They are allowing--despite their final view on the substance of an issue--the full Senate to make a decision on an important issue.  It used to be that a motion to proceed to an issue was routine. It used to be that after a certain period of time, we would cut off the vote so we could have an up-or-down vote, 51, on an important issue.  We have gotten away from that, but Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski have been among the most consistent Senators who would say, absent extraordinary circumstances, ``I am going to vote to allow the vote to come to the floor so the full Senate can make its decision,'' and I thank them for that.

13933,topic-id,981,"Mr.President, I notice my distinguished friend was indignant over the Supreme Court debate. I think each of us has a right to have his own opinion. Here is mine.  There is such a thing called the Thurmond-Leahy rule. It has been in place for a while. I think it reads that after June of a Presidential election year, the Senate will not confirm a[[Page S2090]]President's nominees. That is a bipartisan rule that has been enforced by the Senate for several years. Senator McConnell moved it up three months, from June to March--that is true--even though Democratic leaders said that is exactly what they would have done if the shoe had been on the other foot.  Democrats are saying that as a result of that--the 3-month change--which is what they said they would have done anyway, they are going to do something that has never been done before: They are going to deny a Supreme Court Justice a nomination by not allowing a majority vote. That has never happened in 230 years. Our nominations have always been decided by a majority vote. There was a little incident in 1968 with Abe Fortas when President Johnson sought to elevate him to Chief Justice, but that has been the tradition in the We have always approved Presidential nominees by a majority vote, and we have always approved Cabinet members by a majority vote, even controversial ones. We have never required them to get 60 votes--ever--and the same with Federal district judges. And the same was true with Federal circuit judges until the Democrats started using the filibuster to require 60 votes, as has been well documented here. So I think people need to know the facts.  What the Democrats are proposing to do next week--quite apart from the fact that Judge Gorsuch is one of the most eminently qualified people we have seen come around in a long time--flies in the face of 230 years of tradition in the Senate by insisting that a Presidential nominee to the Supreme Court requires more than 51 votes to be confirmed.  I looked very quickly back at my own votes. None of us are perfect, and I am not asking for any merit badges, but I wonder where the Democrats are who are trying to do at least what I was trying to do when President Obama was there. I found at least 10 times that I voted for cloture--voted to cut off debate--on controversial nominees with whom I disagreed, and then I voted against them when the vote was 51.  With Secretary of Labor Perez, cloture was invoked 60 to 40. If I had voted no, that would have denied him his Cabinet position. He is now the chairman of the Democratic National I cannot think of any Cabinet member I disagreed more with, other than perhaps the one I am about to mention next, but I thought the President deserved to have his own nominee, and I thought we ought to respect the tradition of never having denied a Cabinet member a position because of a 60-vote requirement.  Another one was John King, the Education I asked President Obama to appoint him or somebody of his choosing. I thought we needed an Education Secretary for a year even though I have great differences with John I respect him greatly, but I have differences with him.  So I got him confirmed as chairman--I don't want to say it that way. I asked the President to do it, as chairman of the committee. I saw that he had a prompt confirmation, and then I made sure he had enough votes to be confirmed--not by much. When it came to cloture, I may have even voted for him when it came to it, just because I thought the President deserved to have his own appointment.  Then there was Attorney General Cloture was invoked with only 66 votes. I voted to end debate and have a vote on her.  Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel--there was opposition to him. I voted no there on confirmation, but I voted to make sure that there was a vote. I voted for cloture.  For two National Labor Relations Board members and a National Labor Relations Board General Counsel, cloture was invoked by 64, 65, and 62 votes--very close. I voted against all three of them for confirmation, just as I did Secretary Perez, because I disagreed with them so much. But I thought that we ought to respect the fact that we confirm Presidential appointees by 51 votes.  There are three or four others, but I want to mention only one more specifically: District Court Judge John McConnell, Jr., from Rhode There was an effort on this side of the aisle to deny him a cloture vote. I resisted that. I talked to some other I voted for him for cloture. He got it 63 to 33. Then I voted against him for judge.  The importance of that was if he had had his nomination blocked by the cloture vote, he would have been the first Federal istrict judge in the history of the court to not have been allowed to have an up-or-down vote, majority vote. So I resisted that in that instance. I resisted that for I may have been the deciding vote; there were only 60 votes.  While I said I am not looking for merit badges, where are the Democrats who are willing to vote like that--to preserve the Senate's 230-year tradition of approving Presidential nominees by a majority vote? I think this is a terrible precedent, not justified, and I am sorry to see things heading in this direction.  Now I wish to make some remarks on another matter.

13745,topic-id,1286,"Mr.President, it was 7 years ago that Democrats in Congress passed They promised lower healthcare costs. What they delivered was a Washington mandate[[Page S1862]]for expensive insurance that many people found actually wasn't insurance they could use, even though they were forced to buy it. For 7 years, Americans have suffered under the consequences of that decision by this body and by the former  Less than 7 weeks into the Trump administration, Republicans introduced a plan to give Americans real healthcare reform. The American people know that ObamaCare has been a disaster, one broken promise after another. I hear about this every weekend when I am home in I heard about it this past weekend. There is now only one insurance company that is willing to offer ObamaCare coverage in my entire There are 1,000 counties all across the country in the same situation--only one option. This is not a marketplace; it is a monopoly.  As a doctor who has practiced medicine for 25 years, I can tell you that when it comes to healthcare, the last thing patients want to hear is that they don't have a choice: It is this or nothing. That is why Republicans promised we were going to repeal the restrictions in ObamaCare that limit people's choices. We promised to give people options, not mandates. The healthcare bill we are debating now is the first step to keeping that promise.  The bill starts to give people more choices so they can pick what is right for them and for their families. I want to talk about three ways that it does this.  First, the bill removes the mandates. It ends both the individual and the employer mandates. It eliminates the penalties that hard-working families have to pay if they decide that overpriced ObamaCare insurance isn't right for them. This was one of the most outrageous and unfair parts of the healthcare law. These mandates will be gone.  Second, the bill that the House is considering cuts taxes. It gets rid of the ObamaCare tax on prescription drugs. It gets rid of the ObamaCare tax on health insurance. It gets rid of the taxes on artificial appliances, such as pacemakers and artificial joints. Overall, the bill eliminates 15 different taxes. These taxes are obviously passed on to consumers; repealing them helps to bring down the cost of care.  Third, the repeal bill creates options for people and for It encourages people to find creative ways to help make healthcare costs more affordable for them. It expands how people can use health savings accounts, which is a great option for many people. It helps States do innovative things, such as create high risk pools to bring down costs for everybody. It gives States more flexibility when it comes to Medicaid  Let's face it: Medicaid is broken, and ObamaCare just threw more people onto this second-class health insurance. Just last week, we got evidence of how badly Medicaid is harming patients. The chief executive at the Mayo Clinic said in his speech that his hospital is going to give precedence to people with private insurance over people on The supporters of ObamaCare said that their biggest success is the number of people who got coverage by being put into Well, it is clear that many of these people are being harmed by being in Medicaid, a system that has been broken for decades. It is alarming and it is also appalling.  We have to fundamentally reform the Medicaid To do that, we have to give States more options for coming up with the reforms that work for them and for the people who live in those Every State is different, and a one-size-fits-all mandate from Washington will never work for all of the States all across the country. Democrats tried it, and it failed dramatically.  ObamaCare is collapsing all around us. We have to do something, and we have to start now. In the next couple of months, insurance companies are going to start making decisions about what they are going to do for next year, 2018. They will be figuring out how much they want to charge and whether they want to be involved in the ObamaCare exchanges at all. People have been losing their coverage and losing choices ever since the Democrats wrote the healthcare law and the President signed it 7 years ago. I believe it is going to get worse every day that we delay.  There are Democrats who don't really seem to care much about any of that. They would rather set the whole healthcare system on a path to fall apart completely before they will ever admit that they were wrong. Hard-working Americans and families across the country don't have that luxury. There are still 25 million Americans without insurance even 7 years after ObamaCare has been in place. Every year, people have gotten letters in the mail telling them that their plans have been canceled. That is the reality of Democrats want to pretend that everything is fine, but that is absolutely not true.  That is why it is so important that President Trump jumped in right away to take important steps to help stabilize the marketplace. He recognized what Democrats won't admit--that these ObamaCare markets are falling apart. So the President has already started doing what he can to stabilize the markets, to make sure people keep their options for health coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services has taken steps to preserve programs that ObamaCare tried to eliminate. These are plans that people already had and they liked and the law tried to say they could no longer exist. The Trump administration has said people can continue on those plans. The administration also tightened up some of the rules to make sure people actually pay the premiums for this year's insurance before they are allowed to sign up for next year. The administration is taking commonsense steps that will make it harder for people to game the system and that will lower the cost for everyone else. These are important steps. The administration is going to be doing a lot more to protect families and to create more options.  This repeal bill isn't perfect; nobody says it is. Still, it is a monumental shift away from The American people will be better off with this repeal plan. They will be better off with the additional reforms that we will continue to push after this bill.  I hope that Democrats will join us and offer their own ideas about what these additional reforms will look like. I hope they realize that families are better off when they have more choices, not fewer. We are better off when people can decide what is better for them and their families, not when government tells them what to do. We are better off when healthcare decisions are left to patients and doctors, not to Washington bureaucrats and insurance companies. We are better off when people have freedom and options, not mandates and penalties.  America needs healthcare reform. What we had before ObamaCare wasn't working; I saw that as a doctor. What we have now isn't working, either. It is time for everyone to admit that and to take this opportunity to start repairing the damage, start creating real reform. As Ronald Reagan said: It is better to get 80 percent of what you want rather than go over the cliff with a flag flying. The American people are asking for our help, and we cannot turn our backs on them now.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

13921,topic-id,867,"Mr.President, I would like to add my voice to that of the Senator from I thank him for his leadership and for his excellent work on the matters that he has been addressing.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I am here to address the issue, as I have done before and will again, of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice of the U.Supreme America needs judges who can follow the law, who have the highest ethical standards, and who value the independence of our courts. That is the description of Neil That is him in a nutshell. We saw it throughout his career, and we saw it again in his confirmation hearing last week.  Democrats on the committee asked him to talk about issues that are going to be coming up before the Supreme Well, Judge Gorsuch--we know what he did. He followed the rules, the ethics rules. These are the rules that say that judges and nominees should not answer those kinds of questions.  Following the rules is exactly what he should have done, and it is exactly what other nominees that both Republican and Democratic Presidents have placed on the Court have done in the past.  It is what Ruth Bader Ginsburg did at her confirmation hearing in 1993. She said that a ``judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints.'' She said that this would ``display disdain for the entire judicial process.'' She was confirmed.  That is exactly what Judge Gorsuch said. That is the Ginsburg standard, and every nominee since then has followed that standard.  Democrats on the Judiciary Committee also tried last week to criticize Judge Gorsuch for some of his opinions that they didn't like. They suggested that the Court should have ignored the law--ignored the law and sided with ``the little guy'' in these cases.  Judge Gorsuch was quick to point out that all judges are absolutely not supposed to consider who they think is sympathetic. They are to rule based on the law.  Federal judges actually swear an oath to ``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''  It is interesting because the minority leader, Senator Schumer, himself has spoken about how important it is for a judge to be impartial. In 2009, at the confirmation hearing for Justice Sonia Sotomayor, he praised the way that she put the ``rule of law above everything else.'' He said that she did this even when it led to rulings that ``go against so-called sympathetic litigants.'' That was 2009.  Fast forward to 2017. It is the identical standard that Judge Gorsuch has followed. He pointed out that it is his job to apply the law, and writing the laws is the job of the legislative branch of government.  We are not here selecting the 101st This is not about who ought to be another This is about who should be on the Supreme We are selecting a Justice for the most important Court of the land.[[Page S2082]]  Nearly everyone who has looked at this nominee's record, who has watched his confirmation hearing agrees that he would be an excellent There was one lawyer who wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post on March 8. He is a board member of the liberal American Constitution He wrote that ``there is no principled reason'' to vote against Judge A Denver Post editorial last week said Judge Gorsuch would make ``a marvelous addition to the Supreme Court.'' The American Bar Association has given him its highest possible rating. He was even introduced at his confirmation hearing last week by a former top lawyer for the Obama administration. Neal Katyal is a He was the Acting Solicitor General of the United States for President He has called Judge Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.''  I think any Democrat who watched the confirmation hearings and looked at the nominee's record will decide it is an easy decision to confirm him.  If there is a Democrat who reaches the opposite conclusion, I say: Come to this floor. Come to the floor of the U.Explain why you think our judges should go into a case favoring one side or another. If you think a judge should make promises about how he will rule just to win the vote of a Senator, go ahead. Come to the floor. Make your case. If you think that a Justice of the Supreme Court should ignore the law and rule not based on the law but by that judge's own preferences, please come to the floor and say so. I don't think that is what the American people want.  The American people want judges who are smart, who are principled, who are fair, and who know that their job is to follow the law, not write the law. The American people know that Neil Gorsuch is exactly that kind of judge, and that is the kind of judge who we should have on the Supreme Court and on every court of the land.

13941,topic-id,2087,"Mr.President, I am here on behalf of 55 million working Americans who lack access to retirement savings plans through their employers. These numbers underscore a very, very uncomfortable truth for many Americans--that there is a looming retirement crisis in our  Congress must do more to preserve, protect, and strengthen retirement savings for all I come to the floor to express my strong opposition to the legislation before us, which would do precisely the opposite.  H.67 would tear down ongoing efforts at the State and municipal levels to assist, not obstruct, hard-working Americans in preparing for financially stable and rewarding retirements.  I also want to express my very deep concern about efforts by my Republican colleagues to force a vote on H.66 in the very near future. I would advise my colleagues to reconsider their taking action on both of these misguided proposals right away.  While many private sector employers have the option to set up and their employees have the choice to contribute to their own retirement savings accounts, fewer than 10 percent of workers who are without access to a workplace plan contribute to retirement savings accounts outside of their employers.  To address this growing issue, in August of 2016, under the guidance of the Obama administration, the Department of Labor promulgated what has become known as the State-sponsored auto-IRA rule. This rule provides critical guidance for States on how to administer programs that are designed to improve access to retirement accounts among private sector employees. These State-facilitated retirement programs would allow State governments to provide automatic enrollment in State-sponsored IRA programs, with there being the opportunity to opt out at any time.  There are misguided and progressive proposals that seek to overturn the critical rulemaking that protects Americans in this process. If passed, these resolutions, very simply, will cripple ongoing efforts on the State level to ensure that retirement savings opportunities are more readily available for all workers.  In my home State of Connecticut, we have led efforts to find secure and innovative ways to address the growing retirement savings gap for nearly 600,000 working people in Connecticut who lack access to employer-based retirement savings. The Connecticut Retirement Security Authority has led this effort. It was created in 2016, and it is based on almost 2 years of market research, public hearings, meetings, and broad input from employers, potential participants, and representatives of the financial sector.  We are moving in the right direction in Programs that represent a strong step in the right direction have been fostered and built by encouraging State facilitation with private providers. These plans allow workers access to secure, low-cost retirement savings accounts in That effort would be set back by these proposals to undercut and reverse progress made at the Federal level. Incomprehensibly, these bills would severely undercut efforts to promote State and city auto-IRA programs. It is a blatant attack on these programs and[[Page S2095]]on working families in Connecticut and elsewhere.  I urge my colleagues who believe that Congress should spend time in expanding, not limiting, access to innovative solutions to the American savings crisis to join me in opposing these resolutions.  They have broad economic implications. They set back job creation as well as economic progress. There are 55 million individuals--many of them in Connecticut--who lack the ability to save for retirement directly from their paychecks. This gap is exacerbated by the fact that nearly 20 percent of people between the ages of 55 and 64 have, virtually, zero in retirement savings. That is true of Connecticut and every State in our country.  A lack of retirement savings leads to disastrous results and jeopardizes access to adequate meals, healthcare, and other necessities. Simply put, no American family and, certainly, no Connecticut family should be deterred or discouraged from planning for the future by saving responsibly.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on H.66 and H.67 because States and municipalities should have the flexibility to implement proven strategies to support hard-working Americans who wish to prepare themselves for retirement.                Russia and Trump Campaign Investigation  Mr.President, I find in Connecticut--and, I am sure, my colleagues find around the country--that Americans are outraged and appalled by Russia's disinformation campaign that has been waged against our free and fair electoral process. There is no question now--the intelligence agencies have confirmed it--that Russia interfered in the campaign of this latest election.  Our electoral process is the bedrock of our democracy. Russian interference in our election is an attack on our democracy. Indeed, it is an attack on Some believe--and I join them in this concern--that it is an act of war.  As appalling as the Russians' actions have been, I am equally--if not more--concerned about the ``see no evil, hear no evil'' attitude of this administration. It was aided in its election by Russia's campaign of disinformation, malign theft, its dissemination of private data, propaganda, and cyber attack. That cyber attack was unconscionable and unprecedented in its scope and scale.  Our Nation's intelligence community has provided chilling and absolutely horrifying confirmation of this Russian interference in our democracy. Yet the White House continually dismisses these reports. This week, we are learning that they actually may be actively interfering with and trying to redirect efforts by Congress to discover the full extent of Russia's cyber intrusion.  The bottom line here is that only a special prosecutor at the Department of Justice can apply sunlight and conduct a vigorous, independent investigation. Only a special prosecutor can remove this stain on our democracy. Only a special prosecutor can provide our Nation with assurance that wrongdoing will be effectively investigated and then charged and prosecuted. Only a special prosecutor can give us the closure we need and deserve.  Every day, evidence mounts pointing to the need to investigate these Russian ties and contacts with the Trump campaign. The more we learn, the more troubled and outraged the American people become.  Just this week, revelations have surfaced that Representative Nunes, chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the House, met on White House grounds with a source who showed him secret American intelligence reports that he then used to defend President Trump's claims that his closest associates were under surveillance by the Obama administration. That this information actually came from a meeting at the White House has intensified questions about where the information actually originated and whether the President's team is actually meddling in the congressional investigation. Chairman Nunes's actions have fatally tainted the House Intelligence Committee investigation and infected it with the virus of partisan bias.  Just yesterday, we also learned, based on letters obtained by the Washington Post, that the Trump administration sought to block former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates from testifying to Congress in the House investigation, adding additional taint. We all recall she is the one who blew the whistle on the real risk of General Flynn being blackmailed by the Instead of thanking her, the President fired her. After firing her for doing her job, the administration is now intent on stopping her as a witness from revealing exactly what the President knew about his adviser's ties to foreign interests.  The House investigation is incontrovertibly compromised by having a Trump surrogate running and organizing it and the administration--at least in appearance and likely in reality--controlling its access to the facts.  There is a growing body of evidence that clearly and unmistakably indicates that the Trump campaign and his associates were in contact with Russia during the election, and these deeply troubling claims of coordination with a foreign government to influence an American election deserve exacting and aggressive investigation.  The declassified report from the intelligence community clearly identifies Russia Today as a state-sponsored propaganda source that was integral to Putin's campaign to interfere in that election, and it makes it equally clear, and deplorably so, that former National Security Advisor Flynn accepted $45,000 to praise Russia Today in Moscow and dine with Putin at the network's request.  We know as well that Attorney General Sessions and Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and now senior adviser, had unreported meetings with Russian officials, including the head of a Russian bank under U.sanctions. The President's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, funneled millions of dollars into offshore accounts from a Russian oligarch through the Bank of Cyprus, which was owned at the time by Wilbur Ross, now serving as the President's Commerce  These contacts form a network of facts and suspicion, but more than suspicion, there are real sources of information and facts. As Ronald Reagan said, ``Facts are stubborn things.''  These disclosures are all the more reason--indeed, compelling evidence--that a special prosecutor is necessary to investigate Russia's ties and contacts with the Trump campaign. Immediate, aggressive measures to hold Russia accountable and deter further aggression must be taken. Those actions must be based on facts as well, but we must acknowledge publicly that the need for deterrence requires effective responses, appropriate and necessary measures to send a message and inflict the kind of cost that is necessary to show Russia that we will never accept these kinds of attacks. At stake is not only Russia's view of this country and deterrence to further attacks but also the credibility and trust of the American people in the Department of Justice, and that is where a special prosecutor is absolutely vital.  I support the work of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, and I trust the members of that committee to do their work responsibly. I believe as well that we should have a select committee--or, even better, an independent commission--that will make findings of fact, produce recommendations, have public proceedings, and then, in the interest of full transparency and disclosure, produce a report with recommendations that will help provide a path to avoid these kinds of attacks on our democracy in the future and potential collusion between Americans and those attacks.  I believe that an independent commission would serve a worthwhile purpose, but neither the Intelligence Committee, nor a select committee, nor an independent commission can do what is equally important, which is prosecute wrongdoers. None of these bodies, whether congressional or independent commission, can investigate criminal wrongdoing so as to assure an effective and successful prosecution. That work must be done with the FBI and supervision of an independent, special prosecutor who can investigate vigorously and independently and then take action and bring charges if they are warranted.  I support the investigation of the Intelligence Committee, which should do its work, the appointment of a select committee that can produce findings of fact and a report and recommendation,[[Page S2096]]and an independent commission that can do the same kind of public, transparent, open disclosure. A special prosecutor does not produce a report; they and the team will produce a prosecution, if it is warranted. They are the only ones who can prosecute.  We cannot stand idle while Russia interferes and threatens our political infrastructure, which now includes our electoral system. Neither can we stand idle while our Department of Justice is leaderless or, worse yet, has a prosecutor who also may be tainted by the fact that he reports to the Attorney General or to the The Attorney General has recused himself, with good reason, because he was implicated in allegations surrounding collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian interference.  The allegations of collusion are serious. They must be investigated, and the investigation and potential prosecution must be done by someone who is independent--a special prosecutor. Revelation upon revelation day after day leaves us with no choice. In fact, we had no choice well before now, but the disclosures that have surfaced just within the last hours and days confirm that justice will not be vindicated unless we have a special prosecutor. That is why I have chosen to block the nomination and confirmation of the Deputy Attorney I will consider doing it with other nominees as well. I feel so strongly--and I hope my colleagues do as well--that a special prosecutor is necessary to vindicate justice, to make sure that Americans have trust and confidence in our Department of Justice and in the ability of the United States to protect its democracy and the integrity of its electoral process.

I would like to speak about one other topic that we are dealing with this week. I was here yesterday to talk about Judge I will likely be back again before this debate is over because it is critically important that he be confirmed.  Mr.President, I want to speak for just a minute about what we are also doing this week under the Congressional Review One of the reasons the Court matters is that the Court gets to decide on occasion whether an agency has the legal ability to make a rule, but just because they may have the legal ability to make a rule doesn't mean they should make a rule that stands if the Congress doesn't agree.  The Congressional Review Act, under the late rulemaking of President Obama, has had a real opportunity to work for, I would say, the first time, but the truth is, it has worked one other time in 2001. In the 25-or-so-year history of the Congressional Review Act until the last few days, the last few weeks, it has been utilized only because it is really only practically available to the Senate and to the House if there are midnight rules, rules that come up at the last minute.  As of today, the Senate has already passed 11 resolutions that have disapproved those late rules that came in the final days of President Obama's administration. By the time we finish this process, I think we will be toward a total of maybe 15 rules that would have had a real impact on our economy, that would have had a real impact on job creation, that would have had a real impact on families. Those rules are not going to happen because of the Congressional Review  I have been an opponent of many of these rules and many of the regulations we have seen over the last 8 years, but they have often been able to become law anyway because the Congress, frankly, couldn't do anything about it.                            Title X Program  In particular, I would like to commend Senator Joni Ernst for her work on the resolution of disapproval we expect to consider tomorrow. Senator Ernst's resolution would simply restore the ability of States to set their own criteria for grant recipients under the title X program.  I would like to remind my colleagues that this rule was issued on December 19, 2016. It took effect January 18, 2017, 2 days before the end of President Obama's administration. So for 7 years and 363 days, the Obama administration didn't need this rule, but they issued it on the way out the door.  Overturning this rule would not reduce a single dollar of funding that is available under title Again, all we are doing is simply giving back to the States the flexibility they had until the last 48 hours of the Obama administration to determine which health providers were in the best position to provide the particular set of healthcare services before the rule took effect.  This rule is another example of overreach. This is another example of out-of-control regulators. I certainly am pleased to see Senator Ernst bring it to the floor.  The determination of how the rules should be made and who should make them and who should do something about it is something that this Congress, in the next few weeks, has to take a stronger stand on.  I hope we find a way where we have to vote on every rule that has any significant economic impact. That bill has passed the House of Representatives already.

13925,topic-id,1108,"Mr.President, I take to the floor to urge my colleagues to vote against two of the resolutions that are on the floor, H.66 and H.67--both under the Congressional Review Act--which would not allow two regulations under the Obama administration to go forward that would allow for increased retirement security for American workers and families.  Throughout my time in office, I have fought hard for measures that increase the retirement security for American workers and families. One of the most prominent examples is the private retirement improvements that I championed with my friend Senator Portman when we were both in the House of  More recently, Senator Portman and I have joined together to support other changes to our pension laws that enhance retirement security. For instance, the Cardin-Portman Church[[Page S2084]]Plan Clarification Act, which became law in 2015, clarified the application of certain tax laws and regulations to the unique structures of church pension plans. The Cardin-Portman Retirement Security Preservation Act, which was reported out of the Finance Committee unanimously last September, amends nondiscrimination regulations to protect older workers in pension plans that have been closed or frozen. I hope the bill will be taken up again in this  I mention these efforts over the years with Senator Portman because I think they show two things: First, they show that ensuring all Americans can retire with dignity is an ongoing effort. We need to work continually with workers, retirees, and other stakeholders to make sure retirement security is achievable, especially as our economy changes. Second, they show that this ongoing work has been and hopefully will continue to be strongly bipartisan. That is why I need to speak in opposition to H.66 and H.67. These resolutions are an unnecessary step backward in our ongoing retirement security work.  As my colleagues are aware, H.66 and H.67 eliminate the ERISA safe harbor that was created by the Department of Labor for IRA plans that are administered by State and local governments. We are considering the local government resolution today, but I want to stress the importance of both types of plans.  The provisions of this safe harbor are very similar to an existing safe harbor that is already in ERISA that allows employers to establish payroll deductions to So long as the State- and municipal-run plans meet the requirements of the safe harbor, the businesses--usually small businesses--that offer State-run retirement plans to their workers will not inadvertently be subject to liability under Federal law.  The Department of Labor rules were meant to provide legal certainty to the increasing number of States that have decided, in the absence of any action by the Congress, to address the retirement coverage gap in their communities. Maryland is one of those Our State is active. Last year, Republican Governor Larry Hogan signed legislation creating a Maryland-run automatic IRA program. The legislation was backed by the Democratic leaders in the general assembly. In fact, it passed unanimously out of our  The reason for this bipartisanship was, in part, in recognition of the stakes. At the time the law went into effect, which was last July, an estimated 1 million Marylanders worked for businesses that did not offer retirement savings plans. Without the rule, the businesses that choose to use the Maryland-run option to provide retirement plans for their workers may face legal liability. At the very least, the repeal of the safe harbor will slow the entire implementation process.  I understand that my colleagues who oppose the Department of Labor rule want to be sure that strong ERISA protections apply to retirees; however, under current law, most IRAs do not have ERISA protection. For these IRAs, the only chance for any kind of consumer protection is for States to do it. H.66 and H.67 are seeking to undo that.  I am also confused by claims that the adoption of these resolutions would necessarily lead to the complete ERISA preemption of State programs. The Department of Labor does not take that position. To claim that these resolutions alone would have such a broad effect on the interaction of ERISA with State law is troubling, to say the least.  Let me be clear. I would prefer Federal action in this space. Retirement security is one of a seemingly dwindling number of bipartisan issues we can tackle in Congress, and the concerns raised by many of the stakeholders I have worked with in the past on retirement reform are understandable. I am concerned that a lack of Federal action will lead to a State-level patchwork that will be hard for employers and more mobile workers to navigate. I would much rather build on the efforts of the States to create a uniform Federal system under which employers would adopt high-quality, well-managed plans. I am also concerned that providing a State-run option could diminish robust competition with the private sector.  The point of these State-run programs is to decrease our coverage gap. However, we must not also create a race to the bottom whereby employers opt for a one-size-fits-all minimum and do not consider other plans that may be better tailored to their workforces. This is not, in my view, the case in  The answer to these problems is not H.66 or H.67; it is for Congress to continue its ongoing bipartisan work on retirement security, not to undermine what our States have chosen to do to help our mutual constituents. This is federalism the way federalism is supposed to work. The States adopt policies and hopefully give us some guidance as to how we can develop uniform national policies.  I am, frankly, surprised that my Republican colleagues have chosen to take up these resolutions. It is hard to see what the disapproval of the Department of Labor rules achieves other than notching the repeal of another Obama-era rule, but at what cost?  To me, the resolutions take a fairly clear, anti-States'-rights stance, all to create potential liability for small employers who will take advantage of the new State laws. Essentially, supporting this resolution means sowing unnecessary legal confusion in an area in which States have already acted in a bipartisan way. We can do better. We can work together on this issue. Instead of focusing on haphazard repeal measures, I am confident that we can produce thoughtful, substantive, bipartisan solutions.  I urge my colleagues to oppose these resolutions. As I have in the past, I stand ready to work with them to ensure all Americans can save with dignity for their financially secure retirement.

Back then, the country was in themidst of a deep financial      crisis and recession. The very month Obama took office,      nearly 800,000 Americans lost theirjobs.       Obama believes he hasn't received enough credit for the big      turnaround. ``Anyone claiming that America's economy is      indecline is peddling fiction,'' Obama said earlier this      year.

He's also planning to roll back regulation and spend more on      roads and bridges.     Wall Street hasgiven these plans a big thumbs up. The stock      market rallied to record levels in November after Trump won      the presidency.Business and consumer confidence has also shot      up since the momentous win.                        the big problemfor trump       There's just one catch: The U.economy has less potential      to grow now than in the past,argues economist       Two key factors drive growth: More people entering the      workforce and workers being more productiveon the job.

13939,topic-id,1073,"Mr.President, I rise to express my grave concern about Russian aggression and interference in our political system. My concerns have been compounded over the last several weeks by the response to these allegations by President Trump and his administration.  First, let's step back for a moment. We know that the Russian Federation is an adversary of the United That is without question. Vladimir Putin is what I would like to call a 24-hour bad guy. There are a lot of other ways to express it, but that is one way. There is not a moment of the day when he isn't using his power to undermine our Nation's interests and the interests of freedom and democracy across the globe.  We know that the Russian regime kills journalists, jails and silences their critics, and commits war crimes in places like Syria and Russia meddles in elections throughout the Western world.  Mr.Putin has a warped world view. His view is that the freedom and democratic rights of tens of millions of people in Europe should be subject to the interests of a few in the Kremlin because those countries lie within Russia's supposed sphere of influence.  The work done by our intelligence agencies indicates that Russia meddled in our election with the intent of aiding President We know that now. In January, our intelligence agencies concluded:       We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential      election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in      the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and      harm her electability and potential presidency. We further      assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear      preference for President-elect  That is what our intelligence agencies tell us, and I am quoting verbatim from that basic finding.  President Trump's refusal to accept the assessment of our intelligence agencies was deeply concerning--and that is an understatement. My concerns were compounded by the fact that President Trump ran on the most pro-Russian platform in modern history. Since President Trump has taken[[Page S2093]]office, he has harshly criticized our allies, from Australia to Mexico, yet when it comes to Russia's provocations and war crimes, President Trump is silent.  This deference that President Trump shows to Mr.Putin is troubling and, when combined with Russia's meddling in our election, it raises profound questions that need answers. That is why I strongly support the establishment of an independent commission to investigate Russia's interference in our political system, and I believe that the Justice Department must appoint a special counsel to investigate this matter as well.  What the American people need to know, once and for all, is at least three things: 1, what specific actions Russia took to aid President Trump during the election; 2, whether U.persons had knowledge of or were involved in these actions; and, finally, 3, whether President Trump has financial entanglements with Russians associated with the Putin regime.  You could probably add other questions, but I think they are the three basic questions we have to answer.  So this is a grave problem with substantial national security implications. My constituents agree, as I am sure is the case in every other Just since January 1, more than 80,000 Pennsylvanians have written to my office about That is 80,000 These are thoughtful letters from Pennsylvanians who are so concerned about this issue that they took the time to write.  A constituent from Cumberland County, right in the middle of our State, wrote:       I am bothered by the reports of Russia trying to interfere      with our democracy. I am particularly bothered by a lack of      transparency in the administration with news reports of AG      Sessions' undisclosed contact with Russia is having      the effect they wanted by shaking confidence in our system.  That is a constituent from Cumberland  Another constituent from Northampton County, along the eastern side of our State, just north of Philadelphia, wrote this:       All politics aside, the investigation about Russia's      actions is a concern to our republic. . . . Ultimately, it      does not matter whether our elected officials are democrats      or republicans, but it does matter that we all always put      America's best interests first.  If the warnings from the U.intelligence community and the pleas from 80,000-plus Pennsylvanians aren't enough, then let's look at the numerous credible reports of contact between Russian officials and the Trump team. This body of reporting grows every day.  On January 18, McClatchy reported that ``The FBI and five other law enforcement and intelligence agencies have collaborated for months in an investigation into Russian attempts to influence the November election, including whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided President-elect Donald Trump, two people familiar with the matter said.''  On January 19, the Washington Post reported, ``U.counterintelligence officials are sifting through intercepted communications and financial data as part of a wider look at possible ties between the Russian government and associates of President-elect Donald Trump, officials said.''  Then again on January 19, the New York Times reported, ``American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said.''  We know that Mr.Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, previously worked for the Russian-backed President of Ukraine, Victor According to an August 2016 report by the New York Times, ``Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr.Manafort from Mr.Yanukovych's pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine's newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau.''  In February 2017, when confronted by the New York Times about reports that Trump associates may have been in contact with Russian officials during the election, Mr.Manafort said, ``It's not like these people wear badges that say, `I'm a Russian intelligence officer.' ''  Then there is the case of a former member President Trump's foreign policy advisory committee, Carter In September of 2016, Yahoo's Michael Isikoff reported, ``U.intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials--including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.''

He pours his heart and soul into one of the most important issues and things we can deal with here in Congress and, that is, helping our veterans.  Veterans step up and serve in our military. I stand in awe. They do the heavy lifting. They run through the fire. They engage. Then they come home, and we have got to do a better job of taking care of those people who take care of us.  The Veterans Administration, just like the rest of Federal Government, has a lot of good people who actually work there, do care, and have big hearts. With a government of more than 2 million people, every once in a while you come across some bad apples. They may be a poor performer, or they may just have their heart in a different place, and we have got to deal with these bad apples.  While you have a whole set of people who are actually trying to do the right thing, you are going to run into some people every once in a while who aren't doing the right thing, and you have to be able to dismiss them.  Now, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has jurisdiction on the Federal civilian workforce, and we have worked closely with Chairman Roe of Tennessee to help make this possible.  Through the last couple of years that I have been chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we have heard a number of accounts where Federal employees couldn't be disciplined fast enough. It was obvious what they had done, but they had run into roadblocks in being able to dismiss people.

We heard the Government Accountability Office come and testify before our committee that it can take 6 months to a year to remove a Federal employee for poor performance. You know what?

And when they are hurting our veterans, I take that personally. Everybody should take that personally. Nobody wants to see that happen.  So this bill, H.1259, is a very important bill to accelerate that process. Again, let's remember that most of the people who work there are good, hardworking, patriotic people who care. But when you do have a bad apple and you do need to get rid of that person, we have to have an expedited removal proceeding.  I know this bill does a number of things, but I can tell you, having heard testimony time and time and time again in a variety of Federal agencies, especially the VA, this is a much-needed bill.  We are going to work as a committee to implement reforms like this governmentwide. To put the Veterans Administration first and deal with this first, I think, is the right priority of this  Again, hats off to Chairman Roe of Tennessee and the committee as a whole for addressing this so aggressively and so early in the 115th  I urge passage of H.1259.

I have long maintained that the Affordable Care Act is the Civil Rights Act of the 21st century. Repealing the Affordable Care Act and putting discrimination back into health care is a step history will not forgive.  While the majority has included a new rule limiting the consideration of legislation which increases direct spending in excess of $5 billion, they have specifically exempted from this rule any spending that may flow from repeal of the Affordable Care  They are admitting in their own rules that their proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act will be devastating for the Federal deficit and the national debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that full repeal of the ACA will increase the deficit by $137 billion. The Rules Committee has put before the House a rule that defies all those expectations.  ",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgH7-3.txt,208,VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT OF 2017,2017.0,3.0,March

Today the House will vote to ensure the VA can hold its employees accountable for their actions and make sure that this agency remains committed and connected to its sole mission of serving our Nation's veterans.  Additionally, this bill would provide improved protections for whistleblowers to ensure those brave enough to tell Congress and the American people what is really happening at the VA are protected.  After the wait-time scandal in Phoenix and the over $1 billion cost overrun at the Aurora VA hospital, it is time that we reform the VA's culture of corruption and bureaucratic incompetence.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE                          It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) honoring current national space commitments and      building upon investments in space across successive      Administrations demonstrates clear continuity of purpose by      the United States, in collaboration with its international,      academic, and industry partners, to extend humanity's reach      into deep space, including cis-lunar space, the Moon, the      surface and moons of Mars, and beyond;       (2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in the      United States space program by continuing to develop a      balanced portfolio for space exploration and space science,      including continued development of the Space Launch System,      Orion, Commercial Crew Program, space and planetary science      missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Wide-Field      Infrared Survey Telescope, and Europa mission, and ongoing      operations of the ISS and Commercial Resupply Services      Program;       (3) a national, government-led space program that builds on      current science and exploration programs, advances human      knowledge and capabilities, and opens the frontier beyond      Earth for ourselves, commercial enterprise, and science, and      with our international partners, is of critical importance to      our national destiny and to a future guided by United States      values and freedoms;       (4) continuity of purpose and effective execution of core      NASA programs are essential for efficient use of resources in      pursuit of timely and tangible accomplishments;       (5) NASA could improve its efficiency and effectiveness by      working with industry to streamline existing programs and      requirements, procurement practices, institutional footprint,      and bureaucracy while preserving effective program oversight,      accountability, and safety;       (6) it is imperative that the United States maintain and      enhance its leadership in space exploration and space      science, and continue to expand freedom and economic      opportunities in space for all Americans that are consistent      with the Constitution of the United States; and       (7) NASA should be a multi-mission space agency, and should      have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space      science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight      and exploration, and education.     202.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Returns on the Nation's investments in science,      technology, and exploration accrue over decades-long      timeframes, and a disruption of such investments could      prevent returns from being fully realized.       (2) Past challenges to the continuity of such investments,      particularly threats regarding the cancellation of authorized      programs with bipartisan and bicameral support, have      disrupted completion of major space systems thereby--       (A) impeding planning and pursuit of national objectives in      space science and human space exploration;       (B) placing such investments in space science and space      exploration at risk; and       (C) degrading the aerospace industrial base.       (3) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155; 119      2895), National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422; 122      4779), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18301 et seq.) reflect a      broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA's      core missions in science, space technology, aeronautics,      human space flight and exploration, and education, that      serves as the foundation for the policy updates by this       (4) Sufficient investment and maximum utilization of the      ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and      industry partners is--       (A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the United      States space program; and       (B) imperative to continuing United States global      leadership in human space exploration, science, research,      technology development, and education opportunities that      contribute to development of the next generation of American      scientists, engineers, and leaders, and to creating the      opportunity for economic development of low-Earth orbit.       (5) NASA has made measurable progress in the development      and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration      systems with the near-term objectives of the initial      integrated test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in      2021, and continued missions with an annual cadence in cis-     lunar space and eventually to the surface of       (6) The Commercial Crew Program has made measurable      progress toward reestablishing the capability to launch      United States government astronauts from United States soil      into low-Earth orbit by the end of 2018.       (7) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual      Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the      potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could      accompany significant changes to core NASA programs.    TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT     301. OPERATION OF THE       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in low-     Earth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and      operate safely;       (2) the ISS is a unique testbed for future space      exploration systems development, including long-duration      space travel;       (3) the expansion of partnerships, scientific research, and      commercial applications of the ISS is essential to ensuring      the greatest return on investments made by the United States      and its international space partners in the development,      assembly, and operations of that unique facility;       (4) utilization of the ISS will sustain United States      leadership and progress in human space exploration by--       (A) facilitating the commercialization and economic      development of low-Earth orbit;       (B) serving as a testbed for technologies and a platform      for scientific research and development; and       (C) serving as an orbital facility enabling research upon--       (i) the health, well-being, and performance of humans in      space; and       (ii) the development of in-space systems enabling human      space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and       (5) the ISS provides a platform for fundamental,      microgravity, discovery-based space life and physical      sciences research that is critical for enabling space      exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways      for commercial space development that depend on advances in      basic research, and contributes to advancing science,      technology, engineering, and mathematics research.       (b) Objectives.--The primary objectives of the ISS program      shall be--       (1) to achieve the long term goal and objectives under      section 202 of the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18312);      and       (2) to pursue a research program that advances knowledge      and provides other benefits to the       (c) Continuation of the ISS.--Section 501 of the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of      2010 (42 U.S.18351) is amended to read as follows:     ``501. CONTINUATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE       ``(a) Policy of the United States.--It shall be the policy      of the United States, in consultation with its international      partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete      utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.       ``(b) NASA Action.--In furtherance of the policy set forth      in subsection (a), NASA shall--       ``(1) pursue international, commercial, and      intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply,      maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to      ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize United      States operations costs relating to the ISS;       ``(2) utilize, to the extent practicable, the ISS for the      development of capabilities and technologies needed for the      future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and       ``(3) utilize, if practical and cost effective, the ISS for      Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.''.     302. TRANSPORTATION TO       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that reliance on foreign      carriers for United States crew transfer is unacceptable, and      the Nation's human space flight program must acquire the      capability to launch United States government astronauts on      vehicles using United States rockets from United States soil      as soon as is safe, reliable, and affordable to do so.       (b) Sense of Congress on Commercial Crew Program and      Commercial Resupply Services Program.--It is the sense of      Congress that--       (1) once developed and certified to meet the      Administration's safety and reliability requirements, United      States commercially provided crew transportation systems can      serve as the primary means of transporting United States      government astronauts and international partner astronauts to      and from the ISS and serving as ISS crew rescue vehicles;       (2) previous budgetary assumptions used by the      Administration in its planning for the Commercial Crew      Program assumed significantly higher funding levels than were      authorized and appropriated by Congress;[[Page S1402]]       (3) credibility in the Administration's budgetary estimates      for the Commercial Crew Program can be enhanced by an      independently developed cost estimate;       (4) such credibility in budgetary estimates is an important      factor in understanding program risk;       (5) United States access to low-Earth orbit is paramount to      the continued success of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory;       (6) a stable and successful Commercial Resupply Services      Program and Commercial Crew Program are critical to ensuring      timely provisioning of the ISS and to reestablishing the      capability to launch United States government astronauts from      United States soil into orbit, ending reliance upon Russian      transport of United States government astronauts to the ISS      which has not been possible since the retirement of the Space      Shuttle program in 2011;       (7) NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial      Orbital Transportation Services Program and Commercial      Resupply Services Program that have allowed private sector      companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and      scientific experiments to the ISS since 2012;       (8) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has enabled      significant modernization and infrastructure improvements at      launch sites across the United States to support NASA's      Commercial Resupply Services Program and other civil and      commercial space flight missions; and       (9) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be      continued in a manner that leverages State and private      investments to achieve the goals of that program.       (c) Reaffirmation.--Congress reaffirms--       (1) its commitment to the use of a commercially developed,      private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew      missions as expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155;      119 2895), the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422;      122 4779), and the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18301 et      seq.); and       (2) the requirement under section 50111(b)(1)(A) of title      51, United States Code, that the Administration shall make      use of United States commercially provided ISS crew transfer      and crew rescue services to the maximum extent practicable.

(2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders      from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy      communities.       (3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human      Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational      rationales for human space flight together constitute a      compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit      of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of       (4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the      rationales include economic benefits, national security,      national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens,      scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared      destiny.       (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars      is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight      program.       (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that      NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission      planning and technology development as needed to achieve the      long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of       (7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and      advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early      planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on      the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve      short-term and long-term goals and objectives.[[Page S1406]]       (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph      (1), there are several independently developed reports or      concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or      concepts and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human      space exploration, including NASA's ``The Global Exploration      Roadmap'' of 2013, ``NASA's Journey to Mars-Pioneering Next      Steps in Space Exploration'' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion      Laboratory's ``Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to      Mars'' of 2015, and Explore Mars' ``The Humans to Mars Report      2016''.     432.

(3) During the Key Decision Point-B review, NASA estimated      that costs have grown to $1,400,000,000 excluding launch and      operations for a launch in December 2021 and the agency must      evaluate whether to accept the[[Page S1407]]     increase or reduce the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission's      scope to stay within the cost cap set by the       (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council--       (A) issued a finding that--       (i) high-performance solar electric propulsion will likely      be an important part of an architecture to send humans to      Mars; and       (ii) maneuvering a large test mass is not necessary to      provide a valid in-space test of a new solar electric      propulsion stage;       (B) determined that a solar electric propulsion mission      will contribute more directly to the goal of sending humans      to Mars if the mission is focused entirely on development and      validation of the solar electric propulsion stage; and       (C) determined that other possible motivations for      acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid science      and planetary defense, do not have value commensurate with      their probable cost.       (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is competing for      resources with other critical exploration development      programs, including the Space Launch System, Orion,      commercial crew, and a habitation module.       (6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that      NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment of      the Asteroid Robotic Redirect       (7) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that      NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program      needed to be descoped:       (A) Development of high power solar electric propulsion.       (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity environment in      deep space.       (8) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA Advisory      Council expressed its concern to NASA about the potential for      growing costs for the program and highlighted that choices      would need to be made about the program's content.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid      Robotic Redirect Mission have not been demonstrated to      Congress to be commensurate with the cost; and       (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost effective      and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate the      technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would      otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect            (c) Evaluation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after      the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--       (1) conduct an evaluation of--       (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic Redirect      Mission for demonstrating the technologies and capabilities      needed for a human mission to Mars that would otherwise be      demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission;       (B) the scientific and technical benefits of the      alternative approaches under subparagraph (A) to future human      space exploration compared to scientific and technical      benefits of the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission;       (C) the commercial benefits of the alternative approaches      identified in subparagraph (A), including the impact on the      development of domestic solar electric propulsion technology      to bolster United States competitiveness in the global      marketplace; and       (D) a comparison of the estimated costs of the alternative      approaches identified in subparagraph (A); and       (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a      report on the evaluation under paragraph (1), including any      recommendations.     435. MARS 2033       (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall contract with      an independent, non-governmental systems engineering and      technical assistance organization to study a Mars human space      flight mission to be launched in 2033.       (b) Contents.--The study shall include--       (1) a technical development, test, fielding, and operations      plan using the Space Launch System, Orion, and other systems      to successfully launch such a Mars human space flight mission      by 2033;       (2) an annual budget profile, including cost estimates, for      the technical development, test, fielding, and operations      plan to carry out a Mars human space flight mission by 2033;      and       (3) a comparison of the annual budget profile to the 5-year      budget profile contained in the President's budget request      for fiscal year 2017 under section 1105 of title 31, United      States       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the      appropriate committees of Congress a report on the study,      including findings and recommendations regarding the Mars      2033 human space flight mission described in subsection (a).       (d) Assessment.--Not later than 60 days after the date the      report is submitted under subsection (c), the Administrator      shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress an      assessment by the NASA Advisory Council of whether the      proposal for a Mars human space flight mission to be launched      in 2033 is in the strategic interests of the United States in      space exploration.                    Subtitle D--TREAT Astronauts Act     441. SHORT       This subtitle may be cited as the ``To Research, Evaluate,      Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act'' or the ``TREAT Astronauts      Act''.     442. FINDINGS; SENSE OF       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges      and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed      the lives of 24 NASA astronauts serving in the line of duty.       (2) As United States government astronauts participate in      long-duration and exploration space flight missions they may      experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment,      bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance      risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation.      Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can      result in acute and long-term health consequences that can      increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have      potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central      nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and      vision.       (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration      space flight missions, United States government astronaut      Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space      while his identical twin brother, former United States      government astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control      specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the      physical, behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction      of the human body to an extended period of time in space.       (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical      monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States      government astronauts during their active employment, given      the unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration      space exploration, the Administration has requested statutory      authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring,      diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government      astronauts for psychological and medical conditions      associated with human space flight.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown      and lead the world in space exploration and scientific      discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration      and exploration space flight in deep space and an eventual      mission to Mars;       (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become      increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many      diseases humans face on Earth;       (3) the Administration should provide the type of      monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection      (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique      to the training or exposure to the space flight environment      of United States government astronauts and should not require      any former United States Government astronauts to participate      in the Administration's monitoring;       (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not      replace a former United States government astronaut's private      health insurance;       (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis,      and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the      requirements for new space flight medical hardware, and      develop controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in      the astronaut corps; and       (6) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the      ISS--       (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States for      humans to explore deep space and Mars as the mission      generated new insight into how the human body adjusts to      weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of long-     duration space flight; and       (B) will help support the physical and mental well-being of      astronauts during longer space exploration missions in the      future.     443.

ORBITAL       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) orbital debris poses serious risks to the operational      space capabilities of the United States;       (2) an international commitment and integrated strategic      plan are needed to mitigate the growth of orbital debris      wherever possible; and       (3) the delay in the Office of Science and Technology      Policy's submission of a report on the status of      international coordination and development of orbital debris      mitigation strategies is inconsistent with such risks.       (b) Reports.--       (1) Coordination.--Not later than 90 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the      appropriate committees of Congress a report on the status of      efforts to coordinate with foreign countries within the      Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee to mitigate      the effects and growth of orbital debris under section      1202(b)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.     18441(b)(1)).

REVIEW OF ORBITAL DEBRIS REMOVAL       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) orbital debris in low-Earth orbit poses significant      risks to spacecraft;       (2) such orbital debris may increase due to collisions      between existing debris objects; and       (3) understanding options to address and remove orbital      debris is important for ensuring safe and effective      spacecraft operations in low-Earth orbit.       (b) Review.--       (1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator--       (A) in collaboration with the heads of other relevant      Federal agencies, shall solicit and review concepts and      options for removing orbital debris from low-Earth orbit; and       (B) shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress      a report on the solicitation and review under subparagraph      (A), including recommendations on the best options for      decreasing the risks associated with orbital debris.       (2) Requirements.--The solicitation and review under      paragraph (1) shall address the requirements for and      feasibility of developing and implementing each of the      options.     841.

(b) Funded Space Act Agreements.--To the extent      appropriate, the Administrator shall seek to maximize the      value of contributions provided by other parties under a      funded Space Act Agreement in order to advance NASA's      mission.       (c) Non-exclusivity.--       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall, to the greatest      extent practicable, issue each Space Act Agreement--       (A) except as provided in paragraph (2), on a nonexclusive      basis;       (B) in a manner that ensures all non-government parties      have equal access to NASA resources; and       (C) exercising reasonable care not to reveal unique or      proprietary information.       (2) Exclusivity.--If the Administrator determines an      exclusive arrangement is necessary, the Administrator shall,      to the greatest extent practicable, issue the Space Act      Agreement--       (A) utilizing a competitive selection process when      exclusive arrangements are necessary; and       (B) pursuant to public announcements when exclusive      arrangements are necessary.       (d) Transparency.--The Administrator shall publicly      disclose on the Administration's website and make available      in a searchable format each Space Act Agreement, including an      estimate of committed NASA resources and the expected      benefits to agency objectives for each agreement, with      appropriate redactions for proprietary, sensitive, or      classified information, not later than 60 days after such      agreement is signed by the parties.       (e) Annual Reports.--       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the end of      each fiscal year, the Administrator shall submit to the      appropriate committees of Congress a report on the use of      Space Act Agreement authority by the Administration during      the previous fiscal year.       (2) Contents.--The report shall include for each Space Act      Agreement in effect at the time of the report--       (A) an indication of whether the agreement is a      reimbursable, non-reimbursable, or funded Space Act      Agreement;       (B) a description of--       (i) the subject and terms;       (ii) the parties;       (iii) the responsible--       (I) Mission Directorate;       (II) Center; or       (III) headquarters element;       (iv) the value;       (v) the extent of the cost sharing among Federal Government      and non-Federal sources;       (vi) the time period or schedule; and       (vii) all milestones; and       (C) an indication of whether the agreement was renewed      during the previous fiscal year.

13784,topic-id,1821,"Madam President, finally, on Monday, the Senate moved forward with the nomination of Rex Tillerson to be the next Secretary of His confirmation before this Chamber to serve as our top diplomat should have been a no-brainer, but we know that our Democratic colleagues are still trying to relitigate the election of November 8, and because their preferred candidate lost, they are now trying to do everything they can to slow-walk and to hamper the ability of the winner, President Trump, to get his Cabinet up and running to govern the country. While they think they may be hurting the President and his administration, what they are really doing is hurting the American people whom the government serves. I hope they will reconsider.  It is really sad it has taken this long due to the foot-dragging of our colleagues across the aisle who are sort of in a resistance mode. I really do believe it is like the stages of grief, like the Kubler-Ross stages, where the first one, of course, is denial, the second is anger, and then ultimately you get to acceptance. But they are a long way to acceptance, and they are still in the anger phase of their grieving the outcome of the November 8 election.  When the shoe was on the other foot, we confirmed seven of President Obama's Cabinet nominees on the day he was inaugurated--January 20, 2009--but apparently this is the new normal.  I just hope our Democratic colleagues realize that this is not serving the public interest, and it is not, frankly, good politics, it strikes me, to be so angry and throw a temper tantrum--or, as I said yesterday to some folks, growing up, people used to talk about throwing a hissy fit, and this really strikes me as throwing a hissy fit.  Much has been made of Rex Tillerson's incredible leadership role in a major corporation. Obviously, he has done a tremendous job for one of the largest businesses in the world. He was working for the shareholders of that corporation in that capacity. Now his enormous experience and aptitude and talent are going to be put to work for the American Nation and for the American people.  I believe that not only is he a person of conviction and competence, he is also a man of character. He believes in putting this country first, and I have no doubt he will serve the United States with great integrity and care.  It is none too early for us to transition to somebody of his great qualifications and experience. Our country is no longer respected by many of our friends around the world because we have withdrawn from international leadership. We are no longer feared by our adversaries, who are all too quick to fill the leadership vacuum around the world--Russia being perhaps the most obvious example not only in Crimea and in Ukraine but obviously in Syria and now in It is dangerous. It is destabilizing. So I am very pleased that we will have a new Secretary of State and a new national security leadership team.  If there is one thing that I think President Trump has done right, it is select good people, from Mike Pence as the Vice President, Jim Mattis as Secretary of Defense, Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, and John Kelly of the Department of Homeland[[Page S545]]I think he has chosen very well. I could go on and on with his Cabinet members and say the same thing about each one of them.  We will vote on the confirmation of Mr.Tillerson shortly, between 2 and 2:30 p.m. or in that time frame.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Madam President, what I want to talk about as well is the announcement that President Trump made last night about his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left open by the tragic death of Justice Antonin I couldn't be more pleased with his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth I can't imagine that the President could have chosen a more qualified, more principled, or more mainstream pick for the job of Justice of the U.Supreme  We have all heard some of the details of his personal background, including that he is a Colorado native and that he served in the Denver-based Tenth Circuit Court for a decade, and he is well known and respected in legal circles for his intellect, his brilliant writing, and his faithful interpretation of the Constitution and laws passed by In short, he is a tremendous jurist with an impeccable legal and academic record. He went to schools like Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and Oxford as a Marshall scholar.  In addition to his decade on the bench, his professional experience includes many years practicing law. As a recovering lawyer myself and recovering judge, I can say that one of the things I think the Supreme Court needs is more people with practical experience, serving as lawyers for clients in court. We have some people with great academic credentials but very few people with any practical experience as practicing lawyers. It is important because once they get on the U.Supreme Court, Justices are totally isolated from the rest of the world by the nature of their job. So people need to come to that job with the experience of working with individuals, understanding the strengths and the weaknesses of the legal system and what their role should be.  He not only practiced law at a top law firm as a partner, he had prestigious clerkships, including on the Supreme Court of the United He actually clerked for two Supreme Court Justices--Justice Byron White and Justice Anthony Kennedy--as well as served in the Department of  There is absolutely no question that Judge Gorsuch is a qualified, high-caliber nominee, and I have no doubt that he will serve the Nation well. The reason I say he is a qualified, high-caliber nominee is because when he was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, he was confirmed by the Senate on a voice vote. In other words, he was essentially voted for unanimously, including by people like Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, who was here at the time, and others of our colleagues across the aisle. So I think it is going to be very important for the American people, as they hear the inevitable criticism of this nomination, to remember the Senators who were here at the time Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit, and they expressed none of those concerns or reservations then.  I think, most importantly, Judge Gorsuch will honor the legacy of Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.Supreme Court, but even more importantly, he will honor the U.Constitution and the unique role of our judiciary and our system of government. I think one of the things Justice Scalia made a point of during his professional lifetime was to point out how judges had unfortunately become policymakers rather than interpreters and appliers of the Constitution and the written law. Of course, the problem with that is that judges in the Federal system don't stand for election, so we have lifetime-tenured, unelected Federal judges becoming, in effect, a trump card or super-legislature for our system of government. That certainly isn't what James Madison and the Founding Fathers contemplated. Justice Scalia was a tribute to that traditional role of interpreter of a written Constitution and written laws and respecting the limited, albeit important, role judges play in our system of government.  Put another way, Judge Gorsuch meets every test, and he passes all of them with flying colors.  We have heard from the Democratic leader that President Trump needed to appoint a mainstream nominee. Well, there is no doubt that if that is the litmus test for our friends on the other side of the aisle, Judge Gorsuch meets that test. He has the respect of even people who served on the other side of him in litigation and people whose ideological views differ quite a bit.  Here is what a former Solicitor General under President Obama had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant      judges to have served our nation over the last century. As a      judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve      the rule of law.  He goes on to say:       I strongly support his nomination to the Supreme  This is the sort of respect Judge Gorsuch, in his tenure as a judge, has generated. He has gained respect even from people who are on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum because they realize that Judge Gorsuch will be, first and foremost, somebody who applies the written Constitution and enforces the rule of law--laws passed by the political branches of government--and does not attempt to supplant his own personal agenda for that of the chosen representatives of the American people. As I said, that is why 11 years ago Democrats joined with Republicans to confirm him unanimously to the Tenth I mentioned Senator Schumer, who was here at the time, as well as Senator Durbin and several members of the Judiciary Committee still serving in the Senate, including the ranking member, Senator Feinstein from California, and the senior Senator from Vermont, Senator All of them were here at the time. Because of the voice vote, they didn't note any dissent or disagreement, so we would say that essentially is a unanimous vote of the U.So it will be interesting to hear from them about any reservations or concerns they now voice. I hope that at least they will allow us to have an up-or-down vote on the nomination of this outstanding nominee.  To hear Judge Gorsuch last night and to look at his biography, to read his extensive record and appreciate his scholarship and his commitment to the rule of law--all of this is to see precisely the kind of person who should be confirmed to the Supreme I believe the American people will see that as clear as day.  I hope our colleagues across the aisle will resist the temptation to obstruct and drag their feet when it comes to this important nomination. I hope they will not kowtow to some of the extreme factions in their own party.  They have repeatedly argued for the importance of having nine Justices on the Supreme Now that the American people have spoken by electing President Trump, and he has now announced his pick, they should honor that selection. That pick is superb, the kind of nominee who was supported unanimously by Democrats in the past and is endorsed by President Obama's own Solicitor  Let's move forward with an undeniably qualified nominee.

13898,topic-id,3640,"Mr.President, let me just say while the Senator is on the floor that I express my admiration once again for the distinguished Senator from Utah, who is my good friend and in many ways is a mentor as the chairman of the Senate Finance I am privileged to be a member of that committee and to work with him and, of course, on the Judiciary Committee as well. I thank the Senator in particular for his leadership on this resolution of disapproval, and I support his position 100 percent.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  As we all know now, Mr.President, this Chamber will consider the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to serve as the next Justice on the U.Supreme  Yesterday I spoke a little bit about his qualifications, his background, and his temperament. During the 20 hours of hearings we held before the Judiciary Committee, I think people saw the real Neil Gorsuch--somebody who, again, by virtue of his qualifications, his education, his training, and his experience is supremely qualified to serve on the Supreme He did pass every single test with flying colors, even as my colleagues and some activist groups have done their best to find ways to object to what may be one of the most qualified candidates for the Court in our Nation's history.  One argument we have heard from the opponents of the nominee in 3 days of grueling hearings was that he failed to convey his approach to judging--how he would approach the job. I would like to point out that that is simply not the case. Judge Gorsuch made clear that the text of the statute, the text of the Constitution, and the text of a precedent would guide his judging and would be the place where he starts in deciding any case. As he has repeatedly written and stated publicly, the job of a good judge is to understand what the law means and to interpret what lawmakers have done.  I know some of our colleagues and some of the activist groups who are critical of Judge Gorsuch are upset that he doesn't believe in a living Constitution--in other words, that the Constitution, as written and ratified by the States, does not mean what it says, and that judges have a license to interpret the words in a way to pursue some other purpose, some other agenda, political or personal or the like.  Judge Gorsuch rejects that approach, and rightly so. Indeed, how can a judge claim to bear allegiance to the Constitution if he doesn't actually start in interpreting the Constitution by reading the text of the words? What would a judge decide on if not the text and the original meaning?  To that effect, I received a letter from a friend of mine and an expert in this area, Bryan Garner, last week. Bryan is a well-known lawyer and writer and, among many impressive accomplishments, he is a distinguished research professor of law at Southern[[Page S2060]]Methodist University in Dallas, Bryan has written extensively on judging, appellate advocacy, and the law generally. He was in attendance at the hearings last week. As I said, he has written a number of books, including with Judge Gorsuch, on judicial precedent, and with Justice Scalia, on reading laws.  In a recent letter, Bryan echoed the same point made by both of these men at different times--that adherence to the text is essential to our system of government. He said: ``The very fact of having a written constitution meant that we had fixed its meaning in permanent form.''  Now, that seems so obvious, but, apparently, it is not obvious to some of the critics. He said: ``The very fact of having a written constitution meant that we had fixed its meaning in permanent form.'' In other words, our Constitution is not meant to float on the whims of judges over time, bound only by precedent. It is actually written down, so that even judges have to start with the very text.  If we think about it, there is the independence that we have given to the judiciary--lifetime tenure. They don't have to stand for election, and they are not accountable to the voters or the people. The reason why the Founders created such an important role for the judiciary is because they believed there ought to be an umpire who calls balls and strikes when Congress passes laws or when lawsuits are filed and who could determine the fidelity of those laws to the text of the Constitution, which had a fixed meaning.  Well, sometimes this is called originalism, but it is not a political doctrine or an excuse to get certain outcomes. Mr.Garner makes the point that although his personal politics are different, dramatically, from those of Justice Scalia, those personal politics are irrelevant because the job of a judge is to apply a fair reading of the law. If you can't do that, then, maybe you ought to run for the Senate or Congress and get involved in politics rather than judging, because a failure to apply the law as fairly read is essential in any good judge.  Judges aren't given lifetime tenure--the sort of independence that nobody else in our government is given--just to enact their own visions of policy. Judge Gorsuch confirmed time and again that he will not do that--that he will only interpret the law as he has throughout his career as an independent judge, with faithfulness and fidelity to the text and the original understanding of the  The letter I have been quoting in part is here in my hand, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Now, I know there are some on the other side of the aisle who have indicated that adherence to originalism is a liability or who claim that it is somehow a radical doctrine out of the mainstream, but that is just a scare tactic. It is completely wrong. Let me remind my colleagues that during her confirmation hearings, now-Justice Elena Kagan told the same committee that ``we are all Originalists''--hardly a radical position, if Justice Kagan and Judge Gorsuch agree with originalism. It is certainly not a methodology of interpreting law that should stir any concern.  Yesterday, some of our Democratic colleagues continued to reinforce my view that they don't really have any legitimate objection and reason to filibuster Judge Neil This is about Judge This is not about President This is not about Merrick This is not about anything else.  We will have a chance to vote on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the U.S Supreme That is the question that will be presented to the Senate for an up-or-down vote. Any fairminded person would have to conclude that he is an independent legal mind and that he will not legislate from the bench. He has the intelligence, experience, and character to be a good judge, as he has been for 10 years on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals out of He has an unflinching commitment to upholding a faithful interpretation of the Constitution and our laws. I look forward to confirming him next week.  The question for our Democratic friends is whether they are going to launch the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United It really is unprecedented, what the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, has suggested--that for the first time in the history of the Senate, a partisan filibuster will be used to attempt to defeat the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice and to deny the Senate the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote.  Now, just to be clear, there are two votes we are talking about. One is the so-called cloture vote, where we close off debate. That takes 60 votes. Then, once that passes, it is clearly a majority vote, and 51 votes will carry the day.  But the Democratic leader has suggested that he would deny the Senate the opportunity to get to that second up-or-down vote, and that is simply unprecedented. It is unprecedented for a very good reason. To believe that 60 votes would be required to confirm a nominee to the U.Supreme Court would be to suggest that the Founding Fathers, when the Constitution was written and when it was ratified, somehow believed that the Senate rules were incorporated in the Constitution, when that is clearly not the case--clearly not the case. The Constitution is a separate document. The Senate rules are a different thing. But, again, never have they been conflated to suggest that somehow, in order to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court, we need 60 votes.  I understand the pressure that our friend the Democratic leader is under, because after this last election, he has now had to straddle two competing camps within the Democratic Party--traditional Democrats versus the Democrats lead by the wing of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth I understand the pressures that he must feel and the reason why he would do something that is unprecedented and suggest that we filibuster this nomination.  We already know that some Members of his conference have said they will agree to an up-or-down vote. Our friend from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, has said he opposes the filibuster. Senator Leahy, the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said he is not inclined to go along with it, either. Senator Cardin, our colleague and friend from Maryland, has stopped short of agreeing with the minority leader's strategy. Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota has said that she believes the nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.  If the Democratic leader follows through, as I said, it would be unprecedented. Never before has there been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. I would just say to our friends across the aisle that time and again Democrats have accelerated the arms race on judges, and every single time, it has come back to bite them.  We remember in 2013, when Senator Harry Reid, then the majority leader, broke the Senate rules in order to change the rules, in order to lower the threshold for circuit court and district court nominations. He did that because of the desire to pack the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, because that was the court that had primary jurisdiction over cases coming out of the Obama White House--its regulations and the like. In order to get a court that would be more likely to rubberstamp and approve of Obama policies, Senator Reid felt it was imperative to pack the DC Circuit Court of Unfortunately, he was able to do so with the votes of the Democrats across the aisle--to break the Senate rules to change the rules for the sole purpose of rubberstamping Obama administration policies.  The question before the Senate this time is very different. Those who would break precedent are those who would filibuster a Supreme Court nominee like Judge Gorsuch because it has never been done before. But I would ask our Democratic colleagues this: If Judge Gorsuch is not acceptable to them, is there ever going to be a nominee from a Trump administration whom they would find acceptable?  They have tried to find fault with Judge Gorsuch, and they have simply been unable to do so. So they keep moving the goalpost and raising different issues because they, frankly, are desperate to find some reason to justify this unprecedented filibuster.  But if they do--if Democrats block Judge Gorsuch from receiving an up-or-[[Page S2061]]down vote--then, there is simply no Republican nominee to the U.Supreme Court they won't filibuster. If Judge Gorsuch isn't good enough, I dare say there will never be another nominee who is good enough to allow an up-or-down vote if this unprecedented filibuster is allowed to stand.  So I hope our colleagues will reconsider, and that, on cooler reflection, the will not be driven by the radical elements in their own party but rather by their good judgment and their sense of responsibility to not only their constituents but to the Constitution itself and to the important role that the Senate plays in the advice and consent function to the nominee of the U.Supreme I hope they reconsider, and I hope that when the rollcall vote is held, our colleagues will provide the 60 votes we need to get cloture, so we can have that up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch's nomination.

Senator John Cornyn,     U.Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington,       Dear Senator Cornyn: It was an eerie feeling for me this      week, sitting behind my friend and coauthor Judge Neil      Gorsuch as he was being vetted to replace my late friend and      coauthor, Justice Antonin As you know, I've written      lengthy books with both men, and I know their legal      philosophies pretty darned well.       One aspect of their approach to judging--``originalism,''      as it's called--has attracted polemicists to use the label as      a scare tactic. So much demagoguery surrounds the word that      some clarification is in order.       People might wonder why Justice Scalia would write a      prescriptive book on judging (Reading Law) with someone who      had declared himself to favor same-sex marriage, to be      ardently pro-choice, to disfavor prayer in public schools,      and to be hostile to the Second Amendment--so hostile, in      fact, that he would like to see it repealed altogether. Yes,      I'd favor serious gun-control measures in this country.       My private beliefs on these points, however, would be      irrelevant if I were up for a judgeship because      methodologically I'm an originalist: I wouldn't be enacting      my own visions of wise policy--that's not what a good judge      does--but instead I'd be applying a ``fair reading'' to the      the statutory or constitutional words before me. Although I      deplore the Second Amendment's right to bear arms, I think      the Supreme Court's Heller decision was correct: the      constitutional Framers meant there to be a personal (though      not unlimited) right to own guns. I wish it weren't so.       Only if I were a ``pragmatist'' judge or a ``changing      constitutionalist'' would these private views become      important. Then I wouldn't be ``interpreting'' a document.      Instead, I'd be declaring new policies that have no      discernible foundation in the Constitution itself. I'd be      looking within my heart and soul to consider what I believed      to be fundamentally important. There I might discover new      rights that people hadn't seen before. I might take on the      mantle of philosopher-king: whenever reformers couldn't get a      constitutional amendment through, they could come to my      court. Perhaps four of my colleagues and I could amend the      Constitution for them: we'd declare a new meaning and find a      new fight as part of our never-ending Constitutional            That's what would happen if I were a ``pragmatist'' (it's a      euphemism) or a ``changing constitutionalist'' (the euphemism      is ``living constitutionalist'').       So you can see why methods of judging have caused the      confirmation process to become so heavily politicized. In      Reading Law, Justice Scalia and I remarked: ``The descent      into social rancor over judicial decisions is largely      traceable to nontextual means of interpretation, which erode      society's confidence in a rule of law that evidently has no      agreed-on meaning. Nontextual interpretation, which makes      `statesmen' of judges, promotes the shifting of political      blame from political organs of government (the executive and      the legislature) to the judiciary.''       We went on to observe that ``the consequence is the      politicizing of judges (and hence of the process of selecting      them) and a decline of faith in democratic institutions.''       In a New York Times op-ed two days ago, a law professor      from Louisiana had the temerity to say that ``Justice Scalia      failed to realize that textualism is self-undermining.'' His      support for that slander? ``Nowhere does the Constitution      explicitly state that textualism, no less than originalism or      any other method, is the correct theory of constitutional      interpretation.''       This is just silly. Nowhere in Shakespeare is it said that      future generations may well need a glossary to understand      some of the words--or that the best understanding of the      words will be their Elizabethan understanding. For example,      few people who read the word leasing in Shakespeare would      understand it, as his contemporaries did, to mean ``a lie or      falsehood.''       Although there was no name for originalism in the 18th      century, the idea was well-enough understood. The political      philosopher Emmerich de Vattel--whose influence on Benjamin      Franklin, George Washington, and other Founders was well      known and ``timely,'' according to Franklin, since it reached      them about 1775--wrote in his Law of Nations: ``The      interpretation of every act, and of every treaty, ought . . .      to be made according to certain rules proper to determine the      sense of them, such as the parties concerned must naturally      have understood, when the act was prepared and accepted.''       Vattel added: `When an ancient act is to be interpreted, we      should then know the common use of the terms, at the time      when it was written.''       That was the settled view of written legal instruments,      whether statutes or written constitutions. In 1796, Justice      James Iredell of the Supreme Court wrote: `We are too apt, in      estimating a law passed at a remote period, to combine in our      consideration, all the subsequent events which have had an      influence upon it, instead of confining ourselves (which we      ought to do) to the existing circumstances at the time of its      passing.''       Perhaps, you might think, all these statements relate only      to statutes and not to constitutions. Just seven years later,      in the seminal case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice John      Marshall applied the same principle to the U.     He emphasized the notion that the Constitution, aside from      what ought to be infrequent amendment, is fundamental and      unchanging: ``That the people have an original right to      establish, for their future government, such principles as,      in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own happiness,      is the basis, on which the whole American fabric has been      erected.'' It's an original right to fix the future      government. He added that this original right is ``a very      great exertion'' that should not ``be frequently repeated.''      Then, in this closely reasoned passage, he says that ``the      principles . . . so established are deemed fundamental'' and      ``are designed to be permanent.''       Permanent--not waxing and waning according to political      expediencies of the moment.       That's the essence of originalism. Marshall and Iredell and      Vattel were hardly alone. Other writers of the period agreed.      In 1821, James Madison, one of the architects of the      Constitution and author of the Bill of Rights, correctly      stated the gist of originalism: ``Can it be of less      consequence that the meaning of a constitution should be      fixed and known, than that the meaning of a law should be so?      Can, indeed, a law be fixed in its meaning and operation,      unless the constitution be so?''       Elsewhere, Madison wrote: ``What a metamorphosis would be      produced in the Code of the law if all its ancient      phraseology were to be taken in its modern sense.'' He      further insisted that if ``the sense in which the      Constitution was accepted and ratified by the nation . . . be      not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for      a faithful exercise of its powers.''       The very fact of having a written constitution meant that      we had fixed its meaning in permanent form. That wasn't just      the prevalent notion among the founders--it was the only      notion of which any contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous      trace can be found.       Some imprecise observers confuse the concept of originalism      with the word originalism--and so conclude that the concept,      like the word, was born ``in 1985 [when] Ronald Reagan's      attorney general at the time, Edwin Meese, elevated      originalism to a legal and political movement.'' It may well      be that the term originalism didn't come into common usage      until the 1980s, but that is simply because before then there      was no need for the term. Originalism is what philologists      call a ``retronym''--a term devised to describe what used to      be an entire genus but has since become merely one species of      the genus. For example, the term land line didn't exist in      the telecommunications field until wireless technology was      invented. Until then, all voice telecommunication was through      land lines, so the term was unnecessary.       Likewise, giving text its original meaning was long the      standard legal practice. It wasn't until the 1960s that other      ``theories'' of interpretation came into common usage. Only      then did it become necessary to coin a word to denote the      traditional practice.       Only by sheer, bald-faced casuistry can it be argued, as it      was earlier this week in the New York Times, that ``true      originalism--genuinely following the founders' intent--     requires us moderns to interpret constitutional language in      light of our own, not their, moral and linguistic norms.''      This assertion comes, of course, from the same writer who      asserts that ``Justice Scalia also failed to realize--or at      least admit--that textualism and originalism rarely determine      a unique outcome.''       These calumnies don't square with the facts. In the preface      to Reading Law, Justice Scalia and I plainly wrote:      ``Textualism will not relieve judges of all doubts and      misgivings about their interpretations. Judging is inherently      difficult, and language notoriously slippery. But textualism      will provide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater      predictability and greater respect for the rule of law.''       Judge Gorsuch said as much during his Judiciary Committee      hearings this week. He demonstrated an astonishing command of      the law, a erudition worn lightly, a calm but tenacious      dedication to the scruple of judicial ethics, a thoroughly      likable demeanor,[[Page S2062]]     and admirable endurance. I trust that all fair-minded      Senators will vote for him.

13906,topic-id,910,"Mr.President, I returned last week from the Middle East, where several colleagues and I spent the weekend meeting with leaders and security officials in Lebanon, Jordan, and As usual, the men and women who assisted us were consummate professionals, whether it was the U.Marines, Embassy personnel, or our own military escorts and congressional staff. They all did a superb job, and I want to extend to them my deepest thanks. I want to say a few words about what we learned while we were there.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, our allies told us they are more optimistic about their relationship with the United States now than they were under the last administration. If you thought diplomacy consisted simply of suave sophistication, I can understand your confusion. But among our allies, there is no confusion about what their interests are, how the United States shares them, and which country in the whole region threatens them most of all--Once you realize that, it is not so hard to understand their morale boost. Do they watch what we say? Yes, of course, very carefully. But they watch even more carefully what we do, and even though our foreign policy was cloaked in ``pretty words'' over the last 8 years, they see the difference in leadership as clear as day. The last President coddled Iran, and this President is confronting  Every conversation we had drove home this point: Iran is the single most destabilizing force in the Middle That is because it is more than a regional power, it is a revolutionary power. The regime in Tehran is not satisfied with finding good trading partners or even bullying other countries into proper neighborly deference. Big countries throw their weight around all the time, after all. No, what is different about this regime is that it is not trying to create clients; it is trying to create clones. It wants to expand its influence by subverting legitimate governments in places such as Yemen and Lebanon and replacing them with radical regimes. Countries that it can't subvert, it tries to destroy, like our friend And its aggressive sectarian ideology drives Sunni Muslims into the arms of extremist groups like the Islamic  There is no getting around the fact that in the Middle East, the answer to most questions is Iran, and our allies have told me repeatedly in recent months that they need our help to confront Tehran's campaign of imperial aggression.  In Lebanon, I am happy to say there are some signs of hope. The new Prime Minister, Sa'ad Hariri, has formed a government and is purportedly on the verge of approving a budget--the first of its kind since 2005. For years, the Lebanese Government has struggled with the growing influence of Iran's proxy, Hezbollah, members of which are on trial for carrying out the assassination of the Prime Minister's father, Rafic, in 2005. But now that Hezbollah is committed to the war in Syria, the Lebanese Government has an opportunity to take control of its border, its army, and its governing institutions, free of their terrorist influence. We should take all prudent steps to support Lebanon as it strives to create security and stability for its own people and its neighbors.  Then there is Jordan, which for so long has been a relative island of calm in a tumultuous region. The Hashemite monarchy has been a faithful friend to America for years, but now, for the first time in recent history, Jordan faces a hostile, aggressive power on its borders--It is also under an immense strain as it deals with hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees living in its territory. Today, Jordan spends up to 25 percent of its budget on helping refugees. We need to continue helping this bulwark of stability stand against the forces of Islamic extremism by sharing intelligence, helping train police and counterterrorism forces, and partnering in the fight against  Finally, there is Israel, which it is no secret that the regime in Tehran has vowed to destroy. While we were overseas, Israeli warplanes struck deep into the heart of Syrian territory. They were targeting a convoy of advanced missiles bound for In a serious escalation, Syria fired missiles not[[Page S2068]]only at Israeli aircraft but at Israeli territory, one of which was intercepted by the Arrow 2 missile defense system. This incident goes to show just how important our aid is to protecting Israel's security and how important Israel is to confronting Iranian-sponsored aggression. We must continue to support Israel and its development of advanced missile defense systems.  I am happy to report that all three of our allies continue to seek ever-closer friendship with the United They are optimistic about their ability to work together under the new administration, and they sincerely appreciate everything our country has done for them.  I saw for myself a reminder of this country's sacrifice at the U.Embassy in There, you will find a memorial that is dedicated to the 241 Americans who died in the terrorist bombing of our Marine barracks in 1983. That atrocity was committed by Hezbollah, if anyone needed a reminder as to why we fight alongside our allies against the Iran-Hezbollah-Syria axis in the contest of supremacy in the Middle  If our trip taught us anything, it was that our allies will not give up the fight but that it will take American leadership to stop Iran's campaign of imperial aggression.

Requiring operators to meet yet another set of rules, in addition to States' permits, results in substantial increases in both time and cost without any additional benefit to the public or to the environment, and that would also subject operators to conflicting rules, which actually could have the adverse effect that this rule aims at.  Just in North Dakota alone, it is estimated this rule would cost $24 million in lost tax revenue, and $240 million per year would be lost in production, but $39 million, most importantly, would be lost in royalty revenues, not to big, rich oil companies who make large contributions, as our friends on the other side like to talk about, but to regular people, farmers and ranchers and landowners who own the royalty, who get the royalty. These are the very people the Democrats love to talk about but don't seem to know how to talk to.  Methane leaks are wasteful, but there is a natural incentive to capture it. Methane is not a waste product, it is a commodity.  The overall, best-case scenario impact of this rule would be a reduction of 0.06 percent. Now, if the BLM really wants to do something, they could streamline the permitting of the infrastructure that would capture it.  I know of two pipeline projects in North Dakota alone that, had they been allowed to move forward, at no expense to the government, had they been allowed to move forward by the BLM, without its heavy hand of regulation, would have reduced emissions 6 percent; 6 percent with the natural incentive, stopped by the BLM, rather than this rule, which would, perhaps in the best case scenario, reduce it 0.06 percent.

13911,topic-id,2836,"Madam President, I rise today to speak about the President's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Whenever great issues like the future of our Nation's highest Court come before the Senate, it is easy to get lost in the noise and the hyperbole. Listening to the commentary about Judge Gorsuch, I have found it instructive to ask whether critics have actually met him and listened to his philosophy of jurisprudence.  I have met him, and it is easy to guess that those who oppose him likely have not spoken to him, watched the hearings, or read any of the glowing testimonials from across the political spectrum. The invectives thrown at Judge Gorsuch seem really to be about something else entirely--about anger at the President, disappointment with the election outcome, or concern about holding certain hotly debated topics of the day. It appears that critics could substitute almost any name for Judge Gorsuch in their statements and give them with the same passion and the same concern.  That is too bad because Judge Gorsuch has been consistently regarded by his peers as pragmatic and among the most gifted legal minds on the Federal bench. The man is intelligent, courteous, and modest. He seeks readily the views of those around him. His approach will be a constructive addition to the U.Supreme Court and of benefit to our His judicial record as a Federal judge flows exactly from what he says, and his message and focus is abundantly clear: judicial modesty and fidelity to the law.  When our representative government was established in the United States, a heated debate emerged about the purposes and powers of our new Federal institutions. The Founders of our country understood that a system in which lawmaking was detached from accountability was the quickest path to despotism. A coequal judiciary could help temper tyranny and balance the powers of an executive and a legislature stepping over their constitutional powers. The phrase is ``checks and balances'' not ``usurpation.''  Alexander Hamilton, who has received much recently renewed attention, wrote at length about the newly imagined judicial branch of our government. In Federalist 78, Hamilton wrote that the judicial branch ``may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.''  To the Founders, the division of responsibilities between the three branches of government was clear: Congress would make the laws. The executive would implement them. The judiciary would review the laws for their legality and consistency with the Further, the independence of the judiciary would be enhanced through their distinctive selection process, so they could do their jobs without succumbing to swings in popular opinion. Put succinctly by Chief Justice Roberts during his confirmation hearings, a judge's proper role is ``to call balls and strikes.''  In his testimonial to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge Gorsuch emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary. He writes:       Judges should . . . strive to apply the law as it is,      focusing backward, not forward, and looking to the text,      structure, and history . . . not decide cases on their own      moral convictions.  Judges ``take an oath to uphold'' the Constitution, not ``merely consider it.'' It is their duty to follow the law.  Jurisprudence is not supposed to be the popular arts. Judges are not vessels for moral causes. Judge Gorsuch repeats Justice Scalia's words:       [I]f you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have      to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going      to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the      time, you're probably doing something wrong.  Further, Judge Gorsuch states that rulings made in an attempt to optimize social utility introduces a question of moral relativism.       In criminal cases, for example, we often hear arguments      from the government that its view would promote public      security or finality. Meanwhile, the defense often tells us      that its view would promote personal liberty or procedural      fairness. How is a judge supposed to weigh or rank these very      different social goods?  The answer lies in the common points of reference for all judges, be they conservatives or progressives--the written law. Reading the law is difficult enough without introducing the element of uncertainty. Court-shopping for a pliant judge who will interpret the law the way a litigant believes it should read can be destructive to public confidence in the legal system.  In our democracy, the public expresses its will at the ballot box and empowers its duly-elected officials with the duty to advance that will. Changes in public attitudes can come quickly, and that can be reflected in the results of elections.  Congress is the body most closely connected to the American public because its accountability is directly to the people.  Some observers want judges to be legislators, discarding the black robes for populist impulses. But our system of checks and balances is predicated on the fact that change comes deliberately and incrementally, notwithstanding the wild swings in public mood.  The pace of change can understandably frustrate. However, congressional action is the spirit of the American electorate, exercised with its unique combination of majority rule, minority rights, and compromise. The imperfect caldron of the legislative process is how change happens carefully, purposefully, and properly.  Unfortunately, impatience can drive people to try to circumvent the constitutional power of The tendency of some to race to a courthouse, bypassing the will of the people expressed through Congress, to compel change is inherently destabilizing to representative government.  Without a direct say in how policy is decided and without the ability to hold people accountable, judges who reimagine the law undermine a fundamental cornerstone of representative democracy. Judges have a great responsibility to carefully exercise their judicial authority within the limits of the law. Judges who exercise independence from anchors of our law are dangerous to our liberties. Judge Gorsuch demonstrates that he clearly understands this concept when he writes:       Legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and      to claims to reshape the law as they think it should be in      the future. But judges should do none of these things in a      democratic society.  Some jurists treat the Constitution like a speed bump as they hurdle down the road reinventing the law. Substituting ideology for the written law in jurisprudence is the equivalent of changing the law from what it says to what some wish it says.  Neil Gorsuch identified this very problem when he wrote in 2005 that ``the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary. In the legislative arena, especially when the country is closely divided, compromises tend to be the rule of the day. But when judges rule this or that policy unconstitutional, there's little room for compromise: One side must win, the other must lose. . . . As a society, we lose the benefit of the give-and-take of the political process and the flexibility of social experimentation that only the elected branches can provide.'' These words reflect a clear understanding of the importance of the separation of powers.  The Federal judiciary should not be a replacement for doing the hard work of persuading the public and enacting policy with accountability to the electorate.[[Page S2072]]  Americans learn civics early in their upbringing. The Constitution guarantees certain civil liberties and restrains the powers of the central government. Our court system has the responsibility to preserve our constitutional rights, ensure a limited government, and provide speedy and fair justice when needed. The judiciary holds the sole constitutional power to interpret laws properly enacted by This authority is expressly distinct from the power bestowed to the legislature to write laws and the executive to enforce them. This separation of powers plays an important role in the system of checks and balances envisioned by the  Public confidence in our legal system is undermined when judges seek to reimagine Federal law beyond its clear meaning. Judges who substitute their personal views for the law can shake the public's faith in our legal system as an impartial protector of our rights and an upholder of justice. Judges must follow our Constitution in their decisionmaking and resist this temptation to make policy.  Moreover, without the public sanction of the ballot box, policy changes, particularly controversial ones, naturally divide people. If the judiciary cannot be seen as a neutral arbiter of facts and laws, even more people will see individual judges as ``one of mine'' or ``one of yours.''  The erosion of the humble judiciary began when the Senate confirmation process changed. In recent past, district and circuit court nominees used to be confirmed noncontroversially. Now, instead of looking at the qualifications of the judicial nominee, partisans hope to pre-bake court decisions through the use of litmus tests or demands on nominees to determine in advance what their rulings will be on cases before the matter is even argued to the court. Perhaps this is the logical extension of the overreliance on some to secure social gains they cannot achieve through the democratic process.  Change is hard, and patience is exceedingly rare, but the strongest building blocks to legitimacy are achieved though consensus and the give-and-take of politics.  Writing even before he was overwhelmingly approved by this body for his current seat on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch wrote:       [In courts,] ideas are tested only in the abstract world of      legal briefs and lawyers' arguments. As a society, we lose      the benefit of the give-and-take of the political process and      the flexibility of social experimentation that only the      elected branches can provide. At the same time, the      politicalization of the judiciary undermines the only real      asset it has--its independence. Judges come to be seen as      politicians and their confirmations become just an avenue of      political warfare. Respect for the role of judges and the      legitimacy of the judiciary branch as a whole diminishes.       The judiciary's diminishing claim to neutrality and      independence is exemplified by a recent, historic shift in      the Senate's confirmation process. Where trial-court and      appeals-court nominees were once routinely confirmed on voice      vote--  Based on their credentials and their ability to serve--     they are now routinely subjected to ideological litmus tests,      filibusters, and vicious interest-group attacks. It is a      warning sign that our judiciary is losing its legitimacy when      trial and circuit-court judges are viewed and treated as      little more than politicians with robes.  This development puts a severe strain on our Particularly problematic is the increasing number of split court decisions. Rulings that are given with a one-vote margin further empower litigants to contest decisions, hoping for a more favorable outcome later or in a different court. Setting precedent, though, becomes so much more difficult for the public when a razor-thin decision is accompanied by a dramatic reinterpretation of the law.  One of the hallmarks of the Roberts Court is the drive to establish precedent not by finding the narrowest reading that can achieve a bare majority but its endeavor to ground seminal decisions in large majorities and unanimous findings. Public confidence in the legal system and the finality of the holding is ever greater when we do not see narrow decisions.  The Judiciary Committee just concluded a 4-day review of the nomination of Judge In addition to hearing from Judge Gorsuch for over 20 hours, the committee received formal testimony from almost 30 outside witnesses. Thousands upon thousands of words were exchanged over the course of the hearing, all in front of the American public. What the people saw is a thoughtful, humble, and brilliant legal mind in the service of the people.  In response to a question of mine on Tuesday, Judge Gorsuch said the following:       I come here with no agenda but one, no promises but one: to      be as good and faithful a judge as I know how to be. That is      it. And I cannot promise or agree or pledge anything more      than that to this  That statement and the hearing as a whole confirmed Judge Gorsuch to be a man of great integrity, a mainstream, exemplary student of the law whose record shows that he is a part of unanimous decisions. On the Tenth Circuit, of all the decisions he has participated in in the last 10 years, 97 percent of the time, he was a part of a unanimous court, and 99 percent of the time, he was in the majority.  For days, my colleagues from the other side of the aisle raised the possibility that he might have secret intentions to try to subvert the law or shred the Constitution from the bench. They parsed single words for hidden meanings, imagined devious strategies emerging from concurring opinions, and searched for cloaked messages in his published writings.  Judge Gorsuch has over 10 years as a jurist, with 2,700 opinions to review; yet most of the debate was centered on just 4 or 5 cases. Some Senators were absolutely convinced they would find some problem. They did not.  Let's talk about what Judge Gorsuch testified to under oath. Despite repeated efforts to get him to make commitments about how he would rule or how he would reshape social policy, on his first day, he gave no fewer than eight assurances that he follows the law as a judge. By my count, on the second day, he gave at least 36 assurances that he looks to the law for his rulings. On the third day, it was 29 more times that he was asked and again repeated that he would look to the law for his rulings. That is right. He said at least 73 times that he is committed to the law when he hears a case as a sitting Federal judge. Still, several of my colleagues worried that he had a secret agenda to overturn longstanding legal precedence.  Just in case there are some confused, Judge Gorsuch mentioned no fewer than 97 times in these 3 days that he follows precedent as a judge, as he is bound to do. More than 160 times, Judge Gorsuch reminded the Senate and the American public what a proper jurist does: follows the law and the precedent. We even talked about the book he coauthored titled ``The Law of Judicial Precedent''--942 pages of dedication to following precedent. Maybe the title of the book was confusing to some.  During his oral testimony, he said he was dedicated to ``rul[ing] as the law requires,'' ``reading the language of the statute as a `reasonable person' would understand it,'' and ``respect[ing] precedent.''  Just to put all such questions to rest, he assured everyone that he is ``without secret agenda. None.''  In reviewing his record, it is clear that those who come before Judge Gorsuch receive equal treatment under the law. He said:       When I sit on the bench and someone comes to argue before      me, I treat each one of them equally. They do not come as      rich or poor, big guy or little guy. They come as a person.      And I put my ego aside when I put on that robe, and I open my      mind, and I open my heart, and I listen.  In Judge Gorsuch, we have a nominee who lives the American ideal of a modest jurist. He understands that his responsibility is not to suborn the powers of others but to help deliver the powers of justice.  Those who have encountered him as a legal advocate, an adversary in court, or a presiding judge all praise his fundamental fairness and subornation of his personal views.  His respect for the Constitution is not in question. His experience, wisdom, and judgment are not in question. His capability to serve is not in question. Commentators from both the left and the right overwhelmingly respect his legal mind and vouch for his commitment to fair jurisprudence.  Given Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and his record as a judge, he[[Page S2073]]would be a welcome addition to a Supreme Court seeking cohesive decisions. His record on the Tenth Circuit is strong. Five of six of his decisions that did go to the Supreme Court for a review have been affirmed by the Supreme Court, including one which he wrote, and four out of five on which he joined the decision.  Not many judges have the experience, temperament, and stellar record to match Judge Fewer still can garner overwhelming endorsement from colleagues, peers, and observers from across the political spectrum.  Some may try to distract from the central point that Judge Gorsuch is extraordinarily qualified and suited to serve as an Associate Others would like to discuss other issues or make his nomination a proxy fight about tangential matters. My colleagues and I will vote on his nomination, not on these other issues or distractions. I encourage all of us to remember that.

This time they are using the official rules of the House to further their radical agenda and to gag Members of the Democratic Caucus, which you all know includes taking away healthcare coverage for millions of Americans, putting insurance companies back in charge of healthcare decisions, and raising costs for taxpayers in this country.  Among all the power grabs and cynical ploys in this rules package, there is a very telling sign in their priorities. They know that their plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act won't just create chaos for American families and their health care; it will also blow a huge deficit in our Nation's budget--a huge deficit in our Nation's budget--the height of irresponsible governing.  But they apparently won't let that get in the way of political games. So, today, the majority is giving themselves a pass. They wrote a rule that allows them to ignore the huge financial impact of gutting our healthcare system.

It was designed by Bozeman-based architect Fred Willson and built by local carpenters and craftspeople under the direction of the first owner, John ``Skinny''  Until recently, the Club Moderne had changed very little since its opening day, and in 1986, it was added to the National Register of Historic  In 1997, the Francisco family sold the bar to a close friend, longtime bartender, and Anaconda native John Hekkel who continued its legacy as a flagship watering hole, especially for area law enforcement and firefighters, while maintaining its retro atmosphere.  A recent Yelp review described taking a step inside ``like walking inside a time capsule!''  Last April, it also won the top award in The Big Tap: 2016 Historic Bars Tournament Championship, an online contest sponsored by the National Trust for Historic  Unfortunately, Club Moderne was destroyed in a fire in October, a tragic loss to the Anaconda community.  The night the fire happened, I understand John Hekkel stayed at the bar until 4:00 in the morning and, after the fire was extinguished, grabbed a shovel and physically helped with the cleanup.  Just this week, I was thrilled to hear the Hekkels announce plans to rebuild the bar and restore this historic establishment.  This is a true Montana story. Montanans pull themselves up by their bootstraps, even in times of hardship or loss.  I invite fellow Montanans to stop by to try whatever's on tap or a Moscow Mule, which is an Anaconda specialty.  The Hekkels, through Club Moderne, have welcomed those just passing through our State and native Montanans alike for generations. As small business owners, they have brought their community together. I wish them all my best as they restore Club Moderne and renew it as a bright spot in the Anaconda community.

13738,topic-id,783,"Mr.President, today I want to take a few moments to acknowledge Illinois State Senator--and my friend--John John is one of the best and most decent men in politics--and there is no stronger advocate for the people of western After all, they are John's lifelong friends and family. He has been living and farming there his entire life. And after 14 years in the Illinois Senate, John retired and returned to the family business.  John Sullivan grew up on his family farm in Macomb, Nauvoo, and He spent his summers taking care of livestock and baling hay. In 1981, John graduated from Quincy College--known today as Quincy University--with a degree in history. After college, he went to auction school and obtained his real estate license. He sold insurance before taking a job in Rushville with Production Credit  He didn't know anyone in Rushville--a town of just over 3,000 people--but he joined the local parish and quickly made friends. As fate would have it, Joan Merna moved to town and joined the same parish. Their friends decided to introduce them, and the rest is history. Today, John and Joan have been married for more than 33 years. And if you talk to their friends, they will tell you their marriage was one of the best things that happened to They are a great team and have a wonderful family  In 1986, John joined the family real estate and auction business, which his children and siblings still run today. Nearly 20 years later, he sat down with Joan at the kitchen table and decided to run for office. It was something he always wanted to do--and 2002 was as good a time as any. Before John, no one thought a Democrat could be elected Senator in western For years, good candidates tried and failed. But John won office the old-fashioned way--by knocking on doors, walking in parades, and listening to people. He also had a secret weapon--six brothers and four sisters. Republicans said it was like running against the Walton family. And a couple of his brothers look just like The resemblance was so great that, during that first campaign, people sometimes thought John was everywhere all at once. They didn't realize that sometimes they were seeing one of the Sullivan brothers.  John learned fast and rose in just a few years from a political novice to a leader of the Democratic Party in the Illinois If you want to see John's legacy, you can look at the extensions of Route 336 and Route 67--main arteries that created hundreds of new jobs--and will continue to bring new jobs to the region long after we are gone. He has secured more than $820 million for Western Illinois University in Macomb--and over $16 million to keep the Quincy Veterans Home Guest House open.  But the greatest part of John's legacy is the civility, reason, and dignity he has brought to his work--qualities that are needed in public service today. John understands that getting things done involves finding middle ground and getting along with people. Progress is a long march. It demands patience and perseverance. And sometimes, it requires the wisdom and humility to compromise, a lesson John learned from his parents, growing up as one of 11 children. When fights broke out, his parents didn't get involved, they simply said: ``Figure it out and just get along.'' And they did. John took the same approach to governance and built his reputation as someone who is always willing to listen to the other side to see if there is a way to move forward[[Page S340]]together. He knows that principled compromise isn't capitulation, but how democracy is supposed to work. He will be sorely missed in the Illinois  Despite his many achievements, his proudest accomplishment is his family. John and Joan still live on their family farm in Rushville where they raised four children. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and And let me tell you, Emily inherited some good public service genes--I am indebted to John and Joan for letting her work in my Washington office.  I will close with this. On the wall in John's Senate office was a photograph of his dad, along with the advice he gave him. He told John: ``Don't forget the little guy.'' Throughout his career, he has never forgotten the little guys--family farmers, small business owners, and hard-working people wondering how they will send their children to college or retire with dignity. John has stood with them and been their champion. Now, as he enters the next chapter in his life, I want to wish him and Joan many years of happiness and the best of luck with the family business and family farm.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS339.txt,326,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,17.0,January

Ed Greelegs was my chief of staff for 17 years, and he was a wise and trusted friend. I was not unique in that regard. Ed had thousands of friends. I used to marvel while walking through the Capitol with Ed Greelegs because he knew everybody, and everybody knew him--not just the Members of Congress and their staff but cafeteria workers, carpenters, Capitol Police officers, and certainly Senators, Congressmen, and their staffs. He was a beloved member of the Senate community, and what a smart fellow he was.  During my first 10 years in the Senate, when Ed was my chief of staff, he was an unfailing source of wise and thoughtful advice. Some people are drawn to Congress because of what they think are the perks and power that come with this job. That is not what attracted Ed  For Ed, being a good public servant was always a privilege. He avoided the spotlight. He was there to help people and to help move America closer to that more perfect Union our Founders dreamed of.  Fifteen years ago, Ed was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's. He and his wife Susan faced that formidable challenge the same way they faced everything: together, with love, determination, courage, and a good sense of humor.  Sadly, yesterday, Ed's battle with Parkinson's ended, and he passed away at the age of 66.  Parkinson's disease is a bitter adversary. Over the years, it took away Ed's sure-footedness. It nearly killed him twice. In the end, it robbed him of many memories. I can recall speaking to him a few months back, and Susan had warned me that he didn't have much of a memory, she said, unless you want to talk about politics. So I called him, and we talked about politics--even the politics of the day--and Ed was spot on. He always was. But regardless of the loss of memory, it never took away Ed's dignity, his kindness, or his respect for others.  Ed Greelegs worked for so many Members of Congress from Illinois that I think he became an honorary son of[[Page S2085]]our He grew up in Washington, DC, in the suburb of Wheaton, MD, and graduated from the University of  He came to the Capitol as an intern in 1970.

His quiet, wry sense of humor helped to lighten the mood when things became tense, and his profound compassion and decency reminded all of us of why we were really there.  There were a couple of things that Ed loved more than public service, and one was books. Ed's desk and his bedside were always surrounded by mountains of books.

13790,topic-id,591,"Madam President, I rise today in opposition to Rex Tillerson's nomination to be our next Secretary of I don't believe Mr.Tillerson is an appropriate selection to be our Nation's chief diplomat.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Tillerson repeatedly evaded questions related to transparency and corporate responsibility. For instance, on multiple occasions Mr.Tillerson stated that he was unaware of Exxon's history of lobbying Congress; yet, according to lobbying disclosure forms, Exxon lobbied against a variety of Iran and Russia-related sanctions since at least 2010. When pressed on the matter, Mr.Tillerson even claimed he didn't know if Exxon lobbied for or against these energy-related sanctions bills.  Additionally, I am troubled by Mr.Tillerson's response to questions about Exxon's dealings with Iran, Syria, and According to public documents, Exxon established a joint venture with Shell to conduct business with state sponsors of terror. That joint venture--Infineum--sold petroleum products to Iran, Sudan, and Syria, when those nations were being sanctioned by the United  During that time, Mr.Tillerson rose from senior vice president to president and director and eventually to chairman and CEO of Exxon; yet, during his testimony, Mr.Tillerson claimed to be unaware of Infineum's purposeful evasion of sanctions. Instead of recognizing the larger national interest, Mr.Tillerson suggested that American companies could legally avoid sanctions by setting up shell companies outside of the United States.[[Page S548]]  Infineum is not the only example of Exxon's history of undermining American policy. Under Mr.Tillerson's leadership, Exxon signed oil exploration contracts with the Kurds in Doing so undermined the United States ``one Iraq'' policy and exacerbated the long-simmering conflict between the central government and the That is because Exxon signed contracts to explore oil at six sites. Three of those sites were on disputed land claimed by both the Kurds and the Iraqi central government.  By agreeing to explore in disputed territory on behalf of the Kurds, Exxon changed the facts on the ground in favor of the Exxon's decision may have been good for Exxon, but it certainly did not benefit a stable, unified  I am also concerned by Mr.Tillerson's response to questions about Russia has invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, intervened in Syria, and meddled in our own elections; yet Mr.Tillerson refuses to offer support for international sanctions against  He refuses to describe Russia's bombing of Syrian hospitals and schools--and a U.humanitarian aid convoy--as war crimes.  Russia remains in violation of the Minsk agreement and continues to occupy Crimea, indiscriminately bomb in Syria, and hack American think tanks.  Now is not the time to remove sanctions against Russia, and I have little confidence Mr.Tillerson is committed to pushing back against Russian aggression.  Finally, Mr.Tillerson's indifference to the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians is unacceptable. Specifically, Mr.Tillerson said that a two-state solution is a ``dream'' and openly questioned whether or not it could ever become a reality. The reality is that, without a two-state solution, Israel cannot be both a democracy and a majority-Jewish state.  Today Israel is constructing settlements throughout the West Palestinian terror and incitement continue. Mr.Tillerson's almost casual dismissal of the two-state solution is disqualifying for a Secretary of Our chief diplomat must understand the urgency of the situation and must be willing to engage both sides in the pursuit of peace.

13907,topic-id,2147,"Madam President, I rise to talk about the continuing challenge that our agricultural communities face across this country.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I came to the floor and cited a Wall Street Journal article with the headline: ``The Next American Farm Bust Is Upon Us.'' Living in eastern Colorado, in a purely 100 percent agricultural community, I understand that when there is a downturn in the ag economy, it does not affect businesses on Main Street later that week or later that month; it affects them that very same day. He is not just somebody who is going in to buy a bag of seed or somebody who is going to the local implement dealer to buy a tractor. He is somebody who decides he is not going to be able to buy that pair of blue jeans that he thought he would or that piece of equipment he needed to help fix the fence. It means that the entire economy in towns like Yuma, CO, Burlington, CO, and Dove Creek, CO, are going to suffer enormously. That is why it is important that we continue the conversation in the U.Senate about what is happening in agriculture across this country.  I recognize that many people, when they think of Colorado, probably do not think of farms and ranches on the flatlands and prairies. They probably think more of Kansas for that than they do If you look at Colorado, it is more than just snowcapped peaks; it is incredible agricultural diversity as well.  According to the 2016 National Agricultural Statistics Survey, Colorado ranks in the top 10 in production for the following agriculture commodities: barley, beans, sweet corn, alfalfa, potatoes, millet, sorghum, sunflowers, wheat, cabbage, cantaloupe, onions, cattle, lamb, and wool. Colorado is one of the top 10 producers in those commodities. It is a remarkable list that shows the diversity of Colorado from the plains to the mountains and the incredible production levels that we have achieved.  One of the goals I have had in the Senate, of course, is to help make sure that we have the right policies to support our farmers and ranchers throughout Colorado who are producing everything from barley to potatoes. I want to make sure that we work to add even more crops to this list of the top 10 in order to strengthen the agricultural industry in  As I mentioned a few weeks ago when I came to the floor to talk about that crisis, the Wall Street Journal article highlighted a story from a farmer in I recently talked to a farmer in eastern Colorado who is getting paid $3.21 for a bushel of corn, but to pay the bills, his break-even point on that bushel of corn--the amount of money that it took to make that corn bushel--was $3.92 cents. So he was getting paid $3.21, and it cost him $3.92. That is not the right side of an equation to be on if you are in business and, particularly, if you are hoping to pass that business on to future generations.  I think it is important that the Senate talk about commodity prices and that we talk about the impact that increased Federal regulations have had which make it more difficult for that farmer to survive, that have driven up the cost of doing business, that have driven up the cost that you need to be paid per bushel of corn so that you can help make ends meet.  I talk about barriers to exports and limited financing options. Those are four things that we have to lay out--commodity prices--and deal with. We have to make sure that we are decreasing the number of Federal regulations. We have to make sure that we remove barriers to export and allow agriculture to export. We have to make sure that we are removing any obstacles to the financing that a farmer or a rancher may have, particularly if the economy continues to deteriorate in our countryside, and we have to make sure that we have certainty in ag policy and certainty in regulations. The farm bill conversations continue. Let's make sure that we provide the certainty to our ag communities that they deserve and, quite frankly, demand.  According to the 2017 Colorado Business Economic Outlook--and this is an incredible statistic--net farm and ranch incomes are projected to be down almost 80 percent since the records that were set in 2011. By 80 percent, net farm and ranch incomes are projected to be down. An 80 percent drop in just a few years is devastating for rural communities. I believe the exact numbers in Colorado are something like going from $1.8 billion in farm income to a little over $300 million in farm income just over a matter of a few years.  While we have done a good job of addressing regulatory concerns, we have to make sure that we are doing a good job of addressing continued trade opportunities in this country as well. Corn and wheat prices are hitting 10-year lows. The price is so low that it costs farmers more to produce the crop, as I mentioned, than it is worth on the market. You do not have to be an economist to figure out that that is not going to let you stay in business for much longer.  Simply put, we have a lot of people who are worried in Colorado and across this country for agriculture and our rural communities, which are dependent on their farms and ranches. The Presiding Officer is from the great State of Iowa--a leader in this country when it comes to agriculture. Whether you live in the Eastern Plains of Colorado or in the great State of Iowa, the fact is we have to provide that leadership on a global stage to make sure that our ag communities survive and thrive.  Earlier this year, I sent a letter to the Colorado Farm Bureau that solicited feedback on what Congress and the Federal Government could do to support Colorado agriculture. In their response, I received a number of recommendations from the Colorado Farm Bureau and a number of organizations that they reached out to to respond to my request and my question.  On the list, of course, was regulatory reform--one of the four pillars that we have to address in order to have successful agriculture in this country. Their concern is that overregulation creates uncertainty in regulations like the waters of the United States and the BLM 2.0 rules.  The good news is that, with regard to both of these rules, we have been able to roll them back. According to the Colorado Farm Bureau, the waters of the United States regulation threatened to add additional regulatory compliance requirements to thousands of stream miles and thousands of acres of agricultural land.  To put that in layman's terms, it basically would have said: Hey, you, the Federal Government, you are in charge of every molecule of water.  That is not good for agriculture. Thankfully, the administration has said: No, we are going to stop that, and we are going to repeal it. Courts across this country had actually put in stays.  The Presiding Officer from the great State of Iowa--our colleague, Joni Ernst--was a leader when it came to stopping the waters of the United States regulation. Luckily, we have seen that regulation being stopped in its tracks.  In Colorado, two-thirds of waterways were identified as what is known as[[Page S2069]]``intermittent flow.'' That means that they do not have water in them year round, that, part of the year, they are dry. Yet they would have been subject to a regulation known as the waters of the United States, even though they did not have water in them. That is the absurdity of the Federal So I am glad that we are able to start rolling back these regulations.  At the same time, the Bureau of Land Management had started a process known as its BLM 2.0 rulemaking process, which is a rule that they had issued that they thought would deal with complex permitting issues and land use decisions. Unfortunately, what this rule would have done instead is take away access to thousands of acres of Federal land that were used for grazing. Even more disturbing, it would have given somebody in downtown New York City just as much say over the land in Moffat County, CO, as a Moffat County commissioner--somebody who lives there--amongst various agencies in the Federal Government that oversee thousands of acres of public lands. That, too, was overturned by the U. In fact, if you look at the total number of regulations that the administration and that the U.Congress has been able to overturn, we are approaching $60 billion worth of regulatory relief that we have been able to give to the American people; $60 billion worth of regulations have been taken off the backs of hard-working Americans and has allowed them to do their jobs easier, allowed them to make ends meet easier, allowed them to breathe easier when it comes to job creation and job opportunity.  I am very glad that we saw the BLM 2.0 rule repealed, which gives our people in Colorado a little bit more of a chance to have a say in what happens in their front yards and their backyards. Of course, the waters of the United States has to continue to be something that we stop as we move forward.  There are other positive steps we should take to give our producers additional regulatory certainty. I know there is more that we can do, and I hope to hear from our Nation's farmers and ranchers and our farmers and ranchers in Colorado on how Congress and the Federal Government can help.  So I use this opportunity to make an appeal to people across the country in order to hear from farmers and ranchers, whether you are in the Eastern Plains of Colorado or on the Western Slope of Colorado or in the great State of Iowa or Kansas or anywhere in between and outside the State of Colorado--inside and outside--of the things that we can be doing, such as with trade policy, regulatory policy, financial services opportunities, making sure we have farm bill programs that are working. Back in my office, we want to hear about these ideas and about thoughts moving forward on these important issues so that we can have an agricultural community that thrives and so that we can make sure that, when we talk about bringing generations of farmers and ranchers back to the farm and the ranch, we will get their ideas on how best to do that.  This week, I will be sending letters to the Colorado Agriculture Council, which is made up of organizations across the agricultural spectrum in Colorado, as well as to Don Brown, who is the commissioner of the Colorado Department of Agriculture, on what else Congress and the Federal Government can do to help support this industry. Also, there is Julie McCaleb, the Colorado Agriculture Council chair.  Basically, I will be writing: Hey, whether it is regulations or legislation, it is important that the administration and Congress understand the impact their policies will have on agriculture. I look forward to hearing from you, your member organizations, and farmers and ranchers throughout the State on how we can work together to ensure Colorado agriculture continues to be effectively represented in  We will be sending this letter, of course, to Commissioner Don Commissioner Brown is from my hometown. He is a corn farmer and a cattleman. He is somebody who understands firsthand the hard work and challenges that go into making ends meet in agriculture. He also understands the suffering that we are seeing in the farmland right now and that some people may be at their wits' end in terms of trying to deal with their financial struggles.  We will be sending these letters out. I encourage people--farmers, ranchers, and leaders in counties--to contact my office and give us their ideas on how we can turn this ``could be coming'' crisis around so that we can actually start improving and growing agriculture again and so that we can make sure that we lead Colorado's diverse agricultural economy into a better state than it is today--in a better place than it is today--in terms of the economy.  Here, in the Senate, I believe that same bipartisan support exists for all of us to be reaching out to our communities and making sure that we hear from the heartland of America what we can do to help struggling farmers and ranchers.  I thank the Senator for her leadership in agriculture.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

13917,topic-id,2055,"Mr.President, I come to the floor once again today to talk about the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme  In the 235 years of our Nation's history with the Constitution, there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court What I mean by that is this: No Supreme Court nominee has ever been rejected by a partisan filibuster on the floor of the Now, sure, we can argue about the 1968 bipartisan attempt to make sure that then-Associate Justice Abe Fortas wasn't elevated to the Chief Justice position.  What this Chamber is facing today isn't a question of whether we will abide by the Biden rule. The Biden rule, of course, was when Joe Biden said: During the last term of the outgoing President, when the office is up for election, we are not going to confirm any nominees. This isn't an argument over whether Chuck Schumer was right when Senator Chuck Schumer said: Heck, over the last couple of years of the Bush administration, we are not going to allow a Justice to be confirmed.  That is not what we are arguing about today. We are arguing about whether a brilliant legal mind, a judge who has proven incredible legal temperament over the last several months since his nomination, a judge who has agreed 97 percent of the time with the majority decisions of the court, should receive an up-or-down vote.  Have no doubt that this is a historic opportunity for this Chamber to come together to prove that we believe in that 230-year precedent of confirming Supreme Court This is an opportunity we have to come together on a judge who just 11 years ago was confirmed unanimously by voice vote. There was no opposition 11 years ago to Judge Gorsuch when he was confirmed to be placed on the Tenth Circuit Court, which is based in Now, the Denver-based court, the Tenth Circuit Court, covers about 20 percent of our Nation's land mass. It is a huge, huge area. This is a court that deals with public lands cases. This is a court that deals with water issues, complex public lands issues, and Tribal issues. This is a judge who has been a part of 2,700 opinions, voting 97 percent of the time with the majority of the court.  Now, the majority of the court aren't all George Bush or George H.Bush or Ronald Reagan nominees. The nominees in the Tenth Circuit Court are bipartisan justices. It is filled with Democratic and Republican appointees. That is the Tenth Circuit Court, with whom Judge Gorsuch has worked. Judge Gorsuch has been somebody known as a feeder judge. A feeder judge is somebody that the Supreme Court--when they are looking to select clerks to help the Justices do their work--looks to, like Judge Gorsuch, to provide them with law clerks to help them at the Supreme They do that because he is an incredible and outstanding jurist, somebody who has the respect on both sides of the aisle, Republican and That is why he is a feeder judge. That is why he was confirmed 11 years ago by a bipartisan body of  In the last couple of weeks, we have seen days' worth of hearings where each Senator has been able to speak for an hour or so, questioning Judge Gorsuch, days' worth of hearings where the American people witnessed as Judge Gorsuch laid out his legal philosophy and his temperament, and where he displayed the even temperament we need on a Supreme Court--the kind of temperament that not only is able to work with colleagues but understand complex legal cases. And 11 years ago his confirmation was so noncontroversial that when it came to his confirmation, Senator Lindsey Graham was the only one who showed up. He was the only one at the confirmation hearing. That is how noncontroversial it was. What a difference a court makes.  Now, let's talk about some of the Senators who supported him, or at least didn't object to him, 11 years ago. Then, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer didn't oppose Judge Gorsuch of the Tenth Circuit Senator Leahy, a member of the Judiciary Committee, did not object to Judge Senator Feinstein, another member of the Judiciary Committee, didn't oppose Neil Senator Durbin, the minority whip, did not oppose Judge Neil Gorsuch 11 years ago. Senator Cantwell, Senator Carper, Senator Menendez, Senator Murray--none of them opposed Judge Gorsuch's confirmation to the Tenth Circuit Senator Nelson, Senator Reed, Senator Stabenow, Senator Wyden--all of them here today. None of them objected to Neil  It is even more than that. Then-Senator Barack Obama did not object to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. Then-Senator Hillary Clinton didn't object to Judge Gorsuch's nomination. Then-Senator Joe Biden helped pass his confirmation, his appointment, and made sure it cleared on a voice vote.  To hear the partisan bickering here is extremely disappointing and disingenuous. So I hope this Chamber will do what we do best in this country, and that is to come together on issues of doing our job of confirming a Supreme Court Justice after spending the past several months complaining that the Supreme Court wasn't filled.  This judge should receive bipartisan support, as he did 11 years ago. I guess the question has to be asked of people who are now opposing Judge Gorsuch today, who either supported or did not object to him 11 years ago: Did they not do their work 11 years ago? Did they not realize he was a bad judge? Or has the time of politics changed? Or are we just dealing with a President whom they have decided they don't want to have a Supreme Court Justice from? I guess that is what has perhaps changed the most over the past 11 years, because there is not really a narrative we can point to for a reason of why they should oppose him, other[[Page S2079]]than people just deciding that the politics of the now require it, and that is incredibly disappointing.  If we look at Judge Gorsuch's statements, he talks about Justice Scalia's vision of the good and faithful judge. I think it is a worthy one that we focus on because of what it means to Judge Gorsuch--soon to be Justice Gorsuch--to be a good and faithful judge:       It seems to me that the separation of legislative and      judicial powers isn't just a formality dictated by the      Neither is it just about ensuring that two      institutions with basically identical functions are balanced      one against the other.       To the founders, the legislative and judicial powers were      distinct by nature and their separation was among the most      important liberty-protecting devices of constitutional      design, an independent right of the people essential to the      preservation of all other rights later enumerated in the      Constitution and its amendments.       Now consider . . . if we allowed the judge to act like a      legislature. Unconstrained by the bicameralism and      presentment hurdles of Article I, the judge would need only      his own vote, or those of just a few colleagues, to revise      the law willy-nilly in accordance with his preferences and      the task of legislating would become a relatively simple      thing.       Notice, too, how hard it would be to revise this so-easily-     made judicial legislation to account for changes in the world      or to fix mistakes. Unable to throw judges out of office in      regular elections, you'd have to wait for them to die before      you'd have any chance of change. And even then you'd find      change difficult, for courts cannot so easily undo their      errors given the weight they afford precedent.       Notice finally how little voice the people would be left in      a government where life-appointed judges are free to      legislate alongside elected representatives.       The very idea of self-government would seem to wither to      the point of pointlessness.       Indeed, it seems that for reasons just like these Hamilton      explained that ``liberty can have nothing to fear from the      judiciary alone,'' but that it ``ha[s] everything to fear      from [the] union'' of the judicial and legislative powers. .      . .  That is the explanation that Judge Gorsuch has given to Justice Scalia's good and faithful judge--a judge who believes that the judicial branch is the guardian of the Constitution to take a decision or a question before them to the place the law leads them to, not to the place where politics sends them or politics demands them or personal opinions and beliefs dictate.  We have heard Judge Gorsuch say he believes that a judge who personally believes or agrees with every opinion he reaches is probably a bad judge. It is because Judge Gorsuch knows that once you put on the robe, you don't follow your personal opinion. You follow the law. That is the guarding of the Constitution that the Federalist Papers talked about.  So that is the kind of nominee we are dealing with--a nominee who understands the separation of powers and who understands the role of the judiciary, the role of the legislative branch, and the role of the executive. In fact, he believes that the executive branch has been empowered too greatly and that we should once again have separate but equal branches of government balanced in power.  I think that is a good judge to place on the Court--a judge who is clearly mainstream, a judge who clearly has the temperament to work with colleagues to make our country proud.  Certainly as a fourth-generation Coloradan, I am very excited Judge Gorsuch has been nominated by the In addition to the bipartisan support Judge Gorsuch received here 11 years ago, he also has tremendous bipartisan support back home in In fact, I have a letter here from Jim Lyons, who was a personal friend and lawyer for President Bill It is a letter to Senator Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dated February 7, 2017.       I write this letter in strong support of the nomination and      confirmation of Neil Gorsuch for Associate Justice of the      Supreme  He ends his letter with this:       Judge Gorsuch's intellect, energy and deep regard for the      Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked      with him and seen first-hand his commitment to basic      principles. Above all, his independence, fairness and      impartiality are the hallmarks of his career and his well-     earned reputation.  The former Governor of Colorado, Democrat Bill Ritter, supports the confirmation of Judge Neil  Eleven years ago, then-Senator Ken Salazar spoke very highly of his temperament, saying in 2006 that Judge Gorsuch met the ``very high test'' required of someone to be a ``great judge'' and that he has ``demonstrated a dedication to fairness, impartiality, precedent and avoidance of judicial activism--from both the left and the right.''  The Denver Post editorial board, which came out in support of Hillary Clinton, argued for Neil Gorsuch's nomination, saying: ``A justice who does his best to interpret the Constitution or statute and apply the law of the land without prejudice could go far to restore faith in the highest court of the land.''  Neal Katyal, former personnel in the Obama administration, stated his support for Neil Gorsuch: ``I am confident Neil Gorsuch will live up to that promise'' to ``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''  The Washington Post editorial board, many others in Colorado's legal community, including the former cochair of the Host Committee of the Democratic National Convention in 2008, support the confirmation of Neil This is not a partisan judicial appointment; this is a judge who has strong bipartisan support from the people who know him best.  I hope we can live up to that high, noble intention of our Constitution, the purpose of the Senate, to make sure we are confirming somebody to do a lifetime service for this country in a way that respects our Constitution and the people of this country.  I hope that over the next several days as we debate the nomination, we will move away from this cliff of changing two centuries' worth of precedent in this body and instead come together in a way that befits the best nature of our country.

If we don't do it when it involves interstate commerce, then nobody else has the authority to go across State lines.  I also thank the FCC Commissioner Pai, who I understand will soon be the chairman, for all his efforts because he truly participated.  We found out that there is really no cost. If we pass this law such as it is, then the companies that produce these phones would just set the default position so that when someone dials 911, it goes straight to an emergency operator without having to dial a prefix, whether it is 7, 9, 3, whatever. So there is no cost in that. It is just telling them how to do the default.  What about existing lines?  And then we found from people that have installed these multiphone lines that, actually, if somebody calls and says, ``Hey, we need to get our phone system reset so you can dial 911 and it goes straight through,'' everyone that we have talked to that was in that business said, ``Oh, we will come make that switch for free.''  So we knew we had a bill here, we had a law--it goes across party lines, it goes across bicameral lines--we had an opportunity to pass a bill.  I am grateful to Senator Klobuchar in the Senate and all the bipartisan support there. As my friend, Mr.Doyle, pointed out, there is another push. Let's identify exactly where someone is within that multiline system. That will cost money.  There are some that have said: Look, if there is somebody that is making a secret call, they don't want the bad guys figuring out where the call is coming from.  So there are other issues involved here, but we have a bill that will save lives and it is agreeable across the aisle. It passed this manner in the past It will pass this way again today. So I urge not only our friends here in the House, but also my friends in the Senate, please pass this bill that we all agree on, save lives, and then let's have a full and thorough debate on the part that will cost money. We have some mom and pop hotels that say: If you make us buy a new phone system, the one we have won't be able to identify which room is making the call. You make us add to that, we are already in trouble. We are barely getting by. Please don't add more costs to what we are struggling to pay as it is.  Let's have that debate in a separate bill. Go in and pass this noncontroversial one for Kari's sake and for the sake of all of those that would come into the same situation. Let's just pass this bill. Kari, as her father and her daughters have said, will then not have died for nothing. Her loss of life will save lives in the future.  Again, I thank my friend, Mr.What a great American, the way he pursues matters of conscience. I appreciate again my friend across the aisle, Mr. I urge passage of this bill now, today.

13782,topic-id,1196,"Madam President, last evening, I had the pleasure of being at the White House when President Trump introduced his nominee to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who happens to be serving on the Tenth Circuit Court of It shouldn't surprise anybody that President Trump delivered on a promise made during the campaign, when he listed 21 people he would choose from. Everybody knew ahead of time what sort of a judge he would put on for this vacancy or any future vacancy.  Judge Gorsuch's decade of service on the Tenth Circuit has earned him a reputation as a brilliant, principled, and mainstream judge, just exactly the sort of mainstream that Senator Schumer must have been thinking about when he said he wants a mainstream judge.  It has already been widely reported that he was unanimously confirmed by a voice vote to the Tenth Circuit in 2006.  There are still 31 Senators in this body who voted for the judge at that particular time; 12 of them are Democrats, and one of them is Senator Judge Gorsuch was supported, of course, by both of his home State Senators for the Tenth One happened to be a Republican, and one a He has been recognized as a great jurist by Members from both parties. For instance, when he was sworn into the Tenth Circuit, Senator Salazar, then a Democratic Senator from Colorado, remarked that the judge ``has a sense of fairness and impartiality that is a keystone of being a judge.''  The judge happens to be fourth generation He is eminently qualified to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme His decades of experience span many facets of our legal system. A graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, the judge was also a prestigious Marshall scholar at He served as Principal Deputy Attorney General at the Department of  Judge Gorsuch also knows the Supreme Court well, having clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and also Anthony Kennedy, who is still on the Court.[[Page S544]]  He currently serves with distinction on the Tenth Circuit, where he has established himself as a mainstream judge with a reputation as a fair and brilliant jurist. As a mainstream jurist, Judge Gorsuch enjoys broad respect across the ideological spectrum. At the confirmation hearing for his current judgeship on the Tenth Circuit, he was introduced by Republican Senator Allard from Colorado and Democratic Senator Salazar from Senator Salazar, of course, isn't exactly a conservative firebrand, having most recently served as head of the transition team of Secretary  At his hearing in 2006, William Hughes, Jr., a Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives, authored a strong letter of recommendation for Judge Gorsuch stating:       I have never found, nor thought, Neil's views or opinions      to be tainted or swayed by any partisan leanings. Quite to      the contrary, his approach to all things professional and      personal has always been moderate and practical.  There are plenty of other examples of strong bipartisan support for Judge Even observers in the press recognize his reputation for fairness. Just last week the Denver Post endorsed the judge, saying: He ``has applied the law fairly and consistently.''  Judge John Kane, a colleague on the District Court of Colorado, appointed by President Carter, says this about Judge Gorsuch:       [He] listens well and decides justly. His dissents are      instructive rather than vitriolic. In sum, I think he is an      excellent judicial craftsman.  After his nomination was announced last evening, the highest praise so far came from President Obama's former Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, who described the nominee this way:       Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant      judges to have served our nation over the last century. As a      judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve      the rule of law. To boot, as those of us who have worked with      him can attest, he is a wonderfully decent and humane person.      I strongly support his nomination to the Supreme  To me, following the law wherever that law and case may lead is perhaps the most important attribute for a Supreme Court Justice to possess. That principle guided Justice Scalia's decisionmaking and it is also how Judge Gorsuch has said judges should approach the law.  The judge once wrote, quoting Justice Scalia:       If you are going to be a good and faithful judge, you have      to resign yourself to the fact that you are not always going      to like the conclusion you reach. If you like them all the      time, you are probably doing something wrong.  That gets back to something very basic. A judge is supposed to be dispassionate. A judge is supposed to leave their personal views out of it. A judge looks at the law on the one hand and the facts of the case on the other and makes the decision based on just those two things. So from what I have learned so far, the judge's judicial record reflects this philosophy of being dispassionate, following the Constitution and the laws passed by I think he said last night something like this: A judge is supposed to judge and a legislature is supposed to legislate, and a judge should not be legislating.  Judge Gorsuch doesn't legislate from the bench, nor does he impose his own beliefs on others. To quote from a speech at Case Western, he said that judges should strive ``to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to the text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be--not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.''  I believe it is this fundamental sense of fairness and sense of duty in upholding the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress that has led Judge Gorsuch to be a highly regarded jurist.  After the tragic passing of Justice Scalia, we made it clear that the Senate would wait for the American people to have a say in the future of the I said even before the election that no matter who won the Presidential election, we would move forward with the new President's nominee. I maintained this position even on the eve of the election, and I maintained that position even when everyone seemed to believe that our next President would be Secretary I have been consistent.  Unfortunately, some of my Democratic colleagues--the very Senators who held all those rallies chanting ``we need nine''--have already said they intend to do everything they can to stop this eminently qualified judge. That is very, very unfortunate. I hope and trust that approach won't be uniform on their side.  So I look forward to moving forward with a hearing, when we will learn a great deal more about Judge Gorsuch, and I look forward to an up-or-down vote on his nomination.  I thank the Senate, and I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

13896,topic-id,1889,"Mr.President, I have been very interested in the minority leader's comments here this morning. I have high regard for him. We have worked together on a wide variety of issues, but I have to say that he is leading a party right now that is doing completely the opposite of what Democrats have done in the past when Republicans have had the Presidency and have had the privilege of appointing people to the Frankly, it has become kind of a war that we really don't need and something that literally, I think, is demeaning to the Senate and to this country.  I venture to say that it would be very difficult for anybody to find a better nominee for the Supreme Court than Neil I can't say that the Heritage Foundation was the one that carried the weight with regard to the choice of Neil Now, the Federalist Society did weigh in rather heavily, and there were around 21 absolutely top judges and lawyers who were on that list. I venture to say that anybody would have a very difficult time finding anything to criticize about that list other than on a partisan basis. Unfortunately for the Democrats, they lost the election.  Now keep in mind, all the current majority leader was saying was that we just weren't going to go with a Supreme Court Justice during an intensely hard-fought Presidential election year. In this century, that has been the rule.  The majority leader, Senator McConnell, knew that it was very likely, in the eyes of almost every pollster, that Hillary Clinton would win, and although he and I believed that nominee was a good, reasonable, moderate Democrat, we were quite sure that if Hillary got elected, she would not pick him. We were even working on trying to find a way so that she would have to pick him rather than pick another totally leftwing person for the  Unfortunately for the Democrats, Donald Trump proved to be a formidable candidate for President and won the election and, interestingly enough, as is his right as President, nominated Neil Gorsuch for the U.Supreme  Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, I would venture to say that it would be very difficult to find any candidate for the Supreme Court in this century who is any better than Neil Gorsuch is going to apply the law as written, not as he conjures up his ideas of what it should be. He is not going to do that. He is going to apply the law as written. He did that as a circuit court of appeals judge on the Tenth Circuit, my circuit. You would be hard-pressed to find a better qualified person. In fact, I do not think you could find a better qualified person for the Supreme Court than Neil  So what is all the whining about? They lost the election. They knew that this was going to be a big deal if they won and that the Republicans would pretty well have to go along with whomever they chose, but President Trump won the election, and he has a right to pick who should go on the Supreme In this case, I think he picked the most qualified person in the country for the Yes, he is conservative. Yes, he came up the hard way. Yes, he is not likely to be a liberal on the Court, but I would have to say that anybody this President would choose would not likely be a liberal on the In this case, the President chose one of the leading people in this country, one of the greatest lawyers in this country, one of the finest judges in this country, who has a record of working with Democrats on the bench, to become his choice for the U.Supreme  I know what is wrong with the Democrats on this. They lost, and it is a hard thing for them, and I do not blame them. It is a hard thing because they were so sure they would control this nominee to the Supreme Court and probably two to five more had Hillary Clinton been elected for two terms. But that is not the way the American people chose to vote.  I commend the American people for realizing that these things are very important. I have to say, in that last election, probably the single most important issue that drove it toward Donald Trump was, who is going to pick the Justices to the U.Supreme Court?  Republicans know and President Trump knows that he is not going to be able to put ideologues on the Court, and Neil Gorsuch is anything but an ideologue. He is as fine a judge as we have in this country, albeit conservative in nature. He has as fine an academic background as anybody on the Court--ever. On top of all of that, he is a terrific human being, a good husband, father, and a terrific judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of  To be honest with you, I thought it was really nice to have somebody picked from the West who might bring a western perspective of freedom into the judicial system, and I have no doubt that Neil Gorsuch will do that. To make this a big political issue, it seems to me, is beyond the pale, and it does bother me a great deal.  On another matter, Mr.President, by any measure, our efforts in this Congress to repeal harmful regulations through the Congressional Review Act have been historic. Prior to this year, only one CRA resolution--Congressional Review Act resolution--had ever been passed by Congress and signed by the We are an overregulated country like never before. This year, we have already successfully rolled back 11 regulations that were proposed and finalized under the previous administration. That is truly remarkable. I think our success in this endeavor can be attributed to a few factors.  First, in its last year, the Obama administration was particularly aggressive in its regulatory efforts. A number of regulations were finalized after the election, right up until the day President Trump was inaugurated. In fact, the regulation at issue today was finalized on January 19, the day before the inauguration. In other words, the Obama administration left Congress[[Page S2059]]and the new administration with a target-rich environment for CRA resolutions. There is no doubt what they were doing: They were scrambling to get as many changes as they could instead of allowing the new administration to take over.  Another important factor has been the realization by the American people that our economy--our workers, our businesses--is grossly overregulated. The regulatory state extracts hundreds of billions of dollars from our economy, much of it needlessly so. These CRA resolutions are part of a much broader effort to undo some of that damage.  Today I am pleased to be able to express my support for H.67, which will likely be the 12th CRA resolution we will pass this year. This resolution, once passed and signed, will roll back a last-second Department of Labor regulation that eliminated longstanding Federal protections for the retirement savings of private sector workers.  Specifically, the regulation builds off of a prior regulation that gave States a ``safe harbor'' from the protections workers have under ERISA if the government mandates that employers who do not offer retirement plans either set one up or join the government plan. These government-run plans do not have to be portable, nor do they have to permit workers to withdraw their savings at any time.  The resolution we are debating now would roll back the regulation that provided this authority to municipalities, such as New York Hopefully, sometime soon, the Senate will also debate and pass the CRA resolution relating to the original regulation, the one that focused on States, like California and  Combined, these regulations encourage State and municipal governments to impose conflicting and burdensome mandates on private sector businesses and to bar private workers' access to their retirement accounts, and they would let States invest private workers' retirement assets, ignoring provisions in Federal pension law that require prudent pension investment practices and that ban kickbacks and self-dealing. Think about that.  To be blunt, places like New York City should not just get a pass on investing potentially billions of dollars in private worker retirement assets without regard to Federal rules that require prudent investment practices--rules designed to protect the retirement nest eggs of hard-working  Now, do not get me wrong--I am all for increasing coverage for employees in workplace retirement programs. In fact, it is something I have been working on for some time with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  Last Congress, the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair, unanimously approved the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act of 2016, which is a bipartisan bill that will increase voluntary retirement savings. It includes a number of provisions from a bill I introduced a few years before that, one that received high marks from analysts and stakeholders in the retirement-security community. My bill and others like it provide workable, voluntary solutions to give more workers access to retirement plans. This approach is far better than the one taken by the Obama administration and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, which would purposefully take us down the path toward government-mandated and government-run retirement plans.  The retirement savings system that has been in place for decades now is one of the clearest examples we have to demonstrate the superiority of the free market over government mandates. Private retirement savings vehicles, including 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts, which have been encouraged but not mandated by Federal tax laws, have produced nearly $14 trillion--that is trillion dollars--in wealth and savings for the middle class.  I know some have concerns about the federalism implications in rolling back these Department of Labor regulations. However, let's be clear: Prior to the implementation of these regulations, States were free to pass laws to encourage retirement savings opportunities for private sector workers, and they will be free to do so after this CRA resolution is signed by President They will simply have to observe the longstanding rules and protections that have been in place under Federal pension laws, including the ban on self-dealing and the duty to invest prudently, and they will not be able to offer plans on an uneven playing field that favors government retirement plans over those produced in a free, private sector market.  Unfortunately, I have to wonder why States and municipalities want to do away with these protections in the first place. I also have to wonder why they think they will be able to produce better results than the private retirement savings system, which thus far has been an unqualified success, benefiting workers and employers alike. I also have to wonder how some of my colleagues who value consumer financial protection, as I do, would want to see the continuation of rules that erode protections for workers and future retirees.  The first step in undoing these harmful regulations is with the passage of H.67. Toward that end, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

13923,topic-id,2152,"Mr.President, I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for the wonderful remarks he has made. They are right on point.  Last week's Judiciary Committee hearing on Judge Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination made two things abundantly clear. The first is that Judge Neil Gorsuch is a superb, highly qualified nominee. Second, with the possibility of the first partisan filibuster in the history of a Supreme Court nominee, I have come to the conclusion that some Democrats would do almost anything to keep us from having an impartial, independent judiciary.  As I explained at the start of the hearing last week, qualifications for judicial service include both legal experience and judicial philosophy. Legal experience looks at the nominee's past accomplishments in the law, while judicial philosophy anticipates the nominee's future judicial service.  Judge Gorsuch's legal experience is among the most impressive that I have seen in my 40 years on the Judiciary He is truly an impressive man. This is no doubt why the American Bar Association easily and unanimously gave Judge Gorsuch its highest ``well qualified'' rating, the highest rating it can give. I certainly have had my differences with the ABA, because at times they appear to let political or ideological considerations influence their rating. I mention their rating now because my Democrat colleagues, including Senators Leahy and Schumer, have called the ABA's rating ``the gold standard'' for evaluating judicial nominees.  The ABA testified about their rating at last week's hearing, explaining that they sought input from more than 5,000 people throughout the legal world who would have personal knowledge about Judge That is about as broad a group as I have ever heard of. They assembled 40 scholars and nationally recognized Supreme Court practitioners to review his judicial opinions, other writings, and speeches. The ABA's 1,000-page report concluded that Judge Gorsuch meets the ``very high standards of integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.''  Editorial boards across America took notice as Judge Gorsuch demonstrated such qualities to everyone.  The Denver Post said that Judge Gorsuch ``possesses the fairness, independence, and opened-mindedness necessary to make him a marvelous addition to the Supreme Court.''  The Detroit News said that Judge Gorsuch ``is proving himself an even tempered, deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the Senate.''  The Chicago Tribune said that Judge Gorsuch's critics ``suggest that they fear Gorsuch won't follow the law, but the opposite is more true. They fear he will. Gorsuch should be confirmed.''  The second and more important qualification for judicial service is the nominee's judicial philosophy or his understanding of the power and proper role of judges in our system of government. This is ground zero in the conflict over the appointment of judges. America's Founders were clear about their design for the judicial branch as part of the system of government they established. Central in this design is the separation of powers. Government power is divided among three branches and is supposed to stay that way. As a result, what the legislature does in making law is designed to be different than what the judiciary does in interpreting and applying that law. This design for government is necessary for the liberty that we all enjoy. Change the design and sacrifice the liberty it makes possible.  Specifically for our purpose today, this design provides the job description for judges. They interpret and apply written laws such as statutes and the Constitution to decide cases, and they must do so impartially, deliberately removing their own views, preferences, or agendas from the judicial equation. That is exactly the kind of Justice that Neil Gorsuch will be and has been. Professor Jonathan Turley, a well-known constitutional law expert, told the Judiciary Committee that, like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch has a well-defined judicial philosophy with a record of well-considered writings both as a judge and as an author. In short, concluded Professor Turley, ``we have a very good idea of who Judge Gorsuch is and the type of Justice he will be.'' He will be an impartial Justice who takes the law as he finds it, applies it objectively to decide cases, and leaves the decision about changing the law to the people and their elected representatives.  This brings me to the second thing that the Judiciary Committee hearing revealed last week. I said at the start of the hearing that the confirmation process reveals the kind of judge that Senators want to see appointed. And it certainly did. Judge Gorsuch's opponents seem determined to oppose an impartial and independent judiciary. In fact, it looks to me like they want the opposite--a judiciary that is partial and dependent. They want judges to decide cases with deliberate regard to the parties and with determined attention to the political interests that their decisions will promote.  This is the 14th Supreme Court confirmation process in which I have participated, and I cannot remember Senators opposing more strongly the basic notion that judges must impartially apply the law.  It is important to point out, of course, that Democrats' objection to judicial independence has, to be charitable, not always been consistent. In 2009, for example, Senator Schumer introduced Justice Sonya Sotomayor to the Judiciary Committee for her confirmation hearing. Senator Schumer was a distinguished member of the committee at the time. He praised Justice Sotomayor for, as he described it, carefully applying the law even when it meant ruling against ``so-called sympathetic litigants.'' That was then. This is now. Last week, Democrats turned the Schumer standard on its head, cherry-picking a few of Judge Gorsuch's thousands of cases to criticize him for ruling against sympathetic litigants.  Every Federal judge takes an oath to administer justice without respect to persons and to discharge his judicial[[Page S2083]]duties impartially. The ABA's Model Code of Judicial Conduct spells out that this includes a duty not to make commitments about issues that may come up in future cases.  When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared before the Judiciary Committee in 1993, she took a firm stand. She said: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.''  Every Supreme Court nominee of either party has taken this same position. To me, this simply shows how much these nominees, most of whom are sitting judges already, care about their impartiality and the fairness it provides to litigants.  I think it would baffle our fellow citizens to suggest that judges should, in effect, prejudge cases before they even come up or publicly take sides on issues that could later require their judicial decision. Our constituents would think it crazy to say that judges should not keep an open mind or that judges need not be impartial.  Today, however, Democrats say they will oppose Judge Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination unless he spells out those views, unless he provides those same forecasts and previews. In other words, Democrats consider the impartiality they applauded in Justice Ginsburg to be a liability in Judge To most people, fairness, openmindedness, and impartiality are qualities we need in our judges. To some Democrats, they are obstacles to be overcome, I might say, on the way to a fully politicized judiciary. What do my Democratic colleagues have to fear from judges who are truly impartial? I mean, I don't see where the argument really is.  Another tactic last week was to talk about people who had not been nominated and who were not even in the room. Committee Democrats, for example, talked about President Trump and a few of his advisers more than 80 times over just 3 days. They also decried the efforts of grassroots activists working on behalf of Judge Gorsuch's nomination. It mattered not that the nominee had no connection whatsoever with those particular efforts. No, Democrats warned of the ``extreme special interest groups'' that supposedly advised the President about filling this Supreme Court vacancy. They talked about so-called ``dark money'' contributed to such groups by undisclosed donors.  I would not go so far as to directly accuse anyone of hypocrisy or of changing their tune based on ideology or political party. I would not do that. I would observe, however, that one group invited by Democrats to testify against the Gorsuch nomination was particularly vocal about condemning ``big money corrupting our politics.'' It turns out that this group was cited by the Center for Public Integrity in January as an opponent of dark money even though the group itself accepts shadowy funds and refuses to fully disclose its own donors.  Next week, the Judiciary Committee will report the Gorsuch nomination to the Senate floor, where the same tactics will be in full view. Democrats are already claiming that the threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees is 60 votes. Where did they get that from? They may wish this were the rule, at least for Republican nominees, but they know that is not true. They know it.  Democrats have been playing this game for years, embracing one standard when it suits them, only to do an about-face later. It may be just a coincidence, but the flip-flopping follows an eerily similar pattern to election cycles when different parties control the White But, like I said, that may be just a coincidence.  What I do know is that Senator Schumer voted 25 times to filibuster judicial nominees of President George Then, when nomination filibusters had declined under President Obama, he voted to abolish them. Now, with a Republican in the White House, he is back on the filibuster train. He was against judicial filibusters before he was for them before he was against them.  Why not have a vigorous debate followed by an up-or-down vote? The 1987 nomination of Robert Bork was controversial, yet there was no cloture vote, even though he was defeated. The 1991 nomination of Clarence Thomas was controversial, yet there was no cloture vote, even though he was confirmed.  Republicans have never even attempted a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Most recently, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid said in 2010 that he would file cloture on the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Republican leaders, including our former colleague Senator Jeff Sessions, told him that filing cloture would be completely unnecessary.  The truth is that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been defeated by a partisan filibuster. The only reason Democrats are choosing to push us in that direction is that their leftwing groups have told them to do so.  Judge Gorsuch's approach to judging empowers the American people and their elected representatives. It does so by taking seriously what they do. He takes the words of the statutes they enact and the Constitution they established as having substance and actually meaning what they say. That is the respect that our system of separated branches requires that each give the other.  Last week's hearing confirmed for all to see that Judge Gorsuch has the legal experience and judicial philosophy and temperament to make him fully qualified to serve on the Supreme It also exposed the fact that some of my colleagues see an impartial and independent judiciary as a threat rather than as an indispensable support for our liberty.  I have been kind of shocked at the turnaround by some of our Democratic colleagues--not all of them but some of them--that how, if it is their judgeship nominee, these rules do not apply that they are now trying to apply to Judge  I have seen a lot of nominees in my day and an awful lot of nominees to the Supreme I have never seen one any better than Judge Neil He is totally prepared for the job. He is an outstanding lawyer with great experience. He is a brilliant judge, someone who will enhance the Supreme Court and not deteriorate it, who deserves to be on the Supreme Thank goodness the President has seen fit to put him there.  I hope our colleagues will think it through because we should not be politicizing these judgeships like has been done recently. Frankly, we should never politicize the Supreme Court nomination process. It is not just because the President is a Republican; it is because that is the way I have always approached it. I think that is the way most everybody in this body has always approached it.  I hope people will think it through and vote for Neil He deserves their vote.

In essence, this selfish and bully-like mentality abandon the values that we hold dear and which have defined our great Nation as a global power.  It should come as no surprise that President Trump's nominees to be our Nation's top diplomats--Nikki Haley, Rex Tillerson--have no diplomatic experience. On Nikki Haley's first day on the job, President Trump announced that he would be cutting funding for the United Nations by 40 percent, and Ambassador Haley announced to the world that the United States is now ``taking names'' of those who disagree with us.  In an attempt to show strength, the Trump administration is actually creating weakness. By stepping away from multinational organizations that we helped establish--organizations like the U.and NATO--and by presenting a hostile attitude to other countries and allies, the United States is walking away from its role as the indispensable  This morning, former CIA Director and retired GEN David Petraeus warned that the global alliances of the United States are at risk, stating:       Americans should not take the current international order      for granted. It did not will itself into existence. We      created it.       Likewise, it is not naturally self-sustaining. We have      sustained it. If we stop doing so, it will fray and,      eventually, collapse.  Just as I am not confident in President Trump's nominee for Ambassador to the United Nations, I am equally concerned, if not more so, about his choice for Secretary of During his Senate confirmation hearing, Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, demonstrated that he is blatantly unaware of global affairs. He failed to recognize and condemn human rights violations around the world, including in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, and declared dangerous policy positions without knowing what those policies would actually mean.  In his hearing, Mr.Tillerson repeatedly avoided answering the most rudimentary questions about foreign policy by stating things like ``I'd need more information on that issue.''  For as long as I can remember, throughout grade school and college, women in Saudi Arabia have lacked basic freedoms. Yet Mr.Tillerson either had no knowledge of women's issues in Saudi Arabia or fails to value the importance of that issue, which I believe to be an American value.  The United States faces an increasing number of global threats, including North Korea, Russia, China, Iran, and terrorist organizations across multiple continents. We face evolving threats from nonstate actors and terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic Instability and civil war in the Middle East have led to the greatest global refugee crisis since World War Russia and China are acting aggressively to assert their influence and challenge and provoke American interests and allies. Global threats such as pandemic disease, nuclear proliferation, and climate change require international cooperation and responses.  The next Secretary of State will be diving headfirst into all of these incredibly daunting and gravely important foreign policy challenges. Mr.Tillerson's lack of foreign policy experience, combined with a President who promotes an isolationist world view, leaves me deeply concerned for the future of American foreign policy.  The world looks to America to uphold human rights, to promote democratic values, and to take the lead on many challenges we face as an international community. The American people look to the White House and to the State Department to represent our fundamental American values on that international stage. The American people expect their leaders to show that their only interest is in representing the public's best interest.  Americans have reason to doubt where Rex Tillerson's interests rest. His world view has been shaped through the lens of looking out for what is best for his company's profits, not what is best for the American people, not what is best to address complex international challenges. Just like negotiating a real estate deal does not prepare one to lead the Nation, negotiating oil deals does not prepare you to be a diplomat whose primary interest is in advocating for American values.  When Mr.Tillerson has worked with foreign governments to pursue lucrative oil deals and profits, he has been agnostic to human rights and to America's diplomatic and security interests as well. As Exxon's CEO during the Iraq war, Mr.Tillerson undermined the State Department's efforts to keep Iraq cohesive as a nation and instead served the interest of his company's financial gain, in direct conflict to the American interest.  Under Mr.Tillerson's guidance, ExxonMobil signed a deal directly with the Kurdish administration in the country's northern region, a move that fueled Kurdish secessionist ambitions and undercut the legitimacy of Iraq's central government. This deal was drawn despite the State Department's recommendation that they wait until national legislation was passed because a law governing nationwide oil investments was being reviewed by  In Russia, Mr.Tillerson worked closely with Vladimir Putin's government to forge deals to drill for oil in the Arctic, the Black Sea, and Mr.Tillerson developed such a cozy relationship with the Kremlin that in 2013 he was awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin, the highest honor awarded to non- After Russia unlawfully invaded the Ukraine and took Crimea, the United States and the European Union enacted sanctions against Russia that Mr.Tillerson would be partly responsible for overseeing as Secretary of Right now, when we are trying to hold Russia accountable for its illegal aggression in Eastern Europe, for its war crimes in Aleppo, and for its interference in our own Nation's election, how on Earth can we trust someone with such a cozy relationship with the Putin government to be our Secretary of State?  Mr.Tillerson's record also leads one to wonder how he will address the imperative to implement the Paris climate agreement, especially since President Trump is now exploring how to withdraw from it. At the height of the debate on climate change legislation in Congress, Mr.Tillerson spent tens of millions of dollars to kill a bill that would have reduced our carbon emissions sooner. It has also been reported that his scientists at Exxon have known about the relationship between carbon emissions and climate since the 1980s and that Exxon even made business decisions about what resources to develop and how based on that knowledge. Yet, under Mr.Tillerson's leadership, they chose to withhold those findings and fund[[Page S547]]groups determined to sow confusion and doubt. How can we be confident that Mr.Tillerson will help America address the impacts of climate change and put America's security and values first as our top diplomat?  Those conflicts of interest are troubling enough, but the most troubling reason I cannot support Mr.Tillerson's nomination is this: In just the first week and a half of the Trump White House, we have seen numerous cases of Trump nominees saying one thing during their confirmation hearings before this body and then the administration turning around and doing something entirely different. After Secretary Mattis told us that he opposed the Muslim travel ban and Director Pompeo stated his opposition in hearings to torture, we saw this administration move forward with both.  I have seen nothing that shows me that Rex Tillerson will stand up to President Trump's dangerous vision for American foreign policy. What will he do to stand up for NATO? What indication do we have that he will call on the President to act in the interests of the American people and not the interests of President Trump's business holdings in numerous nations around the world?  The Secretary of State sits on the National Security Will Mr.Tillerson stand up to Steve Bannon, President Trump's political strategist who has been outrageously placed on the National Security Council, while, I would add, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Director of National Intelligence were demoted? President Trump has shown that he trusts the former leader of the far-right Web site Breitbart News more than our leading generals and his appointed leader of the intelligence community. You can already see the influence of Mr.Bannon, who has made a career out of selling hateful and divisive propaganda aimed at women, Hispanics, African Americans, Jews, and other minorities in the actions President Trump has taken in his first days in office.  During his first week in office, President Trump floated the idea of bringing back the CIA's use of ``black site'' prisons and torture techniques, imposed a gag order on our Federal agencies, and renewed talk of a wall on our southern border.  All of this culminated with an Executive order blocking refugees from around the world from entering the United This is not greatness. In fact, this is un-I will not stand aside as the values that created the greatest Nation on Earth are trampled upon.  This dangerous Executive action has already had a clear human impact. In New Mexico, the Albuquerque Journal reports that our universities have issued an advisory to foreign students and faculty: ``Don't leave the country if you want to come back.'' Think about that.  My office has already heard from New Mexicans who fear for their safety and the safety of their families abroad as a direct result of this order. A man who moved to the United States as a refugee from Iraq and settled in my hometown told me that his wife and two kids went to Baghdad to attend his mother-in-law's funeral. They are currently in Iraq and scheduled to return in They are all green card holders. They are part of our community. President Trump's Executive order has left him and his family feeling in limbo. He said: ``I am afraid about our destiny as a family, I am afraid I will lose them.''  The heartbreaking human impact we have already seen is only part of why the Muslim travel ban was such an appalling action for the President to take.  George Washington once said: ``I had always hoped that this land might become a safe & agreeable Asylum to the virtuous & persecuted part of mankind, to whatever nation they might belong.'' It is very clear that President Trump is clearly no George This Executive order flies in the face of that sentiment and, I believe, the sentiment we share as  I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump about this order. I am particularly outraged about the absurd and careless nature of the order, which will have a profound effect on many Iraqi men and women who risked their lives and the lives of their families on behalf of our soldiers, on behalf of American soldiers.  Late last summer, I traveled to Iraq, to Kuwait, to the heart of Africa, and I met with top military officials to discuss operations against ISIL, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations. In order to find a lasting solution in that volatile region, we must take a smart approach that provides training, resources, and support to our regional allies, like the Iraqi security forces, rather than putting tens of thousands of U.troops on the frontlines there ourselves. Alienating our regional allies, alienating Muslims as a whole puts all of that at risk.  Former Cabinet Secretaries, senior government officials, diplomats, military servicemembers, and intelligence community professionals who have served in the Bush administration and the Obama administration together have expressed their deep concern this week with President Trump's Executive order. In a letter, they warned:       This Order not only jeopardizes tens of thousands of lives,      it has caused a crisis right here in America and will do      long-term damage to our national security.       In the middle of the night, just as we were beginning our      nation's commemoration of the Holocaust, dozens of refugees      onboard flights to the United States and thousands of      visitors were swept up in an Order of unprecedented scope,      apparently with little to no oversight or input from national      security professionals.  Also this week, the Iraqi Parliament, in direct response to President Trump's Muslim travel ban, voted to implement an identical visa ban on  How can we possibly think this is in our national security interests?  Rex Tillerson has not answered questions about President Trump's Muslim travel ban. Mr.Tillerson needs to tell us where he stands on this un-American policy. If we are going to move forward on his nomination, Mr.Tillerson needs to reassure the American people and he needs to reassure this body that he understands the repercussions of these kinds of appalling actions. He needs to show us that he will stand up for American values and against the President's dangerous impulses that will isolate our Nation, alienate our allies, and abdicate our role as leader of the free world. Mr.Tillerson has not shown any of that to me, to this body, or to the American public.  Thousands of New Mexicans have flooded my office with letters, emails, and phone calls urging me to oppose his nomination. I share New Mexicans' well-founded concerns about Mr.Tillerson's qualifications to lead the State Department and to stand up for our Nation's interests.  I will not support his nomination, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stop and think carefully about this vote we are about to take. Our Nation's future role in the world is at stake.  ",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS541-4.txt,1937,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,1.0,January
13914,topic-id,1586,"Mr.President, I appreciate the comments my colleague from Colorado has made on energy. I have an energy speech here, also. We have the same goals, maybe coming from different perspectives, but both the Senator from Colorado and I are trying to achieve the same thing.  I appreciate his hard work. He and I have worked well together over the years on the Finance Committee, as he mentioned, with the investment tax credits to make alternative energy viable products and industries in both of our States and across this country, so I appreciate his hard work.  Mr.President, I come to the floor of the U.Senate today to discuss an issue that is extremely important to the State of Nevada, and that is Yucca  For over 30 years, those two words, ``Yucca Mountain,'' have incited frustration and anger for Nevadans across my It is not just a mountain 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas; it represents a decade-long fight by some in Washington to ``wrong Nevada.''  In 1982, the Congress approved the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and charged the Department of Energy with finding a long-term storage site for the disposal of spent nuclear material. At the time, Yucca Mountain was one of the many proposed geological sites to investigate.  Unfortunately, in 1987, the act was amended to concentrate only on one place, Yucca Nevada, a State without any nuclear powerplants, was legally compelled to bear the sole burden of long-term storage of all of the Nation's nuclear waste. This decision was made on bad politics; it was not made on sound science. Ever since, the debate on solutions to this problem has been one-sided, and the study of alternative solutions has been curtailed.  Instead of honoring Nevada's persistent scientific and procedural objections to the repository, the Federal Government has spent decades of time and wasted billions of dollars to design and permit Yucca Mountain, all without any notion that Nevada would consent to the project.  I have spent the past decade in Congress successfully fighting off efforts to force this project on Nevada, and I will continue this fight for as long as I serve my  I want to be clear: Nuclear power is an important part of our Nation's energy portfolio. I am one of the most outspoken Republicans in Congress advocating to make our Nation's energy cleaner and more affordable. Nuclear energy, which represents about 20 percent of our Nation's power production, plays an important role in providing carbon emission-free baseload energy in many States, but Nevada--again, a State without a nuclear powerplant--should not have to shoulder the Nation's entire waste burden.[[Page S2075]]  We have pursued other strategies to meet Nevada's energy needs. I can share a couple of those examples with you. More than two-thirds of Nevada's energy is produced by natural gas-fired powerplants. Just 2 weeks ago, I was at a groundbreaking at the Moapa Southern Paiute Solar Project, the first-ever utility scale powerplant to be built on Tribal land. This project will produce 250 megawatts of clean energy capable of generating enough clean energy to power an estimated 111,000 homes.  Last March, I joined with the Italian Prime Minister in celebrating the world's first combined solar-geothermal plant near Fallon, This facility provides 26 megawatts of solar photovoltaic, 2 megawatts of solar thermal, and 33 megawatts of geothermal energy to Nevada customers.  Nearly half of the geothermal plants producing baseload clean energy in this country are located in Nevada alone. So overall, more than 2,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewable energy in Nevada, enough to power nearly 1 million homes, has been built to meet Nevada's needs. That includes 19 geothermal energy plants, 12 solar projects, 6 hydro facilities, 4 biomass or methane projects, 1 large wind farm, and 1 energy recovery station. These are just some of the examples we are doing in Yet they continue to try to ram Yucca Mountain down our throats as if we are not doing enough.  As we examine viable solutions to the waste problem, it is important to note that there are some promising technological developments that could fundamentally change the Nation's waste storage needs. There are new reactor technologies that could repurpose previously generated spent fuel and produce carbon-free electricity with little or no waste. International research and development on innovative storage solutions and recycling processes could also be part of that solution.  Given the Yucca-centric strategy's previous failures, it would be logical for the government to try something new--some of these strategies that show promise--but, no, not here in Washington is at it again. Apparently, nearly 30 years of wasted time and billions of squandered taxpayer dollars is, simply, not enough.  The Department of Energy recently submitted what they call a skinny budget, including $120 million, in part, to restart licensing activities for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. That $120 million is a lot of money in itself, but let's be clear that it is just a fraction of the true costs.  Nevada has made it clear that it will contest each and every one of the 200-plus elements of any license application. State and Federal officials have estimated that the licensing process for Yucca Mountain will take 4 to 5 years and cost in excess of $1.6 billion.  In these difficult times, I ask my colleagues: Is it financially prudent to invest over $1.6 billion in any program that has not yielded results in over 30 years?  In case there is any confusion, I want to make sure everybody understands that Nevada's position has not changed and that it is not going to change on this issue. Our Governor, Brian Sandoval, continues to strongly oppose the project. In fact, he shares my same sentiment, and he shared it with me a few weeks ago when he stated:       I will vigorously fight the storage of high-level nuclear      waste in Any attempt to resurrect this ill-conceived      project will be met with relentless opposition and maximum      resources.  Every serious presumed candidate for Governor in 2018--both Republicans and Democrats--strongly opposes Yucca Nevada's attorney general, Adam Laxalt, recently requested $7.2 million of State resources over the next 2 years to represent the State's interests in the licensing process over Yucca Mountain, which he called ``a poster child of federal overreach.'' Soon, our legislature will reaffirm the State's opposition to the project with the passage of Assembly Joint Resolution 10.  To sum it up, it will cost at least $1.6 billion just to get through the application process. Think about that. It will take $1.6 billion just to get through the process, to get the applications ready, let alone to get the storage facility actually operational.  Make no mistake about it. I will continue to lead the Nevada congressional delegation's effort to stymie any misguided effort to spend one more Federal dollar on the Yucca Mountain repository. It is fiscally irresponsible and, simply, will not solve this important public policy issue that faces our  I implore my colleagues to work with me in a pragmatic way to solve our Nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste storage problem that we have.  There is an old adage, and we have all heard it: The definition of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is called insanity. Efforts by the executive branch and some Members of Congress to direct billions more toward a repository that will never be built is just that--insanity.  Our Nation cannot fully move forward with viable solutions until Congress moves past Yucca Last year, the Department of Energy began a consent-based siting initiative to find alternative storage and disposal facilities. Identifying communities that are willing to be hosts for long-term repositories, rather than forcing them upon States that have outright opposed such sites for decades, is the only sustainable path forward.  I wholeheartedly support these efforts. In fact, I introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this year, the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, to codify it into law. This strategy was wisely recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future--a 15-member, bipartisan group that is tasked by the Federal Government to develop feasible solutions to nuclear waste disposal. This type of open process ensures all Americans have a meaningful voice in the process if their communities are being considered for a future nuclear waste repository.  I am confident that the government can find safe sites through the careful consideration of all alternatives that are based on credible scientific information and not by politicians here in Washington, Let's stop the insanity. The administration and congressional Yucca advocates should focus their efforts on practical solutions and not on more of the same.  First, let's advance innovative energy technologies that repurpose and reduce spent fuel.  Second, let's invest in the research and development of recycling and alternative storage methods.  Third and most importantly, let's identify safe and viable alternatives for the storage of nuclear waste that remains in areas that are willing to house it.  These are worthwhile initiatives that actually, to use a football analogy, ``move the ball down the field.'' For far too long, our Nation has been going ``three and out'' because Washington keeps trying to run the same, stale game plan.  I am working diligently on feasible solutions to this important problem, and I urge my colleagues here today, on the floor of the U.Senate, to join me in that fight.

13903,topic-id,732,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to both of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, resolutions related to retirement that we will be considering this week. These CRA resolutions before us would kill Federal regulations that give cities and States the opportunity to expand retirement options for individuals.  Our Nation faces a retirement crisis. In Hawaii, about 50 percent of private sector workers have jobs that don't provide retirement benefits.  According to a recent survey by AARP Hawaii, 56 percent of working age people feel anxious about having enough money saved for retirement. For generations, Americans relied on the ``three-legged stool'' of retirement: Social Security, private savings, and a pension from their employer. Those days are gone. More and more seniors are relying on Social Security for a bigger share of their income in old age.  In Hawaii, the average monthly Social Security benefit is $1,408. Given the cost of housing, medical insurance, and other necessities in Hawaii, that is not nearly enough.  Seniors should be able to count on us to keep Social Security strong. That is a bedrock position we should honor.  Given the retirement crisis, taking away tools that States and local governments can use to help bolster retirement savings makes absolutely no sense, yet this is what we are about to do if we pass these CRA resolutions.  Last week, the Hawaii State Senate held a hearing on legislation that would establish a Hawaii retirement savings working group. The proposed legislation would bring together public and private stakeholders to look at ways to improve retirement savings for workers. A number of stakeholder groups, retirees, and other citizens testified on the bill.  Let me tell you one of their stories. His name is He is a 61-year-old gay man who has lost three husbands to HIV/Donald has worked for 35 years and even set aside money for retirement using 401(k)s--401(k)s that he cashed out to help cover medical costs for his loved ones.  He said: ``I did what I had to do out of love and devotion, especially when each of my guys' families took a step back in the face of adversity.''  Donald now lives paycheck to paycheck in senior affordable housing. He plans to work until he is at least 65.  Personal tragedy isn't the only reason it is difficult for him to save. He wants to save, but he noted that ``I am trying to muster some form of IRA through local financial institutions to no avail. No one returns the calls.''  For too many working people, saving for retirement isn't automatic or easy. It seems out of reach, but we can't let that stand.  The Obama administration recognized the retirement crisis in our country and the need for new thinking to help people save. In fact, that is the point of the regulations the Senate is poised to kill. These regulations simply provide a framework that States and cities can use to expand access to retirement savings.  There are no Big Government mandates or industry takeovers. States and cities would simply have the opportunity to be creative and help families save for retirement. The fact Republicans want to kill these rules has a certain ``Alice in Wonderland'' quality to it, where up is down and down is up.  For the last few weeks, Republicans touted how TrumpCare was giving States more flexibility to provide healthcare, while the reality was that for a State like Hawaii and many others, TrumpCare would have saddled them not with more flexibility but more costs. At that point, States' rights was one of the selling points for that disastrous legislation.  This week Republicans have taken a U-turn. Now they are trying to kill regulations that would actually give States more flexibility to provide retirement security. Why we should take[[Page S2066]]away this tool from States is beyond me. Cynics would say Republicans are doing this to help some private entities sell more retirement plans to people. However, the reality is that millions of families are not being served.  Killing these rules is the latest Republican attack on working people. We should be fighting to give people like Donald more hope and opportunity. Voting against these resolutions is a vote to help people like  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing what I can only characterize as lousy anti-working people resolutions.  I yield the floor.

13539,topic-id,826,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in opposition to this bill, and I adopt many of the premises that my friend, Mr.Walz, adopted.  I also adopt the premise of Roe, who is a really dear friend of mine, that Tim Walz is the kind of guy you wouldn't mind riding across the country with. That is because he is honest, he is knowledgeable, and he is sincere. Frankly, I attribute all of those same characteristics to  But, Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. Everybody on this floor agrees that our veterans deserve the best care possible. There is no debate about that. All of us in this House are focused on that goal. But this bill does nothing to meet that goal, in my view. This bill is part of--and I do not ascribe it to Roe--a significantly long history of a partisan effort to scapegoat Federal civil servants that has been going on for decades, long before Roe got in it or Mr.Walz got in it.  It is a follow-on to the dangerous hiring freeze the Trump administration imposed in January and the repeated attempts over the last several years to extract more and more cuts from Federal employees' pay and benefits, which contributed over $150 billion in cuts in pay and benefits over the last 6 years. Stripping away the rights of VA employees to work in a nonpartisan, professional environment will not improve the care our veterans and their families deserve and expect from the VA medical system.  This bill, in my view, would undermine the collective bargaining rights--I am a very strong supporter of collective bargaining rights--of VA employees serving as doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and others in critical jobs, and disrupt the collaborative relationship between VA managers and employees that is essential to a successful workplace environment.  Many years ago--almost 100 years ago--we adopted a civil service system. The premise of that system is we ought to have professional employees--not political employees, not political appointees--not subject to change because of the political whims that may be blowing one way or the other. This bill risks demoralizing those who have tirelessly been working to help our veterans reintegrate into civilian life in communities across this country.  Let me make it clear--and I am sure Roe is not surprised when I say this--that I agree with Mr.If there is an employee who is not performing well, that employee ought not to be kept on. But this bill removes the process that was negotiated, or could be negotiated, in a collective bargaining way. And if, by the way, it takes 300-plus days, then perhaps this legislation could deal with that to shorten it. There are ways this could be dealt with that, in my view, will not undermine the civil service protections that are important not only for the employees, but for the system itself.  I have no doubt there are measures that can be adopted to improve VA performance and effectively and fairly discipline employees who engage in misconduct. We ought not to tolerate that. But this bill does not include them. I have not read Senator Isakson's bill, but perhaps that is closer, and I look forward to reviewing it with both the chairman and the ranking member.  This bill goes too far, shreds basic due process rights, in my view, and punishes even model employees. And let me say as an aside, when I say it undermines basic due process rights, part of those rights are to have some time to get representation, to thoughtfully respond, to have some discovery as to what is going on here, what is being alleged, why is it being alleged, and who is alleging it. This bill eviscerates that, in some respects.  I am proud to represent 62,000 Federal employees in Maryland's Fifth District, including many who work at the VA's clinic in Charlotte Hall and in Camp Springs in the neighboring Fourth We ought to remember, Mr.Chairman, that when we undermine our Federal workforce and our ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest, we undermine our government's ability to serve the American people. So this is not just about present employees. It is about those who might consider employment in the future.  Mr.Chairman, I hope we don't make the mistake of, in effect, throwing the baby out with the bath water. Let's not take away the rights and protections of those who serve us so ably.  But, yes, I agree with Roe and with Ranking Member If there are those who are not serving us well, yes, there ought to be a process; it ought to be fair, it ought to provide time in which to respond, not interminable time, so that we can have an agency of which we can be proud and does what we all want--serve our veterans in a way that we would expect,[[Page H2118]]demand, and that we are morally obligated to give.

Mr.Speaker, I am deeply concerned by a number of controversial provisions included by the majority in the rules they have proposed for the 115th  First, reinstating the Holman rule would make it easier for the majority to circumvent the current legislative process in order to fire or cut the pay[[Page H17]]of Federal employees. It undermines civil service protections. It goes back to the 19th century.

Secondly, I am deeply concerned by the rules changes regarding decorum in this The chairman was generous enough to have that discussion with me. When the cameras were turned off in this House, there was no way to communicate with the American people other than by something that I didn't know existed, and that was the streaming of the debate that was going on.

13889,topic-id,1113,"Mr.Speaker, this week we will consider the most important bill that this House will consider in this  Every day we are hearing from more and more Republican Members of this House and of the Senate who oppose--who oppose--who oppose--the dangerous healthcare bill on the floor this week.  Just yesterday, conservative Republican Representative Justin Amash tweeted the following--a very conservative Republican from the mid-part of our country said this: ``While I've been in Congress, I can't recall a more universally detested piece of legislation than this GOP healthcare bill.'' Or health no care bill.  This is just the most recent in a long list of statements by Republicans on the demerits--demerits--of the bill to repeal the Affordable Care  It is interesting that they have named it the American Health Care The only thing they struck from our title was ``affordable.'' It should tell you something about the bill. They replace it with a system that requires Americans to pay more and get less.  This bill has been rushed through the committees without a single public hearing--not one, no testimony or expert view. And when the committees marked it up, it did not have what we call a CBO score.  That is simply Washington-speak for the agency that is nonpartisan, bipartisan, with the Director appointed by the Republicans to give us the advice of the consequences of the enactment of such legislation.  They came back and told us that there would be 24 million less Americans insured by 2026. That would total 58 million uninsured Americans as a result of this bill just 9 years from now.  Republicans are rushing it to the floor for two reasons. First, they know that if the American people see what this bill would do and what it would cost, it wouldn't pass.  As a matter of fact, we have some information on that already because, at town meeting after town meeting after town meeting that Republicans have held and Democrats have held on this bill, the overwhelming number of people that came to those town meetings said: This is a bad bill. It will hurt us. It will hurt our health care. It will hurt our families. It will hurt our children.  We are rushing this bill that was introduced just some 2\1/2\ weeks ago. It was introduced on a Monday night, late at night. It was marked up less than 36 hours later in both committees. And they were so intent on getting it marked up and speeding it along that they held a hearing for 26 hours straight. Excuse me. It was not a hearing. No witnesses. They just held a markup for 26 hours straight.  Now, I am sure, Mr.Speaker, that millions of Americans were awake at 4 a.m. in the morning to see what the committee was doing. Obviously, I am not sure of that at all. Perhaps that was the strategy.  Now that the CBO score which I just related to you has been released, we know the harm that this bill will bring. As I said, 24 million Americans kicked off their insurance, including 7 million Americans who are currently covered under plans provided by their employers, premiums for individual policyholders rising 24 to 29 percent.  This is not my view. This is the Congressional Budget Office, whose Director was appointed by this Republican His predecessor, Elmendorf, testified in a hearing that we held, because Republicans refused to hold a hearing on this bill, and he agreed with the Republican-appointed Director and Congressional Budget  So you have a bipartisan agreement that this bill will harm Americans--and not just those 24 million It will harm all Americans because their premiums and copays and deductibles will go up. States will be forced to drop 14 million Americans from Medicaid--and I understand there is a manager's amendment that is going to make it worse--while cutting benefits and provider payments.  A less fiscally sustainable future for Medicare, they shorten the life of Medicare's fiscal sustainability by 3 years, from 2028 down to 2025.  The list goes on, Mr.Speaker, of the reasons why this bill would be a disaster for families in our country.  The second reason they pushed the bill through so quickly is because they wanted to bring it to the floor this week--not next week, not the week after, not after thorough consideration, not after hearings, not after listening to the American people, but this week.  Why this week? Because this week marks the seventh anniversary of the enactment of the law they are seeking to repeal, in other words, optics, spin, propaganda, message. That is what their timeline and their bill are all about: messaging--not results, not reform, political messaging.  This is the fulfillment of a campaign pledge based on a premise that is no longer sustainable. Seven years after the law's enactment the facts are clear. It has expanded coverage, improved benefits, banned discrimination against women and people with preexisting conditions and disabilities, and prohibited annual and lifetime limits on coverage.  Now, they keep some of those things in their bill because they were so popular they thought they couldn't get rid of them. But they have voted 65 times to repeal all those benefits.  Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? Of course not. In the areas where it has fallen short, let's fix it--together.  But this bill--this bill repealing the law and making Americans pay more for less--will throw our healthcare system into turmoil and put millions of families and small businesses at risk. That is why doctors oppose it. That is why hospitals oppose it. That is why senior organizations like AARP oppose it. There are literally 1,000 organizations, plus, that have opposed this legislation.  We are now hearing reports, Mr.Speaker, that Republican leaders are making secret backroom deals with individual Members in order to win their support, the kind of desperate maneuvering that shows how unpopular this bill is.  Republicans, Mr.Speaker, must remember that, as the governing majority, they will be responsible for what happens to our healthcare system under their watch. And I do not just mean this bill. I mean the lack of certainty and the turmoil that they have been creating for the Affordable Care Act market since not only Trump was elected, but since they started attacking this bill some years ago.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my Republican friends, for the sake of their constituents, for the sake of the children of this country, for the sake of those who are at risk because of health challenges that confront them, I urge my Republican friends to abandon this dangerous bill and instead work with us to strengthen our healthcare system for all of our citizens.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2244.txt,566,KARI'S LAW ACT OF 2017,2017.0,21.0,January

Mr.Speaker, I have introduced a resolution, 41, that will not only remember World War I, but also honor those veterans who served. While those brave people are no longer with us, we must never forget those who defended and protected freedom.  Many of us in Congress, as well as citizens all over this country, are relatives of World War I veterans. Many like myself had a grandparent who fought for this Many lost their relatives to this war, while many relatives returned from war forever changed. Over 116,000 were killed, over 200,000 wounded, and over 70,000 suffered the effects of inhaling chlorine gas dispelled by German military.  My grandfather was one of the 70,000, and he, like many, could not cope with the effects of gas-damaged lungs and the psychological burden of war. At the age of 34 in 1926, he committed suicide. My father, an only child, was only 13. I am not unique in this situation, as many families tragically suffered the same fate. That is why we must continue to remember and honor World War I veterans and their families.  I want to thank Colonel Charles Bowery, Jr., executive director, U.Army Center of Military History, and his staff for the many months of work organizing this national remembrance.  This week across the country, we will begin a yearlong celebration marking the 100th anniversary of World War This Friday, the North Carolina Museum of History will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark a year celebrating those who served from North My wife and I will be in attendance.

13581,topic-id,480,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, as a nation, we have the moral responsibility for providing for the men and women who have served our country. One of my highest priorities in Congress is ensuring that our veterans receive the care and benefit they have earned.  It has been almost 3 years since a whistleblower shocked the Nation by disclosing 1,400 veterans languish without care at the Phoenix Since then, many others have come forward to report excessive wait times, substandard care, and dirty facilities in VA hospitals all across the country.[[Page H2134]]  The issues we have seen at different VA hospitals have been completely disgraceful. However, what is even more shocking is that many of these whistleblowers have reported some sort of retaliation from hospital directors or the VA's Office of Inspector General, even though Federal law specifically prohibits harassment or retaliation of Federal employees who bring wrongdoing to light.  The recent reports about VA employees facing retaliation is disheartening and it is unacceptable. We need to protect these employees who are trying to ensure that the VA is transparent and accountable to all of our veterans.  Mr.Speaker, my amendment is very simple and commonsense. It merely builds upon existing language in the bill seeking to protect whistleblowers.  Under the bill, a whistleblower can still be fired during the expedited procedure with limited recourse. This amendment would close that loophole.  This amendment would also cover those who come forward to a central whistleblower office instead of just a special counsel.  And, as my colleagues have noted numerous times on the floor today, one-third of our VA employees are veterans. This amendment also works to protect them from unjust firings without due process.  We should never tolerate fraud, waste, or abuse on our Federal agencies. This is especially true when it comes to caring for our Nation's veterans. The brave men and women who have put their lives on the line should be provided with the best quality of care, and it is imperative that the whistleblowers who have stood up to protect our veterans should be fully protected from retaliation.  We should provide whistleblowers with the confidence to step up and help make a change. Helping improve our veterans' health care is dependent in part on the encouragement and protection of whistleblowers within the  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I say this. No one in this body wants to vote on a bill that may give potential whistleblowers doubt about coming forward.

The VA still lacks the ability to take swift action against employees who prevent veterans from getting the benefits that they have earned.  We should be able to terminate senior executives at failing hospitals that force veterans to languish on secret wait lists. We should not award bonuses to poorly performing employees who engage in misconduct, and we shouldn't provide full retirement benefits to convicted criminals whose crime harmed veterans.  We can't stop there. We must go further to pursue bold reform at the I look forward to working with Chairman Roe of Tennessee, Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers, and others to pass the Caring for Our Heroes in the 21st Century Act, which would finally empower veterans, including the almost 100,000 in my congressional district in Colorado, to make their own healthcare decisions.

13827,topic-id,269,"Mr.Speaker, perhaps no aspect of America's economy has been as overregulated as energy under the Obama administration; so this week, the House has already acted to repeal two of the most damaging energy regulations.  This morning we continue the fight to reduce the unnecessary regulatory costs that are passed along to all Americans by repealing the Bureau of Land Management's venting and flaring rule. Some estimates show that this rule could inflict staggering costs[[Page H954]]of $1.26 billion on national, State, and local economies, while generating less than $4 million in new royalties.  In addition, the legal basis for this rule is tenuous at best. The Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA, not BLM, working in conjunction with States, to make rules affecting air quality.  The BLM's venting and flaring rule's extreme compliance cost will force many companies to shut in their wells rather than to continue to operate them. This will be particularly true for marginal wells that are often run by family-owned businesses.  And beyond the loss of jobs in Colorado and elsewhere, State and Federal Governments would lose up to $114 million in tax receipts. This is money that States like Colorado depend on for funding education and other critical services.  The increase in natural gas production is to the benefit of everyday The U.energy boom saved drivers $550 in fuel costs each year and saved American households over $1,000 last year alone.  Affordable, environmentally responsible energy development is critical to the U.economy, but this rule is a needless burden on American families.

13879,topic-id,1425,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  At our subcommittee hearing last April, we heard the very moving testimony of Mr.Hank Hank told us the story of how his daughter Kari was brutally murdered in a Texas motel bathroom in December 2013. As emotional as his story was, Hank continued with the gut wrenching details of how Kari's daughter frantically tried and failed to reach first responders.  The little girl had done as she was always taught, dial 911 for help. Tragically, as it turns out, that was her mistake. Due to the configuration of the phone installed in the motel room, she needed to dial 9 before dialing an outside number. Time after time she tried, but the call never went through. The first responders who could have attempted to save Kari's life were not reached in time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of this commonsense bill that has the ability to save lives. Unfortunately, it[[Page H589]]cost the life of Kari Hunt before the call for action was recognized.  Multiline telephone systems, like the one in that Texas motel room, are everywhere. Many businesses, including hotels, offices, and schools, use MLTS at their facilities across the country. They serve a very practical purpose and make connecting to other onsite users much easier. Unfortunately, many of these phones do not preset with the ability directly to dial 911.  It may be routine for someone who works in an office to know to dial 9 before dialing out, but would the instinct seem so natural during an emergency? Incidentally, I have telephones in offices here and in several district locations in New Jersey, and in some of those offices you dial 9 and in some you don't.  Moreover, our children should not have to be taught that sometimes they need to dial an extra number. 911 should mean 911. Those three numbers are one of the earliest things many parents teach their children. Kari's Law would require multiline telephone systems to be configured with the ability directly to dial 911 without any additional prefix.                              {time}  1730  The law would also require that multiline phone systems be configured to notify a central location within the system's facility when someone initiates a call to 911. This provision will help ensure first responders have the information needed to better locate and assist the caller.  There are some businesses, including a number of hotel chains, who have shown initiative and applied these changes in their facilities already. I commend them, but there is more work to be done. These simple fixes should be adopted and implemented nationwide. When dialing to reach emergency responders, it needs to go through, period.  I thank Hank Hunt, Kari's father, who has been a tireless advocate for this legislation. He has brought this important issue to our attention. Kari's Law passed without objection twice last Congress, and I urge all of my colleagues to support Representative Gohmert's bill once again. Representative Gohmert has certainly taken the lead on this across the United He is an angel of mercy in this regard. I hope this legislation becomes law this year and will be signed into law by our new President because I think it is critical for the safety of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                    H.582 Kari's Law Act of 2017                  BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATTON       Multi-Line Telephone Systems (MLTS) serve multiple      telephone users at a single site, often an office building,      hotel, university campus, or similar location. One common      feature of MLTS is the configuration that permits shorter      dialing sequences within the system by requiring a user to      dial a digit or prefix to reach a number outside of the      system--that is, dial ``9'' before reaching an outside line.      Thus, on some MLTS a user may have to dial the prefix when      attempting to make an emergency call. In December 2013, Kari      Hunt was killed by her estranged husband in a motel room in      Her daughter repeatedly attempted to dial 9-1-1 from      the motel room, but was unable to reach emergency responders      because the motel's MLTS required users to dial ``9'' to      reach an outside line.       Kari's Law seeks to ensure that this situation does not      result in confusion in the heat of an emergency, preventing      others from accessing essential emergency services from an      MLTS phone. While many hotels and office buildings have begun      to make this change to their systems, this bill would make it      a universal requirement. H.582 requires that all MLTS have      a default configuration that allows users to directly dial 9-     1-1, without the need for any additional digit or prefix,      from any phone with dialing facilities. In addition, the      system must also be configured to notify a designated central      point of contact when someone initiates a call to 9-1-1 using      the system. By notifying a central point of contact,      emergency responders are better able to access, locate, and      assist a caller who initiates a 9-1-1 call within the             SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION       Section 1. Short title       Section 1 provides that the Act may be cited as the      ``Kari's Law Act of 2017.''       Section 2. Configuration of multi-line telephone systems      for direct dialing of 9-1-1       Section 2(a) adds a new Section 721 to the Communications      Act of 1934, as amended.       New Section 721(a) requires that any person manufacturing,      selling, importing, or leasing multi-line telephone systems      only do so if the system is pre-configured in a way that a      user may directly initiate a call to 9-1-1 without dialing      any additional digits or prefixes. This section applies to      any system that is sold, leased, offered, or imported for use      in the United States after the effective date. This includes      systems that have call control located outside of the U.S.,      but have terminals or end points in the U.While systems      are required to be pre-configured with the default dialing      pattern described in this section, it does not preclude the      inclusion of additional optional dialing patterns to reach 9-     1-1 (e.g. (9)9-1-1). However, if the system is configured      with these additional dialing patterns, they must be in      addition to the default pattern.       New Section 721(b) requires that any person who installs,      operates, or manages a MLTS only do so if the system is      configured such that a user may directly initiate a call to      9-1-1 without any additional digit or prefix. This section      also applies to systems installed, managed, or operated for      use in the United       New Section 721(c) requires that systems be configured to      provide a notification to either a central location at the      facility where the system is located, or to a contact person      or organization regardless of location. This section is      intended to assist first responders in their emergency      response by providing access and information needed to locate      the caller. This can be particularly important in large      buildings like hotels, hospitals, and schools, where on-site      personnel are uniquely suited to provide information about      the building and its occupants. This provision requires the      system to designate a central point of contact, but allows      the MLTS owner or operator some flexibility in determining      the most appropriate contact, whether in the building or      otherwise.       This subsection only applies to systems where the      configuration is achievable without an improvement to the      hardware or software of the system. The Committee intends      this provision to include upgrades to the core systems of a      MLTS, but not the addition of additional extensions or lines.      The Committee also intends this provision to apply to      substantial upgrades to the software, particularly those      requiring a significant purchase. Minor software upgrades      that are easily achieved or are made to improve the security      of the system would not be considered an ``improvement'' for      the purposes of this section. The legislation seeks to      balance the need for an onsite notification with the goal of      not placing an undue burden on MLTS owners or operators.       New Section 721(d) clarifies that this legislation does not      alter the authority of state or local agencies with      jurisdiction over emergency communications, as long as that      authority isn't exercised in a manner inconsistent with this      legislation.       New Section 721(e) allows for enforcement under Title V of      the Communications Act, but only to the extent that the      section allows for the imposition of a fine.       New Section 721(f) defines multi-line telephone system by      crossreferencing the definition in Section 6502 of the Middle      Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.       Section 2(b) sets an effective date for the changes at two      years after the date of enactment of the  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH588.txt,1936,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,23.0,January

13919,topic-id,1313,"Mr.President, there has been a long conversation about a Supreme Court Quite frankly, there should be a long conversation. It is an incredibly important role of the Senate for advice and consent. We are talking about a Supreme Court Justice as someone who serves on the Court for life, so it has to be right.  A long conversation about Neil Gorsuch is coming to a head. In the next week, he will come to this floor. He will face final debate, and the very long confirmation process will end with him joining the Supreme Court as the ninth When he is added on as an Associate Justice, it won't have been a short journey. He has met with every single Senator face to face. He has made all the time available that they wanted to have for face-to-face questions and to be able to go through those issues personally. He has been in very long hearings. He sat down hour after hour, multiple days, answering questions from Senators in the Judiciary Committee, then a vote from the Judiciary Committee, and then coming to this floor. There has been research in his background in every case. Everything he has ever written and every speech he has ever given has been examined overwhelmingly. And at the end of that, he has been found to be a very serious member of the judiciary.  In this body in 2006, he was put on the Tenth Circuit, a circuit that Oklahoma happens to be in. There was a unanimous vote in the Senate in 2006 for him to join the Tenth He was seen as a consistent, solid, mainstream, fair judge. That means Senator Joe Biden voted for him. Hillary Clinton voted for him. Chuck Schumer voted for him. Barack Obama voted for him in 2006.  After going through all of his background leading up to this point, since that time, what has happened? Did he leave the mainstream during that time period after he was overwhelmingly voted here, unanimously out of the Senate, to be on the Tenth Circuit? Well, since that time, he has been a part of 2,700 cases in the last decade. Of those 2,700 cases, 97 percent of them were unanimous. In 99 percent of the cases, he was in the majority in those opinions. Only 1 percent of the time he was not in the majority of the decision.  So you may ask, who is the Tenth Circuit Court that he is working with, this large group of judges who are in that court? Let me give you the basics of it. Of the Tenth Circuit judges there right now, whom he is serving with, with whom he was in the majority 99 percent of the time, five of the other judges were Obama appointees, five of them were George Bush appointees, three of them were Clinton appointees, three of them were Reagan appointees, 1 was Bush 41, and 2 of them were from President That is the group he was voting with in the majority 99 percent of the time.  He was seen by this Senate in 2006 to be a solid, mainstream jurist. Since that time period, he has voted with them 99 percent of the time in a very diverse Tenth  CRS, in their background research with him, said that Judge Gorsuch's opinions had the fewest number of dissents of anyone in the Tenth In other words, when he wrote the opinion, his colleagues disagreed with him the fewest number of times of anyone on the Tenth  He is a solid jurist, respected around the country, and one who deserves not only an intense investigation but I believe deserves to be put on the Supreme Court of the United I look forward to voting for him next week.  In the process, I hope, as we support him, that we will also step up and do a process that has been consistent in this country for the last 230 years of how we process through judges; that is, we have an up-or-down vote. They are not blocked by a cloture vote to try to keep them from getting to a final vote. The judges here get an up-or-down vote. That is the way we have done it.  Of the eight Justices who are sitting on the bench right now, only one of them even had a cloture vote at all, and that one wasn't even close. It was 72 to 25, and that was Justice  Just to walk through the brief history of some of the recent judges and some of the things that have happened and how it is absurd that we would even be discussing a filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice, Justice Kagan was approved by a vote of 63 to 37. There was bipartisan support coming out of the committee. I can assure you, there wasn't bipartisan support for policy positions.  For some reason, Judge Gorsuch is being accused of being partisan or political or somehow connected to the President, so that would disqualify him.

Clarence Thomas, one of the most controversial nominees in this last century, came out of the committee with a divided committee. After the vote failed, the committee then voted to send his nomination to the floor without a recommendation. He then passed on a floor vote of 52 to 48. There was never a request for a cloture vote. No one filibustered him--not one person.  If Clarence Thomas would have had a filibuster threat facing him, he wouldn't be on the Court today. He has been an excellent jurist on the Supreme Court, but he came out during a time when there weren't these idle threats.  It is even interesting that Robert Bork, who is currently not on the Court--his vote failed 42 to 58, but that was a failed final vote. Robert Bork did[[Page S2081]]not face a filibuster threat. He was brought to a final up-or-down vote.

There is no question he has been an excellent writer.  Now it is a question of, Will the Senate follow through on the procedures that we have followed through on for two centuries?

13715,topic-id,321,"Mr.President, today I am honored to recognize a Vermont treasure, Robert Backus of Grace Cottage Hospital, who is retiring after nearly four decades of dedicated service to the rural community of Townshend,  Backus, or ``B'' as his patients often call him, is a natural healer. He discovered his passion for medical sciences as a young hunter. After serving with the Peace Corps in Brazil, he traveled to Australia to complete a medical internship and his residency. Years later, while on a trek across country from California, Backus found himself meandering along the winding roads of Vermont's Route 30, and he discovered the place he continues to call home today. The people of Townshend are glad he never left.  After settling in Vermont, Backus went on to complete his premedical studies at the University of Massachusetts and, later, Dartmouth He then received his doctorate in medicine from the University of Vermont in Soon after, Backus took a job working as deputy to Carlos Otis, the revered founder of Vermont's Grace Cottage Hospital, one of the State's leading rural providers.  Backus is perhaps most well-known for always being there for his patients, even if they are admitted to a different hospital. He is also known for his strong commitment to the community. For example, each year, Backus dedicates his time to collecting items for the Grace Cottage Fair, an event that supports the work and patients of the hospital. He also enjoys singing in the West River Valley Chorus with his wife,  Backus remains committed to staying active in his community after retirement, and as a grandfather to six, he is also looking forward to spending more time with his family.  I am proud to honor Backus's commitment to our State, and to the health and well-being of I know we will continue to see great things from him, and I wish him the very best as he enters a well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1686-2.txt,1383,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,8.0,January
13901,topic-id,2383,"Mr.President, I rise in support of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court of the United  Last week the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, held a week-long series of hearings concerning Judge Gorsuch's nomination. After listening to the judge's flawless testimony, after listening to him answer questions from my colleagues for days on end, I am even more convinced than ever that he is exactly the kind of jurist we need on the Supreme Court of the United  I want to briefly explain my support for the judge, and then respond to some of the criticisms that have been leveled against him.  First and foremost, Judge Gorsuch understands the proper and necessarily limited role of the judiciary in our constitutional  Last week, over and over, Judge Gorsuch affirmed--even against great criticism that at times can be difficult to understand in its entirety--but responded time and again to criticisms by pointing out that it is his job as a[[Page S2064]]judge to interpret and apply the law--not to make it, not to establish policy, but to apply that policy which has already been placed into law by the legislative branch.  When you are reading law, the text matters. Our laws consist of words and each word matters. If the law leads to an uncomfortable outcome for the parties, for politicians, or for anyone else in our society, then, it is our job as a Congress--or if it is State law at issue, it is the job of a State legislature--to get the policy right, to fix the policy problem at issue. The judge's job is to go where the law leads the judge, not to correct the law.  Over and over, Judge Gorsuch affirmed the importance of precedent in our system. It is clearly a topic that he takes very seriously, having coauthored a treatise on that very subject. While precedent is not always absolute, in so far as you have a clear conflict with the text, Judge Gorsuch testified that you start with the ``heavy presumption in favor of precedent.'' He described precedent as the ``anchor of the law.''  Over and over, Judge Gorsuch explained that judges are not partisans in robes. No, they are different. They are different from politicians. They are meaningfully different than the politicians who make the laws or the politicians in the executive branch who enforce and execute the laws. They are unfailingly independent when they are doing their jobs right. They are devoted to the rule of law. They do their best to decide cases on the basis of the law and the facts, rather than on the basis of achieving whatever outcome they or others might desire.  Some of my colleagues' views of Judge Gorsuch's record are different, and I want to address some of their concerns. First, some of my colleagues have questioned the independence of Judge Gorsuch and his ability to exercise judicial independence. This is a very serious accusation. In fact, it is probably one of the worst things you could say about a judge. So my colleagues who have raised this criticism would need to back that up against something. If you are going to raise a really serious accusation against someone, as you are whenever you are calling into question a judge's independence, you have to be able to back it up.  Let's look at that. Can they back it up? I don't think so. In fact, I am quite certain they can't because they haven't. The argument boils down to the complaint that Judge Gorsuch hasn't sufficiently criticized President Trump's comments about judges. But here is what Judge Gorsuch said about this topic last week. He said this in response to questions raised by Senator Blumenthal on the Judiciary He said:       Senator, I care deeply about the independence of the      judiciary. I cannot talk about the specific cases or      controversies that might come before me, and I cannot get      involved in politics.       But, Senator, when you attack the integrity or honesty or      independence of a judge, their motives, as we sometimes hear,      Senator, I know the men and women of the Federal judiciary, a      lot of them. I know how who hard their job is, how much they      often give up to do it, the difficult circumstances in which      they do it. It is a lonely job, too. I am not asking for      crocodile tears or anything like that. I am just saying I      know these people, and I know how decent they are. And when      anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity, the motives of a      Federal judge, well, I find that disheartening, I find that      demoralizing, because I know the truth.  Senator Blumenthal asked Judge Gorsuch whether, when he said ``anyone,'' that applied to the President of the United Judge Gorsuch responded simply: ``Anyone is anyone.'' It is true that Judge Gorsuch didn't use the magic words: I disagree with President But he can't get involved in politics. He said here what he can say. In fact, he said all he can say in this context.  Moreover, here are some additional parts of Judge Gorsuch's testimony, which shed light on this issue.  From Tuesday:       I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party other      than based on what the law and the facts in the particular      case require, and I'm heartened by the support I have      received from people who recognize that there's no such thing      as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have      judges in this country.  On Wednesday he said:       I do not see Republican judges, and I do not see Democrat      judges. I see judges.  So I think any fairminded person looking at this would have to agree that Judge Gorsuch's feelings about judicial independence in cases before the Federal judiciary are very clear. To my colleagues who might see the issue differently, I would ask simply: What should Judge Gorsuch have said without getting involved in politics, without miring himself in a debate that is within the political branches of government and, therefore, within the political rather than the judicial interpretive arena?  Second, some of my colleagues allege that Judge Gorsuch is somehow out of the mainstream. But consider these facts. Judge Gorsuch has decided roughly 2,700 cases. His decisions have been unanimous 97 percent of the time. Keep in mind that he is an appellate judge who sits on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Appellate judges never sit alone in that capacity. They sit in panels--normally in panels of three and sometimes in panels of a dozen or so when they sit on the bench. And 97 percent of the time, all of the judges with whom Judge Gorsuch sits in any case agree with whatever decision he reaches. He is in the majority 99 percent of the time.  He is about as likely to dissent from a Republican-appointed judge as a Democratic-appointed judge. He has been reversed twice, and in both cases he was following circuit precedent. I want to make it clear that there is nothing wrong with a judge who dissents more than this. In fact, in many instances, dissents are necessary. In many instances, a dissent can be useful, even indispensable. There are judges out there who dissent more than this, and there wouldn't be anything wrong with Judge Gorsuch if he dissented any more. My point is that of all the arguments you can make against Judge Gorsuch, this is not a fair characterization. To say that he is out of the mainstream simply runs against mathematics. It runs against the bold statistics on their very face, which contradict this characterization.  Some of my colleagues respond that only a handful of cherry-picked cases matter. If you watched the hearing last week, you might recognize the names of some of these cases. They include TransAM Trucking, Hwang, Luke P., Hobby What I find revealing is that my colleagues never mount much of a legal argument against any of these decisions. No, you are not going to find quibbling with the statutory construction in these cases. They don't parse the statutes at issue and then explain where it is that Judge Gorsuch somehow got it wrong, somehow departed from what the law actually says. No, they are looking at outcomes. They think Judge Gorsuch should have bent the law in order to go where they think the law should go. They want judges who have the right approach in mind, the right outcome in mind, and to decide the case according to what outcome they desire.  I flatly disagree with this view of judging. It is a view, frankly, that is way out of the mainstream in American law. To say it is out of the mainstream in American law does not mean out of the Republican mainstream or the conservative mainstream or the mainstream among members of the Federalist No, I am talking about rank-and-file practitioners of the law, jurists from every conceivable point along the political and ideological spectrum. This is just not something that a judge would ever want to admit to doing. Certainly, it is never anything a judge would aspire to do--to choose an outcome and say: I am going to reach that outcome, and I don't really care that the law doesn't really authorize me to do it. I am just going to do it because I think, in some abstract sense, that outcome would achieve a greater degree of fairness than what the law actually requires me to do.  Third, I am distressed by a lot of the rhetoric that we heard during the confirmation hearing last week--rhetoric that I expect to continue and even mount over the next 10 days or so. One of my colleagues last week actually went so far as to describe the Supreme Court of the United States as an ``instrument of the Republican party.''  Other colleagues have complained about the so-called dark money campaign to support Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and still other colleagues complain that President Trump or Steve[[Page S2065]]Bannon or Reince Priebus or others are enthusiastic about Judge Gorsuch's nomination, as if the fact that someone is supported by someone they don't like means that the person in question is not qualified. This is unfair to Judge  Judge Gorsuch didn't decide Citizens He didn't decide Hobby Lobby or any other case my colleagues dislike. He made clear in no uncertain terms that no one speaks on his behalf but him.  They may dislike some of the cases in which he offered opinions, but, again, in those cases, they are not quibbling with the way that he interpreted the law. No one has attacked his interpretation of a statute, his approach to statutory construction. They are quibbling with the outcome. They are quibbling with the fact that they wish it had turned out differently on policy grounds, policy grounds that have everything to do with the policymaking arms of the government and not with the jurisprudential arm of the government.  Even worse, these types of statements are damaging to our judiciary. If you don't like a judicial decision, engage the decision on its own terms, engage in a discussion of how that decision turned out wrong or where it is that it departed from what the law requires. Make a legal argument, in other words.  The courts announce reasons for their decisions. There is plenty of material to dig into, but don't impugn the judge's motives or independence. This is especially harmful when you impugn the judge's motives without actually getting into what the judge did or what the law says and explaining how those two things diverge.  Don't accuse the Supreme Court of functioning as an instrument of the Republican In fact, you might as well call someone a so-called judge in a case where you disagree with the outcome. In fact, calling someone a so-called judge is probably no worse than calling the Supreme Court of the United States an instrument of the Republican  Finally, I want to talk about the filibuster. The minority leader has urged his colleagues to filibuster. The minority whip has announced he will filibuster. Only two Democrats have said they will vote yes on cloture, so here we are.  I ask my colleagues: If Neil Gorsuch can't get 60 votes for cloture, which Republican nominee can?  Some of my colleagues have argued that if a nominee can't get 60 votes, the President should find a new nominee. I ask my colleagues: Was that the standard for several of President Obama's nominees at the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit?  Well, yes, it was. Under rule XXII, that was the standard. That was the standard until, in November of 2013, the Democrats in the Senate went nuclear, and they created a new precedent, taking that threshold down from 60--by precedent--to 51. Through going nuclear, this is the result they achieved.  Their analysis, in its entirety, went in this direction. Their analysis nuked the Executive filibuster. It nuked the filibuster on the Executive  Interestingly, although some were insisting at the time and went to the floor to explain at the time that they didn't intend for this to extend to Supreme Court nominees, when everyone thought Hillary Clinton would be President--Harry Reid admitted that the Democrats would extend this same precedent through which the Democrats had nuked the Executive filibuster to Supreme Court nominees.  So, look, I work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle on a great number of important issues, issues that are very important to me, issues like criminal justice reform, reform of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, reform of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, which is badly in need of reform, and a number of other issues, many of which involve privacy protections. These are A-plus legislative priorities for me. Nothing else is more important, and I stand ready to reform the law whenever I see the need to do so and will continue to work with my Democratic colleagues.  As we approach this discussion, I want to be clear that unilateral disarmament doesn't work. I hope the Democrats reverse course and do not filibuster this nominee, but if they do, I am confident Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed.

13822,topic-id,1278,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong opposition to this resolution, which would waste resources, waste money, pollute our air, and worsen the impacts of climate change.  When it comes to regulations that we should keep on the books, the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule is a no-brainer. Currently, oil and gas companies are venting, flaring, or leaking hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of natural gas each and every year.  People who are sitting at home may wonder: Why would a company simply waste or burn off such a valuable resource?  The answer is simple: They want the oil, and they want it now. To them, the natural gas that goes along with the oil is just a nuisance; so they burn it off or they don't make the effort that is required to ensure that their equipment isn't leaking.  The problem is, when they are operating on public lands, this isn't their natural gas to waste. They cannot waste this. This belongs to the American people. So when that gas is simply burned off or is allowed to escape, the royalties that are owed to the American people are gone with the wind; and instead of generating electricity or heating our homes, this wasted resource generates pollution and heats our planet.  For people who live near oil and gas wells, this is not just a climate problem. Methane contributes to low-level ozone, which causes a number of health problems, such as shortness of breath, more frequent asthma attacks, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When the methane leaks, you also get leaks of benzene, which is a known carcinogen, and of other volatile organic chemicals that further contribute to ozone and smog and can contribute to liver and kidney damage, nausea, and other health problems.  Now, my colleagues on the other side say that this is exactly the problem--the Bureau of Land Management is trying to regulate air pollution, and that is the job of the Environmental Protection The fact is, though, that the Bureau of Land Management has very clearly written a waste prevention rule, as they are authorized and required. I will state that again--as they are authorized and required to do under the Mineral Leasing  Section 30 of the Mineral Leasing Act reads:       Each lease shall contain provisions for the purpose of      insuring the exercise of reasonable diligence, skill, and      care in the operation of said property; a provision that such      rules for the safety and welfare of the miners and for the      prevention of undue waste as may be prescribed by said      Secretary shall be observed.  The BLM simply did its job by writing this rule, and now that they have done the job that Congress required of them, the majority is attempting to argue that Congress never gave the BLM that job in the first place. If you look at the statute, that claim is clearly an alternative fact. Just because preventing the waste of methane helps keep our air clean and moderates the severity of climate change, it doesn't mean the BLM is doing anything outside of their authority. The BLM is not regulating the quality of the air around oil and gas sites. It is just trying to make sure that methane stays out of the atmosphere and gets into the marketplace.  Another argument you have heard from the majority is that this is an effort to shut down oil and gas production on Federal lands. It is just another salvo in their war, which they claim is the Obama war on energy, except that that is simply not true. I am almost tired of having to say this, but the production of Federal onshore oil went up, not a little bit--it went way up under President Obama--but by 71 percent, as a matter of fact, between 2009 and 2015.  Now, would this Methane Waste Prevention Rule hurt production? Would it drive operators off Federal lands?  To answer that, let's just take a look at one of our States--Colorado, which, in early 2014, enacted methane venting and flaring regulations that the BLM used as a model in writing its own rule. I want to state this really clearly: after Colorado enacted their methane regulations, their production went up 47 percent from 2013 to 2014 and another 32 percent in 2015. Colorado's oil production from Federal lands has been up 28 percent over the past 5 years also.  Clearly, strong methane waste regulations do not scare away oil and gas companies.  What about the claim that companies have to burn off natural gas because the BLM takes too long to process pipeline applications?  If we look at a recent report from the Government Accountability Office just from last year, they found that only 9 percent of flaring was due to the lack of pipelines and that 91 percent had nothing to do with pipelines.                              {time}  0930  How about the point that is made at the oil and gas companies' insistence that they are making great strides in reducing their own methane emissions so they don't need additional oversight?  Members, that is a myth as well. Oil and gas producers in the field emitted 45 percent more methane in 2014 than they did in 1990. In fact, methane emissions from oil and gas producers went up 21 percent in the past 24 years.  The majority also says this is a power grab, an effort by BLM to take power away from the States, except that the BLM has regulated venting and flaring since the Carter administration. And this has not stopped States from setting their own regulations, as I have just said that Colorado[[Page H953]]has done, which they will still be free to do under this rule. In fact, despite all the complaints about one-size-fits-all regulations, companies still have to follow State regulations when they operate on Federal land.  Mr.Speaker, none of these arguments against the regulation hold any water, but the benefits of this regulation would be huge: enough gas saved to supply up to 740,000 households each year; the reduction of an estimated 185,000 tons of methane emissions, which would have the same impact as taking nearly 1 million cars off the road; and up to $14 million each year to the American taxpayer from additional royalties, and that number could be even larger if the price of natural gas increases, which the majority is trying to do by expediting natural gas exports.  The BLM methane waste prevention rule is a win for the taxpayer, a win for the environment, a win for the climate, and a win for common sense. That is why it is supported by over 80 percent of voters in Western States, including both Democrats and Republicans, according to a poll just released this week. If my colleagues have not seen that poll, I would be happy to share it with them.  Unfortunately, the Republican antiregulatory, antitaxpayer, antihealth, antienvironment machine must be continually fed. Earlier this week, they voted to strip clean water and transparency regulations. Today, they are going after clean air.  I ask my colleagues to stand up and put a stop to this, to speak for the ordinary Americans who don't own oil and gas or coal companies, which those companies donate immense sums of money to politicians. The industry has to do its share and not simply demand that the farmers, the ranchers, the sportsmen, the conservationists, and all the rest of us have to put up with their waste in the name of higher profits. I ask my colleagues to do this by voting ``no'' on H.36.  I reserve the balance of my time.

We heard that the majority insists that oil and gas production on Federal lands is down. To support this, they often show misleading charts that compare apples to oranges or use visual tricks to hide the facts.  The facts are Federal onshore oil production was up 71 percent between 2009 and 2015. All the panic that we have heard for years that President Obama is trying to shut down oil and gas was based on as much reality as the claim that he was coming to get everyone's guns.  I will say it again: there was a 71 percent increase in oil production on onshore Federal lands under President Obama's watch. And it is the oil producers that are wasting and leaking methane at a faster and faster rate since it is not a product they care about. They just want the oil.  With an unfortunate likely return to a drill-at-all-cost mentality under President Trump, we need the BLM methane waste prevention rule more than ever.

13831,topic-id,264,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we have heard a lot from Members from Colorado about how this onerous methane rule will hurt industry in I would like to read from a couple of Colorado editorials that came out this past week in support of maintaining the BLM methane rule.  On Saturday, The Denver Post posted an editorial entitled ``Congress shouldn't butcher federal methane rules.'' In it, they say: ``Congress is getting ready to use an ax where it needs a scalpel. . . .''  Make no mistake, Mr.Speaker, the Congressional Review Act is an ax. It is an ax being swung blindfolded after several shots of whiskey. It shows a complete lack of seriousness on the issue, and it could have serious, long-term consequences.  That is why The Denver Post editorial board asks Republicans to be surgeons and not butchers, and to avoid repealing what they call a thoughtful regulation.  This past week, another editorial was published on Wednesday by the Grand Junction, Colorado Daily Sentinel entitled, ``Stop methane leaks.'' Referring to their State's own methane waste rules, they say: ``We're fortunate to have the rule in But if the federal rule isn't enforced, the results can undermine our own gains.''  Air quality does not recognize State lines. Under-regulated drilling in Utah produces bad air that blows into the western slope communities.

13832,topic-id,253,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to reinforce a point that I made in my opening statement. Oil and gas companies and the industry would like to say they have done a tremendous job cutting methane emissions on their own.  In fact, just this week, the Western Energy Alliance spearheaded a letter saying: ``Methane emissions from oil and gas production have declined by 15 percent since 1990, without any Federal regulations.''  What we have been hearing today, and my friends on the other side, is continually using some variation of this reduction that they say occurs. The problem is, and I repeat that the problem is, is that claim is just flat out false. That is the definition of an alternative fact.  Methane reduction, since 1990, has come entirely from natural gas storage, from the distribution and the transmission of natural gas. Out in the field, however, what we are talking about, out in the field, where companies are actually drilling, methane emissions are up.  For natural gas production, methane in the field, methane emissions are up by 31 percent. For oil production, emissions are up a staggering 76 percent.  Mr.Speaker, the industry has not fixed this problem on their own, and they are not going to fix this problem on their own. Only strong rules and oversight are going to hold companies accountable to reduce methane waste and, for that reason, we must defeat this resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

They point to the volatile organic compounds that also pollute the air when natural gas leaks, saying that these chemicals ``include benzene, a known carcinogen; ethylbenzene, a probable carcinogen; and toluene, a neurotoxin that may also cause miscarriages and birth defects.''                              {time}  1000  Also, these chemicals are ``precursors to the formation of ground-level ozone, a dangerous air pollutant that causes permanent lung damage. By limiting emissions of volatile organic chemicals, oil and natural gas limits will reduce the risk of ozone formation in the air and, thus, the risk of ozone-related health effects, including asthma attacks, hospital admissions, and, unfortunately, premature deaths.''  These health impacts are just one more set of reasons why repealing the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule is the wrong way to go.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, it may no longer be Groundhog Day, but it feels like we have been here doing the same thing over and over again.  Once again, Republicans are doing the bidding of wealthy fossil fuel companies at the expense of ordinary On Wednesday, we were here so our majority could strip away clean water protections from coal mining. Later on that day, the majority gave our new Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, a gift by repealing the requirement for oil and gas companies to tell the public how much money they paid to foreign governments.  Now, today we are here to shower more goodies onto the oil and gas industry by repealing a rule designed to keep them from wasting--and I urge you to hear that term, ``wasting''--natural gas and also polluting our air.  Really, Mr.Speaker? Less than 2 weeks into the new all-Republican government and they are already handing out early Valentine's Day gifts to their wealthy donors. Instead of chocolates and flowers, they are giving their oil and coal executives the right to pollute our air, dump waste into our water, and do it all under the cover of darkness. Republicans are using the Congressional Review Act so fast that I doubt they even know what they are repealing from day to day. It's Friday, so I guess it must be air pollution day.  Let me warn everyone that is watching this telecast that they are not going to stop at trying to destroy clean air, clean water, and transparency. Dozens of health, safety, transparency, and consumer protections are on the chopping block, and Republicans are more than happy to swing the ax.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule and defeat this resolution.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

13838,topic-id,1350,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I include in the Record two letters opposing this resolution and supporting the BLM Methane Waste Prevention The first is from 78 environmental, conservation, public interest, and sportsmen's groups urging a ``no'' vote on this resolution. The second is a letter from 13 public health and medical organizations strongly urging a ``no'' vote on this resolution because of the damage that it will do to public health.                                                 January 31, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of our millions of      members and supporters, we write to urge you to oppose any      effort to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn the      Bureau of Land Management's Methane and Natural Gas Waste      We rely on laws and regulations to protect taxpayer      resources and to keep our air and water clean and healthy.      While we oppose the use of the CRA for any rule, the BLM rule      is one of the anticipated targets to be considered under a      Congressional Review Act       The BLM rule is a common sense policy that requires the oil      and gas industry to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks at      industry operations on public and tribal lands by deploying      methane mitigation technology. Currently, more than $330      million worth of natural gas is wasted on public and tribal      lands each year, meaning that taxpayers could lose out on      $800 million in royalties over the next decade due to venting      and flaring of this gas. Repealing this rule would harm      public health and reduce revenue to the federal government      and Western states. The BLM estimates the rule's net benefits      range from $46 to $204 million per year. And economic studies      have found the technologies and practices included in this      rule to be very cost effective since the gas captured can be      sold to the benefit of industry and taxpayers. Leaked natural      gas contains volatile organic compounds, an asthma irritant;      benzene; and other hazardous air pollutants that are known.      carcinogens. After Colorado implemented a similar rule,      natural gas production increased, and the standard has been      popular.       The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is a blunt instrument      that seeks to undermine the federal rulemaking process. It      allows Congress to overturn a recently finalized rule--major      or otherwise--through an expedited process called a      Resolution of In the Senate, a Resolution of      Disapproval requires only a simple majority vote, may      circumvent the committee process and cannot be filibustered.      If the resolution passes and is signed by the President, the      rule becomes void and the promulgating agency is prevented      from issuing a rule that is ``substantially the same'' in the      future without an act of By essentially voiding the      rulemaking process and mandating that substantially similar      rules not be pursued in the future, the CRA on the BLM's      Methane Rule wastes taxpayer money and defies the public      interest.       We request that you vote in opposition to this attack on      commonsense standards which limit wasted resources and      protect the American taxpayer, public health, and the      environment.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the tens of thousands of      members of the undersigned medical and public health      organizations, and the communities we serve, we strongly urge      you to oppose any Congressional Review Act resolution of      disapproval that would block air pollution limits that      address the leakage of methane, including the Bureau of Land      Management (BLM) Methane and Waste Prevention       The Congressional Review Act is a blunt tool that would      permanently block actions by BLM to reduce dangerous and      wasteful methane leaks from the oil and gas industries. Use      of the Congressional Review Act would not only block current      actions to solve manageable problems; it would also prevent      BLM from moving forward with substantially similar actions in      the future.       Methane fugitive emissions (leaks) occur from oil and gas      wells, drilling-related infrastructure and natural gas      pipelines. Estimates of the amount of methane lost to leakage      range from 9.3 percent to about 12 percent. Not only are      these leaks wasteful, but they also create dangerous threats      to health.       Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases recognized as      hazardous air pollutants, accompany the methane extracted      from deep underground wells. VOCs include benzene, a known      human carcinogen; ethylbenzene, a probable carcinogen; and      toluene, a neurotoxin (affecting the nervous system) that may      also cause miscarriages and birth defects. Comprehensive      methane limits would immediately reduce emissions of these      life-threatening substances.       VOCs are also precursors to the formation of ground-level      ozone, a dangerous air pollutant that causes permanent lung      damage. By limiting emissions of VOCs, oil and natural gas      limits will reduce the risk of ozone formation in the air      and, thus, the risk of ozone-related health effects,      including asthma attacks, hospital admissions and premature      deaths.       Finally, methane itself is a highly potent driver of      climate change, one of the greatest threats to public health      in our time. Methane is an extremely powerful heat-trapping      gas; over its first 20 years in the atmosphere, it is 84      times more effective at retaining heat than is carbon dioxide      . . . The resulting higher temperatures mean longer and      hotter heat waves and more ground-level ozone; these in turn      contribute to asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease, heart      attacks and premature death. Climate change also increases      the frequency and intensity of storms, droughts, wildfires      and flooding; these are associated with accidental deaths,      crop losses, air pollution, water contamination, and the      spread of disease-causing pathogens. If we as health and      medical organizations are to protect the public's health, it      is vital that our nation make progress in the fight against      climate change.       The Congressional Review Act, if applied to BLM's Methane      and Waste Prevention Rule, would block feasible, affordable      steps to reduce methane leakage. It would deprive Americans      of vital protections from carcinogenic and neurotoxic      substances and from climate change. Please make the health of      your constituents your priority and reject the use of      Congressional Review Act resolutions on actions that would      protect our health and our current and future wellbeing.

13900,topic-id,3190,"Mr.President, we have come to a crisis in our country. My State of West Virginia has the highest drug overdose death rate in the West Virginia reported 818 overdose deaths last year--four times the number that occurred in 2001 and a nearly 13-percent increase over 2015. We lost more than 700 West Virginians who died from an opioid overdose last year. Some 42,000 people in West Virginia, including 4,000 youth, sought treatment for illegal drug use but failed to receive it because of a lack of treatment centers, which we have been trying to correct. In West Virginia, drug overdose deaths have soared by more than 700 percent since 1999.  West Virginia had the highest rate of prescription drug overdose deaths of any State last year--31 per 100,000 people. In West Virginia, providers wrote 138 painkiller prescriptions for every 100 people. Think about this. Doctors are prescribing and manufacturers are producing. They have written 138 painkiller prescriptions for every 100 people in my State--the highest rate in the country. I hope Arkansas is not facing the same dilemma we are.  Every day in our country, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose. Opioids now kill more people than car accidents. In 2015, the number of heroin deaths nationwide surpassed the number of deaths from gun homicides. Since 1999, we have lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription drug opioid abuse.  Mr.President, 2.1 million Americans abuse or are dependent on opioids. According to the CDC, three out of four new heroin users abused prescription opioids before moving to heroin. Heroin use has more than doubled among young adults ages 18 to 25 in the past decade. Forty-five percent of the people who used heroin were also addicted to prescription opioid painkillers. Between 2009 and 2013, only 22 percent of Americans suffering from opioid addiction participated in any form of addiction treatment.  Misuse and abuse of opioids cost the country an estimated $78.5 billion in 2013 in lost productivity, medical costs, and criminal justice costs.  Every week, I come to the Senate floor to read letters from West Virginians and those struggling all throughout our country with opioid abuse. The reason I do this is because it is a silent killer. We don't talk about it. There is not one of us in the Senate, not one of us in Congress, not one of us in any gathering who doesn't know someone in our immediate family, extended family, or a close friend who hasn't been affected, but we would never talk about it because it was so embarrassing--how did it ever break down in our family, whether you had a model family or you thought you did. This is a killer. Whether Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, this is a killer. It has no discretion. It has no partisan base. It goes after one and the other. So this is what we are dealing with.  The letters I read have a common theme: They all mention how hard it is to get themselves or loved ones into treatment. Sometimes it takes months, and sometimes it never happens. This problem stems from our lack of a system to help those who are looking for help. We need permanent funding to create and expand substance abuse treatment facilities to help people get clean and stay clean.  I know the Presiding Officer has heard this before, but that is why I introduced the LifeBOAT The LifeBOAT Act puts one penny per milligram of opiates--basically, one penny for every milligram of opiates produced in America, consumed in America--into a fund that pays for treatment centers. In the Presiding Officer's beautiful State of Alaska and my State of West Virginia, people need treatment. This is an illness. I used to look at it 20 years ago as basically a criminal act, and we put them in jail. Guess what. They came out of jail just as addicted as they went in. Nothing changed, so I am willing to change. I have always said that if you can't change your mind, you can't change anything. This is an illness that needs treatment, and we are responsible for that. This lifeboat would establish a steady, sustainable funding stream to provide and expand access to substance abuse treatment.  Today I am going to read a letter from parents from West Virginia who lost their son to drug abuse. This is Renee and Criss's letter, which they want me to read. This fine-looking young man was a father, and this is such a tragic ending to this story.       Dear Senator Manchin,       I am writing to you in the hope of bringing to light the      devastating effects of heroin addiction, overdose death and      the difficulty in finding treatment for those afflicted with      the disease and their families.       On November 12th, 2016, we lost our 23-year-old son, Nick,      who died from what we thought at the time was a heroin      overdose. When Nick's autopsy report came back, we discovered      that his body contained no trace of heroin in his system. He      had died from a fatal dose of straight fentanyl.       Nick was a quiet, kind and inquisitive child. He learned to      speak and read at an early age and spent most of his time      absorbed in books and riding his bike and scooter. He also      loved playing in the woods and dreaming up adventures with      his sisters and neighborhood friends. He was a protective big      brother, and he had a natural way of connecting with kids who      were ``different'' and making them feel accepted.       Nick was always tall for his age. He came into this world      on July 5th, 1993, weighing in at 10 pounds and topped off at      6'8"". He loved sports and excelled in basketball and soccer.      He even met you when you were Governor Manchin, after his      basketball team traveled to Charleston, WV, to celebrate      their A State Basketball Tournament Championship in 2011.       After high school he went on to play basketball for the      Glenville State College Nick wasn't able to keep      his grades up and had to drop out of Glenville after the      first semester of school. Shortly after that, he met a girl.      They instantly connected, and he soon became a father to her      daughter. After several years together, they had a son of      their own.       After having difficulty holding down jobs and providing for      his family, Nick came to me in November of 2015 and told me      that he was addicted to opiate prescription drugs. We had      suspected drug use for quite some time but didn't realize the      extent of it. He said that he could no longer live the life      he was leading and needed help. Nick and his girlfriend had      started using opiate-based prescription drugs after she was      prescribed them for her recovery from the birth of her      daughter in 2013. At first, they would make trips to the      doctor or quick care with fake ailments in order to get their      prescriptions. If they couldn't get prescriptions, then they      bought from drug dealers. The pills were easy to get up until      the time he came to me for help.       I told my husband about Nick's drug problem, and not      knowing what to do, we turned to the Internet as a source of      information. We found a lot of information and many treatment      centers across the country. I began calling a few of the ones      that looked reputable, but in each case, they required three      to five thousand dollars up front for a 28 to 30 day      treatment. The question now was: Were these treatment centers      as good as they appeared to be on their websites or were they      simply out to make a profit and marketing their centers to      bring in more patients?       While we researched and tried to make a decision, Nick, not      wanting to be away from his family, went through detox at      home and had convinced him and us that he could do this on      his own. Nick made it through his first round of self-detox      but started using again for a short while at the end of      We confronted him, and he immediately started his      second round of self-detox. He again swore that he could do      this himself and was finished with the life he was leading.      We were still trying to figure out what to do with him and      what would happen to his family while he was gone. We didn't      know that his girlfriend was also using and detoxing along      with       After speaking to several people at a local treatment      center and trying to arrange for him to be admitted, we were      told that they wouldn't take him because [of] our insurance.      My next course of action was to call local counseling centers      that offered addiction counseling, hoping that they would be      able to offer advice. Each one I called politely told me that      they couldn't help.       Nick's addiction, and our focus on him, was taking away      from our being able to celebrate and focus on our other      children, Nick's two sisters. We decided to put Nick on the      backburner while we prepared for our daughter's graduation      party and the school events that preceded it, thinking that a      few weeks wouldn't hurt. Were we ever wrong!  It is a sad scenario when a family has to hope that their child gets arrested[[Page S2063]]and gets a conviction record so they can go to a drug court to get treatment, that that is the only help they have.       One of our daughters had learned that Nick could get      treatment if we pressed charges against him for theft. He      would be charged, then court-ordered to be sent to an      addiction treatment center. She felt that this was the best      course of action to get Nick the help he needed, but Criss      and I were hesitant because of the negative impact a felony      charge would have on Nick's life if the charges weren't      expunged after completing his treatment.  Which is our what we call fresh start or last-chance bill, which the Presiding Officer has been so graciously looking at and hopefully will be a part of this. It is a shame they fall into this.       Our decision to not go this route caused even more anger.  Since they knew that, hindsight being 20/20, this was the only way to get Nick help.       Little did we know that, by late-March or early April, Nick      and his girlfriend had decided to celebrate their being clean      by using heroin ``just this once'' as a reward for staying      clean.  They were rewarding themselves by using heroin to celebrate being clean. Now, understand, that is not proper thinking. That is not rational common sense.       In the past, the two had snorted heroin but had never      injected it. When they went to buy from their dealer, he told      them that since they didn't have much money and there were      two of them, they could get a better high with less heroin if      they injected it. And that was the beginning of a rapid      decline.       On June 2, 2016, Nick had his first overdose. Without our      knowledge, his girlfriend had taken Nick, along with the      children, to the emergency room, where he was treated and      released within a few hours. Unbeknownst to us, this      initiated a call to CPS that would result in her daughter's      father taking custody of her and CPS involvement for Nick and      his girlfriend and their son.       At the hospital, Nick and his girlfriend talked with a      doctor out of Pittsburgh about They agreed to try      the program. I traveled with Nick, his girlfriend and her      mother for the first visit to They had a high      success rate, and it was decided that once the treatment was      established, the two would go to Pittsburgh once a month for      drug testing, counseling and their Suboxone prescriptions.      The clinic would line up additional support services in      Parkersburg or close by. We were very impressed with the      clinic, their staff and their program, which only took on 100      patients at a time.       Criss came to the next meeting two weeks later to speak      with the counselors and was now more comfortable with the      treatment plan. Unfortunately, when the counselors tried to      set up local support services, they were shocked to find the      small number of places that treated addiction and the fact      that the ones that were here would not provide services for      patients who were not in their program. The decision was made      to increase their sessions to twice a month and eventually      once a week when it became apparent through consistent      ``dirty'' screens that the two were struggling with the      program [and still using].       In August, his girlfriend suffered an overdose. The      Pittsburgh Clinic called shortly after that and said that      they were releasing the two from the program, letting us know      that they needed a more intense treatment plan than they      could provide. I called the CPS case worker and addiction      counselor that were assigned to watch over the children and      monitor the two after Nick's overdose in We all met at      the house to determine the next course of action. After      numerous phone calls, we were able to find an ``open'' bed in      Las Vegas, Nevada, for Nick, while his girlfriend would      decide the following week to go to a treatment center in      Fairmont,       In less than a week, Nick was on a plane to Vegas, eager to      begin a new, clean life. He was upbeat and positive before he      left, excited by the prospect of finally leaving behind the      life of addiction that he'd been living for so long. During      his phone calls home, he had positive things to say about his      treatment. He was staying in nice homes that were part of the      treatment center. Along with their daily treatment schedule,      they were taken on hikes and went go-cart racing. He even had      a manicure at the facility's salon. The purpose of these      activities was to teach the patients natural ways of      experiencing highs.       Nick's release date was scheduled for October 3rd. There      were longer-term treatment plans offered at the facility, but      Nick missed his son and worried about his girlfriend and      wanted to come home. The treatment center had set up group      sessions for him three times a week for a period of about six      weeks.       Nick came home on a beautiful, sunny day. I waited at home      for him with his son, who had been staying with me, and his      other grandmother.  I wish we had this picture of his son, a beautiful little boy.       When I saw Nick for the first time, he looked beautiful. He      looked and acted like the Nick that we had known before      addiction. He told us about his stay in Vegas and was      literally shining with hope! He told me, ``Mom, I will      never go back to that life!'' And I believed it was      possible.       That hope began to fade pretty quickly. Nick had started      working about six weeks before he left for rehab. It had      taken him a long time to get that job and he enjoyed it and      felt that he could actually provide for his family if he      could work his way up. However, after rehab he was unable to      secure a job. Nick was going to his scheduled group sessions      and going to nightly NA meetings for support. Nick finished      up his six weeks of group therapy. He was so proud when he      received his ``sixty day's clean'' chip at the NA meeting.      Seven days later he and I spent part of the afternoon      together. He wanted to look for a job and I had some errands      to run. He dropped me off where I needed to be and applied      for jobs. When I finished, he picked me up and I took him to      Sam's Club to show him cute toys for his son for      We picked out a racetrack together and I showed him a few      other things I had bought for my grandson. I had mentioned      that Criss might get his son a basketball hoop for Christmas      and he told me, ``No Mom, I want to buy that for him with my      own money.''       We had a good afternoon together. He had made plans for the      evening, to meet up with some of his high school friends who      were in for the weekend. He left my house around eight      o'clock and I heard him return around 12:35 am. All of his      friends later said that he'd had a good night. He was happy      and smiling and there was nothing to indicate that there was      anything wrong. Shortly after I heard Nick come in, my      grandson's crying woke me up and I woke to change him, give      him a bottle. I headed back to bed and noticed the light on      in the bathroom and knocked and opened the door. It was      around 1:45 am and Nick was lying on the bathroom floor with      no pulse and not breathing. I called 911 and began      Within minutes the ambulance arrived. They worked on him for      some time while I spoke to the police officer then they took      him out to the ambulance. I assumed they had stabilized him      enough to transport him and waited for my in-laws to arrive      to watch our grandson.       When Criss and I were called back into the emergency room      we did not expect to hear that Nick had passed. We didn't      expect that we would have to call our daughters to tell them      that their brother was dead or that we would sit in a room      with him feeling him go cold while we waited for our daughter      to arrive from We weren't able to get in touch      with our other daughter and had to send my sister over the      following morning to tell her the news. We didn't expect that      in less than two days we'd be picking out a coffin and      cemetery plot for our son.       We expected that we would be sending him back to treatment      in the hope that the next round would be successful. We      expected another chance. And what we have now is the      knowledge that we failed our son in the worst way possible.       Sincerely,       Renee and Criss  There is a picture that would be hard to show because it was the most moving picture I have ever seen. They sent me the picture of Nick, this wonderful young man, lying in a casket and his little boy tiptoed up holding on. That should move all of us to do the right thing here, to start finding treatment centers, to start working with this illness, to find ways to understand, and to start intervening. You have to intervene from inception, from birth and all the way through, educating children. It is destroying economies. It is destroying families. It is destroying, basically, communities all over this country.  It is something that I hope we all can fight. To lose a young man--this was a terrific young man, and to lose him to drugs is uncalled for.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan).

13909,topic-id,2040,"Madam President, here in America we hope that families will have the opportunity to build successful lives in preparation for a beautiful retirement. That involves many different factors. It involves the solvency of Social It involves the foundation of a good, living-wage job. It involves, certainly, the question of whether, through one's life, they are able to save for retirement.  This has become more and more important over time because fewer and fewer jobs have a retirement pension plan. Without that, it is really incumbent on the individual to be able to succeed to put money aside, and we know how difficult it is for an ordinary working family to have the extra funds to be able to put into a retirement account. Certainly, we want to make that as simple and as easy as possible. But what we know is that the simplest strategy--which is to be able to save through your work, to be able to have funds automatically deducted from your paycheck so you never actually get it in your hands--is often unavailable.  According to one 2013 study, 40 percent of small business owners themselves had no retirement savings, 75 percent had no plan to fund their own retirement, and of those who are working for employers who hire and have 100 or fewer employees, more than 60 percent--62 percent of the workers--do not have access to a work-based retirement plan.  We can imagine the difference between going to work at a job where the employer says: Hey, we have a retirement plan. You just need to sign this document, and you will be part of it. Please sign up. After a few months, if you feel you can't afford to keep setting those funds aside, you can change what you are doing. You have that flexibility. You can choose between options for different types of investments. But it is all right there. It is all very easily accessible. All you have to do is do it. The difference between that and a situation where there is nothing in the workplace--no benefit in the workplace, no retirement structure--is that in that situation it becomes a much more complicated undertaking.  Fifty-five million Americans--nearly half of private sector workers--work for employers that do not offer any form of workplace retirement saving or pension plan. Roughly 45 percent of working-age households, half of which are headed by someone between 45 and 65 years old, lack any type of retirement account asset.  So if there is no structure to make it simple to plan for retirement, it is more likely that one goes into those golden years without any form of gold; that is, without the resources in the bank to back up Social  We know that more than half of the folks who are on Social Security depend on it for more than 90 percent of their income. Or, more simply stated, for more than half of Americans in retirement, Social Security is essentially their only source of support, and it is often not enough to maintain even the minimal essentials of life.  Why is it that so many businesses don't set up a workplace plan? What it[[Page S2070]]really boils down to is complexity for the employer. A lot of small businesses don't have a human resources person. They don't have an extra individual who can do the administrative work to set it up. Maybe the plan requires a match, and the employer isn't sure they will be able to afford a match. There are all sorts of reasons that this is complicated. It is difficult either financially or just in terms of additive overhead for a small business. So they don't set up the plan.  We know that if they had a plan, employers would participate. We know that because in States that have plans, the employers participate. In addition, the General Accounting Office did a study in 2015 which found that the overwhelming majority of workers would participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan if they had the opportunity to do so.  So this brings us to the fact that many States are saying: Let's make it easier for employees. There are 30 States that are looking at the possibility of the State setting up a retirement plan that wouldn't be attached to a single employer, so that an individual could carry it with them. For example, imagine that your teenager has their first job serving yogurt--one of the jobs that my daughter had--or as a lifeguard at a local swimming pool or serving coffee--those first service jobs they get. What would happen if, from that first job, 3 percent of their income was placed automatically into a retirement account--a retirement account that they could control the options of, a retirement account where they could increase the amount of their income to go into it if they wanted, or a retirement account that they could always opt out of if they chose to do so. But if they were automatically enrolled, we know the vast majority of individuals stay in the plan. If you go, then, automatically from job to job to job--and in our economy that is the way it works; people don't sign up with one company and serve there for 30 or 40 years--in every job 3 percent was being automatically deducted. Then when you actually went into retirement, you would have a sizable nest egg to complement Social  That is what States are looking at. That is what they are pursuing. In more than half of the country, States are considering legislation to create a retirement savings opportunity for small business employees who do not have a work-based plan. Seven States, including my home State of Oregon, are already working at implementing these plans. On July 1 of this year, Oregon is going to launch its plan with a voluntary pilot group, and then it is going to expand to employers with 10 or more workers in 2018 and finally to all employers in the State in 2019.  Under this plan, employees who do not have an employer-provided savings account will be allowed to save part of their paycheck in their own personally managed accounts, and it will be automatically deducted unless the employee decides to opt out. Once it expands to all employers, 800,000 Oregon workers are expected to have access to a State-sponsored retirement savings program. Again, this will be an automatic-in, opt-out strategy to make it really simple.  In Oregon, 95 percent of our businesses are made up of small businesses. More than half of our workers are employed by those small businesses. So this is a pretty good arrangement to facilitate this opportunity.  Now, here is something that we may not immediately think about. When an employee saves for their retirement and is, therefore, financially better off in retirement, it reduces the cost of government programs. Within the first decade after these plans are established, total State spending on Medicaid could drop by $5 billion. In Utah, a recent study found that the State would save $3.7 billion for five essential government support programs--not just Medicaid--over the course of 15 years.  When I first read about Medicaid costs dropping because of a retirement plan, I said: How does that work?  It turns out to be very simple. If you have saved money and are financially better off, you are not in a position where you would be in the Medicaid Program, thus reducing the number of people who are in it. This study found that over 10 years, for the States that are already working to implement plans, California would save more than half a billion dollars; Maryland would save more than $100 million; Connecticut and Oregon, about $60 million a piece; and Illinois, a quarter of a billion dollars. So that is just an interesting piece that we should be recognizing--that when families do better, not only do they do better, but they lower the cost of government programs, which I think many folks here, on both sides of the aisle, would say would be a terrific thing.  Then there is this principle of experimentation at the State level. Why would we in this Chamber, having failed to provide an automatic-in, opt-out opportunity as people move around the country to various jobs, having failed to do a Federal version of this, stop our municipalities and our States from experimenting to see if this is something that will increase the success of our families? Why would we stop a State from experimenting?  Now, I hear all the time here about States' rights. I hear all the time about how States are the place for experimentation, to see what works and what doesn't work, innovation. Give them the opportunity to try things. Well, this Congressional Review Act proposal says the opposite. It says: Let's stomp out experiments by our municipalities. Let's devastate and decree that you cannot experiment and innovate at the State level on a very significant challenge facing So whether you want families to succeed or whether you simply believe in the power of local innovation and opportunity, you should be against this proposal.  What this proposal is about is this: There is a twist in the national retirement law known as ERISA that an employer might possibly have liability related to an employee signing up for a State-sponsored or a municipality-sponsored account. Well, that pretty much puts a wet blanket over employers signing up under these State plans or under these local plans, because the thought that you might have liability for something you have no control over doesn't sound like a good place to be. So to correct or clarify this, a regulation was issued and it should be obvious why it is right, which is that the employer will not have liability over provisions of a State- or municipal-sponsored retirement account. They didn't set it up. The employer didn't advocate it. The employer is not choosing where the investments go within the account. They are not deciding which companies' retirement plans get to participate as options or whether there are even company retirement plans. The employer is not doing any of that. The employer is simply the host. The whole point of the plan is to make it very easy for the employer, because that has been the burden in the past of an employer-by-employer plan. In this case, it is just automatically set up.  In States like Oregon, they are setting up a pilot project, where employers are willing to experiment and be a part of it so they can learn from that. Then, they can design a better plan for larger small businesses, those that have more than 10 employees. Then, they can make it, after having worked the kinks out of it, work for everyone, including very small employers. If along the way they run into an obstacle, they can pause and work on that.  This is absolutely the best in policy strategy in Give municipalities, give States the opportunity to experiment, and on an issue that can help families thrive, help our young ones thrive.  I know that my son and my daughter are going to be better prepared for retirement and in a better financial position if, in every job they pursue in Oregon, they are automatically saving 3 percent of their income--or more if they choose to or less if they opt out. But certainly, the vast majority of workers, once in a plan, stay in the plan. It is kind of how it is with deductions on your Federal and State taxes. When it comes out of your payroll automatically, you get used to it, you adjust to it, and you say: Hey, that works.  So, to my colleagues, please oppose this Congressional Review Act proposition that will squash innovation by municipalities, and its companion will squash programs by States--programs that are very valuable, both for us to understand possible important policies to help set a platform for the success of our families, and it is very important[[Page S2071]]to the families themselves.

13916,topic-id,2460,"Mr.President, the most important words in our Constitution are the first three words. Our Founders made sure that, when the Constitution was written, those were displayed--``We the People''--in super-sized font so that, generations later, we would not forget what our Constitution is all about.  Our Constitution was not crafted to create a government that would make decisions by and for the powerful. It was not crafted to create a government that would make decisions by and for the privileged. That was the power of the ``we the people'' vision, as President Lincoln so eloquently stated, ``a government of, by, and for the people.'' Well, that is the vision we have the responsibility of maintaining, and it is a vision that is facing a dramatic test in this coming week--a test that affects the integrity of this body, a test that affects the integrity of the Supreme  Back in January of last year, a Supreme Court seat came open. A Supreme Court seat for which the President had a responsibility to nominate a replacement, a new Justice to serve on the We here in the Senate had a responsibility--a responsibility to exercise advice and consent. That meant that we would vet the nominee, that we would research, have a committee hearing, have a committee vote, and then forward it to the floor, where we would have a floor debate. But for the very first time in the history of the United States of America, the majority party decided that they would not exercise their constitutional responsibility, that they would instead steal this seat from the Obama administration, wrap it up, pack it into a time capsule, and send it into the future, in hopes that they would be able to succeed in packing the Court by having a different President, a more conservative President, proceed to fill the vacancy.  I am going to go through the 16 cases in our history where there has been a vacancy during an election year, and in 15 cases, the Senate acted. But last year, this Chamber refused to act, for the first time, in trying to exercise a seat-stealing, Court-packing scheme, and that diabolical act against our Constitution will have its final chapter of discussion next week. I think it is important that the Members of the Senate understand the history of the United States of America and the setting in which this debate is going to occur.  If you read the Constitution from start to finish, nowhere does it say that the Senate has the option of refusing to consider a Supreme Court nominee in the final year of a This strategy was announced within hours of Judge Scalia dying. And why would the majority choose to reject their responsibility under their oath of office? Why would they choose to do that? Certainly it wasn't because Merrick Garland wasn't qualified. He hadn't been nominated yet. Certainly it wasn't because there was a precedent because there was no precedent in U.history for stealing a Supreme Court seat.  Here is what transpired. The majority said: This might be a nominee who will fight for the ``we the people'' vision of our Constitution, and we don't want that because we are committed to a different vision--a vision of government by and for the most powerful people in the United States of America--and we want to make sure that the Court has a 5-to-4 majority to keep turning the Constitution on its head, destroying the vision that this Constitution, our Constitution, was designed for.  Well, the President proceeded to carry out his responsibility despite the fact that the majority said: We are not going to consider your nomination because we are not going to honor our responsibilities under the Constitution.[[Page S2077]]Despite that, the President said he would honor his responsibility, and he nominated Merrick Garland on March 16.  The story here in the Chamber was that if he was on this floor, he would have plenty of votes, far more than 60 votes to be confirmed. So that kind of hardened the opposition, because there were more than 60 Senators who were going to say: Yes, let's embrace this mainstream judge who wants to fight for our ``we the people'' But the leadership said no.  What have we seen unfold over the last few years of dark money ruling American campaigns? In 2014, we saw the Koch brothers decide that they wanted to control this Chamber, so they said: We are going to spend vast sums to elect a majority that will respond to our perspective as billionaires, coal and oil billionaires, kind of like a government by and for the powerful.  So they spent huge sums of money in Arkansas and in Louisiana and in North Carolina and in Iowa and in Colorado and in Alaska and in my home State of Oregon, and they won most of those Suddenly, there was the majority they had hoped for.  Then they sent a warning message to the Republican leadership in the form of this: In January 2015, the Koch brothers said: Pay attention because we plan to spend nearly $1 billion in the next election, 2 years from now, and if you cross us, you might know the consequences because we can spend money in primaries as well as in general elections.  That is the background on how the Senate majority decided to steal this seat for the first time in U.history.  Just to make sure we are checking all of our facts on this, let's take a look at those various vacancies. As I mentioned, there have been 16 in our history. In one group of nominations, those vacancies occurred after the election, so there was very little time for the Senate to act.  Nominee John Jay--President John Adams--was nominated on December 18. At that point in time, the new President took office in March, so there wasn't very much time, but nonetheless the Senate acted and confirmed the nominee, and, in kind of an interesting twist of fate, the nominee turned down the post.  When Ward Hunt was nominated by Ulysses Grant in December of 1872--again, just a couple of months before the next President would come in--the Senate acted.  Let's take a look at William The nominee from President Rutherford Hayes was also nominated in December of that year, just months before the new President would come in, but nevertheless the Senate acted.  In all three cases, they confirmed the nominee within that short period of time. They debated. They vetted. They acted. They fulfilled their responsibility under the  Now there is another group of nominees in an election year where the vacancy occurred before the election, but the nominee was nominated after the election, and there are four in that group. We have President John Quincy Adams, who nominated John The day he nominated him was in December of 1828--again, just a few months before the new President would take office--and in that case, it was proceeded to be acted on by the The Senate chose to postpone the action, but they acted. They took a vote. They decided.  There was Jeremiah Black, the nominee, in February 1861. There was a motion to proceed. The Senate voted, and they rejected it.  Then we have a nominee from Abraham Lincoln in 1864, and that nomination was confirmed.  Finally, under President Dwight Eisenhower, there was William Brennan, and that nomination was confirmed as well.  In all of these cases, even though the nomination occurred after the election and there was little time, the Senate acted.  There is a set of nine more nominations that occurred in an election year, and these are cases where both the vacancy occurred before the election and the nomination occurred before the election.  Nominee William Johnson under Thomas Final result: The Senate acted. They confirmed.  Edward King under President John The Senate acted. They rejected that nomination, but they acted. They tabled it.  Edward Bradford under Millard They proceeded to again reject the nomination, but the Senate acted.  Melville Fuller--nominee under Grover Cleveland--was confirmed. And realize this was in May of that year.  George Shiras under Benjamin He was confirmed. That happened in July that the nomination occurred.  Brandeis under Woodrow He was nominated in  John Clarke, also Under Woodrow Nominated in  All of these were before the election in a parallel case to the situation with Justice Scalia passing away and a nomination in the election year.  Benjamin Cardozo was nominated by Herbert He was confirmed.  So there we have 16 cases--actually, I have only mentioned 15 so far--15 cases in our history in an election year, and in each and every case, the Senate acted--in each and every case except for the tragedy, the desecration of the Senate process that occurred last year.  Merrick Garland was nominated by Barack Obama in No action. The first no action in U.history. The first stolen seat in U.history.  Let's understand that this is politics out of control when Senators would ignore their oath of office, would proceed to engage in a Court-packing scheme and steal a Supreme Court seat. This is politics completely unhinged. This is driven by the dark money of the Koch brothers. This is the powerful, behind-the-scenes puppet master telling the Senate what to do because they cannot afford to have a Justice who hadn't been appropriately vetted by conservative think tanks to make sure how they will vote on Citizens United possibly get on the Supreme Nobody knew how Merrick Garland would vote on Citizens On the Democratic side, we worried that he might sustain it. On the Republican side, they worried that he might strike it down and be a ``we the people'' But instead of engaging in responsible Senate action required by our oath of office, for the first time in U.history, the majority, driven by a powerful special interest, the Koch brothers, decided to steal the seat.  So that is the setting in which next week's debate will occur. We have heard some very self-righteous words coming from the majority side saying: Look how qualified he is. How could you possibly say there is anything wrong with this nomination?  Well, I asked my fellow colleagues to realize the reality of what they are engaged in, that they had a responsibility and that every Senate majority in U.history exercised that responsibility until last year. And it corresponds to this enormous growth of dark, secret money under Citizens United entering our campaigns. It corresponds to the threat that the Koch brothers made in January of 2015 that they were going to spend nearly $1 billion in the 2016 election.  One of our Republican colleagues said he thought the Senate should do their job. He thought we should hold a debate, we should hold a vote. And there was a tremendous pressure brought to bear on that colleague from the suppliers of this dark money, and then 3 days later he changed his position.  This is a corruption of the very foundation of our democracy, and that is why there is only one legitimate nominee who President Trump should put forward to end this act of theft, to honor the integrity of the responsibility of the Senate, and that is Merrick We don't know where he stands on lots of issues. He has been a judge who came right down the middle. He has been a judge whom everybody respected. He wasn't from the extreme. But the process of stealing the seat was to get a judge whom everyone knew where he stood, because they wanted to make sure that he would sustain Citizens United, that he would take the corporate side against the consumer time after time after time. This is why there is a tragedy unfolding right now. I urge the American people to pay attention because the very foundation of our democracy, of the integrity of our institutions are being shattered, degraded, and destroyed right before our eyes.[[Page S2078]]  Those who care about the Constitution, those who care about the integrity of the Senate doing its job under its oath, those who care about the integrity of the Court must stand up and say no to this effort to pack the court.  One of the arguments colleagues made, not knowing the history of the United States, was that there just wasn't time. There was just not enough time to consider a nominee. So here is a little bit of information regarding time. Since the 1980s, every person appointed to the Supreme Court has been given a prompt hearing and a vote within 100 days. Since 1975, the average is 67 days.  So to those who said that this seat opened up in January and there wasn't time left to have the Senate exercise its responsibility, we can see that they were just presenting a falsehood, that there was plenty of time for the Senate to exercise its responsibility. To those who said that the nomination didn't come until March, there was still 10 months left. So from the time that Merrick Garland was nominated, 293 days were left in the administration.  For Kagan, consideration took 88 days; for Sotomayor, 67; for Alito, 83; for Roberts, 63; for Breyer, 74; and for Ginsberg, 51. Do we hear any numbers equivalent to 293 days?  Let's look at Thomas, 69 days, Kennedy at 65, Scalia himself at 85, Rehnquist at 89, and O'Connor at 33. They all fall into the same pattern of a couple of months for the paperwork to be done, the investigation to be completed, and the committee to hold hearings and to act. But there is Garland, with 293 days, and the Senate failing to act.  This simply reinforces the pretense put forward that there wasn't enough time, or that there was a tradition of not considering a nominee for a seat that became available in an election year, because it has happened 15 times previously in our history, and in all 15 times the Senate acted--every single one. So every argument put forward was phony, was wrong, and was based on falsehood. It was driven by dark money puppeteers of this Chamber wanting to make sure they could keep open their Citizens United money corrupting American campaigns and debasing our democratic  So to everyone who cares about the integrity of the Senate and the integrity of the Court, let this Senate know that they must return to respecting this institution and to respecting the That means Merrick Garland must be the nominee until the Senate has acted on him, and the nominee before us must be rejected.

Forgive me if I get a little angry when I hear those on the other side of the aisle talk about Democrats' using exceptional measures, in their opinion, in order to oppose a Justice for the Supreme Come on. Everybody knows what happened here last year. The Republican majority decided to deny the President of the United States--at the time, Barack Obama--the ability under the U.Constitution to nominate a Justice to the Supreme Court, not because of anything having to do with the merits of the nominee, Merrick Garland, but simply because the President was a Everybody knows that is what happened. Everyone knows that precedent was broken and that comity was broken here in the Senate when the Republican majority decided not just to deny a vote on this floor but not to even give the courtesy of a meeting, of a hearing to Merrick Garland despite the fact that he was unquestionably qualified for that position.  It is a fiction to suggest that there is some strategy amongst Democrats on this nomination. We are all making up our minds individually. I decided yesterday that I was not going to support[[Page S2089]]Judge Gorsuch because I think he is likely going to side on behalf of corporations and special interests instead of my constituents and bring his politics to the bench in a way that I do not think squares with the people whom I represent. Yes, I am going to use my ability to vote on the floor of the Senate in order to stop his nomination.  I understand Republicans may not be happy about my decision and the decisions of others on this side of the aisle, but let's have a discussion about the merits of Judge Gorsuch, not the question of which side is breaking precedent because everybody remembers what happened to Merrick Nobody has forgotten that. This is not some quid pro quo, this is not some tit for tat, but to come down and pretend as if 2016 did not happen.  Mr.President, I would like to speak for a moment about a potential CRA--another CRA--that is perhaps coming to the floor this week or next week. It is one that would take away the ability of States to try to do something about the retirement crisis that is enveloping this country.  I speak as one of the youngest Members of this Chamber, and it scares me to death to think that half of Americans who are in their working years have no money saved for retirement today before a qualification for Social Security or Even worse, a study that I looked at the other day suggested that 58 percent of Americans who are working have not even done the calculations as to how much money they will need in order to retire.  There is a retirement crisis in this country, and you can understand why, as wages have been essentially flat for tens of millions of Americans and employers have largely left the space of defined benefit plans. And there is just no money to save when you have to cobble together your paycheck to meet your budget every week and when your employer is not putting in the kind of plan he used to and the kind of contribution he used to. So you can understand why Americans are in this position.  State governments--those laboratories of experiments that I hear a lot of my friends talk about--have come up with an idea. There are 55 million working Americans who do not have a way to save for retirement out of their regular paychecks, meaning their employers are not offering them any way to set aside a portion of their incomes in order to save.  So that is one number--55 million Here is another: In my State, 44 percent of workers do not have access to retirement plans through their employers. That is about 600,000 people in Half of my State does not have access, when they show up to work, to retirement savings plans through their employers. Yet we know that employees who have access to a payroll deduction are 15 times more likely to save for retirement--not twice as likely, not 5 times as likely, but 15 times more likely.  It stands to reason that State legislatures would step in and say: OK, for employers who are not offering plans, we are going to give employees the ability to set aside a small portion of their earnings in a privately run plan that is sponsored through the State governments.  If the employer is not going to do it, then there is really no one else other than the State governments. In a handful of occasions, the States of decided to step in and offer this option to employees.  By the way, as far as I understand, it is not traditionally a State-run plan; it is a privately run plan. It is just that the State is acting as the conduit to get employees linked with private plans and to allow for a small portion of their paychecks to be set aside. Employees are 15 times more likely to save if they have access to that payroll deduction.  This is a pretty run-of-the-mill, typical State intervention in order to try to solve a problem that is real for State legislators. So it is a mystery to me as to why we would try to take that ability away from  What we are doing is taking away an ERISA exemption for States relative to these plans. Why that is important is that ERISA is all about the employer-employee relationship. There are important responsibilities that flow from employers to employees when they are engaging in a retirement plan that is offered through the workplace. But the State is not the employer of this individual; the State is simply acting as a conduit to get that employee into a private sector plan. So the ERISA rules simply do not work. They are a mismatch for this State innovation. The Federal Government, through regulation, has recognized that.  Importantly, in my State of Connecticut, which does have one of these plans, we provide ERISA-like protections, so the protections you get in ERISA, you get through this State innovation. It is just that the way in which the Federal Government normally requires it does not make sense because the State in this case is just the conduit, not the employer.  This sort of seems like a pretty run-of-the-mill exercise of State innovative power, a fairly run-of-the-mill exercise of Federal regulatory authority to allow for this innovation to happen, and it is hard to understand why we are taking it away, why we are taking this ability away from 600,000 Connecticut residents who, frankly, will not have access to easy retirement savings without it.  We have known that set-asides in your paycheck work. That is why we have provided incentives for employers to do it. But not every employer does it. Why? Because if you are a small employer, it just may not make sense administratively to establish one of these plans. So States have decided to offer it themselves.  I know that the retirement industry may not love this idea because it might not make the same fees on these plans as it would if the plans were offered through the employer, but, frankly, these hundreds of thousands of people in my State are not going to be the retirement companies' customers without this innovation. It is not like these State-backed plans are stealing business from the private retirement plans. They were never going to be customers without their ability to put aside a little bit of money.  We have a retirement crisis in this country right now, and this is an innovative way to solve it. I know this is not yet scheduled for a vote, a Congressional Review Act vote that would take away the ability of States to offer these plans in a meaningful way, and I really hope we think twice about it. It sort of feels like we are just inventing CRAs to bring before the Senate and the We are kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel, and this one just does not make sense. This does not make sense.  Let States that want to pass this innovation, that want to give their constituents, their citizens the ability to save through payroll deductions, through payroll withholding, the ability to do that. Do not do the bidding of the big retirement providers, who may think they are going to make more money if the CRA passes, but in reality these folks were probably never their customers. Let States move forward with this innovation. Let the people of Connecticut and California see how it works so that maybe other States can learn from our experience.  I hope we can come to some agreement to leave this innovation alone and move on to some other important issue here and not risk doing something that is, frankly, going to exacerbate the retirement crisis that exists in this country. Republicans and Democrats should be trying to work together on this question of giving people more access to retirement plans.  For all of the things that we fight over, whether it be the healthcare law or whether it be a tax cut bill or a budget, this just seems like one of these issues in which we should set this CRA aside with respect to State innovations and try to find a way to find some common ground. I hope that is where we will head. It would really matter to my constituents in Connecticut, who are expecting to receive the benefit of this newfound access to retirement.  I yield the floor.

13915,topic-id,916,"Mr.President, I am deeply frustrated that Republicans, in one of their first actions following their and President Trump's disastrous attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, have decided to bring to the floor yet another CRA that would hurt workers, hurt the middle class, and hurt our economy.  Last week, millions of families sent a very clear message to President Trump and Republicans: Enough with the attempts to turn back the clock on progress for working families.  Clearly, President Trump and Republicans are not getting the message because, today, in what can only be described as a truly shameless giveaway to Wall Street, Republicans are poised to roll back a rule that would, simply, allow cities to help small businesses provide their workers access to easy, affordable, and high-quality retirement savings programs.  Before I continue, I want to reiterate what is at stake if Republicans roll back this rule. If Republicans pass this anti-worker resolution that is on the floor today, over 2 million workers in Philadelphia, in New York City, and in[[Page S2076]]Seattle--in my home State of Washington--will lose the opportunity to access a retirement savings program.  I expect my Republican colleagues to make several claims as to why they are pushing to repeal this rule, but I want to be very clear that this is a deliberate attempt by Republicans to deny millions of workers the opportunity to save for retirement just to ensure that Wall Street remains in charge of our retirement system and can continue to write its own rules.  The 2 million workers who are at risk today in these three cities are part of the nearly 55 million workers across the country, which include 2 million workers in my home State of Washington, who do not have access to a workplace retirement plan through their employers. That is about one-third of all of the workers in our country. These are workers--particularly low-income and young workers--who are putting in long hours, meeting all of their responsibilities, but who lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.  Because Congress has been unable to come together to address our retirement savings crisis, cities and States have now stepped up to help more workers save for their own retirements. These programs vary, but they all generally include several things.  First of all, they allow employers to automatically enroll workers while giving workers the opportunity to opt out. Several studies have made clear that, when workers are automatically enrolled, they are more likely to save simply because it is easier to save. We all want that, and that is a fact.  Secondly, these programs apply only to businesses that do not currently offer retirement plans, and they, in no way, limit an employer's ability to seek out and offer its own employer-sponsored plan.  Lastly, these programs are worker and business friendly. There is little paperwork required for workers to participate in the programs, and there are no added burdens to the small businesses. In fact, in these programs, employers are strictly required to serve only in an administrative capacity.  Last year, Democrats, in their working with the previous administration, pushed for guidance to provide certainty to cities and States that have launched their own retirement programs.  This guidance clarifies an existing safe harbor that allows employers to establish payroll deduction IRAs, which gives States the clarity that these programs will not be preempted by Federal retirement law while still retaining the protections under the Internal Revenue These retirement programs are safe; they are secure. This guidance merely provides flexibility to cities and States to move forward with these programs. Again, this guidance provides clarity for small businesses, which facilitate these programs for their employees, in that they may only act in an administrative capacity in operating these plans.  I think we all know what this repeal is truly about. President Trump is committed to doing everything he can to put the interests of Wall Street first. Unfortunately, with this action, Republicans in Congress are helping him do that.  It does not seem to matter if Republicans need to vote against policies they are on the record as having previously supported, like these retirement programs. Apparently, it does not matter if they need to vote to undermine our States' rights, as this resolution will do. It is becoming increasingly clear, without having a legislative agenda of their own, that Republicans are working to undo any and all rules and protections that had been put forth by the Obama administration.  It is not working. It is not leadership. It is not the kind of leadership our families deserve. After last week, I had hoped that President Trump and the Republicans would have dropped their extreme anti-worker agenda. Families nationwide are sending a clear message in marches and phone calls and letters and online and in their communities. They expect their representatives to be committed to working for them, and they are paying close attention--more than ever before--and are prepared to hold Members accountable.  This CRA is a critical vote. Families are watching. If you stand with working families, vote against this resolution. If you say you believe in States' rights, vote against this resolution. If you want to meaningfully address our retirement crisis, vote against this resolution.  I am here to urge all of our colleagues to reject this harmful repeal and to stand with our working families. That is what is at stake.  I yield the floor.

13652,topic-id,368,"Mr.Speaker, today we are seeing just how far House Republicans are willing to go to repeal the Affordable Care The party that claims to be fiscally responsible is now looking to change the rules of the House so that it can be fiscally reckless in its dangerous assault on the Affordable Care  House Republicans know that repealing the ACA will increase direct spending and the deficit by $3 trillion, and this cynical rules proposal shows that Republicans want to hide the true costs of their repeal plans from the American people.  Now, repealing the ACA would take away health care from about 20 to 30 million people. It would increase healthcare costs for everyone else. Premium growth for Americans in employer-sponsored plans has slowed since the ACA became law.                              {time}  1545  If the ACA had not been enacted and average growth remained the same, job-based premiums would be a projected $3,600 higher today.  Repeal will also harm hospitals. The hospital industry has warned that repealing the ACA could cost hospitals $165 billion and trigger an ``unprecedented public health crisis.'' Since the ACA was enacted, uncompensated care costs have declined for hospitals by approximately 21 percent. These costs cripple hospitals and are passed on to others in the form of higher prices.  Mr.Speaker, repeal would also harm the 55 million seniors and people with disabilities enrolled in In addition to ensuring free preventive services for Medicare beneficiaries and closing the prescription drug doughnut hole, the ACA lengthened the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 11 years.  Reforms in the ACA helped slow the rate of healthcare cost growth in Medicare, which means Medicare seniors pay less today than they would have if the ACA weren't enacted. Medicare spending was $473 billion less from 2009 to 2014, compared with spending if pre-ACA cost growth trends had continued. Repeal would reverse these gains and shift costs to seniors who simply cannot afford it.  Mr.Speaker, Republicans say they are fiscally responsible and that government spending is out of control, but today they will vote to add $3 trillion to the deficit with their ACA repeal bill. Their assault is not logical. I urge all Members to vote against this GOP hypocrisy.  ",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgH7-3.txt,887,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,3.0,January
13823,topic-id,426,"Mr.Speaker, New Mexico gets 40 percent of its State's revenues from oil and gas, that is, 40 percent of our teachers' pay, 40 percent of our government institutions, law enforcement, hospitals--40 percent. So when the Federal Government begins to adjust the rules, we in New Mexico take an interest because it provides our jobs and it provides the way we educate our children.  Now, we have two points of view being postulated on this argument nationwide. One says that the government is suddenly becoming the model of efficiency. I wonder where that efficiency is with regard to the $200 billion of fraud in Social Security, Medicare, and The government hasn't suddenly gotten efficient about that. Or just your local post office, has it suddenly gotten efficient about that? Or you could listen to the argument that the government is suddenly interested in the environment and we are going to make it clean.  The BLM did not say a word when the Gold King Mine spill not only was allowed, but mandated to be turned loose by the The heavy metals ran down across those public lands and currently sit in the streambeds in New Mexico, and our friends say that the government is suddenly all worried about the environment.  When you look specifically at the venting and flaring rule, we are told that oil and gas production went up dramatically in the last years. The truth is, when you dissect it down, oil and gas production on private lands went up dramatically. Oil and gas on public lands, the government lands owned by the BLM and other agencies, went down dramatically.  So when the BLM decided to go in and control the venting and flaring of gasses, then we in New Mexico looked and said, is the government suddenly being more concerned about us or is it one more wink and nod to the special interests who want to kill the industries? They have already succeeding in killing the timber industry in this country. They have the coal industry on its back, and they want to kill the oil and gas industry that provides the jobs in New  Yes, we have an opinion about that. Oil and gas production, again, educates our kids. Oil and gas production provides our jobs. It provides the way of life that we in this country are looking for. We contribute heavily to that, but we don't stand silently when the government suddenly decides our best interests are at stake.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

13674,topic-id,2031,"Mr.Speaker, I join our colleague Mr.Lewis in praising the gentlewoman's leadership as ranking member, formerly chair, of the Committee on  It is an honor to serve in this Every day we step foot on the floor is an exciting moment because we have been sent here by our constituents to represent, as I said earlier, their hopes and their hurts. To serve with John Lewis is something beyond a privilege. To call him colleague is something that is an honor for all of us. To call him friend is a joy in our lives.  I thank Mr.Lewis for his leadership on so many issues, but for speaking out so consistently on this public health issue of gun violence in our country, we could not be better served. When, in fact, the sit-in on the floor occurred under his leadership and with his inspiration, the leadership on the Republican side said it is a publicity stunt, and he replied: That is what they said the march on the Selma bridge was, a publicity stunt. It is not a publicity stunt. It is about conveying truth to[[Page H22]]the American people. And that is exactly what the Republican leadership does not want the American people to hear: the truth about obstacles to legislation coming to the floor that would reduce gun violence in our country.  So here we are with this rule that has come to the floor that is outrageous in so many ways. Some ways are very esoteric and may mean nothing on first glance to the American people, but let me tell you a few things as to why you, as a person in our country, should be interested in what is happening on the floor today.  You would expect that, after an election that was so hard fought and so focused on the economic security and stability of America's families, the first order of business would have been to say how can we find a bipartisan path to greater economic growth that creates jobs--good-paying jobs--increases salaries, and contributes to the financial stability of America's working families, giving them the confidence that they will be able to buy a home, again address the aspirations of their children, whether that is at college or other training for the workforce, and also to retire with dignity.  Instead, we come to the floor with, first, a proposal that was so outrageous that the Republicans even had to back off of it. Even the President-elect, Donald Trump, criticized the first actions of the Republicans in the House, so they backed off of that for the moment. For the moment they backed off their attempt to harm the way we deal with ethics violations in the We should be draining the swamp. They are backing off.  I am here because we are talking about, again, a big public health issue: gun violence in our country. When Members of Congress spoke and the response from the public was so great, Republicans decided that, in this rule today, they would do something so outrageous. It is a violation of freedom of speech on the House floor. It is an insult to the intelligence of the American people that they should not be able to hear this. It violates the Constitution by saying the Sergeant at Arms can take money out of your salary if he doesn't like your behavior on the floor. It is absolutely ridiculous.  But our distinguished colleague from Georgia (Mr.Lewis) has spoken, as have others spoken to that point. I want to just go to another point, and it is a health issue as well, and that is what every family in America should be concerned about about what is happening in this rules package today.  I recently heard over the weekend from my friend that a grandchild of that family was diagnosed with leukemia--3 years old, diagnosed with leukemia. What does that mean and what does this rule mean to that child's life? Well, this rule is a setup to overturn the Affordable Care What the Affordable Care Act is doing for that child is to say you cannot be discriminated against because you have a preexisting medical condition, which that child will have for life. Insurance companies cannot have limits on your annual or lifetime limits on what kind of benefits you can receive--you are 3 years old, a whole lifetime of benefits. Up until you are 26 years old, you can be on your parents' policy. That would be eliminated as well. The issues go on and on and on that would affect that child.  If that child's grandparent is on Medicare, that family is affected, too, because, in this legislation, there is a provision that would harm Medicare by changing from mandatory to discretionary.                              {time}  1615  Inside baseball, I know. But when you realize that the Republican budget has a provision in it to take away the guarantee of Medicare and say to seniors, you are on your own, you have a voucher, you are on your own, now this family is being assaulted at the earliest years--3 years old. Medicare, in the meantime, for grandparents.  In between, it is important to note the following about the Affordable Care While we talk a great deal and with great pride about the fact that 20 million Americans have received health benefits now, have health insurance now because of the Affordable Care Act, we are very proud of that. It is a wonderful thing, but it is only a part of the picture.  Seventy-five percent of the American people get their health insurance through the workplace. One hundred percent of them have increased benefits because of the Affordable Care One hundred percent of them have a rate of growth of the cost of health care greatly diminished--the lowest rate of increase in over 50 years that they have measured these rates of growth.  So if it is a question of access, if it is a question of quality of care, if it is a question of cost, the Affordable Care Act has been a magnificent success.  Can we do better?  We always like to see implementation and how we can do better, and we thought we could work in a bipartisan way to do that. But the fact is that either the Republicans do not understand what this means in the lives of America's families or do not care about what it means in that regard, that they just want to repeal.  They say repeal and replace. Repeal and replace has one thing going for it--alliteration. Beyond that, it has nothing going for it, because they would never even be able to get the votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care It is just not possible. That is why they don't have a replacement.  Do you want to know why they don't have a replacement?  They don't have the votes for a replacement.  Then they say repeal and delay.  Delay? For how long?  Delay is probably one of the most cowardice actions they could take because it says: We don't know, but we know that it would be harmful to our politics if people lose their benefits or their costs go up, so we will just delay the impact of our irresponsible action of repealing.  So we have before us the makings of this bombshell of a rule that undermines the health and economic security of America's working families in so many respects. You certainly will be hearing more from us about every aspect of it, whether it is lifetime limits. Oh, we are going to keep no preexisting conditions. You are? At what cost and to whom? We would like to see that proposal. So far we haven't. So for many reasons that are, as I say, too inside baseball to go into.  Think about your own life, you out there who said: Keep your government hands off of my They want to put their hands not only on your Medicare, but to squeeze the guarantee right out of it, the lifeblood of what Medicare is, a guarantee.  They want to block grant Do you understand that if you have a senior in your family who is in need of long-term health care, whether it is because of one physical disability or another and some related to dementia and Alzheimer's, at least 50 percent of the benefits of Medicaid go to long-term health care?  So families in America who want them to overturn the Affordable Care Act and all that that means for Medicare and Medicaid and their budget to boot, you are going to have Mom and Dad, as Richard Neal says, living in your house. You are going to be taking care of them right then and there. That may be a welcome sense of community to you or it may not. It may deprive you of opportunity that you want to provide for your children because of an ideological view of Republicans that we should not have Medicaid and Medicare, which are pillars of economic security in our families.  The very idea that in this bill they want to take mandatory money and turn it into discretionary money, subjecting it to the will of the Congress in terms of appropriations, says that they have their eye on Social Security as well. So be very, very vigilant, be very, very aware. I don't want you to be very, very scared, but there is reason to be if the Republicans work their will based on the blueprint that they have both in this bill, this rules package they are bringing to the floor, as well as what they have in their budget.  Even their nominee for President, Donald Trump, has disassociated himself--in the campaign anyway--from what they want to do to Medicare and Social Security and the rest. We will see how that holds up as we go forward. But you can be sure that the Democrats will have a big, bright, relentless spotlight on what is happening here because of what it means to you out there and your families, whether it is a child who is sick, a worker who gets benefits in the workplace which now[[Page H23]]will be diminished, or a senior citizen who relies on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  There is a lot at stake. There is an ideological difference between Democrats and Republicans on these issues. I would hope that these issues would go away and that the public would weigh in in such a significant way that the Republicans would back off, as they backed off this morning when they chickened out on their very bad proposal relating to ethics.  In order for the American people to weigh in, they have to know, which takes us back to what Mr.Lewis was talking about--they have to know. If it is the determination of this body that the Sergeant at Arms can effectively silence the voice of Members on the floor deducting a penalty from their paycheck, which is totally unconstitutional--but I guess that doesn't matter to the devotees of the Constitution that what they are doing is unconstitutional--then how will the public know?  There is a method to this madness. It is not just about the sit-in on guns. As Mr.Cohen mentioned, it is about what other ways they will deprive us of communicating with the American people about what is at stake for them, America's working families, by actions taken on this floor.  I urge my colleagues, of course, to vote ``no,'' a thousand times ``no'' on this legislation, but also to continue the fight that will unfold if it becomes the new rules of the  It is a very unfortunate day. We should be starting with a big jobs package for America's working families, not threatening their financial stability by undermining what they have paid into, systems that they have paid into, now being subjected to the whims of an ideological majority.  Again, I urge a ``no'' vote. I thank, again, our colleague, Mr.Lewis, for his extraordinary leadership over time and up to the minute today, and I look forward to following his lead as we go forward.

13918,topic-id,795,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about one of the greatest honors and privileges that we enjoy here in the As outlined in article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, one of the real honors of serving here in the Senate is the opportunity to offer advice and consent for nominees to the U.Supreme  This body has historically treated it in such a solemn manner that in over 230 years of our history, no nominee to the Supreme Court has ever been denied a seat through the use of a partisan filibuster. Unfortunately, right now, Members--colleagues from the other side of the aisle--are threatening that very precedent.  As I said on the floor earlier this year, President Donald Trump promised the American people he would nominate an unwavering supporter of the Constitution to fill the vacancy left by the late Justice This President has kept his promise. He has nominated somebody who was actually confirmed here in the Senate not that long ago by a voice vote by Members who are still here in the Senate, many of them. This was a nomination to the Tenth Circuit, a role that this man, the nominee, filled with great honor and much distinction.  Judge Neil Gorsuch's record of service lives up to the highest standards for a Federal judge. His academic and legal records are impeccable. He has demonstrated a keen understanding and appreciation for the rule of law, and he spoke so articulately in hour after hour of interrogation, actually, in his confirmation hearing just last week. Most importantly, Judge Gorsuch has repeatedly demonstrated his commitment to the Constitution and to our founding principles of economic opportunity, fiscal responsibility, limited government, and most important, individual liberty.  His testimony last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee was masterful. It absolutely convinced me that he is the man for this job. Judge Gorsuch listened to questions, carefully responded thoughtfully, and he gave an indication into his own demeanor that he would use in the Supreme Judge Gorsuch listened to questions carefully over and over. He illustrated the ability to show a balance of judgment, which is what we look for in a lifetime appointment like this. He made it abundantly clear that the role of the judicial branch is to interpret--not to make law but to interpret the law.[[Page S2080]]  In my own individual meeting with Judge Gorsuch, these same qualities stood out. I was very impressed with his disarming nature and ability to talk about issues without necessarily showing bias of his own opinion. Because of all this, I know he will serve as a Justice in the mold of Justice Scalia, that of a balanced judiciary member.  I should also point out that this is not a partisan view point. Conservatives and liberals have come out in support of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation over and over through the past week since his nomination. Neal Katyal, who served as Acting Solicitor General under former President Obama, as a matter of fact, has described Judge Gorsuch as ``an extraordinary judge and man.''  The American Bar Association, which many members of this body hold as a gold standard for judicial nominees, actually gave Judge Gorsuch its highest rating--something they don't do very often. They did so unanimously, by the way.  Those who know Judge Gorsuch best, regardless of their political persuasion, have offered ample praise and abiding respect for this well-qualified nominee.  If confirmed, I have full faith that Judge Gorsuch's rulings will be just and rooted in the letter of the law.  This nomination and confirmation come at a time in the history of this Republic when it is absolutely crucial that we have a balanced jurist as the ninth member of the Supreme Jonathan Turley, constitutional law professor at George Washington University right here in Washington, says that this past administration created a constitutional crisis the likes of which our country has never seen. Professor Turley talks about how a President has shown future Presidents a new precedent of how to run the government without Congress by blocking the Senate and actually creating the fourth arm of government--the regulators.  This is a time we have to have a jurist who will bring a balanced view for all Americans to be represented in the Supreme  I am proud to have the opportunity to support this nominee. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to put partisan interest aside, to put the best interest of the country first, and to confirm Neil Gorsuch as the next Justice of the Supreme  I take this as a huge privilege to speak out today, and I will speak more next week on the history of this nomination.

My State saw the American labor movement grow and fight to deliver the 40-hour workweek and safe workplace conditions. In Michigan, we work hard, and after a lifetime of hard work, we expect to be able to retire with dignity.  The American dream can mean different things to different people, but I believe there are some universal elements. We all want our children to prosper and see more opportunity than we have had. While we all need to have a secure retirement, we dream of passing on to the next generation--whether it is a small business or a family farm, a home with the mortgage paid off, or a nest egg that has been built up over many decades. I fear this piece of the American dream--the ability to enjoy a comfortable retirement on the strength of your lifetime earnings--is slipping further and further away for increasing numbers of  The measures we are considering this week, which would repeal the Department of Labor's safe harbor for States and municipalities developing retirement plans, would be a step backwards.

The solution that followed was Social Security, perhaps the most effective anti-poverty program ever created.  Today, we must meet that challenge once again. We must preserve and strengthen Social Security, and I will fight for that every day that I am here in the But a modern, comprehensive retirement policy must be more than just a safety net. It must be a ladder to prosperity. A ladder provides a sturdy frame to help people climb and reach new heights, if they are willing to put forth the effort.  Unfortunately, far too many Americans lack access to private savings plans. Traditional defined-benefit plans--the pensions our parents and their parents relied on--are now providing historically low rates. Now, more than ever, expanded access to defined-contribution workplace retirement accounts is critical to our Nation's economic future. Solving the retirement crisis is a complicated puzzle, but one of the most important pieces is access.  Ninety percent of Americans with access to a workplace plan report saving for retirement, while just 20 percent of those without access to a plan say they have saved. Although this difference should be as clear as night and day to everybody, only about half of private sector workers have access to a 401(k) retirement plan. This leaves nearly 60 million Americans without access to a workplace plan. Make no mistake, the numbers are clear. Workers without access are disproportionately low-income and minority workers.  In an effort to address this sweeping problem, States and municipalities have begun work to create their own programs to support retirement savings programs for workers. Recognizing that States are truly the laboratories of democracy, the Obama administration's Department of Labor put forth policies providing safe harbors to States moving forward with these innovative programs.  Today, instead of working on a bipartisan infrastructure package or legislation to support American workers and small businesses, we are debating the use of a fast-track procedure to undo these new policies and make it harder for cities and States to help tackle the retirement savings gap. If a State or city has a good idea that is helping Americans--all Americans--save for retirement, I think that is great. Why are we blocking States from creating innovative solutions? We should allow these programs to move forward so we can help workers responsibly save their hard-earned money. We should also allow these programs to move forward to see what actually works. The Federal Government certainly does not have a monopoly on good ideas, and States and cities cannot be the laboratories of democracy if we tie their hands. We need big ideas, we need small ideas, and, frankly, we need good ideas so we can get to work with what we need to do to solve this incredibly difficult problem.  A secure retirement cannot become a relic of the past. But this foundational piece of the American dream will only be true for this generation of workers[[Page S2092]]if we start working on these solutions now. As our Nation wrestles with growing income inequality, we cannot weaken our ladders to prosperity and pull out the rungs that help hardworking families take the next steps upward. Solving the retirement crisis is about empowering workers to do the right thing for their families and for their future, and repealing these Department of Labor safe harbors will only move us in the wrong direction.  I urge my colleagues to oppose these resolutions of disapproval.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

13533,topic-id,239,"Mr.Speaker, there is kind of a rather ridiculous healthcare bill that this body may or may not be considering soon.  First of all, it creates an entirely new entitlement program at the State level rather than the Federal level.  Second of all, in an unrelated matter, it provides huge tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires--mostly in New York and California--which has nothing to do with making health care affordable. I mean, it is fine. Republicans want to do that. We get that. They always want to cut taxes for millionaires, but don't put it in the same bill as we are here trying to provide health care for people and bring down our insurance rates.  Third of all, this bill that is supposed to somehow help is going to increase insurance costs to American families by 15 to 20 percent. Most families can't afford that, and 24 million people will lose their insurance.  So there is just no way, shape, or form that this bill makes any sense.  There are a lot of positive improvements and suggestions that we can make to the Affordable Care There are a lot of great ideas with us providing a public option, more pricing transparency, a lot of great ideas that probably Democrats and Republicans support; but, frankly, they missed the mark on this bill.  These aren't ideas that Democrats or Republicans support, because they are bad ideas that cost families money.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2252-5.txt,1910,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,21.0,March
13912,topic-id,2289,"Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague for his good comments regarding Neil  I rise today to strongly support Neil Gorsuch for the U.Supreme  First, there is no question that Judge Gorsuch is qualified for this job. He served as a law clerk for two Supreme Court Justices, Justice Byron White and Justice Anthony He has also had a distinguished career in the public sector and in the private sector. Finally, of course, he worked in the Office of the Attorney He worked in the Justice Department, and he had a great reputation there as well.  Of course, in 2006, not that long ago, he came to the floor of the Senate to be confirmed to the Tenth And guess what. He was unanimously confirmed by this body. In fact, at the time, Senator Hillary Clinton voted to confirm him. Senator Joe Biden voted to confirm him. Senator Barack Obama voted to confirm him, and, by the way, so did a number of Democrats who are currently serving in the Not a single Senator objected. Why? Because the guy is so well qualified.  Since then, in his 10 years on the Tenth Circuit Court, his record has shown that he is fair, he is independent, and he is a consensus builder, which only ratified what the Senate had done. It showed that, in fact, he was the kind of person who represents us well in court.  By the way, he is also a guy who knows how to find common ground. Listen to these numbers: 97 percent of the cases he has decided were unanimous decisions with the other two judges on the panel. Typically, as you know, these are judges who have been appointed by Presidents who are Republican and Finally, he has been in dissent less than 2 percent of the time. So this is a guy who 97 percent of the time is unanimous, and 2 percent of the time he is in dissent. Out of the more than 180 opinions he has written as a judge--180 opinions--only one had ever been appealed to the U.Supreme Court from the circuit court, and, by the way, that one was affirmed.  So this is a guy who clearly knows how to build a consensus, bring people together, and that is needed right now. It is needed in this body. It is needed in our country as a whole, and it is certainly needed in the judiciary.  By the way, it doesn't surprise me that he is a consensus builder. If you think about it, he was a law clerk for Justice Byron White and Justice Anthony They are both known famously as being consensus builders and being able to bring together disparate decisions to try to find a decision at the Supreme Court level. So he has seen it up close and personal. He knows how to do it.  I would say, though, in terms of this debate we are having, it is not just about Neil Gorsuch and it is not just about another seat, as important as it is, on the U.Supreme It is also an opportunity, by voting for Neil Gorsuch, to ensure that we have reestablished the proper role of this body, of the legislative branch and of the judicial branch in our system of government.  Judge Gorsuch understands that his job as a judge is not to impose his views on people but rather to apply the law, as written--to apply the law as written. That is kind of a basic part of our  He put it well in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary He said: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.'' What does he mean by that? I think what he meant is that he doesn't believe in substituting his personal views for what he is supposed to do as a judge.  So you may not like the decision, but you are constrained by the Constitution, by the law, and that is what judges should do.  He went on to say that the job of a judge is ``not about politics. . . . If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk.''  I think he is right about that. It is not about what he wants. It is what the Constitution and the law say. Judges should not legislate from the bench. That is not their job.  Judge Gorsuch and I met recently, and he has met, I think, with about 80 of my 100 colleagues in the Senate, and he has talked to them about his views privately. I was very impressed with him. I was impressed with him as a person, his background, and his family. I was impressed with his approach.  I was talking about what he said that he is not going to substitute his own personal views. He basically said to me what he said in public. He is going to uphold the law, as written, even if his personal beliefs had led him to vote against the law if he had been in my position, as a legislator. I think that is what you want in a court.  But don't take my word for it. Judge Gorsuch also has earned the respect of lawyers and judges across the spectrum. Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, who was an adviser to former President Obama and to previous Democratic Presidents, has said that Judge Gorsuch is ``a brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work with distinction.'' That is Laurence  Neal Katyal, who was President Obama's Acting Solicitor General--so a guy who knows a thing or two about arguing before the Supreme Court, because that is what the Solicitor General does with a lot of his time--has said that Judge Gorsuch's record ``should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the president who appointed him. . . . He's a fair and decent man.'' Again, this is the Acting Solicitor General for President  Yes, this debate is about something bigger than that, even. It is about Neil It is about his character, his experience, and his judgments, but it is also about something I think even more important than this division of powers in our It is about the rule of law itself. What does it mean?  Why does that matter? It matters because laws are an expression of the will of the people. The Constitution itself starts out with this idea, of course: ``We the people . . . establish this Constitution''--not ``we the Congress'' or ``we the government.'' It is we the people who govern ourselves. The government is the servant of the people under our Constitution, not the other way around.  When judges try to change the law rather than apply the law, they make themselves into an unelected legislative body. That is not just arrogant, by the way. I think that is unfair. Not because it steals legitimate authority from us, the elected representatives in Congress, but because it steals that authority and silences the voices of the people who elected us. Ultimately, that is what this is all about.  In this Republic, Congress writes the laws, the President ensures that the laws are faithfully executed, and the courts apply the law and our Constitution to specific cases that come before them. That is how it should work. That is how our Founders intended it.  I think it is more important now than ever to have a Supreme Court that understands this role and resists the urge to act as a superlegislature.  In recent decades, the Court has been increasingly asked to decide a lot of important matters that affect us all. Think about it. Healthcare, or the Affordable Care Act is an example, and[[Page S2074]]immigration, energy and environmental policies, social policies, First Amendment rights to free speech, freedom of religion, Second Amendment rights, and a hundred other issues. The Court affects all of our lives in ways that are fundamental, and rulings by the Court, of course, cannot be appealed to a higher court. All you can do is change the law. On constitutional provisions, you can't even do that.  At the same time as the scope of judicial power has expanded and as the significance of the Supreme Court's rulings has increased, there are some judges who have essentially rewritten statutes that did not suit them. They have taken the law and said: We are going to rewrite this in a way that we think works better. That is not their job.  One example I would give you is that a couple of years ago, the Supreme Court ruled, for example, that the words ``established by a state''--this was in the Affordable Care Act--could also mean ``not established by a state.'' I mean, literally, the Court said that, and that ``legislature'' could also mean a popular referendum. So they took the very words of a statute and said: We don't like the way that is written. We are going to change these words, and we are going to adjudicate this matter based on our understanding of these words, which is based on our personal opinion.  I don't think these rulings made sense logically but, more importantly, they changed the law, as written by the people and the people's  So the stakes are high here. We have to get this right. There are people who make the argument that the Constitution is such a living document, whose meaning evolves as popular opinion evolves, that we should make judges into basically pollsters or superlegislators. I don't think that makes sense. But, more importantly, I don't think it is fair, and it is one reason why so many people have felt like their voices aren't being heard, I believe, when the courts do that.  Again, Neil Gorsuch gets it. As he said in his testimony recently, his philosophy ``is to strive to understand what the words on the page mean . . . [to] apply what the people's representatives, the lawmakers, have done.''  This should be what we all want in a Supreme Court justice--someone who will fairly and impartially apply the law and protect the rights we have guaranteed by our  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I would make a plea today: I would say that in this regard, I would think Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of Justice that you would like, someone who is actually going to apply the laws that you write--that we write--and not impose his personal views.  The American Bar Association--not known as a conservative body--has unanimously declared Judge Gorsuch ``well qualified'' for this job. That is their highest rating--``well qualified.'' That is what they have given him. The ABA has noted that ``based on the writings, interviews, and analyses we scrutinized to reach our rating, we discerned that Judge Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence of the judicial branch of government, and we predict that he will be a strong but respectful voice in protecting it,'' meaning the independence of the judicial branch. That is pretty strong from the American Bar  By the way, despite these accolades he has gotten and his respect for the lawmaking that so many of us do here in this body, some of my colleagues on the other side may decide to vote against Judge Gorsuch, and they certainly have a right to do that. Of course, they do. But let's at least give him a vote. Let's give him an up-or-down vote. He deserves that. If a nominee this qualified can't get an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, it is not clear to me who could.  Some have argued recently that the standard for a Supreme Court Justice should be 60 votes in the Senate--not an up-or-down vote, not 51 votes or a simple majority. The Washington Post has looked at that recently, and the Washington Post gave the notion that it should be 60 votes three Pinocchios--that means the guy whose nose gets longer when he is not telling the truth. Here is what the Washington Post said: ``There is no `traditional' 60-vote `standard' or `rule' for Supreme Court nominations, no matter how much or how often Democrats claim otherwise.''  That is the Washington  In fact, as you probably know, two sitting Justices on the Supreme Court right now were actually confirmed by this body with less than 60 votes. Justice Thomas, a very controversial nomination at the time, was confirmed 52 to 48--hardly a tradition of confirming with 60 votes. Justice Alito was confirmed 58 to 42 only 10 years ago. In fact, as we have heard on this floor, there has never been a successful filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice in the history of this body. That is hardly the standard. So I urge my colleagues to give him a vote, and I hope the result will be the confirmation of this smart, mainstream, decent man who is so well qualified for the Supreme Court and who has made it clear, again, that he is not going to impose his personal beliefs on the rest of us but will apply the law as written, and he is going to adhere to the U.That is the kind of judge who deserves the support of all of us.

13701,topic-id,2313,"Mr.President, I come here this evening to speak on the issue of human rights in Venezuela and developments today in regard to all these issues. It is part of the broader effort my office has undertaken for a while now. It is the hashtag ``Expression NOT Oppression'' campaign.  Every week we come here to the floor of the Senate when in session and highlight political prisoners and dissidents whose lives are being destroyed by oppressive regimes around the world.  Today, I will be highlighting the case of Leopoldo Lopez, a Venezuelan opposition leader who, 3 years ago this week, led peaceful demonstrations against the regime of Nicolas Maduro, and he was thrown in jail for it.  I am honored that this week we will be visited here in Washington by Lilian Tintori, Leopoldo's wife and the mother of their two children. She is an incredibly brave woman who does not rest as she continues advocating for her husband's release and the release of all political prisoners and continues to fight for a free and democratic So I want to recognize her as she visits Washington this week to ask for our government's continued help.  Before I get into Leopoldo's case, I want to take a few moments to talk about what is happening in our own Western Hemisphere and in Venezuela specifically.  For decades, the Western Hemisphere has been neglected by our foreign policy--sadly, by administrations of both[[Page S1132]]parties. As we see all over the world, when America fails to lead and engage on the world stage, bad actors emerge and they grow emboldened, while our enemies and adversaries rush to fill the void. We see democracy under assault and with it, an assault on the universal, God-given rights and dignity of citizens throughout this region.  Despite the one-sided concessions of the past 2 years, Castro's Cuba remains as repressive as ever. In Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega ran for and won an unconstitutional third term, with his wife as the Vice Of course, we are growing increasingly familiar with the economic, social, and political disaster in Venezuela, which I shall elaborate on shortly.  By the way, I am also concerned about the impact of ongoing, rampant corruption in the region, which will undermine democratic governments and their institutions.  There is another major issue plaguing the region and threatening the security of the United States, and that is rising insecurity stemming from narcoterrorist drug cartels. In recent years, we have seen the worst of them--the FARC in Colombia--brought to their knees and to the negotiating table by the Colombian Government's efforts. But Mexico and other countries throughout Central America continue to be threatened by organizations such as these.  A third problem in the region is the lack of economic opportunity. It is simply in America's interest to have more prosperous neighbors, people to sell to and trade with. Ultimately, if people can't earn enough money to feed their families and live in a safe neighborhood, they will either pick up and leave by any means necessary, including illegal immigration, or they will join drug gangs.  I know that too often there is a tendency to overlook what is happening in our own region. Some might say: I have enough problems here at home to worry about what is going on in other countries. But I hope that everyone remembers that all of this I have described and am about to talk about ultimately has direct consequences on us here in the United States and on our people. When you have a breakdown in any of these areas, people in these countries look to leave. The first place they often look to is the freest and the most prosperous country in the region--in the world--the United States of Because it also happens to be relatively close, that creates immigration pressures on our borders and on our communities.  When economies aren't functioning, it means American workers and entrepreneurs have fewer customers abroad to sell products and services to. And when you have all of this instability, vacuums are created that foreign enemies or adversaries like North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia seek to fill, not to mention terrorist organizations. It allows for the rise of tyrants and authoritarians like Castro and Chavez, Maduro, Ortega, Morales, Correa, and others.  Today in Venezuela, all these problems have come together to bring this country--one of the richest countries in the world in terms of resources--to the verge of becoming a failed state, and today the people of that proud country are living a nightmare.  Not that long ago, Venezuela was a vibrant democracy. It had strong democratic and independent institutions. It had free and fair elections. But today in Venezuela, democracy and human rights are under assault. The country is ruled by an incompetent strongman--a criminal, a human rights abuser, someone who has perverted every independent institution in the country, and is incompetent, whether it is the judiciary, the military, intelligence, or the media--in order to entrench himself and his cronies in power.  Here in the United States, when we have disagreements, people use different rules at their disposal to prolong debates and slow things down. We are aware of that here in the In Venezuela, when people have disagreements, especially with the government, they just try to stop debates completely. For example, after the opposition party in Venezuela miraculously won the last legislative election--despite every effort by the Maduro government to steal that election--the Venezuelan state police then blocked the new members of the Parliament from going to work.  Imagine for a moment 2, 4 years ago, 2012, when President Obama was elected, if he had ordered--in 2014, when Republicans took control of the Senate, imagine if at that time the President had ordered the police to stand at the door of the Chamber and not allow Senators from the Republican Party to enter the That is what happened in Then that same government in Venezuela ordered their hacks on the kangaroo supreme court to invalidate laws passed by the National Assembly to free political prisoners.  Venezuela also has a drug cartel problem. In fact, there are officials in the highest levels of the Venezuelan Government who have even been linked to drug cartels. Among them is the former head of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, and the Vice President of that country, Tareck El I will talk about him in a moment.  We also learned last week--and I came to the floor to discuss the CNN report confirming what my office had been gathering for a while. By the way, that is going to be airing tonight on CNN, the second part of that series. We learned that organized crime syndicates in Venezuela, with the tacit approval of the Government of Venezuela, of Maduro, are running counterfeit passport rings, with counterfeit Venezuelan passports being sold to terrorists and to individuals with links to terrorism.  But it is Venezuela's economy that is perhaps the saddest story of all. The failures of Chavez-style socialism in Venezuela led to misery for people there of all ages. Not that long ago, Venezuela was a relatively rich economy. It is a rich country blessed with oil and other natural resources, and it has long had a well-educated population and vibrant middle class. But under Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela has been crumbling. Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, has become the murder capital of the world. It is one of the most dangerous cities on the planet. Venezuela is defaulting on its loans. In fact, it will owe about $6 billion in They will not be able to make those payments. In Venezuela, the grocery shelves are bare--a rich country, and they are completely bare. Everyday products, like toilet paper, are scarce, as is food. The people of Venezuela are literary starving, so much so that a recent Miami Herald article from last week detailed how people have turned to hunting and eating flamingos for food. By now, many of us have seen the images of newborn babies being put in cardboard boxes at the hospital because these hospitals can no longer afford cribs.  So it comes as no surprise that the Venezuelan people, living in misery like this--robbed of their dignity and aspiring for more than this disaster--would choose to speak up. They began to do so in full force 3 years ago this week. That is when Venezuelan students took to the streets to protest the violence and the scarcity of basic necessities due to the negligent, incompetent policies enacted by the Maduro regime. What began as a student protest soon became something bigger. It became a movement.  Government thugs responded to this movement with violence, and the peaceful demonstrations came to look like a combat zone: 43 people dead, 600 people injured, and approximately 3,400 people detained. Among those detained was Leopoldo Lopez, a Venezuelan opposition leader. The government of Maduro outrageously accused him of being responsible for all of this violence, and they threw him in jail and he has been there ever since. It has been about 1,100 days. To put that number into context, Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian was held prisoner by the Iranian regime for 544 days. The Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 lasted 444 days. In September 2015, Leopoldo Lopez was sentenced to 13 years, 9 months, 7 days, and 12 hours for his participation in the protests. In jail he has suffered physical and psychological torture.  He is the father of two young children, and he is married to Lilian He was the mayor of Chacao, and the leader of Popular Will or Voluntad Popular political party. He will be a critical part of building a[[Page S1133]]freer, more democratic, and more prosperous Venezuela, but for now, sadly, he languishes in prison.  He is not alone either. In Venezuela today, there are at least 108 political prisoners. Like Leopoldo, they each have a lot to contribute to make Venezuela a better place, but the Venezuelan Government is robbing them of their freedom, and it is robbing their families of the memories every child and spouse deserves to create with their father, husband, and loved ones.  All these political prisoners should be free. I have encouraged, publicly and privately, our new Secretary of State and the administration to make the freedom of these political prisoners their cause and to make it a priority. I know we are trying to work through our top-level Cabinet nominations here in the Senate, but we need to get people in place in other key roles throughout the administration; for example, our next Ambassador to the Organization of American States, where the United States needs to recommit to making its voice heard in that forum as a voice for democracy and human rights and for holding Venezuela's regime accountable for violations of the Inter-American Democratic  I am also pleased that today the administration announced a new round of sanctions against a key Venezuelan official. Specifically, Venezuela's Executive Vice President Tareck Zaidan El Aissami Maddah, El Aissami, as I talked about him earlier, and Venezuelan national Samark Jose Lopez Bello were sanctioned under the Kingpin Act for international narcotics trafficking.  Aissami's primary front man was Samark Jose Lopez Bello, whom I just discussed. He was designated for providing material assistance, financial support or goods and services, and support of international narcotics trafficking activities and acting for or on behalf of El Five U.companies owned or controlled by Lopez Bello have been blocked as part of today's action.  All five of them are located in my home State of In fact, all five of them have mailing addresses in South Florida where I live. Among the properties seized: A U.S.-registered aircraft with the tail number It has been identified as block property owned or controlled by PSA Holdings, LLC, controlled by Lopez Bello and by El Aissami, with funds that were able to get by conducting prohibited transactions dealing with drug traffickers.  It is an outrage that the Vice President of a country in our hemisphere not only is a narcotrafficker but is also in the business of selling passports and travel documents to people with links to terrorism.  For years now, I have been talking about how Venezuelan regime officials were committing crimes in Venezuela, stealing from the people of Venezuela, and then they spend their riches living in the lap of luxury in my hometown of These announcements today further confirmed how true this is and the extent to which corrupt regime officials have been allowed to freely travel and prance around free U.soil with impunity.  I am hopeful this is only the beginning of the sanctions today, to make sure the Maduro regime feels pressured to cease its illicit activities, to free all of its political prisoners, to tolerate dissent, and respect the will of the Venezuelan people who voted to abandon the disastrous past of Chavez and  I am hopeful this is only the beginning of making sure the Maduro regime feels pressure to cease its illicit activities and everything it is doing that has placed Venezuela on this disastrous path.  We in this country are a blessed people, to have a vibrant democracy that serves as an example to the world. With those blessings come the responsibility of speaking out when we see others yearning to be free but repressed by their government. In recent years, this body, the Senate, has spoken unanimously in support of the Venezuelan people's aspirations, and we have spoken unanimously against the Maduro regime's brutality.

A proud daughter of northwest Indiana--Gary--and the industrial working class, Kim grew up witnessing firsthand the destruction of the industrial Midwest as corporate greed destroyed the steel industry and manufacturing jobs and decimated good-paying union jobs that built the middle class. Daughter of a union factory worker, Kim attended Purdue University, where she met the love of her life, Will Kohr.[[Page S1576]]  Upon graduation, Kim began her long career in the labor movement, moving to California in 1986 to work as a journalist and an organizer with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers Union,  Kim and Will moved to Upper Jay, NY, where their daughter Emma was born and raised. Six, often seven days a week, Kim, an International Representative for the fiercely independent and democratic United Radio, Electrical and Machine Workers of America, UE, would drive hours in every direction from her family's cabin in Upper Jay, NY, to help workers, often against great odds, form their own unions and bargain contracts.  For two decades, Kim has done the hardest and some of the most important work anyone can do. Because of her, thousands of people have gained the courage to stand up and speak for themselves and for what is right. Because of her, many, many thousands of people, in Vermont and across the country, live measurably better lives.  Kim Lawson led the effort to successfully organize workers at workplaces in Vermont, including U.Citizenship and Immigration Services, Counseling Services of Addison County, Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, NHVAC, Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center, Hunger Mountain Co-op, City Market Co-op, Northeast Kingdom Community Action, and the University of Vermont; and in New Hampshire, Grafton County New Hampshire Nursing Home and Public Employees, and the National Visa Center; and in New York, Adirondack Community Action At a time when the wages and living standards of most people were under attack, Kim helped people organize collectively for a better life.  Kim was also a founder of the Vermont Workers Center and for years staffed the Workers Rights Hotline which, free of charge, has helped many thousands of workers learn and protect their rights under the law. She has trained, mentored, and led countless young organizers and workers who, inspired by her quiet, steadfast and relentless example, carry on her pursuit of justice.  In whatever task she set for herself, Kim worked with her whole heart and a deep sense of solidarity for her fellow humanity.

But the repeal-and-replace plan proposed by my Republican colleagues adds fuel to the fire. The bill eliminates the Affordable Care Act's requirement that Medicaid cover basic mental health and addiction services.  Economists estimate 1.3 million Americans receive treatment for substance abuse and other mental health disorders through the Medicaid extension.  Across the States that have expanded Medicaid, like Illinois, the program is used for 27 percent of all addiction treatment.  We are not going to arrest our way out of this epidemic; instead, we need to treat addiction like the disease that it is. Removing the mental health coverage requirement pulls the rug out from more than a quarter of all those seeking help from opioid addiction.

13780,topic-id,1859,"Madam President, I rise today on a matter of great importance to everyone in this body and everyone in America: the future of the Supreme Last night, the President nominated Judge Neil We in the Senate have a constitutional duty to examine his record robustly, exhaustively, and comprehensively, and then advise and consent if we see fit. We have a responsibility to reject if we do not. We Democrats will insist on a rigorous but fair process. There will be 60 votes for confirmation. Any one Member can require it. Many Democrats already have.  And it is the right thing to do.  On a subject as important as a Supreme Court nomination, bipartisan support should be a prerequisite; it should be essential. That is what 60 votes does.  This is nothing new. It was a bar met by each of President Obama's nominations. In my mind, 60 votes is the appropriate way to go, whether there is a Democratic President or a Republican President, Democratic Senate or a Republican  Because a 60-vote threshold is essential, those who say that at the end of this process, there are only two possible results--that the Senate will confirm this nominee or the Republicans will use the nuclear option to change the rules of the Senate--are dead wrong. That is a false choice.  If this nominee cannot meet the same standard that Republicans insisted upon for President Obama's Supreme Court nominees--60 votes in the Senate--then the problem lies not with the Senate but with the nominee.  The answer should not be to change the rules of the Senate but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes. Sixty votes produces a mainstream candidate, and the need for a mainstream, consensus candidate is greater now than ever before because we are in new territory in two ways; first, because the Court, under Chief Justice Roberts, has shown increasing drift to become a more and more pro-business, pro-special interest Court, siding more with corporations and employers and special interests over working and average This in an environment where starkly unequal concentrations of wealth and ever-increasing corporate power--aided and abetted by the Citizens United decision--has skewed the playing field even more decisively toward special interests and away from the American citizen. A mainstream nominee would help reverse that trend, not exacerbate it; and, second, another important reason we are in a new world here, making a 60-vote margin even more important than it was before--as important as it was before--is this: This administration, at least since its outset, seems to have less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory and is challenging the Constitution in an unprecedented fashion. So there is a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist.  Let's go over each point. First, we have a special responsibility to judge whether this nominee will further tip the scales on the Court in favor of Big Business and powerful special interests instead of the average American because over two decades this Court has shifted dangerously in the direction of Big Business and powerful special interests.  According to a study by the Minnesota Law Review, the Roberts Court has been the most business-friendly Supreme Court since World War It is the most corporate Court in over 70 years. It was pro-corporate when it frequently favored forced arbitration as a way to settle disputes, a process that limits the ability for individuals to form a class and collectively go after large corporate interests; it was pro-corporate when it repeatedly refused to hear legitimate cases where individuals have been harmed by faulty products, discriminatory practices, or fraud; and it was pro-corporate when it came down with one of the worst decisions in the history of the Court: Citizens By equating money with speech, the Citizens United decision cut right at the heart of the most sacred power in our democracy: the franchise of our citizens. It has poisoned our politics by allowing dark money to cascade into the system, entirely undisclosed.  With absolutely no precedent, the Roberts Court came up with the theory that money necessarily equals speech, and under the First Amendment, you are allowed to put your ad on TV 11,000 times to drown out all others, especially average That dampens the power of their voices, dilutes the power of their votes. The Citizens United decision was the worst decision in 100 years, and it is the embodiment of this new era of the corporate special interests  At a time when massive inequality plagues our economy, dark money floods our politics, and faith in institutions is low, this rightward shift in the Court is an existential threat to our democracy.  Now, more than ever, we require a Justice who will move the Court back in the direction of the people, not only because that is what the law requires but because that is what our system of government requires--summed up, of course, by President Lincoln's declaration that it is ``a government of, by, and for the people.''  Second, we must insist upon a strong, mainstream, consensus candidate because this Supreme Court will be tried in ways that few Courts have been tested since the earliest days of the Republic, when constitutional questions abounded, because, again, this administration seems to have little regard for the rule of law and is likely to test the Constitution in ways it hasn't been challenged for decades.[[Page S543]]  Just 2 weeks in, the new administration has violated our core values, challenged the separation of powers, stretched the bounds of statute, and tested the very fabric of our Constitution in an unprecedented fashion. The President has questioned the integrity of our elections without evidence, issued legally and constitutionally dubious Executive actions, such as the one on immigration and refugees, and fired his Acting Attorney General for maintaining her fidelity to the law, rather than pledging obedience to the For that, the White House accused her of betrayal.  Acting Attorney General Sally Yates offered her professional legal opinion, but because it contradicted the administration's position, she was fired, even though the very purpose of the Department of Justice is to be an independent check on any administration.  We are just 13 days into this new administration. How many more of these dismissals will take place over the next 4 years?  This is not even close to normal. Many of us have lived through the first few weeks of several administrations of both parties. This is not even close to normal.  Now, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court Justice who is independent, who eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy, protect fundamental rights, and will stand up to a President who has already shown a willingness to bend the  The Supreme Court is now the bulwark standing between a President who, in too many instances, has little regard for the law, for the separation of powers, for American ideals, for the power of the legislative branch, and for the sanctity of the  Now, more than ever, we require a Justice who will fulfill the Supreme Court's role in our democracy as a check and balance on the other branches of government.  Because this President has started out in such a fundamentally undemocratic way, we have to examine this nominee closely. As to the nominee himself, I have serious concerns about how he measures up on these two great issues I just described.  First, Judge Gorsuch has consistently favored corporate interests over the rights of working people. He repeatedly sided with insurance companies which wanted to deny disability benefits to employees. In employment discrimination cases, Bloomberg found he has sided with employers a great majority of the time. In one of the few cases he sided with an employee, it was a Republican woman who alleged she was fired for being a conservative.  He wrote in an article in 2005 that securities class actions were just tools for plaintiffs' lawyers to get ``free ride[s] to fast riches,'' ignoring the fact that these lawsuits often bring justice to thousands and thousands of people who have no power without the class action suit.  On money and politics, he seems to be in the same company as Justices Thomas and Scalia, willing to restrict the most commonsense contribution limits.  It seems President Trump, who has said he would be for the working man and woman, has not chosen someone who routinely sides with the average Instead, it seems he has selected a nominee to the Supreme Court who sides with CEOs over citizens.  Second, Judge Gorsuch lacks a record demonstrating the kind of independence the Court desperately needs right now. He has shown a tendency to let ideology influence his decisions, criticizing ``liberals'' for turning to the courts to advance policy. The irony is this: Those who blame liberals for legislating through the courts are usually activist judges themselves. In recent years, conservative judges have proven to be the true activists, completely reimagining the scope of the First Amendment through Citizens United, gutting key provision of the Voting Rights Act that had lasted for decades and decades, and attempting to roll back the established law of the land, Roe v.  Judge Gorsuch has shown disdain for the use of the courtroom to vindicate fundamental rights, a viewpoint that should be anathema to anyone in the legal system but is particularly inappropriate for somebody who seeks a seat on the highest Court in the land. Because of this, women are duly worried about the preservation of their rights and equality, as is the LGBT community. With an administration that has already challenged fundamental American rights and will do so again, the courtroom must be a place where those rights can be vindicated.  As Senators, we are endowed with an awesome power to judge whether this man, Judge Gorsuch, has the right to a title that is higher than all the others in our judicial system, the title of ``Justice.''  Therefore, we must be absolutely certain that this person is a strong, mainstream candidate who has respect for the rule of law and the application of basic constitutional rights to all Americans, a deference to precedent, a nonideological approach to the Court, and the resolve to be a bulwark against the constitutional encroaches of this administration.  Judge Neil Gorsuch, throughout his career, has repeatedly sided with corporations over working people, demonstrated a hostility toward women's rights, and, most troubling, hewed to an ideological approach to jurisprudence that makes me skeptical that he can be a strong, independent Justice on the Given that record, I have very serious doubts that Judge Neil Gorsuch is up to the job.  The Supreme Court now rests in a delicate balance. We cannot allow it to be further captured by corporate influence or bullied by Executive overreach.  The Senate has a responsibility to weigh this nominee with the highest level of scrutiny, to have an exhaustive, robust, and comprehensive debate on Judge Gorsuch's fitness to be a Supreme Court We Democrats will ensure that it does.

13895,topic-id,1746,"Mr.President, I rise this morning on a few topics, but I first want to mention that last night many of us spent some time at the White House where we were regaled by the wonderful Marine and Army chorus, where there was talk about renewing a spirit of bipartisanship in  I am all for it. Of course, we Democrats hope that the President and Republicans in Congress will sit down with us in a true spirit of bipartisanship because so far in this Congress--the Republicans in this Congress so far--the Republican idea of bipartisanship has meant to both the President and the Republicans in Congress: We come up with our plan, and you Democrats should support it. That is not bipartisanship.  The Republican leader, the House Speaker, have come up with issue after issue, including a Supreme Court nominee, with no Democratic consultation, and then said: The only way you can achieve bipartisanship is just to vote with us.  You can't improve the healthcare system with only Republican votes on reconciliation, without consulting any Democrats, without a single sentence of Democratic input, and call that an attempt at bipartisanship.  You can't do an infrastructure package of tax credits and no real spending, and then ask for bipartisan support. And you certainly can't out-source your entire selection of Supreme Court Justices to be handpicked by the hard-right, special interest-dominated Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society, and then ask for us to vote for that nominee as a show of bipartisan support.  Bipartisanship means sitting down with the other side, getting our ideas, and hashing out a compromise. It does not mean proposing your policy--particularly when these policies and nominees are so far to the right--and then making an exhortation for bipartisanship and bemoaning the absence of it when Democrats don't go along with your way. I truly hope that the President and Republicans want to renew a spirit of bipartisanship, but it has to be real, it has to be meant, and their actions have to follow suit.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Well, Mr.President, let's talk about the Supreme Court because that exemplifies exactly what I am talking about. Over the last several weeks, my Republican friends have tried to paint Judge Neil Gorsuch as the beau ideal of a neutral and impartial judge. They insist that Judge Gorsuch is a straight down-the-middle guy, someone who will call the balls and strikes. The majority leader likes to cite a letter of a friend of the judge who says ``there is no principled reason'' to oppose his nomination. Of course, there are several principled reasons to object to Judge Today I would like to focus on one in particular: Judge Gorsuch's long career ties to conservative interests and conservative ideological groups.  The idea that Judge Gorsuch would simply be a neutral, mainstream Justice is belied by his career, his judicial record, and, perhaps most of all, the manner by which he was selected to serve on the Supreme He was culled from a list handpicked by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, conservative organizations that have spent the last few decades simply trying to shift the balance of the courts way to the right. Most of my colleagues on the other side know how far to the right the Heritage Foundation is, and they often grumble at how they are pulling the party too far over, but Judge Gorsuch was handpicked by that group, along with the Federalist  Instead of consulting the Senate, President Trump outsourced his Supreme Court pick to the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation long before an election even took place. The Constitution does not say the President shall appoint the Supreme Court Justices with the advice and consent of rightwing special interest groups. It says he should appoint them with the advice and consent of the President Trump didn't consult the Senate; he never even considered it. He just consulted this list.  Surely my dear friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, must remember when President Clinton consulted him about his Supreme Court picks. Senator Hatch told the President not to select Bruce Babbitt and offered instead the names of Ginsburg and President Clinton listened to Senator Hatch and nominated them instead. Surely my good friend from Utah also remembers when he suggested to President Obama that Merrick Garland be nominated to the Supreme Court, calling him a fine man. President Obama listened and made him his pick.  President Trump is different from all of the past Presidents in so many ways, so many of them unfortunate, and here is one: Even before being elected to office, President Trump swore off the entire process and outsourced the advice and consent process to a list selected by two ultraconservative organizations.  Take the Heritage Foundation, for example. Are they down the middle? Are they unbiased? Well, let's listen to some of the things they believe in, which are way different from most It is a group that believes ``freedom'' means businesses have the right to discriminate against LGBT people. This is a group that believes ``limited government'' means eliminating resources for the Violence Against Women This is a group that believes a strong national defense means discriminatory Executive orders that bar immigrants and refugees from Muslim-majority countries. This is a group that holds extreme-right positions, a group that is far, far out of the American mainstream--and is even out of the Republican mainstream so many times--and they have handpicked Neil Gorsuch to have a seat on the highest Court in the land.  Does anyone think the Heritage Foundation or the Federalist Society would put on their list a judicial moderate who would only call balls and strikes? Does anyone think there would be all this outside, dark, undisclosed money being spent to support Judge Gorsuch's nomination if he were just someone who called balls and strikes? There is a reason all of this dark money is being spent to support him. There is a reason the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation liked Judge Gorsuch enough to put him on the President's short list. There is a reason the President pledged to select only from this list. He wanted to curry favor with skeptical hard-right, special interest-dominated conservatives during his campaign. So the idea that Judge Gorsuch would simply be some neutral Justice does not hold water.  When Republicans say that if Democrats will not support Judge Gorsuch, we will not support any Republican-nominated judge, that is simply not true. We have several reasons to be concerned with Judge Gorsuch specifically, and specifically one of those things we are concerned about is that he was pushed forward from the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society, groomed by billionaire conservatives like Mr.Anschutz, another hard-right, special interest person.  Judge Gorsuch had a chance. Most of us waited till after the hearings because at the hearings he had a chance to distance himself from these views, but he refused to substantively answer question after question.  So if Judge Neil Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, which, by the way, the American people believe is the appropriate standard for a Supreme Court nominee, it is not because Democrats are being obstructionists; it is because he failed to convince 60 Senators that he belongs on the Supreme In that event, the answer is not to permanently change the rules and traditions of the Senate; the answer is to change the nominee and do what President Clinton and President Obama did before they nominated people: Consult the other party for some semblance of bipartisanship.  The majority is trying to make this a binary choice: Confirm Gorsuch or change the rules. It is not so; it is just not so. The idea that if Judge Gorsuch can't get 60, we must immediately move to change the rules is a false narrative. If the majority chooses to go that route, they do so at their own volition. No one is forcing them to do so,[[Page S2058]]except maybe the Heritage Foundation and groups like the Federalist                              Border Wall  Mr.President, there is one thing I want to say about the wall. I talked about the wall yesterday, and I am not going to elaborate, but I would like to add to the Record a quote about the wall from none other than the Secretary of Interior, former Republican Congressman, Mr.Zinke, from Here is what he said. This is his quote about the wall, and I hope my colleagues will listen:       The border is complicated, as far as building a physical      wall. . . . The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you      going to put the wall? We're not going to put it on our side      and cede the river to And we're probably not going to      put it in the middle of the river.                          Affordable Care Act  Mr.President, finally, on the Affordable Care Act, today, 44 Senate Democrats are sending a letter to the President who puts onto paper our official offer to work with him to improve the existing law.  Last Friday, in the wake of TrumpCare's defeat in the House, I was deeply concerned to hear the President say that he wants the Affordable Care Act to ``explode.'' The President and his HHS Secretary, Tom Price, have significant latitude to either improve the law or undermine it. So far, the President has undermined the law. These were all before the vote: He discontinued the advertising campaigns to get people to sign up for coverage and worked behind the scenes to give insurers flexibility to offer less generous care, and, still, the President's Executive order directing agencies to help him repeal and replace the ACA is hanging out there after the defeat or lack of a vote in the House, causing instability in the market and giving Federal agencies permission to undermine the law. That should be rescinded.  What our letter says today is simple: If the President drops these efforts to undermine the law, we Democrats stand ready to sit down with him and with our Republican friends across the aisle in good faith to discuss a bipartisan approach to improving our healthcare system.  It is time to work together to make healthcare even more affordable but not to encourage or root for the failure of the law that would have devastating consequences for millions of  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Upon receipt of an      appeal, the Committee on Ethics is provided 30 calendar days      or five legislative days, whichever is later, to either      dismiss the fine or allow it to proceed. Upon a determination      regarding the appeal or if no appeal has been filed at the      expiration of the period, the chair of the Committee on      Ethics shall promptly notify the Member, Delegate, or the      Resident Commissioner, the Speaker and the Chief      Administrative The Speaker is required to promptly      lay such notification before the       The Sergeant-at-Arms, Committee on Ethics, and Chief      Administrative Officer are authorized to establish policies      and procedures to implement this subsection. Upon      notification from the chair of the Committee on Ethics, the      Chief Administrative Officer shall deduct the amount of any      fine from the net salary of the Member, Delegate, or Resident            The subsection also modifies rule XVII to clarify conduct      considered disorderly or disruptive during legislative      proceedings to ensure that a Member may be referred to the      Committee on Ethics for behavior impeding in the rights of      another Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner to      participate in floor proceedings, including blocking access      to legislative instruments such as microphones and blocking      access the well of the       Authorization and Oversight Subsection (b) amends      the current oversight plan requirements. The subsection      requires each standing committee (except the Committees on      Appropriations, Ethics, and Rules) to adopt an authorization      and oversight plan, which must be submitted to the Committees      on Oversight and Government Reform, House Administration, and      Appropriations no later than February 15 of the first session      of The plan must include a list of unauthorized      programs and agencies within their jurisdiction that have      received funding in the prior fiscal year, or in the case of      a permanent authorization, has not received a comprehensive      review by the committee in the prior three The      subsection requires committees to describe each program or      agency that is intended to be authorized in the current      Congress or next Congress, and a description of oversight to      support reauthorization in the current The      subsection also requires recommendations, if any, for moving      such programs or agencies from mandatory to discretionary      funding.       The subsection also provides that committees may make      recommendations to consolidate or terminate duplicative      programs or agencies, or those that are inconsistent with the      appropriate role of the Federal government. Committees may      make recommendations for changes to existing law to address      Federal rules, regulations, statutes, and court decisions      related to these programs that are inconsistent with      Congress' Article I authorities. The subsection requires the      Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, after      consultation with the Speaker, Majority Leader, and the      Minority Leader, report the oversight and authorization plans      to the House by March 31 of the first session of       Amendments to Appropriation Subsection (c) codifies      the standing order from the 112th, 113th, and 114th      Congresses prohibiting an amendment to a general      appropriation bill proposing a net increase in budget      authority in the bill.       Duplication of Federal Subsection (d) codifies      the standing order from the 113th and 114th Congresses that      requires committee reports to include a statement on whether      any provision of the measure establishes or reauthorizes a      program of the Federal government known to be duplicative of      another Federal program. The subsection also eliminates      unnecessary language regarding the authorization of a      committee chair to request that the Government Accountability      Office perform a duplication analysis of any bill or joint      resolution referred to that committee, and makes technical      changes.       Recognition of Subsection (e) eliminates from the      rules outdated references to physical mobility. This is a      clarification to address the needs of Members who are      physically unable to stand.       Convening Outside the Hall of the Subsection (f)      conforms the standing rules with current practice regarding      convening outside the Hall of the       Temporary Presiding Authority Subsection (g)      clarifies that the authority of a Speaker pro tempore      appointed under clause 8(b)(3)(A) of rule I takes priority      over the Clerk's authority to preserve order and decorum      pending the election of a new       Continuing Litigation Subsection (h)      authorizes the House, the Speaker, a committee or chair of a      committee to carry forward litigation from the previous      Congress as the successor in interest in any continuing      litigation matter in which the House, the Speaker, the      committee or chair of a committee, respectively, was      previously authorized to be involved. This subsection      automatically continues previously authorized litigation      authority and fully empowers the successor in interest to      take all steps necessary to carry such litigation forward      during the new Congress, thereby eliminating the need for a      separate resolution authorizing the continuation of such      litigation as in the past.       Clarifying Staff Access to the House Subsection (i)      conforms the standing rules to the current practice that      staff accompanying Members on the floor are not required to      remain at the desk.       Member Subsection (j) adds language to the      definition of ``Records of the House'' to clarify the      ownership of congressional office records of a Member,      Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, and to codify the      longstanding custom and practice of the House under which      such records have been recognized to be the personal property      of the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, in keeping      with the common law. Prior rules of the House drew a      distinction between the records of House committees and      officers, on the one hand, and congressional office records      of Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner, on the      other. The latter do not belong to the House, because the      Rule expressly defined House ``records'' to exclude them.      See, e.g., Rule VII.6, Rules of the U.House of      Representatives, 114th (2015); Rule XXXVI, Rules of the      U.House of Representatives, 105th (1997). This      subsection adds language confirming that congressional office      records are the personal property of the Member, Delegate, or      Resident Commissioner who creates, generates, or receives      them, in accordance with longstanding House custom and prior      pronouncements. See, e.g., 307, 110th      (2008) (``[B]y custom [congressional papers of Members,      Delegates, and Resident Commissioners] are considered the      personal property of the Member who receives and creates      them, and it is therefore the Member who is responsible to      decide on their ultimate disposition . . . .'');      99-994, 99th (1986), at 5 (``[I]t is relatively clear      that Members' papers have been regarded as their personal      property . . . .'').       Response to Subsection (k) clarifies and      streamlines procedures governing notification of, and      response to, properly served judicial subpoenas and judicial      orders directing appearance as a witness relating to the      official functions of the House or compelling the production      or disclosure of any document relating to the official      functions of the       The subsection continues the practice of granting authority      to respond to subpoenas without the necessity of a House      vote, and streamlines the notification process to eliminate      inefficiencies. The recipient of a properly served judicial      subpoena or order compelling testimony or production of      documents relating to the official functions of the House      must promptly notify the Speaker in writing of the receipt of      that judicial order or subpoena and must determine whether      the subpoena or order is a proper exercise of the      jurisdiction of the court and is consistent with the rights      and privileges of the In keeping with current      practice, the notification to the Speaker must either[[Page H13]]     set forth those determinations (if they have already been      made at the time of the notification) or state that the      recipient intends to make those determinations. The prior      rule's additional reference to determining whether the      subpoena or order ``is material and relevant'' has been      omitted as redundant and superfluous, because it is subsumed      within the requirement to determine whether the subpoena or      order is consistent with the privileges and rights of the      House; it would not be consistent with the privileges and      rights of the House for a Member, Delegate, Resident      Commissioner, officer, or employee to be compelled to respond      to a judicial subpoena or order seeking information that is      not material and relevant to the underlying cause.      Accordingly, no substantive change is made by the deletion of      the ``is material and relevant'' determination.       The subsection omits the obsolete requirements for the      Clerk of the House to provide a copy of rule VIII to the      court and for recipients of judicial subpoenas or orders to      submit ``certified'' copies of documents when production of      documents in response to a properly served judicial subpoena      or order has been determined to be appropriate. References to      administrative subpoenas relating to the official functions      of the House have also been deleted, because the rule should      not be interpreted to suggest that compliance with such      subpoenas may be mandatory. The subsection deletes the truism      that notifications received when the House is adjourned will      be laid before the House upon its reconvening.       Requirements for Subsection (1) codifies the      exceptions carried in previous rules packages to clause 5(d)      of rule X to allow the Committee on Appropriations up to      thirteen subcommittees, the Committees on Armed Services,      Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Government Reform up to      seven subcommittees, and the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure up to six subcommittees.       Committee Subsection (m) provides the Committee      on Homeland Security with authority to close hearings for an      additional 5 consecutive days when considering sensitive      matters that require an executive session.       Referrals to the Court of Subsection (n) conforms      the standing rules with the current practice that measures      making a referral to the Court of Claims are referred to the      private calendar.       Contents of Committee Reports Showing Changes to Existing      Subsection (o) modifies language adopted in the 114th      Congress to address an unintended consequence that required a      committee report or accompanying document to portray      duplicative prints. This subsection continues to require that      a Ramseyer print show the entire text of each section of      statute that is proposed to be repealed and a comparative      print of each amendment to the entire text of a section of      statute the bill or joint resolution proposes to make. The      subsection also clarifies existing practice that appropriate      typographical devices be used for both repealed text and      comparative prints.       Authority to Postpone Record Votes on Certain      Subsection (p) adds motions to recommit and motions to concur      to the list of postponable questions under clause 8 of rule            Conforming Guidelines for Five-Minute Subsection      (q) clarifies that the Speaker's ability to reduce the time      for a vote pursuant to clause 9(b) or 9(c) of rule XX is      subject to the same guidelines as the reduction of the time      for a vote pursuant to clause 8(c)(2) of rule       Electronic Subsection (r) modifies and      codifies a standing order from the 112th, 113th, and 114th      Congresses by designating the electronic document repository      operated by the Clerk of the House for the purposes of      electronic availability rules.       Comparative Prints for Bills or Joint Resolution Considered      on Subsection (s) provides that by December 31, 2017,      each bill, joint resolution, or amendment in the nature of a      substitute shall have an easily searchable electronic      comparative print that shows how the proposed legislation      will change current law, showing by appropriate typographical      devices the omissions and insertions proposed. The subsection      also seeks to enhance transparency on changes made to a      measure after it has been reported by a committee.       Appointments of Subsection (t) allows Delegates and      the Resident Commissioner to serve as chair of the Committee      of the     Section 3. Separate       Holman Subsection (a) provides a new standing order      for the first session of the 115th Congress based on the      ``Holman Rule,'' most of which was removed from the standing      rules in 1983. This standing order functions as an exception      to clause 2 of rule XXI to allow provisions changing law in      certain limited circumstances. Under this order, a provision      in a general appropriation bill or an amendment thereto may      contain legislation to retrench expenditures by (1) reducing      amounts of money in the bill, (2) reducing the number or      salaries of Federal employees, or (3) reducing the      compensation of any person paid by the To qualify      for treatment under this order, an amendment must be offered      after the reading of the bill and must comply with all      applicable rules of the House, such as the germaneness rule.      The purpose of this provision is to see if the reinstatement      of the Holman rule will provide Members with additional tools      to reduce spending during consideration of the regular      general appropriation bills.       Staff Deposition Subsection (b) carries forward      and modifies provisions from the 114th Congress to provide      the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and each      standing committee of the 115th Congress (except for the      Committees on Rules and House Administration) the authority      to order the taking of a deposition by a member or committee      counsel of such committee. The authority provided under this      subsection extends for the entirety of the 115th      Depositions taken under this authority are subject to      regulations issued by the chair of the Committee on Rules and      printed in the Congressional       The subsection modifies the member attendance requirement,      which applies unless (1) the witness waives the requirement      or (2) the committee authorizes the taking of a specified      deposition without the presence of a member during a      specified period and the deposition occurs on a day that the      House is not in session. The latter authority enables a      committee to authorize the taking of one or more such      depositions of one or more specified witnesses at any point      over the course of a specified period of days, such as a      district work period.       Independent Payment Advisory Subsection (c) carries      forward a provision from the 113th and 114th Congresses that      turns off a provision contained in the Affordable Care Act,      which limits the ability of the House to determine the method      of consideration for a recommendation from the Independent      Payment Advisory Board or to repeal the provision in its      entirety.       Providing for Transparency with Respect to Memorials      Submitted Pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the      United Subsection (d) carries forward and modifies      provisions from the 114th Congress that clarify the      procedures of the House regarding the receipt of Article V      memorials from the States by directing the Clerk to make each      memorial, designated by the chair of the Committee on the      Judiciary, electronically available, organized by State of      origin and year of receipt, and indicate whether the memorial      was designated as an application or recession.       In carrying out this subsection, it is expected that the      chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will be solely      charged with determining whether a memorial purports to be an      application of the legislature of a state calling for a      constitutional convention or recession of prior applications.      The Clerk's role will be entirely administrative. The chair      of the Committee on the Judiciary will only designate      memorials from state legislatures (and not petitions from      individuals or other parties), as it is only state      legislatures that are contemplated under Article V of the            In submitting each memorial to the Clerk, the chair of the      Committee on the Judiciary will include a transmission letter      that indicates it has been designated under this subsection      of House Resolution 5. The Clerk will make publicly available      the memorial and the transmission letter from the chair.      Ancillary documentation from the state or other parties is      not expected to be publicized.       The chair of the Committee on the Judiciary is also      permitted to designate memorials from Congresses prior to the      114th Congress to be made publicly available under the same      procedure.       Spending Reduction Amendments in Appropriations      Subsection (e) modifies and carries forward the prohibition      from the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses against      consideration of a general appropriation bill that does not      include a ``spending reduction account.'' The subsection      updates the definition of a spending reduction account to      state a recitation of the amount by which an applicable      allocation of new budget authority under section 302(b)      (Appropriations subcommittee allocations) of the      Congressional Budget Act of 1974 exceeds the amount of new      budget authority proposed by the bill, or if no such      allocation is in effect, $0.       Point of Order Against Motion to Rise and      Subsection (f) carries forward from the 113th and 114th      Congresses the requirement that prevents the Committee of the      Whole from rising to report a bill to the House that exceeds      an applicable allocation of new budget authority under      section 302(b) as estimated by the Committee on the Budget      and continues a point of order.       Limitation on Advance Subsection (g)      provides limits against a fiscal year 2017 general      appropriation bill or measure continuing appropriations from      making advanced appropriations in fiscal year 2018. The      subsection provides a limited number of standard exceptions      which provide advanced appropriations only for fiscal year      2018.       Point of Order Against Increasing Direct      Subsection (h) establishes a point of order against      consideration of a bill or joint resolution reported by a      committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) or an      amendment thereto, or a conference report thereon, which has      the net effect of increasing direct spending in excess of $5      billion for any of the four consecutive ten fiscal year      periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10      fiscal years after the current fiscal year. The subsection      also provides exemptions for measures repealing or reforming      the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health      Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010,      and measures where the chair of the[[Page H14]]     Committee on the Budget made an adjustment to the allocation      levels or limits contained in the most recently adopted      budget resolution.       Disclosure of Directed Rule Subsection (i) carries      forward and modifies the requirement that committee reports      on bills or joint resolutions include a list of directed rule      makings required by the measure or a statement that the      measure contains no directed rule makings. The subsection      carries forward the definition of ``directed rule making'' to      include those rule makings specifically directed to be      completed by a provision in the legislation, but does not      include a grant of discretionary rule making authority. The      prior standing order only required an estimate of the number      of direct rule makings.       Exercise Facilities for Former Subsection (j)      continues the prohibition on access to any exercise facility      that is made available exclusively to Members, former      Members, officers, and former officers of the House and      their spouses to any former Member, former officer, or      spouse who is a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying      Disclosure Act of 1995.       Numbering of Subsection (k) reserves the first 10      numbers for bills (H.1 through H.10) for assignment by      the Speaker and the second 10 numbers (H.11 through H.     20) for assignment by the Minority       Inclusion of U.Code Citations for Proposed Repeals and      Subsection (1) continues to add, to the maximum      extent practicable, a requirement for parallel citations for      amendatory instructions to Public Laws and Statutes at Large      that are not classified in the U.      Broadening Availability of Legislative Documents in      Machine-Readable Subsection (m) continues to      instruct the appropriate officers and committees to continue      to advance government transparency by taking further steps to      publish documents of the House in machine-readable formats.       Congressional Member Organization Transparency      Subsection (n) carries forward the provisions from the 114th      Congress to allow participating Members to enter into      agreements with eligible Congressional Member Organizations      for the purpose of payment of salaries and expenses. The      Committee on House Administration is required to promulgate      regulations, consistent with current law, to carry out this      subsection.       Social Security Subsection (o) carries forward      from the 114th Congress a point of order against legislation      that would reduce the actuarial balance of the Federal Old-     Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, but provides an      exemption to the point of order if a measure improves the      overall financial health of the combined Social Security      Trust This subsection would protect the Old-Age and      Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund from diversion of its      funds to finance a broken Disability Insurance system.       Subsection (p) waives clause 5(d) of rule X      to allow the Committee on Agriculture up to six      subcommittees, which is consistent with authorities in the      114th       Treatment of Conveyances of Federal Subsection (q)      provides that any provision in a bill, joint resolution,      amendment, or conference report requiring or authorizing a      conveyance of federal land to a State, local government, or      tribal entity, shall not be considered as providing new      budget authority, decreasing revenues, increasing mandatory      spending, or increasing outlays.     Section 4. Committees, Commissions, and House       House Democracy Subsection (a) reauthorizes      the House Democracy Assistance Commission, now known as the      House Democracy       Tom Lantos Human Rights Subsection (b)      reauthorizes the Tom Lantos Human Rights       Office of Congressional Subsection (c) reauthorizes      the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) and clarifies that      term limits do not apply to members of the The      subsection reaffirms that a person subject to a review by the      Office of Congressional Ethics has a right to be represented      by counsel, and establishes that invoking such right is not      to be held as a presumption of guilt. The subsection modifies      the language to require consultation prior to the appointment      of members rather than concurrence. The subsection also      prohibits the Office of Congressional Ethics from taking      action that would deny a person any rights or protections      provided under the Constitution of the United States of          Section 5. Additional Orders of       Reading of the Subsection (a) allows the      Speaker to recognize Members for the reading of the      Constitution on any legislative day through January 13, 2017.       Consideration of Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017.      Subsection (b) provides for the consideration of the Midnight      Rules Relief Act of 2017 under a closed rule.

13604,topic-id,1226,"Mr.Speaker, today is an exciting day, a brand new 115th Here in the House of Representatives, we have new Members of Congress who are bringing their families, coming to Washington with a sense of exuberance, but mostly with what I believe is respect for the American people who sent them here, respect for the people who elected each of us with the thoughts and ideas from our districts back home, all the way to the election of the President-elect of the United States of America, Donald  So we do this every 2 years. We reorganize the House of We start anew. We start fresh. We start with the best ideas that are brought forth, and we try and bring the teams together. That is what Republicans have done. That is what Democrats are doing. We gather together and add up literally the amount of teams and who is on each side, and that is how we determine who is elected the Speaker of the It is from the majority party. In this case, today we elected the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.Ryan), a great young leader for not just our party, but for our country.  So today what we do is we show up and we exercise our constitutional rights, our duties, our views, the ideas that we have, the ideas that we were sent here to exercise, and the ideas of our majorities, of the bodies, of the groups that we represent.  So today those men and women who gather together with their ideas and plans, they are going to help project and move our country forward over the next 2 years. I think that what we are saying today is important. That is, we are trying to change the direction that this country has been going for at least 2 years, and some could argue for 8 years. We are going to change that direction because the American people have given Republicans an opportunity to lead in the United States House of Representatives, in the United States Senate, and in the Presidency of the United  I believe that we are looking at those elected officials, including the newly elected President, at the next generation, people who will take our places soon, people who we need to leave a better America for, people who are counting on us to, yes, as the saying goes, Make America Great Again, but, more importantly, to live up to the challenges of our job, the challenges that the American people have said we expect you to go to Washington and make tough decisions, not easy decisions, but to do things that are in our best interest rather than in the best interest of a government.  Well, that is what this experiment is about. This experiment takes place every 4 years with the election of a Presidency and perhaps every 2 years with a new  Mr.Speaker, during the first 7 years of the Obama administration, they had an opportunity, the House, to send to the President, to forge a path that they felt would be best for the American people, perhaps based upon a calling or the things that they heard. What happened is that Federal regulations added up to an average of 81 new major regulations per year for a total of 556 regulations, at least 220 of which contained new burdens on individuals and businesses with an annual cost of $108 billion.  We see things differently. That is why you are going to see not only in the rules package, but by the way that we do business here in the House of Representatives, that we look at regulations differently; that we work based upon the law, the intent of the law, not the intent of a regulator who would, as I would suggest, see things perhaps differently than others would see them.  So while it sounds like these are staggering numbers and they do a lot of damage on our country, it is not too late to change that. It is not too late to reevaluate the way things have been done and the way that things should be done.  So we have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do not just about rules and regulations but about the day-to-day business, the progression of GDP, and the growth of jobs and job creation in this country.  For the first time in a long time, we will have a President-elect--yes, Donald Trump--who will, I believe, work with the United States Congress forthrightly and find the avenues of consensus between the House of Representatives and between the United States Senate to push this body.  I met with Mr.Trump earlier in the year when he was just a candidate for the Presidency, and he told me point blank: It is not so much that I am opposed to what you guys are doing in Congress; it is more to I think you ought to be forced into making more tough decisions.  He said: I think Congress gets away from doing the tough things. They do[[Page H15]]the easy lift rather than the things that will be better for the American people, because proud people sent us up here.  That is the standard that, I believe, we should adopt to have and be prepared for in these next 2 years: tough, straightforward, honest work that is meaningful, that can move our country forward, that will propel a generation to believe not only in a great day's pay and a hard day's work, but, more importantly, leading to something that will make our country stronger and yet stronger the next day with a heartbeat from a Nation and a people who deeply believe that America's greatest days are in our future and they are willing to give that to the next generation. That is why we are here.  We have a lot of new Members who bring ideas, Mr.They come here to Washington full and brimming with ideas about things that they would like to see happen. Well, what we are going to do is we are going to make sure that we are ready to do business with them, that we are open and prepared for them.  So you will see that this package carries forward many of the rules from the previous Congress and builds on House Republicans' efforts to streamline House processes, increase transparency, and improve accountability. Specifically, it preserves the important reforms that were made in three previous It also adds perfecting amendments in order to help us further advance and share our ideas and goals of transparency.  We think this is important. We think the ideas that are contained within this package will help propel not only us in better decisionmaking, but the American people will buy into what we are doing.  Fairness is important for all of us. As chairman of the Rules Committee, it is my hope that I will continue to be open, that the Rules Committee will be open to hearing from every single We will welcome them.

The gentleman and I both know what caused this action was a deep, deep feeling that many Members on your side had about a particular issue. It resulted in what could be seen as--and I saw it as--a protest. Look, we are used to that in this body, people being upset. We are not used to people violating the rule, and it already was a rule that you cannot use, for recording purposes, those devices. We did not make this up. That was already a rule. So it became an advent of a protest.  We are simply trying to say--and I am not trying to get you to change your viewpoints at all--but I think it would be wise, and I believe we will not always be in the majority. I believe some day there will be a chance where the Democrats will be in the majority. I would be for this same rule, for the sake of the Speaker and the leadership and the person sitting in that chair. I can look at myself in a mirror because I was a part of this thinking. How do we say to Members a gag order says you cannot utter bad things? This, if you are willing to pay the fine and you want to do that, that is not a gag order. That is a violation of a rule. If you would like to participate in that, go for it all you want. But I don't think it is the right thing.

The Democrat majority certainly did show up and give us lots of things to think about, which is good. The new year deserves an opportunity for us to hear some of their thoughts and ideas. I will tell you that it went across the board.  I am still stunned that Republicans are blamed for the failures of ObamaCare when, in fact, it is ObamaCare that we are going to amend and we are going to change.

But what we really address in the rules package is an opportunity to streamline the procedures on rules and regulations and our ability to effectively do the work with the consent of the American people.

What has always allowed this body to be different from any other body in the world is the discipline of rules and order and procedures, mutual respect for each other, the opportunity to hear and be heard, but, really, the opportunity with an open process, a process that is given to the minority and one that is given to the majority.  Any rule that has been promulgated in this body is not done on a partisan basis because, see, my majority has people who disagree with necessarily some in our party, too. We did not try and stop anybody from voicing what they would voice, but a rule of decorum has been placed upon that. That is what separates this body from any other bodies in the world, and that is what will continue to gain the admiration of not only the American people, but people around the world.

13804,topic-id,1085,"Mr.President, I came to the floor today to join with Senators and people across this country in speaking out against the President's misguided and, I believe, destructive Executive order that has abruptly closed our borders to all refugees as well as citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.  During the campaign, Candidate Trump called for a ``total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.'' I had certainly hoped that once in office, he would receive wise and prudent counsel and he would realize that elevating such a Muslim ban to the status of official U.policy would have very negative consequences.  Instead, what we have seen is that a small group in the White House acting in secret produced this Executive order. They did so without legal review and even without the knowledge of the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, or the nominee to be Secretary of As a result, as we all know, we saw a weekend of chaos and confusion--a self-inflicted wound to our national security and to our reputation in the world.  The consequences go far beyond the scenes of disorder that we witnessed in recent days. By singling out Muslim-majority countries and banning their citizens from entry into the United States and by denying entry to all refugees, the President has greatly damaged America's image across the world and, perhaps, worst of all, this Executive order is a gift to ISIS, Al Qaeda, and to every other radical jihadist group. On social media they celebrated the travel ban as a confirmation to their narrative that the United States is at war with Islam and that they are engaged in a clash of civilizations. One ISIS sympathizer praised the Executive order as a ``blessed ban,'' comparing it to what he called ``the blessed invasion'' of Iraq, which inflamed anti-American anger across the Islamic world. This is dangerous because this is a powerful recruitment tool for our enemies.  I am also deeply concerned that this Executive order endangers our troops and our diplomats who are in the field. Today, more than 5,000 American troops are supporting Iraqi troops in the fight to reclaim Mosul and drive ISIS out of By discriminating based on religion and nationality, the President's order undermines the local alliances and the trust established by our troops and diplomats in the field. This order is so ill-considered that, as originally drafted, it even barred Iraqi civilians, including translators who provided essential assistance to the U.mission.  Just to be clear, this Muslim ban is un-It is offensive to our Nation's core values and ideals. The right way forward is not to carve out small exceptions to the Muslim ban. It is to repeal the ban entirely. The President has called for what he has termed ``extreme vetting,'' but the truth is that our vetting procedures are already thorough and rigorous. It takes as long as 24 months for a refugee to make it through the process and come to the United The entire screening process takes place outside the United So it doesn't pose a threat to people here in  In my home State of New Hampshire, the President's Executive order has caused shock and profound concern, especially in our business and academic communities, as well as in our immigrant communities. T.Parker is the CEO of PillPack, a company that employs nearly 400 people in Manchester, which is the largest city in New He said on Monday: ``This ban is wrong and goes against our values as a company and as Americans.''  He continued: ``I'm also deeply concerned about any measures that could discourage talented individuals from studying and working in the U.S.''  The Union Leader newspaper reported yesterday that more than 700 refugees who settled in New Hampshire over the past decade are from the seven countries singled out in the Executive order and would have been banned from entry. These immigrants are not Iraqis, Somalis, Sudanese or They are proud loyal members of our diverse American family. Many of them have spouses or children still in refugee camps, and they hope to be united with their families. The President's order has now slammed the door on these hopes.  Yesterday the Associated Press in New Hampshire reported on Omid Moghimi, an internist at New Hampshire Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical An American citizen, he fell in love with a childhood friend in Iran and married her in Tehran in 2015. Here is the picture of the two of them on their wedding day. After months of vetting for entry to the United States, his wife had an appointment for her visa interview. That appointment was abruptly canceled after the President's Executive order, and Moghimi worries that this could become permanent. He is now in his first year of a 3-year residency, and he fears he will have to leave the United States in order to live with his wife, who volunteers at daycare centers and an orphanage. Moghimi told the AP: ``There's no evidence that she is in any way even a miniscule threat, security risk, and there are many, many cases like her out there.''  If this Executive order stays in effect, we lose the opportunity to have Moghimi practice in the United States and maybe serve a community in New Hampshire, and it has a real impact on their lives. The ill-advised words and actions, including this Executive order, have damaged America's standing in the world and harmed our national security. But the Senate has[[Page S553]]an opportunity to send a very different message to our allies and to our enemies across the globe. We can make clear that America's democracy is founded on a system of checks and balances, and that the President doesn't speak for America or make policy all by himself. I urge my Senate colleagues to join with us in supporting legislation to repeal the President's order. We need to send a clear message to the world that America does not support discrimination based on religion. We welcome appropriately vetted refugees from wars and violence, and we respect our Muslim allies, including our friends in Iraq who have sacrificed so much in the fight against  In recent days we have seen what happens when America betrays its ideals and its allies.

13626,topic-id,1009,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume; and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions) for yielding me the customary time, and I want to wish everybody a happy new year. I hope, circumstances notwithstanding, that we can have one.  I want to follow on what the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Hoyer) was talking about. I have been pretty concerned here since the day we did what was a protest regarding some of the actions we are looking at. Last night, in what I thought was a moment of pique, the majority decided that they would put into the rules package a gutting of the Office of Congressional Ethics, which was totally unconstitutional in the fact that they were not going to get rid of it, but they took everything it had from them and forbade them having on their committee a person who could talk to the press and forbade them talking to people.  Mr.Speaker, that is a gag order. That is against the constitutional right that we have. It was only an hour ago that all of us raised our right hand and swore that we were going to uphold the Constitution, and now, not an hour later, we are struggling to defy it. This is not new for me. I have been very concerned about this since we were here in June and had our protest.  Now, it is our job, and we all said we were going to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. But we may have enemies right here in the room, which is troubling to me, because of what happened last night. I appreciate that cooler heads prevailed and that part was taken out because there was such a hue and cry of: ``What the heck do they think they are doing now?'' So this whole change did not last even 24 hours. In conjunction with that, I need to go back to what happened here on the House floor.  We tried for years to try to do the simplest kinds of things on gun control measures: background checks, closing loopholes, coming up with absolutely nothing. We live in a country now where doctors are forbidden from asking patients if there are guns in the home. Doctors can ask if there are drugs in the home or any other thing that may cause great harm, but they are not allowed, by law, to ask if there are guns in the home. We have gone so far in the gun culture here that 335 million Americans own over 320 million guns, and that is life now in the United  So what we were trying to do, what we thought made the most eminent sense--and I would almost guarantee that not a single American man, woman, or child would object to it--we said, if you were on the terrorist list and you can't fly on an airplane, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun. We called it no fly, no buy. There is such eminent sense in it. But because we are shut out--and I know there is a lot of openness talk going on today, but in the Rules Committee there is none. We didn't have an open rule all year, over this whole last term. We don't get amendments. We don't get to talk. We were desperate to try to do something about the carnage in this country.  Because it was overwhelming to us, we decided something had to be done about letting terrorists who couldn't get on airplanes have guns. So we gathered our people. I think it was totally spontaneous. There was no great plan to do it, no vote to get here. So we sat here and talked peacefully. The microphones were all turned off and C-SPAN was shut out. They couldn't hear what was going on. Because of the times we live in, some of our enterprising Members, they took their iPhones and streamed what was going on on the floor. Then Facebook took it up, and then C-SPAN got it from their stream and the whole country saw what was going on here. It was basically for the first time.  Now, one of the things in the Constitution that we all revere today is the right of peaceful assembly. There were no threats, no action, no violence, no anything. We just said, if we have no bill, we will have no break. Everybody understood exactly what we were trying to do.  So now what we are getting to, which again is totally unconstitutional, is to decide to fine Members of Congress for doing what we did. In other words, their free speech does not work on the floor of the House of Representatives, when we are the people who swear to uphold the  It was really an amazing sight for the people of America to see that kind of thing going on here where we are so circumscribed in what we say and how long we have to say it. So the rules of the House that we are doing today say you are going to punish a sitting Member, but not in the way that the Constitution says you can do that.                              {time}  1530  If you are going to punish a Member in the House, the whole House has to vote on it. But there is no provision in there to allow anybody other than the leader of this House to fine a  The idea of your doing that so that people can have due process is ridiculous. If you are brought up on ethics charges, you have lawyers. It was proposed simply to get at us and to say to the minority: Keep your place over there; you know where you belong.  So I have talked to numerous lawyers and constitutional experts, and I know that was unconstitutional. I think I have said enough about it, but I think we will have more to say on another day.

13678,topic-id,1568,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I include in the Record a description of the many troubling Republican rules changes in 5.       5, the House rules package for the 115th Congress,      contains a number of troubling provisions. Most concerning is      that instead of taking action to address the gun violence      epidemic, Republicans have responded to the Democratic sit-in      of last June by instituting an offensive and possibly      unconstitutional gag rule to punish Members who violate the      rules on decorum. 5 authorizes the Sergeant-at-Arms      to fine Members for the use of photographic and audio or      visual recording devices on the floor. Fines are set at $500      for a first offense and $2,500 for each subsequent offense      and the Chief Administrative Officer is instructed to deduct      such fines from the Member's salary. The resolution also      makes ``disorderly or disruptive conduct'' in the Chamber an      offense for which Members and staff can be referred to the      Ethics There are serious constitutional questions      concerning whether fines can be deducted from Members' pay,      and whether the House can delegate the responsibility of      punishing Members to House officers, but most importantly      this change has the potential to have a chilling effect that      would silence the Minority party and the millions of      constituent they represent.       5 will also dramatically expand the Republican      Majority's investigative powers, giving nearly every      committee the ability to haul private citizens to Washington      to be deposed by Republican staffers. After spending six      years demonstrating their eagerness to spend taxpayer money      on wasteful, politically-motivated witch hunts, Republicans      are giving themselves additional tools to do more of the      same. The rules package gives every committee (except Rules      and House Administration) the ability to force private      citizens to travel to Washington, DC and be subjected to      unlimited hours of interrogation by Republican staff.      Republicans have expanded committees' investigative powers      over the last six years, but even last Congress gave staff      deposition authority to only five standing committees. In      this rules package, for the first time ever, Republicans are      removing entirely any requirement that Members be present      during such depositions (unless the House is in session),      making it much more likely that depositions will be lengthy      and numerous. Freely handing out the power to compel any      American to appear, sit in a room, and answer staff's      invasive questions on the record is truly unprecedented,      unwarranted, and offensive. Note that due to the Majority's      use of this authority to intimidate potential witnesses      during the 114th Congress, the ranking members of the      relevant committees requested that this authority not be      extended at the end of the first session.       Democrats are also troubled that 5's expansion of      staff deposition authority and delegation of Member      punishment to a House officer represent a disturbing trend of      giving to staff powers that ought to be, and have      traditionally been, exercised by       This rules package also includes a worrisome requirement      that each standing committee (except for Appropriations,      Ethics, and Rules) include in its oversight plans      recommendations for moving programs from mandatory to      discretionary funding. This would begin the process of      dismantling the guaranteed funding mechanisms for vital      safety net programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and      Medicaid and expose these programs to the uncertainties of      the annual appropriations process--something the Majority has      been trying to accomplish for years.       With 5's reinstatement of the so-called ``Holman      Rule,'' Republicans are unfairly targeting Federal employees.      The Holman Rule, which was largely removed from the standing      rules in 1983, permits provisions in and amendments to      general appropriations bills that reduce the number of      Federal employees, or reduce the salary of any Federal      employee. Since 1983, such provisions and amendments have      been out of order, as they constitute ``legislating on an      appropriations bill.'' Reinstating this rule represents yet      another effort by the Republican Majority to scapegoat      Federal employees, make cuts to the Federal workforce, and      politicize the civil service system that was established to      professionalize agencies and offices. Moreover, in light of      the President-Elect's transition team asking agencies to      ``name names'' of Federal employees who have implemented      policies with which Republicans disagree, perhaps most      worrisome is the potential use of the Holman Rule to      persecute career employees for doing their jobs during the      Obama       5 also intentionally hides the cost of repealing      the Affordable Care Act (ACA), by preemptively waiving the      Majority's own long-term direct spending point of order for      any ACA repeal legislation. The rules package extends a point      of order against considering legislation that would increase      direct spending by $5 billion or more in any of the four 10-     year periods following the decade after passage of the      legislation. Repealing the ACA will result in increased      direct spending and would very likely violate this long-term      spending point of order, so 5 includes a carve-out      exempting ACA repeal legislation from the point of order      entirely. On top of that, 5 permits the Budget Chair      to apply this waiver to any other legislation she wishes.       Similar to the provision waiving the budgetary point of      order against legislation repealing the ACA, an amendment to      5 was adopted late last night that continues the      Republican practice of disregarding fiscal responsibility by      requiring the House to ignore the fiscal effects of the sale      or transfer of Federal land to a State, local government, or      tribal entity. While this rule was included to simplify the      process for authorizing the transfer of land, and would also      apply to instances when direct spending decreases, it is      irresponsible to authorize such a sale or transfer without      knowing its total cost.[[Page H24]]       Democrats also find 5's change to the rules to make      it easier for the Majority to continue its wasteful,      taxpayer-funded lawsuits in future Congresses very      unfortunate. The rules package takes the unprecedented step      of providing blanket authority for the House, Speaker, or a      committee chair to carry forward any litigation from the      previous Previous rules packages listed specific      matters to be carried over, ensuring a level of transparency      and review that will be absent following this rules change      This change will ultimately permit the Majority to more      easily shield its abuse of the legal process from public      scrutiny.       5 also includes several rules changes that, while      not necessarily problematic on their face, have the potential      to be abused by the First, 5 allows the      Majority to postpone votes on the motion to recommit by      adding such motions, as well as motions to concur, to the      list of questions that can be postponed for up to two      legislative days under clause 8 of rule This same      authority already exists for many other questions and is      typically used for time management. Although this may be      useful in coordinating the timing of floor votes with      Members' schedules, it could be used by the Majority to      postpone votes on Democratic priorities if they are concerned      about losing a vote.       Second, the rules package explicitly states that records      ``created, generated, or received'' by Members' personal      offices are the personal property of the individual Members      and, unlike Committee materials, are not records of the      While this is a codification of a longstanding policy,      the rule change could be exploited by the Majority to store      materials in Member offices in order to circumvent      requirements that they share House records with the      This was a concern in the 114th Congress, for example, in      relation to the Republicans' Planned Parenthood      investigation. Moreover, this change could lend legitimacy to      a defeated Member's decision to refuse to hand over      constituent casework files to his or her successor, which      appears to have happened last year.       Democrats will monitor the Majority's implementation of      these new rules to ensure they are used to assist in the      effective operation of the House and not to prevent Members      of the Minority Party from representing and serving their      constituents.       Finally, Democrats were very concerned with the Republican      Conference's adoption of an amendment to the Rules package      late last night that would have stripped the Office of      Congressional Ethics (OCR) of its independence by placing it      under the authority of the Ethics Committee, thereby      eliminating its role as an effective Congressional watchdog.      It would have effectively gutted the OCE by prohibiting it      from investigating anonymous complaints, prohibiting it from      having a press secretary or from talking to the press at any      time, requiring OCE to refer criminal complaints directly to      the Ethics Committee, and allowing the Ethics Committee to      stop any OCE investigation at any time.       The OCE was created in 2008 to investigate allegations      against Members of Congress, following years of scandal that      tarnished this institution. It was intentionally set up as an      independent body to ensure that it was able to conduct proper      investigations free from political influences and favoritism.      Disciplinary actions against Members have increased      substantially since the OCE's creation, because there is now      finally an office not run by Members of Congress      investigating allegations against Independent      Inspector General offices ensure accountability in the      Executive Branch and the House should be held to the same      standard. This is why the top ethics lawyers to both      Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama have strongly      condemned the Republican effort to gut the       In attempting to implement this rules change, Republicans      showed their true colors. While we are pleased that the      public outcry and negative attention from the media forced      Republicans to backtrack this morning and leave the OCE      intact, it is disturbing that Republicans' first instinct was      to weaken rather than strengthen the House's ethics rules.

13542,topic-id,1843,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman, Sergeant Major Walz from the State of Minnesota, for yielding me time.  I also would like to say to the chairman, we had a wonderful time traveling to Afghanistan to pay respect to our troops during I don't have to travel across the country with him, but I did travel halfway around the world with him.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.1259.  Every Member of Congress supports accountability for employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs--everybody. Building a culture of excellence at the VA is critical to providing veterans the care and support they deserve.  However, H.1259 does not further this goal, or improve outcomes at the We are not going to be able to fire our way to better outcomes at the  The question posed by the VA Accountability First Act is whether accountability or workers' rights are mutually exclusive. I, along with many of my colleagues, believe we can respect VA employees--a third of whom are veterans themselves--while also ensuring that poor-performing employees are held accountable.  This legislation violates workers' rights in two very specific ways:  First, it would erode due process protections by giving employees too little time--just 10 days--to prepare for a disciplinary hearing, and then just 7 days to file an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection  Second, it goes much further than past accountability bills by eliminating the use of collectively bargained grievance procedures for frontline VA employees. Not only do collectively bargained procedures often lead to quicker and simpler solutions, but they also give added protection to potential whistleblowers by acting as a check against managers who may retaliate against an employee who raises an issue.  Mr.Chairman, there is no question that we have workforce challenges at the VA, but this bill does not solve them. Instead, it eschews the Senate's bipartisan accountability legislation in favor of a much more one-sided bill.  To my colleagues who voted on VA accountability legislation in the past: This is not the same bill. It goes much further. And I ask you to join me in opposing it.  This is the first time the majority has targeted collective bargaining at the VA in this way. Your vote against this bill today will show that you oppose this very tactic.  If we are serious about providing veterans the best care possible, we should focus on removing the Federal hiring freeze, advancing the appeals modernization bill, and other bipartisan efforts that will immediately improve veterans' access to high-quality care and support.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in opposition to this bill, a letter from the American Federation of Government Employees, as well as a letter from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial                                                       AFSCME,                                                   March 15, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I'm writing to urge you to oppose H.     1259, which would eliminate collective bargaining rights and      fundamental due process rights of employees at the Department      of Veterans Affairs (VA).       The bill makes it easier to fire people for a good reason      or a bad reason. By eliminating merit-based principles for      workers facing a removal, demotion or suspension, the bill      makes it easier for management or political appointees to      scapegoat employees that advocate strongly for the veteran      patients they serve. Basic civil service due process rights      are necessary to block corruption, patronage, discrimination,      and political pressure to cover up problems in the delivery      of services to veterans.       The bill destroys the right of registered nurses and other      front-line VA employees to use a union grievance procedure to      efficiently and fairly address proposed adverse employment      actions. This is union busting.       This bill will not help improve the care to veterans from      the VA but rather make such care politicized and subject to      corrupting and corrosive influences unrelated to quality.      Moreover, this bill sets a dangerous precedent that could      subsequently harm more than one million additional federal      workers in other agencies and occupations, and the public      they serve. We urge you to vote against H.1259.           Sincerely,                                                       Scott Frey,     Director of Federal Government                                  ____                                                         AFGE,                                                    March 7, 2017.     Re AFGE Opposition to H.1259.     Phil Roe,     Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington,     Tim Walz,     Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: I am writing on      behalf of nearly 700,000 federal employees represented by the      American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE),      including 230,000 employees of the Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA) to urge you to oppose H.1259, a bill      introduced by Representative Phil Roe (R-TN) to eliminate      collective bargaining rights and significantly cut the due      process rights of employees facing a proposed removal,      demotion, or suspension (adverse action).       H.1259 is a direct assault on the union rights of every      VA employee, including more than 120,000 veterans within the      VA workforce. This bill will hurt, not fix, the It will      reverse the significant improvements made over the past two      years, and will make it harder for veterans to get the      veteran-centric medical care and benefits on which they rely.       In addition to punitive, counterproductive due process      attacks recycled from earlier bills, H.1259 breaks new      ground by union-busting. The bill destroys the right of every      VA front line employee to use union grievance procedures to      efficiently and fairly address proposed adverse actions. The      grievance procedure is not only part of the law but also part      of the contract negotiated between labor and management. The      only avenue that VA front line employees will have left is a      rushed management-run appeals process that does not allow      good employees enough time to gather the evidence they[[Page H2119]]     need to defend their jobs. For medical professionals facing      proposed adverse actions related to professional conduct or      competence, the reductions in the timeframe for the agency      review process are more severe, even though their cases      typically involve complex medical issues.       In addition, all front-line employees and managers will      have weaker rights to appeal to the Merit System Protection      Board (MSPB), their first chance at an independent review.      They will only have seven days to appeal to the MSPB after      they are fired (and off the payroll), and the bill ties the      hands of the MSPB Administrative Judge (AJ) with the recycled      ``one-size-fits-all'' prohibition against mitigating the      penalty, regardless of the facts of the individual case.       When the employee loses at the MSPB (which happens in 80%      of cases now), he would have only seven days to prepare an      appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal            How does this impact the life of a veteran working in a VA?      What if a veteran working in a regional office processing      claims is trying to do his job in the face of unfair      allegations of poor performance by a manager who did not want      to hire a veteran and did not train him properly before      rushing him onto the job? It means that he only has ten days      to gather all the evidence he needs to respond to a proposed      removal and his manager only has five days to decide whether      to go ahead and fire him. Therefore, 15 days after learning      that he may be fired, he has no job and no paycheck. Then he      has one week to get his appeal to the MSPB, during which he      must hire an attorney if he can afford one, where the AJ      cannot give him a suspension or demotion even if the judge      believes that the facts dictate a less severe punishment than      removal. When the MSPB upholds the decision to fire him, he      has just one week to prepare his appeal to a federal appeals      court (and again, hire an attorney if he can afford one),      while he is without a job and without a paycheck.       Just last month, Chairman Roe stated that ``the men and      women who have fought for our great nation should never have      to struggle to find a job,'' but his bill attacks every      option that veterans in the VA workforce have to save their      jobs in the face of unjustified firings.       Chairman Roe has also expressed his intentions to reduce      mismanagement at the VA, but his bill weakens the critical      protections that VA employees need to speak up against      mismanagement and patient harm. Every day, employees      throughout the VA report concerns to management that directly      impact patient safety, health care access, processing of      disability claims, and many other functions essential to the      agency mission.       Chairman Roe opposes the hiring freeze because he      understands how critical it is for veterans who depend on the      VA to have a ``robust clinical workforce.'' Yet his bill      singles out VA employees, including every clinician caring      for veterans, for worse treatment than other federal      employees through recoupment of compensation already earned,      including pensions, relocation bonuses, and performance      bonuses. These provisions are unnecessary and violate due      process. There are already ample safeguards in the law      against retention of improper relocation and performance      bonuses, and the VA has already dismantled the relocation      bonus program that was the subject of abuse allegations. In      addition, this bill directly contradicts private sector law      that forbids the recoupment of pensions.       Thank you for considering the views of If you need      more information, please contact Marilyn Park of my staff.

Phil Roe,     Chair, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington,     Tim Walz,     Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: On behalf of the      AFL-CIO, I urge you to reject the VA Accountability First Act      (H.1259), introduced by Chairman David H.1259 is a      thinly veiled effort to destroy union rights and shift the      blame for management failures at the VA onto the backs of      front line employees.       The bill severely truncates the appeals process in current      law and destroys grievance procedures that have been      successfully used throughout the federal government to      provide stability and protection against arbitrary treatment,      and with it any guarantee that employees will feel safe      speaking out against mismanagement or to protect patient      safety.       Rather than building a culture of trust at the VA, H.     1259 would turn back the clock to an era when employees could      be fired with the slightest justification and almost no      opportunity to mount an effective defense. Worse, the bill      would single out VA employees for harsher treatment than      other federal workers, including the recoupment of      compensation already earned without adequate due process,      including pension benefits, and relocation and performance      bonuses.       The Roe bill reflects the Chairman's opposition to      collective bargaining and the crucial role labor      organizations play in giving federal workers a voice on the      job. For the 120,000 veterans who work at the VA, this bill      is not only a slap in the face but a betrayal of the promise      that they would be guaranteed fair treatment if they came to      work for the federal government.       We urge you to reject H.1259.           Sincerely,                                         William Samuel, Director,                                    Government Affairs  ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2114.txt,2110,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,16.0,March

13576,topic-id,422,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, my amendment in the nature of a substitute would strike the text of H.1259 and insert a new provision allowing the Secretary to suspend, without pay, any VA employee whose performance or misconduct threatens public health or safety, including the health and safety of veterans. It would give the Secretary the authority to remove a suspended employee after an investigation and review if the Secretary determines removal is in the interests of public health and safety.  Both parties share the desire to protect veterans from mistreatment or harm, especially when they are seeking medical care at a VA facility, but the language in my amendment would be more likely to achieve the majority's stated outcome of removing VA employees whose misconduct harms veterans.  We have voted on similar accountability bills before, but I want to point out that this bill goes much further in the wrong direction. While in the past we have had disagreements on procedure and the amount of time an employee is given to file an appeal, for the very first time, this version of the accountability bill is attempting to undermine VA employees' collective bargaining rights.  Buried in this bill is a new provision that would take away the rights of frontline VA employees to use collectively bargained agreements for settling grievances. This has not been a part of past negotiations, and the vote that Members take on the underlying bill should not be based solely on their votes on previous accountability bills.  Collectively bargained grievance settlement procedures often lead to quicker and simpler solutions, and they give added protection to potential whistleblowers. When these basic protections are undermined, we give too much power to managers whose goal may be to retaliate against someone who called out a mistake.  The bill, as it is currently being offered, does not provide enough time for an employee to get their case together to file an appeal. It undermines collective bargaining agreements negotiated in good faith between management and employees. It doesn't do enough to protect whistleblowers.  My amendment addresses our shared goal to create accountability at the It would ensure that the Secretary has the authority to immediately suspend any VA employee whose behavior threatens the health and safety of veterans, and that the suspended employee does not accrue pay while the investigation is being carried out.  I hope that Members will join me and vote in favor of my amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2114.txt,2110,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,16.0,January
13577,topic-id,279,"Mr.Chair, I continue to oppose the underlying bill and support my amendment.  I would assert that my amendment would apply to many of the employees in the scandals who were cited by our esteemed chairman.  I want to remind the body that several Republican speakers this afternoon repeated a phrase that the vast majority of employees at the VA are doing a good job. My amendment really does address those few employees who really do pose a threat to veterans' safety or health.  I would also say that I want to remind also the chairman and inform the body that we heard testimony from the bipartisan Commission on Care established through the Choice They were charged with the responsibility of reviewing VA health care.  One of the co-chairs was appointed by a Republican--I believe the Senate majority leader--and the other by the White They both reported back that we cannot create excellence at the VA through enhancing the firing process.  They were astounded that more effort and resources have not been invested in the personnel function of the VA to better train our managers in progressive discipline and to do the kind of documentation that really will bring about effective accountability.  By the way, both of these co-chairs led, and do still, large, private sector healthcare organizations. They pushed back on a suggestion that we needed to enhance our dismissal process, our accountability process.[[Page H2132]]  I do agree with the chairman and the ranking member that we have an opportunity to work together as Democrats and We are not far apart on the bipartisan agreement that came out of the  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

13570,topic-id,356,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.1259, which would require the VA to submit a report to Congress at the end of each fiscal year listing the bonuses that were awarded to senior-level executives.  In 2015, VA employees received more than $177 million in bonuses, which was 24 percent more than they received in 2014. The average bonus for a senior executive was $10,000.  I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans admirably each day. In my own district, I have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care that they receive from local VA clinics throughout upstate New VA employees should be fairly compensated for their work and awarded for their achievement.  It is also clear to me that there is more work to be done. Just this month, an audit of several VA facilities in North Carolina and Virginia revealed that wait times continue to be misrepresented and that nearly 14,000 veterans were denied access to timely care. The audit also found that veterans were waiting an average of 26 days to see mental health specialists, while the VA falsely reported average wait times of 6 days. In light of this information, the American people are right to wonder who at the VA may be receiving a bonus this year.  My amendment adds a simple reporting requirement to the bill that will streamline oversight of bonuses at the VA by requiring the agency to proactively provide information to Congress that details the amount of each bonus awarded to senior executives as well as the job titles of the individuals and the location of their employment. Given the patterns of mismanagement at the VA, the American people deserve to know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency. This bill increases transparency over the bonus process without placing any undue burdens on the agency.  I would encourage my colleagues to support it, and I thank the committee for the opportunity to offer this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

13791,topic-id,631,"Madam President, last night President Trump announced the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme He will fill the spot left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin  Justice Scalia left a profound mark on our judicial history. He had a brilliant mind, a ready wit, and a vivid and colorful writing style that made reading his decisions not only illuminating but enjoyable. But most importantly, Antonin Scalia had a profound respect for the rule of law and the He knew that he was a judge, not a legislator, and his job was not to make the law but to interpret the law. That is exactly what he did.  For 30 years, Justice Scalia ruled on the plain meaning of the laws and the His politics, his personal opinions, his own feelings about a case--none of those was allowed to play a role in his decision. He asked what the law said, what the Constitution said, and he ruled accordingly, even when he didn't like the result. Justice Scalia once said:       If you are going to be a good and faithful judge, you have      to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going      to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the      time, you are probably doing something wrong.  Needless to say, Justice Scalia left some big shoes to fill. But after learning a little about Judge Gorsuch, I have to say that if anyone can come to fill them, I think Judge Gorsuch can. Like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch has a brilliant mind. He shares Justice Scalia's gift for the written word. The Washington Post noted the many people ``who have praised Gorsuch's lucid and occasionally lyrical writing style.'' Slate called Judge Gorsuch's writing ``superb, incisive, witty, and accessible.''  But most importantly, like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch understands the role of a Supreme Court He knows that a Justice's job is to interpret the law, not write it. In a speech last year, Judge Gorsuch said the following: ``Perhaps the greatest project of Justice Scalia's career was to remind us of the differences between judges and legislators.''  Understanding those differences is indispensable. Brilliance, eloquence, learning, compassion--none of those things matter if you don't understand the proper role of the Supreme That role is to interpret the law, not make the law--to judge, not legislate; to call balls and strikes, not to try and rewrite the rules of the game.  It is great to have strong opinions. It is great to have sympathy for causes or organizations. It is great to have plans for fixing society's problems. But none of those things has any business influencing your ruling when you sit on the Supreme Judge Gorsuch understands this. That is why I trust him to sit on the Supreme  When Judge Gorsuch was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals 10 years ago, he was confirmed by a unanimous vote here in the You can't really get a more bipartisan confirmation than that. At the time, then-Senator Ken Salazar, a Colorado Democrat who later became Interior Secretary under Obama, noted that Judge Gorsuch ``has a sense of fairness and impartiality that is a keystone of being a judge.''  Given the wide respect in which Judge Gorsuch is held, his outstanding record, and his previous overwhelmingly bipartisan confirmation, I am hopeful that his nomination will move quickly through the Senate Democrats have spoken a lot about the need to fill the ninth seat on the Supreme Now is the chance.  I congratulate Judge Gorsuch on his nomination, and I look forward to seeing him confirmed to the Supreme  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

13829,topic-id,278,"Mr.Speaker, I know I, and many of my colleagues, share concern about a Federal regulatory code that has become so bloated with redundant, ineffective, and unnecessary rules that the sheer bulk of it threatens to suffocate American economic recovery and long-term prosperity.  The Bureau of Land Management's rule to reduce venting and flaring from existing oil and natural gas operations is one such example of duplicative and unnecessary regulation. Aside from the fact that the authority to regulate air quality does not rest with the BLM, we certainly don't need the BLM rule in addition to the EPA methane rule and State regulations, which our colleagues on the other side have noted and lauded that have come out of the State of  For all of the costs this rule would impose on industry, the supposed benefits of the rule would be emission reductions in the neighborhood of less than one one-hundredth of a percent of global greenhouse emissions. That is the definition of an ineffectual rule.  Methane is a marketable resource, and the oil and gas industry would prefer to economically capture and sell that resource, rather than vent or flare it, which is a necessary safety procedure in the absence of other viable options.  Instead of using its authority to take actions that would effectively facilitate capture versus venting or flaring, like processing pipeline right-of-way permits in a timely manner, the agency has once again issued a rule that unnecessarily burdens energy development.  There are cost-effective strategies available that will achieve emission reductions, and it is those strategies that we should focus our efforts on, rather than duplicative regulations.

13930,topic-id,3316,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in strong support of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch as Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  There has been a lot of debate about Judge Gorsuch and his candidacy for the Supreme Let me first review some of the things that really have not been debated. One is the intellect and the education and the knowledge of this man. It is really extraordinary.  Judge Gorsuch attended Columbia University as an undergrad, Harvard Law School, and he went on to Oxford for postgraduate work.  Nobody disputes the intellect, the education, and the knowledge that this man brings to this job. Nobody disputes his experience and qualifications, either. How could they? He has spent 10 years on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest level of courts in our American system. There is no question that Neil Gorsuch has the experience and the qualifications.  Character and temperament are extremely important--actually, essential--characteristics for a judge or a I have heard nobody criticize the character or temperament of Judge Gorsuch, whatsoever. In fact, he has only gotten glowing praise about both his integrity, his character, his temperament, and the way he treats people in his courtroom and throughout his life.  There is also no disputing that he has enjoyed very broad bipartisan support in the past and significantly to this day. First of all, there was not a single Senator who opposed his confirmation to the Tenth Circuit when he was nominated and confirmed.  President Barack Obama's Acting Solicitor General, a Democrat, has endorsed Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme A bipartisan group of attorneys, former colleagues from his law firm, classmates of his, and many people across the political spectrum from both parties who know this man personally have strongly endorsed his candidacy.  So as to these very important criteria--his intellect, his education, his knowledge, his experience, his temperament, his character--everything about this man is really quite extraordinary, and that is not even disputed. That is almost universally acknowledged.  So what is the attack? What is the criticism that we hear about Judge Gorsuch? Well, one is this notion that somehow he is outside the mainstream. We have heard this from some of our colleagues who intend not to support Judge  One of the things about being a circuit court judge is that it is actually quite easy to evaluate whether or not a circuit court judge is outside the mainstream because, as it happens, appellate court or circuit court judges don't rule alone. They rule in groups. It is usually a group of three when they are hearing a case as a subset of the full court, or it is the entire court. Either way, they are ruling with other judges.  So you can evaluate, for instance, how often they are by themselves, how often they are the sole minority dissenting view, because that might be an indication of someone who is outside the mainstream.  It is interesting. In the over 2,700 cases that Neil Gorsuch has decided on, in 99 percent of those cases, he was in the majority. In 97 percent of the cases, it was unanimous. How could that possibly be outside of the mainstream? That is not a valid argument at all.  As to the people who are trying to manufacture some opposition to Judge Gorsuch, what they are doing is they are cherry-picking a handful of the over 2,700 cases in which he has participated in, and they try to find a handful in which Judge Gorsuch did not rule in favor of litigants that our Democratic colleagues believe are politically sympathetic. That is what their argument has come down to.  The Democratic minority leader has been down on the floor for a speech, and I will quote from his speech. He said: ``I saw a judge who repeatedly decided with insurance companies that[[Page S2087]]wanted to deny disability benefits to employees.''  The Democratic leader goes on to say: ``I saw a judge who, in unemployment discrimination, sided with employers the great majority of the time.''  Here is another quote: ``Time and time again, his rulings favor the already powerful over ordinary Americans.''  The Democratic leader went on to marvel: ``Judge Gorsuch ruled against a teacher.'' ``Judge Gorsuch ruled against a truck driver.''  Now, even if you set aside the fact that the facts in these cases have been wildly distorted in the retelling that I have heard, and if you set aside the fact that even in those very cases in which Judge Gorsuch has ruled, often he has ruled with the Democratic judges who enjoy the support of our Democratic colleagues, and even if you ignore the fact that in many of these cases he was bound by precedent--he had no choice--you could also ignore all the many other cases in which Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of workers and unions and people who allege sexual harassment, environmentalists, immigrants, and other sympathetic litigants. The minority leader put all that aside. I think we have to ask a fundamental question: What is missing in this critique of Judge Gorsuch's decisions? What I find striking is that what is missing is any reference to the law. I don't hear them mention the law. I have not heard any of our Democratic colleagues, who intend to oppose Judge Gorsuch, say that he ignored the law or that he violated the law or that he misapplied the law or that he misunderstood the law. I don't hear anything of the sort.  Now, why do you suppose that is? I think I know why that is. I think because to many of the people who are threatening to oppose Neil Gorsuch, the law isn't what really matters the most. What really matters the most is that politically favored special interests or someone that they think the public will be sympathetic to has to win regardless of the law. They want a policy outcome and one that would benefit their perceived preferred litigants, rather than the law.  Here is what I think. I really think there are two unpardonable offenses in the minds of our friends and colleagues who are opposing Neil Gorsuch's nomination. The first is that Judge Gorsuch believes in the rule of law. I know he does. It is very, very clear. To some degree, there is a fundamental debate going on here between those who support his candidacy and those who oppose it, and it is fundamentally about the role of judges in the U.constitutional system.  One view, the view that I have--and I believe the one that Judge Gorsuch shares--is that the law totally matters. What the law says matters, and that includes the The words matter. And not only that, but it is up to the American people to change laws or to change the Constitution, if the American people see fit. It is up to judges to impartially apply the law and the Constitution, as it is written, and that is an important thing here. Both of these are important.  Under our view of the world, a judge is supposed to see everyone the same regardless of race, sex, wealth, political affiliation, or other characteristics. A judge is obligated to neutrally apply the law. Whether you are a man or a woman, young or old, rich or poor, Black or White, that is not supposed to matter to a judge. There is a reason our symbol of justice, Lady Justice, is depicted wearing a blindfold--it is because as a judge you are not supposed to decide based on these characteristics of a person; you are supposed to decide based on what the law says. This is fundamental to an independent judiciary, to a nation that lives by the rule of law.  But the other view, the critics' view--they constantly go back not to the law or the application of the law but to how sympathetic the litigants are. That is what matters most to them. That is an implicit rejection of the notion that everyone is equal before the law. Instead, in that world view, some are more equal than others and the law means whatever a judge thinks it should mean, and that is based significantly on whom the litigants are.  The same applies to the Constitution, in their world view, that of those who are opposing Judge The Constitution can't really mean exactly what it says--that can be very inconvenient--and so what the Supreme Court is supposed to be, in the minds of our friends who are opposing Judge Gorsuch, the Supreme Court is really a permanently sitting constitutional convention. Make up the Constitution as it goes along. Decide what it means today as opposed to what it meant yesterday or what it might mean tomorrow. The judges are supposed to be acutely sensitive to the race, wealth, political affiliation of the people who come before them, and those criteria matter a great deal.  In fact, you have to ask yourself, if that is the way you view the world, why even bother having a trial? Why not have a checklist and see whether the litigants come down on the politically sympathetic side of the ledger, and once you know that, you can decide? Why bother with the hassles or a trial or a case?  I would suggest that this approach to the law--the law that depends on the race, ethnicity, or any other criteria of the litigants--such a law is not a law at all. That is how a banana republic imposes the law; that is not how America views the law.  So my view, as I stated earlier, that the law means exactly what it says and nothing other than what it says--and that also applies to the Constitution--that is a view which is often described as originalism. The opponents' view, especially with respect to the Constitution--they believe the Constitution is a living document, meaning changes over time, in their view. I would suggest that this is the fundamental choice between the rule of law in the former case and the rule by judges in the latter case.  Justice Scalia once said: ``Every tin horn dictator in the world today, every president for life, has a Bill of Rights.'' The Bill of Rights only protects us if it is enforced and if it is enforced consistently and equally for everyone who is involved. How much protection does our Bill of Rights provide if, as Chief Justice Hughes stated in 1907, ``the Constitution is what the judges say it is''? Well, as Justice Scalia observed, once the original meaning of the Constitution can be set aside and judges can rewrite it, then they can rewrite and limit individual liberty or any other of the rights that are so fundamental to the nature of our country.  Let me give an example that makes this very specific. There is a case that came before the Supreme Court not very long ago called the Kelo decision. The Fifth Amendment states very clearly that the government cannot take private property unless it is ``for public use.'' That is what it says in the Look it up. Well, in the Kelo case, five Supreme Court Justices decided that public use can mean private use. The word ``public'' can mean ``private.'' Specifically in this case, what they said was that the government can come along and take an individual's home and give it to a private company--in this case, to use as a parking lot for a private venture. This is blatantly unconstitutional. It is very, very clear. Yet that is what happened when five Justices decided they could just rewrite the Constitution as they prefer it.  Here is the thing about this: Even if you believe it is a good idea to be able to take someone's house and give it to another private developer because he has a better use for it than the homeowner, if you think that is a good idea--I don't happen to think that is a good idea, but you might. If you do, we have a mechanism for making that policy permissible. You change the You amend the You can strike that word or insert another clause. There are any number of ways you can change that.  But here is what is so important: Under our constitutional system, the only people who get to change the Constitution are the American people. They do it through their elected representatives in the Congress and in the State legislatures, but they are the sovereigns. It is the American people who get to make these decisions, who determine policy, not five unelected guys wearing black robes, because when they get to make that policy, they are not accountable to anyone. They can't be fired. The Presiding Officer and I can be fired. If we are not[[Page S2088]]doing the job our constituents want us to do, we will be fired. That is how we are held accountable. Our constituents can replace us with people who will reflect the policies they want. That is why we are the policymakers under our constitutional system.  I believe Neil Gorsuch completely understands this. It is one of the reasons our friends on the other side of the aisle can't bring themselves to support him.  I think there were two unpardonable sins that Neil Gorsuch has committed. I just mentioned the first. I think the second one was that he was nominated by Donald We have folks in this Chamber who don't seem to be able to accept that they lost an election, and they are reflexively opposing whatever it is President Trump wants, and apparently they intend for that opposition to continue indefinitely.  In a public interview, the minority leader was quoted as saying: ``It is hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support.''  He was asked a follow-up question: ``So will you do your best to hold the seat open?''  The Democratic minority leader replied: ``Absolutely.''  Hold the seat open for 4 years or maybe 8 years? This is outrageous, and it is unprecedented.  If the minority leader were to get his way, for the first time in the history of the Republic, we would have a Supreme Court nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster. Let me stress this. This has never happened before in the history of the country. How many times have we nominated and confirmed Supreme Court Justices? Never once have we had a partisan filibuster used to block the consideration of a nominee. We have had people withdraw. We have had people who were voted down.  The case of Abe Fortas was an unusual case where there was a bipartisan filibuster because there was a perception of ethics problems, and he, in fact, had to resign as an Associate The bipartisan filibuster was used when there was an attempt by President Johnson to elevate him to Chief That is not the precedent. There is no precedent.  Take the case of Clarence In my lifetime, I am pretty sure Clarence Thomas was the most controversial nominee we have ever had. It was a brutal, very difficult, very contentious, really ugly process--the hearings, the nomination process, the confirmation process. In the end, Clarence Thomas was confirmed with 52 votes. Any Senator in the body could have insisted on a 60-vote threshold if it was there, but nobody did. No Senator did because the custom has been that Supreme Court Justices get confirmed if they have a majority of support. So what the minority leader wants to do is completely departing from that and establishing a new threshold.  The minority leader made an argument that is absolutely laughable. He suggested that because President Obama's nominees got 60 votes, well, then President Trump's should. What is laughable about that is the reason President Obama's nominees got 60 votes is because Republicans gave them those votes. I was running for the Senate at the time that Sonia Sotomayor was nominated, and I pointed out that there was a lot I disagreed about with her. I am sure I will not be happy with many of her decisions. But here we are in the President's new term--relatively early--and this is a qualified, capable person. I am not going to obstruct. I voted to confirm her, and a number of Republicans did join the Democrats, and President Obama got Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan confirmed to the bench.  The minority leader has suggested that there is this tradition of 60 votes. Well, you don't have to take my word for it; the Washington Post Fact Checker--not exactly the mouthpiece of the Republican Party--did their fact-checking analysis, and they said it was absolutely false. They gave him three  It is also one of the many ironies of this that the very same Democrats who insist that we should allow them to permanently block any Supreme Court nominee because they won't provide the votes to get to 60 are the ones who actually did break the Senate tradition and establish a 50-vote threshold when they wanted to pack the DC Circuit Court of Appeals back in 2013. Now they suggest that if we use the same tactic they used--although we are doing it for a different reason--that this would be an abomination, that the Democrats would never do this. Well, actually, they did in 2013. But as for the circumstances we face now, there is no mystery about what they would have done because they told us just 12 days before the election.  Our Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for Vice President, was asked: ``What happens if,'' as everyone expected at the time, ``Hillary Clinton becomes President and the Democrats take control of the Senate, if Republicans were to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee? What would you do?''  I will quote Senator He said: ``We will change the Senate rules to uphold the law, that the court will be nine members.''  Here is the truth: If the election had gone differently, if Hillary Clinton had won and if Democrats were in control of the Senate, then Republicans would have probably provided the votes for a competent, capable, qualified Supreme Court nominee, just as Republicans did for Elena Kagan and Sonia That is what history has shown. Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues at this point seem unwilling--or at least some of them are--to provide the same bipartisan cooperation to a new President attempting to fill a vacancy that Republicans provided to President  Let me conclude with this: The case for confirming Judge Gorsuch was summed up pretty well by the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune--again, not exactly the RNC's mouthpiece--in endorsing Neil They said:       Here is a judge who knows the law and knows the role of the      judiciary: He isn't on the bench to make law, he's there to      interpret it faithfully, because the separation of powers      among the branches of government serves our democracy.      Sometimes the result benefits liberal positions, sometimes      conservative. . . . Some of Gorsuch's critics think judges      should be creative and expansive depending on the political      climate--to treat laws differently on a cold night than a      warm one. Those critics suggest that they fear Gorsuch won't      follow the law, but the opposite is more true: They fear he      will. Gorsuch should be confirmed.  If our Democratic colleagues aren't willing to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, then there is no one they are going to vote to confirm to the Supreme And we cannot allow a Democratic minority to block an up-or-down vote and deny filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court for 4 or 8 years. We simply can't allow that to happen, and I trust that we won't.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

13826,topic-id,379,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution and efforts to roll back important protections for not only our environment, but for American taxpayers.  Our Nation's public lands belong to all Americans, and they are managed to balance many competing uses: recreation; responsible economic development; sustainable resource extraction; yes, renewable energy; military purposes; and conservation of historic American landscapes, just to name a few. As such, they should be subject to strong national standards that protect our shared water, shared lands, wildlife, and the multiple uses they support.  It is also critical to remember that use of our public lands is a privilege, not a right; and companies seeking to exercise that privilege, whether they be fossil fuel companies or clean energy companies developing wind, solar, and geothermal projects, should be held to a very high standard to preserve and protect resources that belong to all of the American people.  We must also make sure that the taxpayers get a fair return for the use and development of our commonly shared resources. The Mineral Leasing Act, as written by Congress, calls upon the Secretary of the Interior to prevent the waste of oil and gas resources on public lands.  The Bureau of Land Management's methane waste rule achieves all of these shared goals: the rule prevents the waste of resources that belong to all American people, which, by law, it is required to do; it reduces the amount of greenhouse gas pollution coming off our public lands; and it increases royalty payments to Federal taxpayers and the  The methane waste rule also supports job creation and American innovation in new technologies. The methane mitigation industry is a growing and emerging field that uses modern technologies to identify and capture wasteful emissions. In fact, a 2014 report commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund found that methane mitigation companies provide jobs in 46 States and support 102 manufacturing and assembly locations, with 59 percent of all companies across the industry being small businesses.  If Republicans had brought this resolution before the House Natural Resources Committee, we could have more thoroughly examined its negative impacts on job creation. Instead, it was rushed to the House floor with only this 1 hour of debate.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.

13724,topic-id,746,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Honorable Michael Newman, Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, and who is president of the Federal Bar Association, for his achievements in piloting a special veterans court in Dayton,  With Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the Dayton VA Medical Center both located in the Dayton community, and with the large number of veterans residing in my 10th Congressional District, southwest Ohio is a prime region for establishing a court that concentrates on veterans' issues.  Judge Newman's veterans court appears to be the first of its kind in the State of Ohio, and it aims to address an area of need in the Miami Valley, assisting military veterans who have been charged with relatively minor offenses get their lives back on track.  In many cases, treatment and strong guidance is a better course of action to remedy misdemeanor Federal offenses than jail time, which can lead to a cascade of negative unintended consequences, such as difficulty in obtaining employment.  Thanks to Judge Newman's efforts to cooperate with the United States Attorney's Office and the Federal Public Defender's Office, veterans in the Dayton, Ohio, area can receive treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues, which so often underpin these minor offenses, rather than sitting in jail.  Veterans who decide to participate in Judge Newman's 6-month-long pilot program are required to work closely with a Veterans Justice Outreach coordinator, who acts as a mentor and caseworker, providing guidance, facilitating treatment, and helping secure housing and employment.  Besides meeting with their veterans officer, veterans must also attend medical appointments, receive recommended treatment, and not reoffend in order to graduate. Upon successful completion, the misdemeanor charges are frequently dismissed, allowing former servicemembers to truly earn themselves a second chance at life.  Of the more than 33 veteran participants thus far, 20 have successfully completed the program, and several others are continuing to make progress as we speak.  I commend Judge Newman for instituting an innovative Federal veterans court program that addresses critical needs within our community and resolves programs by rehabilitating rather than simply punishing the brave men and women who have served our country.  I also would like to congratulate Judge Newman for his work in implementing a civics program for students to learn about the Federal courts. Developing a partnership between the Federal judiciary and the Federal Bar Association, these interactive court camps invite elementary, middle, and high school students into the Federal courts to learn about the third branch of government.  During court camp, Federal judges meet with the groups of students in school classrooms, as well as Federal courtrooms, to teach them about the[[Page H2525]]selection process for Federal judges, explain how decisions are made in both criminal and civil cases, and offer an insider's view on how the Federal court system works.  Under Judge Newman's leadership, the Federal Bar Association's partnership with the United States Courts will give thousands of young people across the country the opportunity to meet with Federal judges and explore the judicial branch of government.  In Dayton, Ohio, alone, where Judge Newman sits, over 1,000 students will participate in the civics program, learning more about the Constitution and Bill of Rights, the separation of powers, the role of the Federal judge, the structure of the Federal court system, and how to become a judge or lawyer themselves.  The Federal Bar Association has also added a civics page to its website to make educational materials available for lawyers and judges who choose to serve as mentors in the program.  In an effort to encourage direct involvement by American government teachers and students alike, the Federal Bar Association, again under Judge Newman's leadership, is holding a national essay contest for middle and high school students on the subject ``What Does an Impartial Judicial System Mean to Me?''  In addition to honoring the student essay winners, the Federal Bar Association and United States Courts will also recognize a select group of top-notch civics teachers from across the United  As president of the Federal Bar Association and a United States magistrate, Judge Newman has spearheaded this effort, publicly urging the association's 19,000 members to join him in engaging the next generation of attorneys, judges, and legislators.  I commend Judge Newman on his tireless work to connect our young people to the best and brightest in the field of law, and for reemphasizing the critical importance of civics in American society.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2524.txt,1741,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,29.0,January
13537,topic-id,2087,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition to H.1259. Let me be clear that I rise in opposition not after serving this Nation in uniform for 24 years; not after serving on this committee longer than anyone else on the committee; and not with serving honorably with my friend, the chairman, who--I want to be clear, first of all, where the commonality lies around this issue, about 95 percent of it, you are not going to find daylight between us.  The idea that anyone would put a special interest ahead of the care of a veteran is not only distasteful, it is wrong to assume that. There are legitimate differences on how to get accountability in the VA, and we have come to some conclusions that get us pretty close. This piece of legislation--and I do not condemn the committee because this is truly a bipartisan committee, but, for whatever reason, for the first time in the decade-plus that I have served on this committee, we have brought a bill to the floor without a hearing.  We held a markup and brought it to the floor. The majority has the right to do as they please. What that deprives us of is the ability to build consensus around issues we know we share. I know the chairman's heart is providing absolute best care to every single veteran. I also know the chairman's heart is to make sure that every employee who is doing their job is respected the way they are supposed to be. There is not disagreement on that.  This piece of legislation, and framing it as a false choice between veterans and the employees, the majority of whom are veterans, in many cases, serving other veterans, is a false choice. The chart that was put up, I belong to half those organizations. There is also an organization that is on there that differs from the others because it is a 501(c)(4) with the sole purpose of political attack ads on Members of the opposing party. Leave them off the sheet. The other ones I agree with. The others are 501(c)(3)s advocating for veterans, but for us to pretend this isn't a[[Page H2116]]proxy fight for outside groups on something bigger is disingenuous and moves us away from the place we should have gotten.  To show you the comity, my friend from Tennessee gave an impassioned, logical, and, in my opinion, correct assessment on the Veterans 2nd Amendment, H.1181. I agree with the chairman on this. I believe we could have built consensus by bringing that through the committee, but it doesn't change the fact that I think the chairman eloquently got to the heart of that. I know what the heart of that was because the majority side used the term over two dozen times, ``due process.'' It matters. These are veterans working in the VA who should have due process to their Second Amendment rights and to their employment rights. It ensures that the working environment attracts and retains the best and brightest.  So let's go through a little bit of what is here. One of the things is, we talk about going back and breaking a sacred pledge. You can disagree what is in the collective bargaining that was done between the administrations, Republican and Democrat, and those employees who work there, but to go in and arbitrarily change that from Congress, how is that due process? How about in the next bargaining agreement you make the case that those things need to be there. I will stand there with you and tell you this: The public sector unions need to give more, because you know what happens if they don't? They get painted with those examples.  I hear some people say there are 350,000 employees in the VA, and they gave five examples of five bad people. You should give those examples. That is unacceptable, horrid, and should never be agreed to. This is a zero sum proposition. If one bad employee gives substandard care, Mr.Chairman, to one veteran, that is a failure, and the majority and the minority are in absolute agreement on that.  But here is what I fear. We have had legislation--and I will offer up an amendment to do this--that has bipartisan support, that has Senate support. We will see if I am right or wrong on this, but I am almost certain--and it is our responsibility in this House not to message things for those outside groups to run attack ads, it is to get things that actually get through.  I am saying today--and I will be the first to come back and tell you I was wrong on this--the process of getting legislation into law to be enacted by the agencies means compromise must be there. I think we come back here in October, this isn't done yet. Why don't we give on the 5 percent that is not agreed upon and get the 95 percent right so we can act to enact it? This is going to be the perfect getting in the way of the good, and I would argue the zeal to get it done in the way of due process.  I do not question the heart of any of my colleagues to get this right. I do not question--I hope it would not come back to me--the outrage I feel when I hear the story--and I know when the chairman tells me it, it is true--of someone showing up intoxicated trying to provide care to a veteran. How in goodness name is that person not done, not removed, and not moved forward? I will have to tell you this: I have been there on this. I am a public schoolteacher. Do you know who hates a bad public schoolteacher the most? A good public schoolteacher. What really angers me is when management doesn't do their dang job, follow the law and remove those people, and give the due process to them.  The same thing happens in the Management needs to do their job. We have issued subpoenas for Phoenix, we have issued subpoenas for Philadelphia, we have issued subpoenas for Paul of people doing egregious things, not caring for veterans. They should come here, and they should lose their jobs. In some cases, they did. Do you know what they all did have in common? None of them were part of a collective bargaining agreement. They were the management. My fear on this is you have bad managers making bad decisions, and if someone speaks up, Mr.Chairman, who is a lower ranking member, their only protection to improve the system is by collectively bargained grievance processes to make sure their due process is heard. That is all we are asking for.  I do not deny there are going to be proxy fights on this. I will not deny that I believe the public sector unions need to be in a partnership with this. I believe we should have had them in a hearing and set those union members down there and asked them: How in God's name can you justify this? Ask them and say: What would help so that we can do this?  I have witnessed this as a public schoolteacher. Beating up on public schoolteachers all the time is not the best way to entice good people to go into public school teaching. I ask people, whether it be teachers or the veterans--go ask your veterans, how many have received quality care at the VA? How many really appreciate that floor nurse who did what he or she was supposed to do? How many are grateful that their cardiac surgeon is one of the best in the world and is choosing to make less money to serve there?  But I won't deny this. We have managers who are unaccountable. This piece of legislation does not get at the heart of it because the teeth are saved for the rank-and-file members. I agree. I think the gentleman is exactly right.  I want to read something. You tell me if this is okay. We had a VA employee who was written up and subsequently fired because they were practicing medicine without a license. That is outrageous. Outrageous that you would go there and you don't have the license, and you are practicing medicine. That person was fired. If we pass this piece of legislation, they are done and they are not coming back.  But there is a little bit different story to this. This was a Navy veteran in Arkansas, and you know what they got it for? Not picking up a scalpel and doing something that a doctor should do, not writing a prescription for an opioid and trying to steal medicine, which does happen. What they did was, they entered the wrong code on a chart, and that got them for practicing medicine without a license.  When they went through the approved negotiated grievance process, not only did they find out that this was wrong to this combat Navy veteran trying to serve other veterans who was discharged by a manager, it turns up the lack of management oversight. It was the entire system was flawed and the chart was wrong. So the grievance process not only returned the employee back to their rightful job, it fixed the system guaranteeing better care for veterans going forward.  So I don't disagree. When we try and make it, the big scary thing is, oh, we have unions that don't care about veterans, don't care about what the care is, and what we need to do is fire those people immediately. Well, you know what? Some of them do need to be fired. But if there is not a process in place--this Navy veteran caring for other veterans was released without due process--we don't find out about a broken system putting veterans' care at risk. That is what is at stake here.  My point is not to disagree. The chairman has insights into veterans that I think are second to none. The committee works together on this. Once again, when you gain the most votes, you get the majority, and I respect that. But I would also say that if we want to build consensus around this, I am going to offer up a piece of legislation that was written by a Republican Senator that has the ability to pass, be signed into law, and will get at the heart of this by going after the managers.  Mr.Chairman, it is important to me, and I know it is important to my chairman, a Vietnam veteran himself, it is important to the staff sitting behind, veterans ourselves, that we not allow what has happened in this country to get into the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, to divide us over talking points when our goals are exactly the same.  When we have legitimate differences, again, I don't think it is fair to me, as a veteran and a union member, to put something up that says you are choosing sides. I am not choosing sides. We are all in this together. What I disagree with is it is my opinion--and I wish I would have had experts testify to this, employment law people, bring the union folks in there, have us have this debate so that we can say: you know what, these changes are good, these won't make a difference.  I respectfully oppose the way this legislation is written. I respectfully totally associate myself with the chairman on why he wants to do it and why he believes that this is best. I only ask,[[Page H2117]]take a look at some of the improving amendments that can get us all to the same point, and give us the benefit of the doubt that we are not assuming the worst. And I don't--as some have said, this is an attempt to bust unions or bust the civil service system. That is the farthest thing from the chairman's mind. I know that because never, in my experience, has he done anything to disprove that veterans' care comes first, quality of care at the VA comes first, and accountability must go with that. My concern is, this doesn't get us there nor does it have a chance to become into law. With those things, let's come back at it, let's approach it a little differently, and let's find the common ground that is there.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

13545,topic-id,922,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, you are hearing it here, and these are folks, we work together. This idea of accountability matters deeply to all of us. We know when you are in any business, this business--we have had colleagues of ours in here be arrested for buying cocaine from undercover police officers in Washington, D. Well, that brings great discredit to every single one of us, but I certainly don't think it requires all of us, then, to go through the same thing that person is going through or deprive us our rights of where we are at. This idea of due process, and what we are asking about, is not something meant to protect a bad employee. In fact, it is just the opposite. It is meant to improve the workforce.  My plea on this is--much of this bill, there is agreement on, Mr.Takano was right--it went a step further. Having been a rank-and-file person in a collectively bargained unit, my goal was to provide the best quality education so our students could learn--an environment, quality teachers, and all of those things.  I am at a loss for the desire to come here and decide that, and again, we say it in passing: Well, I don't want to deride all of those really good employees who are there. I just want to take away their collectively bargained right that was there.  Even though we can give example after example, like He was a[[Page H2120]]service-connected disabled Navy veteran with over a decade of experience at the Veterans Benefits He was demoted after consistently, every single year, receiving highly satisfactory or top-rated performance reviews. Robert volunteered to be part of a quality review team to get rid of the backlog, and he had the audacity to tell his manager that there were better ways we could do this. Perhaps all of this overtime pay and consolidating all of these claims to one place was not in the best interest of that. That manager, on the way out the door, demoted and tried to remove Robert from that position.  Now, keep in mind, that same manager, all of those years before, had rated him well. Well, maybe something happened. Maybe Robert started doing something wrong. Maybe Robert wasn't that good an employee.  But again, under this piece of legislation, Robert's collectively bargained right--which he used and grieved it and got back his job, and subsequently, the manager had problems on their performance reviews, where it came from.  So again, don't set this up as if everything is wrong.  And I would make note of this: We are doing our best to attract the best and brightest to the Nobody is defending the bad. But when I hear folks come to the floor and it is nothing but what a horrific place this is, I leave this for you, Mr. I also have the privilege of representing America's premier medical institution in the Mayo Clinic, and I look at what they do. Folks at Mayo Clinic will tell me some of the finest cardiac surgeons in the world are at the Minneapolis  I will also tell you this. If you, in America, go to any hospital--Roe can attest to this--the thing that you should probably be most worried about and the thing that kills most people--over 90,000 a year--is hospital-acquired infections.  Do you know who does it better and has the lowest rate, better than Mayo Clinic, better than Johns Hopkins? The So somebody among those rank-and-file members who is cleaning the operating rooms and cleaning the equipment is doing so in a manner that is better than any other.  What message are we sending them today? If a manager doesn't do their job and decides they want to fire you, we are going to lump everybody together. I just ask, once again, to my colleagues, to this body, these are things that should have been debated in a hearing. We should have brought in the experts.  Here is what I think. I think you would build a broader coalition--because I have to be very honest with you. I think our public sector unions could help us and step up and say: What was the real situation here? How do you respond to this egregious breach of trust? And what do you think would be a better way?  I am not saying they would give us a suggestion. I want to be very honest and not disingenuous. They may not answer us. We should have at least asked them: What would you do to make this better? What could speed it up, and what could protect them?  We didn't do that because we didn't have a hearing, and I think that stops building the consensus. I think it makes it harder to get this.  I will tell you this. The bill I keep referencing that was over in the Senate had 45 Senate cosponsors. Good luck getting 45 of them to agree today. It is Thursday, and we did it on an accountability plea that also had the support of every single one of those groups on there, except one, to support that piece of legislation.  So we went a step further. We didn't have a hearing. We tried to let outside groups frame this as a veterans versus public sector union folks, who were also veterans. That is not what it is. We just need to get it right.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2114.txt,1856,VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT OF 2017,2017.0,16.0,January
13547,topic-id,573,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, we are not going to find a lot of disagreement.  I will tell you what a good first step would be: hire some surgeons. There are openings there. This is our first salvo at trying to fix the We have an appeals bill that every single veterans service organization agrees: appeals modernization. We have worked that thing through. We have had the language. It is not here.  We have a Choice bill that is expiring August 7. We have had a hearing with the VA Secretary, and that is the way it should have been. It is not here today.  What we have is a bill that did not go through regular order, a bill that obviously didn't build a consensus, and this is very unusual to have a bill from the VA I bet you 90 to 95 percent of the time when one hits this floor, it gets 300 to 400 votes up on that board, but this one is not.  So, again, if the contention is that Members of this House don't care if there is a bad employee working there, that is disingenuous and wrong. But if we do believe, putting it in place--and again, the example I gave, the chairman is right. It took Robert 6 weeks to get all of the information gathered together because the manager who left was holding on to it and had to get the union to force the release of that information. His 14 days would have come and gone, and that is it.  This is why, sometimes, I am not going to defend 400 days. That is ridiculous. I am not going to spend--if they are dragging their feet. But this guy got fired by a manager, got demoted down, wanted to get the information. The outgoing manager said, ``It isn't my problem.'' The union had to go--and had to go, in this case, almost to court--to get the information back to them so he could present a case that said exactly what was ruled upon: You got fired illegally by a bad manager.  I am telling people, if you are angry when things go wrong at the VA, you have got 330 million Americans who are with you. We have subpoenaed them. None of them were collectively bargained. The problem is in management and middle management not doing their job.  Do your work.  You know what would be great is if the management actually did what they are supposed to do and improved bad performance before it gets to a point where it causes problems and you actually improve that employee, which saves us money from having to go out and hire someone else and you have the system working better. But to watch something go wrong, not do your due diligence, not follow the law, then fire someone and then complain that it takes too long to fix it, how about we figure out what really gets, keeps, retains, and makes the VA better?  There are other places that we could work on. Ninety percent of it, you have got my agreement. I think you are going to see that 10 percent is going to ensure this does not get into law; and that, in itself, is simply wrong because[[Page H2121]]no one disagrees.

13559,topic-id,479,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Chairman Roe of Tennessee and Chairman Sessions of the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order. I have voiced my concern with the regular order. I think it is important to note that we are given the opportunity here to offer amendments in good faith, and I am grateful for that.  This amendment to H.1259 would replace sections 3 and 9 of the underlying bill with bipartisan legislation from the Veterans First Act that was first introduced by Senator Isakson last This is a piece of legislation I have been talking about.  It is supported from both sides of the aisle, as well as those veterans service organizations, with the exception of one, that was shown earlier.  If we hope to reach any compromise with the Senate on accountability, I believe this amendment could be made in order, be voted on, debated, and passed into it.  The amendment specifically targets senior executives. It has been the senior executives, not the frontline employees, who we have subpoenaed before our committee, and who the VA has failed to hold accountable.  Like H.1259, it provides an expedited process for the VA Secretary to hold senior executives and VA employees accountable.  For a senior executive employee, the employee would get 10 business days' notice. The employee subject to an adverse action would be able to grieve the action through an internal grievance process that would take no longer than 21 days. The employee would also be permitted to appeal an adverse action to court. It would also require the VA Secretary to develop a performance management system for SES employees. Do your job. Have the management do their job.  For VA employees, the employee would be removed from misconduct or poor performance that took place within the previous 2 years before the proposed removal. The employee would get 10 business days' notice. The employee would get 10 business days to respond to the charges. The VA Secretary would be required to provide the employee a decision in a reasonable period of time, and the employee would have 10 days to appeal the decision to the Merit Systems Protection This takes a little time.  The Merit Systems Protection Board would have 90 days to issue a decision. During that time, the employee would receive no pay and no benefits.  My amendment would also leave in place sections 4 through 8 of H.1259 because I agree employees convicted of felonies connected to their jobs should not receive pensions, and poor-performing employees should not receive bonuses. No disagreement.  Most importantly, my amendment provides a fair process that protects whistleblowers. By allowing our frontline employees to use arbitration and grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements, these frontline employees remain protected from bad managers who want to retaliate against them for speaking out when something is wrong.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2114.txt,1856,VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT OF 2017,2017.0,16.0,January
13560,topic-id,281,"Mr.Chairman, the choice is not as easy as that. Do you want to stand with Robert, the good employee who was fired by a bad manager who used the process to get their job back, or do we want to just hurry it?  It is better to get it right than get it done. And I will point out, AFGE, the union you keep hearing about, Mr.Chairman, does not endorse my amendment. They do not endorse my amendment, nor do I care about that.  What I do believe is that this amendment has the opportunity to improve upon on a bill that we 90 percent agree upon, taking out the piece that is going to make it difficult and not improve care for our veterans. And I guess the thing that I would hope matters, I believe--and we will come back here and see. We will see. That is the good part about this place. If this piece of legislation is passed by October, by Halloween, we should have this bill through and it should be done, and we should be seeing changes.  If we don't, perhaps we do this exercise again, through regular order, taking some of these suggestions that make it possible to get it done.  I encourage my colleagues to support this change that makes sure we can get accountability. Let's agree where we know we agree. It is not picking one over the other. It is deciding how you give due process, encouraging good employees to have the rights that they have earned to improve that care and workplace while at the same time removing those that don't.

13566,topic-id,277,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing this forward. This amendment addresses an issue that we dealt with in our committee last Congress, where senior executives are transferred to different positions around the country, receive pay increases and relocation incentives.  We subpoenaed two senior executives. In fact, the first subpoenas ever issued out of the VA Committee, I asked for them to get there; and they were backed by Mr.Roe, backed by our chairman and ranking member. And to refresh people's minds, these were folks that took positions of lesser power, used their positions to negotiate to get there, and then, in some cases, took $129,000 moving expenses.  You cannot find anyone more outraged than me. And I will tell you, because it was not done correctly, and we didn't focus on this, I still work with some of those very same people. They have their jobs back.  Now, the debate that the gentleman may have heard earlier is we don't disagree at all that we should get rid of these people. This amendment will focus on the right things, that is what we have been making the case of.  So I applaud the gentleman. I am glad he is here. His military service is greatly appreciated.

13936,topic-id,827,"Mr.President, Republicans are in charge of the Senate, and so far they haven't put up for a vote in this Congress a single piece of original legislation to help working families--not one. They haven't fixed a single piece of our crumbling infrastructure. They haven't put Americans back to work. They haven't brought down the soaring cost of prescription drugs. And they haven't done a thing to help the 55 million Americans who don't have access to a workplace retirement account to save for their retirement. But they have been busy.  Here is what they have done so far: They have made it easier for giant corporations to hide the payments they make to foreign countries. They have made it easier for companies to discharge filth into our rivers and streams. They have made it easier for Americans suffering from mental illness to buy guns. They have made it easier for hunters to shoot baby bears and wolf cubs from planes. They have made it easier for companies that get big-time, taxpayer-funded government contracts to steal wages from their employees. They have made it easier for employers to hide injuries their workers suffer on the job. They have made it easier for States to divert Federal education dollars away from struggling schools and students. They have made it easier for States to block people who are out of work from getting unemployment insurance payments that they are entitled to by law. And they have made it easier to keep local residents from having a say in how Federal lands are managed.  Now they are back at it again, this time to overturn a rule that will help millions of Americans start saving for their retirement. For years, the Republican-controlled Congress has done nothing to help the 55 million Americans who don't have an employer-provided retirement plan save for their retirement. Because of this Federal inaction, 7 States have passed legislation to provide retirement accounts to their constituents, and 23 others are considering proposals. The efforts of just those 7 States could expand coverage to 15 of the 55 million Americans who don't currently have an employer-sponsored retirement account.  In addition to these State efforts, three cities are actively considering proposals to curb the retirement savings gap, potentially covering another 2 million Extending coverage to 17 million Americans would go a long way toward starting to chip away at the retirement crisis in this country.  Today, among working families on the verge of retirement, about one-third have no retirement savings of any kind, and another one-third have total savings that are less than 1 year's income. This is a real problem, and Senate Republicans should be working hard to come up with solutions to fix it. But if they don't have any ideas of their own, the least they can do is step aside and let the hard-working Governors, mayors, State treasurers, city councils, and State legislatures continue their important efforts to try to solve our retirement crisis.  Every single time the Senate has come to the floor of this Congress to overturn an Obama administration rule, Republican Senators have said they were voting to remove burdensome Federal regulations that ``severely limit the role of State and local governments,'' when local governments ``could do a much better job of providing for the people of our State.'' So why on earth are they now voting to make it harder for cities and States to help their own citizens save for retirement? Why? Three words: chamber of commerce.  The chamber of commerce and the trade associations for the giant financial firms have been fighting tooth and nail to kill these retirement initiatives. Their armies of lobbyists have been deployed to peddle misinformation about what these plans do, all because the giant financial firms that the chamber of commerce and the trade associations represent are worried that the city and State plans might actually offer better investment products with lower fees.  The American people are not calling their Senators asking us to work day in and day out to overturn rules to help them save for their retirement; 72 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats support these initiatives. They aren't calling us and asking us to make their water dirty or to let their employer put their lives at risk by cutting corners on safety either.  The American voters didn't send us to Washington to work for the lawyers and the lobbyists and the giant corporations that keep corporate profits soaring by skirting basic regulations.  This vote may be really good for filling the campaign coffers of Senate Republicans, and a few of them may pop champagne corks with their buddies at the chamber of commerce after this vote tonight, but Americans are watching, and they will be ready to fight back.

13836,topic-id,349,"Mr.Speaker, American workers and American businesses are the most innovative and productive in the world. This is no more evident than in our oil and gas fields--the ones in my district, in my State, across our country, and offshore.  Mr.Speaker, in spite of the Obama administration's war on energy, our producers made huge gains in technology, production, and productivity to meet the needs and lower energy costs.  The gentleman from California is correct, energy production has increased during the Obama administration. According to this 2016 CBO report, both oil and gas production has increased on State and private lands both onshore and offshore. However, during the same time, under the heavy hand of the Obama administration, production on Federal lands has decreased. The Energy Information Administration reported that oil production on non-Federal lands has increased 89 percent while it has decreased 10 percent on Federal lands, while gas production has increased 37 percent on non-Federal lands and decreased 37 percent on Federal lands.  The Bureau of Land Management's venting and flaring rule is an overreach of the Obama administration. This is not about the environment. It is about extending the war on energy to private and State lands. The rule increases costs on producers, which are then passed on to customers, stifling job growth and hurting the economy.  The BLM, as it has already been said, does not even have the legal authority to regulate air quality. It is an authority expressly provided to the EPA by the Clean Air Methane emissions are already on the decline, dropping 21 percent since 1990 to 2014. This drop occurred despite the rise in natural gas production by nearly 47 percent. If the venting and flaring rule goes into full effect, it will cost nearly $1 billion by 2025.  The result of overregulation is a decrease in domestic energy production, lost jobs, a battered economy, and an increased dependence on foreign energy sources. A repeal of the venting and flaring rule is necessary to protect our economy, the Constitution, and the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

13905,topic-id,1854,"Mr.President, with the Republican plan to defeat the Affordable Care Act itself defeated, President Trump says he wants to move beyond healthcare to focus on other priorities. One area that he has often highlighted is our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, which is a priority that many of us share and is something I would like to discuss today.  All of our kids, I suspect, dread having to bring home a lousy report card. They would be facing a serious talk.  Every 4 years, the American Society of Civil Engineers issues a report card for American infrastructure. Our 2017 report card--out just this month--shows lousy marks across the board for American infrastructure. Our ports and bridges got C-pluses, flat Ds for both drinking water infrastructure and roads, and our energy grid got a D-plus. Overall, the United States took home a D-plus grade point average. It is not pretty, and not an improvement over the scores we got 4 years earlier.  A report card is a progress report, and our grades show we are not making progress. So it is time to get serious about the sorry state of America's roads, bridges, ports, and pipes, which literally keep our economy moving.  The Civil Engineers estimate that we need an additional $2 trillion in infrastructure investments over the next 10 years to get our infrastructure back to a B grade level. The study also found that there is a cost for lousy infrastructure--that we are set to lose nearly $4 trillion in GDP and $7 trillion in lost business sales by 2025, which would result in 2.5 million fewer jobs that year.  America's declining infrastructure also faces growing demand. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates an additional 100 million more people will rely on our transportation system by midcentury. The U.Department of Transportation says that we can expect twice the level of freight traffic on our highways and roads by then, so our already worn-down infrastructure is going to take an even heavier beating. We have to be ready for this. We have to make smart investments in the infrastructure backbone of American commerce. We should make those investments now, and we should make them for the long term.  I am hopeful. Transportation infrastructure has been a rare bipartisan bright spot in After all, our red States and our blue States both have bridges that age and water mains that rupture.  Congress has tried many times to push large bipartisan infrastructure bills. In the 112th Congress, a bipartisan group led by Senators Kerry, Graham, and Hutchinson, introduced the BUILD Act to create a national infrastructure bank that would have authorized up to $10 billion to underwrite transportation, water, and energy projects.  The Partnership to Build America Act, introduced in the 113th Congress by Senators Bennet and Blunt, also proposed an American infrastructure fund, this time financed with a form of tax repatriation.  In the 114th Congress, we were actually able to pass the first long-term transportation law in 10 years. The FAST Act--short for Fixing America's Surface Transportation--authorized more than $300 billion in transportation infrastructure investment over a 5-year period.  We also passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act to address drinking water emergencies and authorize a number of new Army Corps of Engineers projects, including the removal of pilings and debris from the Providence River in Rhode These bipartisan successes, however, barely put a dent in our Nation's total infrastructure needs.  Out on the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald Trump spoke broadly of a $1 trillion infrastructure push. I agree we have to make that investment in America's infrastructure, but we also need to make sure we get real commitment from Washington, not just public-private partnerships and nebulous tax cuts. To bring our roads and bridges into the 21st century, we need a far-reaching infrastructure program like Franklin Roosevelt's Works Progress  The Joint Economic Committee's Democratic contingent put out a report analyzing the President's proposal to use investor tax credits to close our infrastructure gap. What they found was that using these tax credits alone would actually ``cost nearly 55 percent more than traditional infrastructure financing.'' We can't let infrastructure turn into a special interest boondoggle.  In the absence of any sort of Executive plan or strategy, Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Schumer, put forward our own blueprint to rebuild America's infrastructure. It would invest $1 trillion in the Nation's infrastructure, as the President wished, creating over 50 million American jobs. The blueprint encompasses not just roads and bridges but parks, schools, hospitals, and airports. It calls for investing $100 billion in smalltown communities that need revamped infrastructure, over $100 billion in aging water and sewer systems, $50 billion in our railways, over $100 billion in public transportation, and $30 billion in our essential port infrastructure. It would put billions toward modernizing our energy grid by connecting rural areas and driving investment in clean energy.  It includes strong support for American workers--something the President claims as a priority--with ``Buy American'' provisions to promote American-made products and protections like the Davis-Bacon law to make sure Americans earn fair wages.  For a coastal State like Rhode Island, which has to prepare for rising seas and increased storm surges from climate change, the blueprint includes $25 billion to improve coastal infrastructure and make coastal communities more resilient. This includes competitive critical infrastructure resiliency funding, a new Resilient Communities Revolving Loan Fund, and support for the National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund, which I authored sometime ago to research, restore, and reinforce our cause. Our plan is big, it is bold, and it should garner the support of anyone who says they want to improve America's infrastructure and create jobs at home.  This work is vitally important in my home The American Society of Civil Engineers' report card shines a light on Rhode Island's particular infrastructure woes. It shows we need $148 million for drinking water infrastructure needs and nearly $2 billion for wastewater infrastructure fixes over the next 20 years. We have $4.7 million of backlogged park system repairs and a $241 million gap in needed upgrades at schools.  More than half of our roads are in poor condition. A lot of our infrastructure, unlike Alaska, dates back to colonial days when the foundations of our roads were first traveled by ox carts. This state of disrepair costs my constituents a lot of money. I have been told by the transportation research group TRIP that driving on cracked and crumbling roads in Rhode Island costs our motorists $604 million per year--more than $810 per motorist, per year, in vehicle repair and operating costs from banging into potholes.  In our State, 56 percent of the bridges are deficient or obsolete. That, I am sorry to say, is the worst rate in the country. Those bridges have been around a long time in many cases, and they are literally falling down piece by piece. It can be pretty shocking to see.  This photo shows part of the 6/10 Connector in The interchange is a vital link in the State's highway network for vehicles traveling between[[Page S2067]]Interstates 95, 195, and 295. It was built in stages through the 1950s, and it can no longer accommodate the approximately 100,000 automobiles and heavy trucks that travel on it each day. Our department of transportation has spent millions of dollars on temporary maintenance to keep the interchange shored up and in operation, but you can see that this type of jury-rigging is not a lasting solution.  While Rhode Island directs millions of State funds to repair and replacement of these structures, we need some Federal financing to ensure that this work gets done before a serious failure occurs, which could disrupt commerce up and down the entire Northeast  The evidence of dangerous disrepair is all over my This photo depicts a crumbling bridge on Route 37, the east-west freeway servicing the cities of Cranston and The tumbledown cement and rusting ironwork are not reassuring. Here is another graphic showing a rusted and ramshackle bridge over Highway 95. We can save money in the long term--a stitch in time saves nine--if we can get on to these repairs and get these bridges fixed.  We also have to consider the bridges, roads, ports, rails, and other transit systems in the Ocean State that are, as you might imagine, very close to our coast. This infrastructure is at particular risk from sea level rise, from storm surge, and from the more severe storms that come at us offshore, driven by warming seas and climate change.  Recently, NOAA released updated global sea level rise estimates, and they focused those global estimates on the U.coastline. The estimate for their ``extreme'' scenario--that is, if we continue to emit high levels of carbon pollution--was increased by half a meter, to a total of 2.5 meters or over 8 feet of global mean sea level rise by 2100.  My State's Coastal Resources Management Council has adopted the ``high'' scenario for planning purposes and made the adjustments for the local conditions, and they now put 9 vertical feet of sea level rise as the expectation for Rhode Island's coast by 2100. Of course, as any coastal Senator knows, when you go straight up 9 feet, you can go a long way back, pushing the shoreline into what is now inland, flooding a lot of infrastructure.  We need to protect evacuation routes from flooding, we need to bolster hurricane barriers, and we need to replenish beaches and nourish wetlands. To protect infrastructure from storms, we need to raise ports and reinforce bridges that are exposed to corrosive saltwater from storms. We need to manage upstream reservoirs to control downstream flooding. We need to protect groundwater drinking water supplies from intruding saltwater. We need to retrofit lowland wastewater treatment plants that are in danger of flooding. Some of them are not just in flood zones, they are actually in velocity zones where wave action is expected against the structures. These improvements are essential to meeting our infrastructure needs over the coming decade.  Every coastal State--especially those in the Northeast and the western Gulf of Mexico, which are expected to see the most dramatic rises in sea level--should be nervous. That is why the Democratic infrastructure blueprint includes funding for resilient coastal communities, including support for the National Oceans and Coastal Security I have worked to establish this lifeline for coastal infrastructure since my early days in the Once we fund it, it can be a tremendous resource for coastal communities needing infrastructure improvement and smart coastal adaptation.  President Trump has said he wants a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. I am ready to roll up my sleeves and ``git 'er done.'' Democrats have put forward a blueprint for making the investments our Nation so badly needs. Congress can come together on a plan that can provide direct, long-term support and help communities address current needs, while also preparing for the changes we know are coming down the pipeline at us.

13928,topic-id,1773,"Mr.President, before he leaves the floor, let me thank my friend from Illinois for his very thoughtful and warm remarks about somebody who we all admired very much, Ed  I remember so many times talking to him about the rights of seniors, and a lot of us who thought we knew something about the subject didn't know half of what Ed did. This was a guy with a really razor-sharp mind, but he had an even bigger heart, and particularly a heart for people without clout and power. I don't think it was an accident that he gravitated to the senior Senator from Illinois, I might add as well.  So I thank my friend for his very gracious remarks about somebody we all admired very much.  Mr.President, I am here this afternoon because from the people who brought us TrumpCare, which was so favorable to the fortunate few and the special interests, now comes legislation that is going to make it harder for working people and working families to save for their own retirement. To kind of put that in context, whenever we have a debate about retirement, we always hear people say: You know, you just ought to realize that Social Security, this earned benefit--an earned benefit for Americans--you have to realize it is not going to cover everything. You have to save privately. You have to save for your retirement. And now, what we are seeing is the powerful special interests--the people with deep pockets and great political influence--are talking about restricting the chance for those typical working families to do the very thing that those people usually say is the solution. They say: No, we can't have government programs; you have to save privately for your retirement. And now come along those very powerful special interests, and they want to talk about restricting the ability of working families to save privately.  So we are now debating the first of two resolutions that would put a huge dark cloud over the new programs with individual retirement accounts, called auto-IRA programs, that States like mine and a handful of cities are seeking to build.  Right now, immediately, it is the locally based programs that are trying to promote private savings, giving the working-class family the chance to do it, and they are the ones who could be undermined. Of course, depending on what happens around here, the State programs could be next.  So at this time in American history, when we are facing a very large challenge with respect to savings, when a little over half of the workers approaching retirement age have nothing--zero--saved in retirement accounts such as individual retirement accounts or 401(k) plans, these two resolutions amount to a game plan that would take the savings crisis, which is already bad, and make it worse.  Around 55 million Americans don't have access to a retirement plan at work. More often than not, it is the employees of small- and medium-sized businesses who don't have that job benefit, and it is no fault of their own. In my view, this shouldn't even be a partisan question. There ought to be bipartisan interests in helping these workers find new opportunities to save. It ought to be easier than it is today.  I see my friend and colleague from the Finance Committee in the Chair, and as he knows, we have had countless committee hearings in the Finance We have been part of multiple floor debates when I have heard Members on both sides of the aisle talk about the importance of private savings. Yet here we are in the Senate, and yet we are looking at an effort on the part of the majority at this point that wants to ram through resolutions that would make it harder to save, not easier.  So juxtapose what is going on today and then think about all of the committee hearings in the Finance Committee, in the HELP Committee, where we hear people talk about private savings. We ought to make it easier; we ought to have smarter policies. Today the U.Senate is looking at making it harder for working families to save.  Here is a little bit of background about this and what it means to my home State of Oregon, and we are looking at winning the NCAA championship here in a few days, so there are a lot of things we are talking about in Oregon right now. But I wanted to especially come and talk about another area where we are leading right now; that is, trying fresh approaches to retirement savings.  Oregonians want as a State to help close the gap for the 55 million Americans without an employer-sponsored plan. After a lot of study and careful planning, my home State of Oregon is one of a handful of States that have passed what has come to be known as an auto-The actual name of the program is OregonSaves, and it is set to launch this summer.  What it means--and the highlight of it is this is a voluntary program--is we are creating a new set of opportunities for workers to actually save. What it means in my State is if you are a worker at one of these businesses, when you get a job, you will get a retirement account, and you will be able to start saving.  Now, I want to emphasize that it is not mandatory. Any worker who wants to opt out could do so, but it is designed to be simple and easy to use for everybody involved.  I wish to describe for a moment some of my conversations with Oregonians and workers who have been part of these auto They come up at townhall meetings in every county of my State--I have had a little over 800 now--and we have discussed savings. They come up often, and they say: I have been hearing about these new IRAs, and I am automatically enrolled in one.  Then they say: You know, if they hadn't automatically enrolled me in it, I probably wouldn't have done it because there is always an expense in our[[Page S2086]]household, there is always something we think we probably should do, and we would say to ourselves: We had better do that now, and we can come back and talk about saving later.  Those employees have come up and said: We probably wouldn't have done it without this automatic enrollment. But, Ron, I am so glad that we have it because I have seen that this is really beneficial, and it in effect has persuaded me that I have to take a very disciplined approach. I am glad this is automatic, and I especially like the fact that I have the last word on the subject. In other words, if I feel for one reason or another I can't do this automatic savings, there would be an opportunity for me to opt out.  It is automatic, and it provides this path for people to start saving. It is cost-effective. It is straightforward for employers. It eliminates a lot of redtape and administrative hassle. Most importantly, it gives the worker the last word--the right to opt out of this.  The Trump administration says it wants to cut redtape that burdens business. In my view, this legislation does the opposite. It makes it harder for small businesses to provide retirement savings programs for their workers.  One after the other, Oregon employers are raving about the opportunity the program represents for them, especially when it comes to recruiting and retaining top-notch employees and helping those workers build a nest egg. I just gave a little bit of empirical evidence from these community meetings I hold where workers say they particularly like what this does. It is almost like a little bit of a nudge to save and build a nest egg.  Judi Randall, the finance director of an affordable housing provider in Roseburg, OR, says it would make a big difference for a rural nonprofit organization like hers to have OregonSaves available to help employees secure their retirement.  Joy Andersen, another Oregon leader, is the administrator at the Asher Community Health Center in Fossil, I had my first community meeting in this small town of about 500. Joy has talked about how important it is to her to have an attractive retirement plan to recruit employees to come work in Fossil in eastern  Kevin Max runs Statehood Media in Bend, a small company with big aspirations. He notes that there is no better State in the country than Oregon when it comes to employee recruitment. He says that OregonSaves gives companies like his another leg up with an even better package of benefits.  I believe it defies logic that in light of all of these positive returns from employers and from workers, that the Congress would want to stamp out a program like OregonSaves which has so much potential, but the resolution going after State initiatives--and there are two--would pose that kind of threat.  My view is that these are not easy programs for States or cities to set up. There are legal issues that date back decades that have to be worked through. There is a lot of heavy lifting at the Labor Department to get the legal roadblocks out of the way. If these resolutions pass, it would wipe out months and months of work that has gone into making this kind of State- and local-based partnership possible.  This particular issue ought to be a no-brainer. Saving in the private economy is the right thing, as I have said, for a host of reasons. People scrimping and saving to set aside money for retirement is the key to a healthy retirement policy so everybody is in a position to have a dignified retirement rather than stretching every penny they have, relying just on Social Security, family members, and food banks to make ends meet. I believe our people want the opportunity to save, and they like the idea of this automatic IRA because it is fair to workers and fair to employers.  My view is that the Senate ought to stand up and recognize that by voting against these ill-advised resolutions, this is a chance to support the interests of working people who would like to save in the private economy, ahead of special interests. I hope the Senate will do the right thing for those hard-working people and their families and vote these resolutions down.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

We are actually going through regular order, allowing the committees of jurisdiction to do their work in public, and have the text for all to see and debate.  Mr.Speaker, ObamaCare is failing and will collapse on its own. Many more will lose their insurance, and the healthcare system will get drastically worse if we simply leave it in place. The worst thing we can do is nothing.  4.7 million Americans were kicked off their healthcare plans by the I was one of them. Under the ACA, there has been a 25 percent average increase in premiums for the midlevel plans in 2017 for millions of Americans trapped in the healthcare.gov exchanges. Nearly one-third of U.counties have only one insurer offering an exchange plan.  ObamaCare is unsustainable. Mr.Speaker, it is time for Congress to do its job and replace the failed We guarantee we will read this bill before we pass it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2094-2.txt,2115,IT IS CRUCIAL TO REPEAL AND REPLACE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,2017.0,16.0,February
