                             THE ROBESONIAN

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of The Robesonian 
newspaper in Lumberton, North Carolina, and their exceptional public 
service during the massive floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.
  Last October, Lumberton was inundated with rain. The water treatment 
plant was under 4 feet of water; Interstate 95 was shut down; hundreds 
of homes and businesses were destroyed. The devastation, which I 
witnessed firsthand, was unbelievable. The Robesonian's own offices 
were destroyed, and much of the staff suffered personal loss, slept in 
offices, went without showers; yet the newspaper continued to share 
vital information online and via social media.
  Mr. Speaker, during this emergency, The Robesonian's website and 
social media were the only way many residents of Robeson County could 
access updated information on shelters and water distribution.
  Thank you to the dedicated staff of The Robesonian for putting the 
community first and serving with distinction during the Hurricane 
Matthew floods.
