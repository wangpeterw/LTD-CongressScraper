  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Today's prayer will be offered by Sharad

College in Brevard, NC.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  We are grateful to stand at the beginning of a new day and a new 
session. Thank You for the roads we have traveled and for the strength, 
courage, and fortitude to continue on the roads yet traveled.
  Thank You also for the incredible individuals in this space, who have 
committed themselves to a life of service--women and men who have 
chosen to use their gifts and their passions to serve their respective 
constituencies and our Nation.
  Help us all on this day to choose courage over fear, benevolence over 
unkindness, and selflessness over selfishness. Remind us in all of our 
endeavors that Your energizing and enlivening presence is already with 
us. And as we continue to press forward through this session and this 
day, thank You for being the one who has already made the way. Amen.

                          ____________________
