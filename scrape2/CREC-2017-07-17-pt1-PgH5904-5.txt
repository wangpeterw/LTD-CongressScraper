                CELEBRATING VERA POWELL'S 90TH BIRTHDAY

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
90th birthday of Ms. Vera Powell, who lives in Pooler, Georgia.
  Ms. Powell was born on July 16, 1927, in Tattnall County, Georgia, 
about 60 miles due west of Savannah. After graduating from Tattnall 
County High School, Ms. Powell dedicated her life to her family and 
raising her three children: Bruce, Linda, and Crystal.
  In 1994, Ms. Powell moved from Tattnall County to Pooler, Georgia, 
and became a member of the First Baptist Church of Pooler. Her love of 
God and fellowship with others turned into a meaningful role with the 
church's weekly Sunday school class.
  Now she has been an active weekly participant, greatly contributing 
to the fellowship and scholarship with the class for the past 23 years, 
and is a staple of the church.
  The members of the congregation look forward to seeing Ms. Powell as 
she greets them at the church doors every Sunday morning.
  Ms. Powell's family and friends celebrated her 90th birthday with a 
reception on July 16, 2017. Please join me in wishing this remarkable 
woman a very happy birthday.
