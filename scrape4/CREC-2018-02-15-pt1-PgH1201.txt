               DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR JAPANESE INTERNMENT

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker, over 120,000 Japanese Americans were 
incarcerated on American soil during World War II.
  On the annual Day of Remembrance, we are reminded of the brave men, 
women, and children who lost everything. They lost their homes, their 
belongings, their businesses, really keeping only what they could carry 
with them.
  But their spirits were not broken. Countless stories of bravery, 
courage, and resilience defined an entire generation, including the 
Nisei-only ``Go For Broke'' 442nd Infantry Regiment, becoming the most 
highly decorated unit in Army history.
  The anniversary of this shameful blight on our history remains a 
powerful reminder of the fragility of civil rights and the threat that 
prejudice and divisiveness and bigotry continue to pose to our way of 
life today.
  We must follow in the footsteps of those Japanese Americans who 
volunteered to serve this country, even with their loved ones 
incarcerated on American soil, and find the light and love of the Aloha 
spirit to stand up and fight against intolerance, bigotry, and hatred.
