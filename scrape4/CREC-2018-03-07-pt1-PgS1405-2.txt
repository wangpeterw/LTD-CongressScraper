                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, help our 
lawmakers to honor Your Name. Demonstrate Your great power by filling 
them with Your Spirit and giving them a desire to cultivate spiritual 
discernment. Lord, sustain them through the power of Your prevailing 
providence until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like 
a mighty stream. As our Senators draw near to You, experiencing Your 
Divine guidance, may they be motivated to follow Your precepts as they 
face difficult challenges.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
