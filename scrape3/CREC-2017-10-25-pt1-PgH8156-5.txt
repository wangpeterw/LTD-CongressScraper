                       RECOGNIZING BRUCE HARBACH

  (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the head coach of 
the Lancaster Catholic High School football team, Bruce Harbach, who 
has recently announced his retirement.
  Coach Harbach has been coaching for a remarkable 41 years and has 
spent the last 16 years of that career leading the Crusaders. His 
accomplishments at Lancaster Catholic are too many to mention, but let 
me provide just a few highlights: two State championships, eight 
section championships, nine district playoff appearances, six district 
championship appearances, and a perfect 16-0 season in 2011.
  In fact, I was glad to host Coach Harbach and the team at the 
Pennsylvania State Capitol following their State championships in 2009, 
and then again in 2011. Our coaches for our youth, it is not only about 
the scores and about their winning, but they are responsible as a role 
model--their players look up to them--and the most successful coaches 
also practice what they preach. We want our coaches to instill 
integrity in our kids and to show them the value of teamwork, 
commitment, and perseverance.
  That is exactly what Coach Harbach has done for these many years. I 
know the Crusader community joins me in thanking Coach Harbach for his 
16 years leading their team from the sidelines.
