     bill passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate 
     and signed by the President to be codified into law; and 
     therefore implicitly allows Congress to repeal any bill that 
     has been passed by both chambers and signed into law by the 
     President.
       Additionally, the Constitution grants to Congress the 
     explicit power to regulate commerce in and among the states, 
     as enumerate in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, the Commerce 
     Clause.
