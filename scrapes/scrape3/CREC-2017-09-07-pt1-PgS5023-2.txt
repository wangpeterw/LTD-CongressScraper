                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, the Lord of the Harvest, we acknowledge that only by 
Your might can we live productive lives.
  Inspire our lawmakers in their daily work to labor for Your glory. 
Give them the desire to please You even with their motives so that 
their thoughts, words, and deeds will honor You. Keep them from 
avoiding irksome and unpleasant issues, as they arrange their 
priorities to accomplish Your purposes.
  Lord, guide them in the paths of justice and cooperation as 
understanding and forbearance prevail among them.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
