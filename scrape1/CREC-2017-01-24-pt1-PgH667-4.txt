                    44TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE

  (Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give voice to the millions 
of lives that have been lost in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade.
  In the 44 years since that disgraceful decision, an unconscionable 58 
million abortions have been performed. That represents 58 million 
children who will never grow up, never make their own decisions, and 
never influence the world around them, but whose lives are cut short.
  The House took a vital step today with the passage of H.R. 7, the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure 
Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill that permanently 
prohibits taxpayers from funding abortion through the Hyde amendment.
  Since its original passage, this amendment has saved over 2 million 
babies. Congress must make permanent these protections to honor the 
conscience rights of a strong majority of Americans who do not want 
their taxpayer dollars paying for abortions.
  This week, we gather to mourn the tragic loss of life and to seek 
God's forgiveness for the stain of abortion on our Nation's conscience.
  May God have mercy on our country.
