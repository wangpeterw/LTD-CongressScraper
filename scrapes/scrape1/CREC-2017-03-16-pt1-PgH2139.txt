            CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF LOUISE HOPKINS UNDERWOOD

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and 
legacy of Louise Hopkins Underwood, a west Texas icon who passed away 
Tuesday, March 7, at the age of 97.
  Mrs. Underwood was known as a charismatic woman with a sharp sense of 
humor. A woman loved by all, she was gracious, she was generous, and 
she was inspirational.
  Mrs. Underwood was the mother of six and a pioneer in her quest to 
promote a passion for the arts and a stronger sense of community on the 
south plains.
  Our region, which has a rich history better known for farming and 
ranching, is now also known for the arts, thanks to Mrs. Underwood.
  Ecclesiastes 7:1 says:

       A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of 
     death better than the day of birth.

  Thank you, Mrs. Underwood. Thank you for your fragrant life and for 
leaving a legacy of a brighter, more colorful west Texas.
  God bless the Underwood family.
