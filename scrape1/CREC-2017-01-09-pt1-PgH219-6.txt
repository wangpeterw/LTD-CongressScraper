               NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, today is National Law Enforcement 
Appreciation Day, and I think it is very appropriate in this body to 
stand up and show that appreciation, especially in these confused times 
where signals come out of this place that don't show appreciation but, 
instead, depict our law enforcement in very unflattering terms.
  To our friends in law enforcement, we want you to know that the vast 
majority of us believe in what you do and that we value you and what 
you do every day out there to keep us safe, to keep us secure in our 
homes and our communities. We also honor those--too many--whom we have 
lost tragically in the line of duty.
  I know their families pray every night that they will return home 
safely. Too often, just in 2016, many of these families' worst fears 
were realized, as 135 fathers, sons, mothers, and

daughters never returned home from the line of duty. In my home State 
of California, 11 officers lost, one even from my own district, Deputy 
Jack Hopkins of the Modoc County Sheriff's Department. We recognize 
him, and we recognize all the brave men and women around this country 
who sacrifice, who stand as a thin blue line between us and a lot of 
mayhem. We are truly grateful and want to take time this day to 
recognize what you do for us. God bless you all. Amen.
