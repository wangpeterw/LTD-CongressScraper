                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

    SENATE RESOLUTION 175--RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
  COMMISSIONED OFFICER CORPS OF THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC 
                             ADMINISTRATION

  Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself, Mr. Thune, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Peters, and Mr. 
Cochran) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to:

                              S. Res. 175

       Whereas, on May 22, 1917, the forerunner to the 
     commissioned officer corps of the National Oceanic and 
     Atmospheric Administration (referred to in this preamble as 
     the ``NOAA Corps'') was created as the commissioned corps of 
     the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in order to 
     provide officers to command coastal survey ships and field 
     survey parties locally and abroad;
       Whereas the heritage of the NOAA Corps is closely tied to 
     the oldest scientific and technical agency of the United 
     States, the Survey of the Coast, which was established by 
     President Thomas Jefferson and Congress in 1807;
       Whereas, on October 3, 1970, the National Oceanic and 
     Atmospheric Administration was established and the officers 
     of that agency became members of the NOAA Corps;
       Whereas, for the past 100 years, the central mission of the 
     NOAA Corps and its predecessor has been to collect data at 
     sea or in the air to enable decisions that have a great 
     impact on the United States;
       Whereas, since 1960, officers of the NOAA Corps and their 
     predecessors have flown into 292 tropical cyclones, risking 
     their lives to advance the science needed to save lives and 
     livelihoods along the coastal communities of the United 
     States;
       Whereas, whatever the mission, the United States turns to 
     the NOAA Corps for environmental leadership;
       Whereas the motto of ``Honor, Respect, Commitment'' is the 
     creed by which NOAA Corps officers live and serve; and
       Whereas, regardless of the cause, location, or magnitude of 
     a future hurricane, the United States can rely on the NOAA 
     Corps to fly into the storm to carry out the missions 
     entrusted to the NOAA Corps: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) expresses the appreciation of the people of the United 
     States to the commissioned officer corps of the National 
     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (referred to in this 
     resolving clause as the ``NOAA Corps''), and the officers who 
     have served in the NOAA Corps, for 100 years of dedicated 
     service;
       (2) honors the valor, commitment, and sacrifice that 
     officers of the NOAA Corps have displayed throughout the 
     history of the NOAA Corps; and
       (3) respectfully requests that the President issue a 
     proclamation that--
       (A) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the NOAA Corps and 
     the dedicated service of the officers who have served in the 
     NOAA Corps; and
       (B) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
     that anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
