  IN APPRECIATION OF TERRY MICHALSKE, DIRECTOR OF THE SAVANNAH RIVER 
                          NATIONAL LABORATORY

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate Dr. 
Terry Michalske, who is the Executive Vice President and Director of 
the Department of Energy's Savannah River National Laboratory, located 
at the Savannah River site in South Carolina's Second Congressional 
District.
  Today is Dr. Michalske's last day as director. I am grateful to thank 
him for his leadership of this critical national laboratory.
  The Savannah River National Laboratory conducts research and 
development, focusing on legacy waste cleanup, national security, and 
clean energy. Dr. Michalske has more than 30 years of experience in 
these fields. He holds seven patents, has authored 90 journal 
publications, and also collaborated on several books.
  Dr. Michalske also coordinates with the Department of Energy to 
support the Savannah River site as a leading national laboratory and 
regional producer of jobs.
  Also, congratulations to Dr. Vahid Majidi, who will succeed Dr. 
Michalske.
  As a former staff member at the site myself, I am grateful for the 
opportunity to represent the Savannah River site in Congress.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Secretary Rex Tillerson for his service, and 
best wishes for continued success for Secretary of State designate Mike 
Pompeo.
