                    THE INFAMOUS TRUMP TOWER MEETING

  (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, June 9, 2016, was the date of the infamous 
Trump Tower meeting with at least five Russians with Kremlin ties. That 
date is about the only constant in a tangled web of lies we have heard 
from Team Trump.
  When Donald Trump, Jr., was first asked about this meeting, he said 
it was just about adoption, not a campaign issue. But he changed his 
tune when the New York Times revealed emails showing it was all about 
the campaign; in fact, an offer to get damning information on Hillary 
Clinton as ``part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump. 
. . .''
  Now, Donald Trump, Jr.'s, response to this illegal offer says it all: 
``. . . if it is what you say, I love it. . . . ''
  We may never know how much collusion was set in motion at this 
meeting, but we do know two things:
  First, Team Trump has repeatedly misled us, concealing it from 
security clearance forms, issuing a false statement dictated by 
President Trump himself.
  Second, the Russians did go on to produce a massive cache of stolen 
emails and helped the Trump campaign in other ways.
  These are damning facts, Mr. Speaker, and there are many more to 
come. We need to find out what else they lied about and what else they 
are hiding.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Kustoff of Tennessee). Members are 
reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the 
President.
