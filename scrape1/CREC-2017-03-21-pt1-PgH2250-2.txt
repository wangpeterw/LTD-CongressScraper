                       THE THREAT OF NORTH KOREA

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was grateful 
to participate in a panel discussion at the dynamic Hudson Institute 
about the growing threat North Korea poses to the United States and our 
allies, with Hudson fellow research director Rebeccah Heinrichs and 
senior fellow Arthur Herman.
  We discussed the growing threat of North Korea's testing medium- and 
long-range missiles, the gruesome capabilities of conventional weapons, 
and their rapidly proceeding nuclear program.
  We further discussed the importance of missile defense, specifically 
the THAAD missile system and the boost phase interceptor system, and 
how they could deter the threats from North Korea.
  I also spoke on the bipartisan resolution that I introduced last 
week, a resolution condemning North Korea's development of their 
missile program, calling for the consideration of all available options 
to protect the people of South Korea.
  I look forward to working with Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, 
Ranking Member Eliot Engel, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and 
President Donald Trump to ensure that all options are on the table when 
responding to the growing threat posed by North Korea.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
