                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear Lord, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  You are the source of all life and unconditional love. The House of 
Representatives is a noble institution which embraces the highest 
aspirations of the Nation's people and embodies their lasting values.
  Help the Members of this House to look at themselves, their politics, 
priorities, and the Nation's interests with new vision in the light of 
Your Spirit. Help them to be wise and patient legislators, seeking not 
immediate political wins, but a productive future which will nourish 
the stability of our homeland and reap a harvest of peace in the world.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
