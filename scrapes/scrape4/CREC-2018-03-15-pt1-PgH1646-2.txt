  CONGRATULATING JOHNSTOWN'S ENVIRONMENTAL TANK AND CONTAINER COMPANY

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Johnstown's 
Environmental Tank and Container Company, a division of JWF Industries, 
for being named Manufacturer of the Year at the Sixth Annual 2018 Oil & 
Gas Awards.
  The Manufacturer of the Year Award recognizes the outstanding 
contributions that a manufacturer has made to the industry in the 
region, such as advances made in environmental stewardship, efficiency, 
innovation, community leadership, and health and safety, and I am proud 
of ETC's achievement.
  Manufacturing is a key to a nation's prosperity and drives the 
American economy. As America competes on a global scale, it is critical 
that this industry continues to grow, creating a wealth of job 
opportunities for all Americans. Over 500,000 people in Pennsylvania 
rely on the strength of the manufacturing sector.
  Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the United States had the highest 
business tax rates in the industrialized world. Now this law is 
removing this economic choke hold, putting American businesses at a 
more favorable corporate tax rate than their foreign competitors, and 
also allowing companies to write off the full cost of new equipment 
when it is purchased.
  America is gaining its competitive edge, and the manufacturing 
industry is at the forefront of this success story.
