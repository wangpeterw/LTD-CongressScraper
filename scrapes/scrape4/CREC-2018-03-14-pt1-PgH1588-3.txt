                  HONORING CONGRESSWOMAN MARCY KAPTUR

  (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our colleague 
from Ohio, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, who has become the longest 
serving woman in the United States House of Representatives. She is 
from Toledo, Ohio.
  I want to rise today to recognize being able to see someone of her 
caliber for so many years contribute so greatly. The World War II 
monument on The Mall here in Washington, D.C., was a long-term project 
that she started and she finished.
  Those of us who represent working class people in Ohio know Marcy, 
respect Marcy. She is tough, she is smart, and she has one of the 
biggest hearts in this Chamber.
  This is what I love about her: she is not afraid to say the word 
``union'' and to recognize the power of working people coming together 
to bring economic justice to our society.
  Mr. Speaker, we salute Ms. Kaptur's service and look forward to many, 
many more years ahead working on behalf and for those working class 
families in Ohio.
