                 HONORING RETIRING CAPTAIN PETER DUPREE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
Washington, D.C., firefighter for his more than three decades of 
exceptional service.
  Captain Peter Dupree has served more than 31 years with the District 
of Columbia Fire Department. He started his firefighting career in 1977 
as a volunteer with his hometown fire company in Avis, Pennsylvania, in 
Clinton County. Pete rose through the ranks and eventually became fire 
chief.
  In 1986, Pete moved to Maryland and joined the Berwyn Heights 
Volunteer Fire Department, Station 14, in Prince George's County. That 
same month, Pete was appointed as a probationer for the District of 
Columbia Fire Department. After passing required courses, he was 
assigned to Truck 12 in Northwest D.C.
  In December of 2000, Pete achieved the rank of sergeant. Three years 
later, he would be promoted to lieutenant at Engine 18 on Capitol Hill. 
Then, in 2008, Pete became a captain in Northwest D.C. at Truck 9. He 
retired from the station in January after more than 31 years of 
service.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to thank Captain Peter Dupree, a native 
son of Clinton County, and wish him well in his retirement.
