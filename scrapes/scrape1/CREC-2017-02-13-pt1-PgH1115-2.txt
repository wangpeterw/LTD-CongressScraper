                           DRAINING THE SWAMP

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, President Trump said he was going to drain 
the swamp.
  Really?
  His actions speak louder than words. Check the facts. Wall Street's 
gold diggers are in charge of the swamp already.
  The President's senior strategist, Steve Bannon, spent half a decade 
working at Goldman Sachs. Trump's National Economic Council Director, 
Gary Cohn, spent 25 years more there. He rose to be Goldman Sachs' 
president. Trump's Senior Counsel for Economic Initiatives, Dina 
Powell, was a partner since 2010 at Goldman Sachs.
  Steve Mnuchin, up for a vote tonight for Treasury Secretary, spent 17 
years at Goldman. Dubbed the ``Foreclosure King,'' Mnuchin was the 
fast-buck artist who maneuvered OneWest out of IndyMac's collapse with 
shady tactics that kicked hundreds of thousands of families out of 
their homes in Ohio and beyond. Mnuchin is the ultimate swamp dweller. 
His father worked at Goldman, his brother still works there, and they 
all return for alumni engagements.
  Come now. While millions of Americans lost their homes, with millions 
more underwater today, Goldman increased its profits. It is obvious, 
Wall Street's trolls have squiggled their way through the White House 
transom even before the First Lady has remodeled the living quarters.
  When Wall Street rigs our economy again, does anyone seriously expect 
President Trump to drain the swamp?
  He is fast in it with them.
