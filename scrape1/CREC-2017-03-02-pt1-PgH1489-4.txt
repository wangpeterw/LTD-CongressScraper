 TRIBUTE TO ROBERT AND MEGAN TRINKLEY AND MISSION FIRST HOUSING GROUP 
                       VOLUNTEERS AND SUPPORTERS

  (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert and 
Megan Trinkley and the many supporters and volunteers of the Mission 
First Housing Group, which places homeless veterans in need in safe, 
affordable, and sustainable housing.
  Last Friday evening, I had the great pleasure to be present at the 
third annual Homes for Heroes fundraising event in Delaware County, 
Pennsylvania. I joined the Trinkleys and iconic radio personality and 
Vietnam veteran John DeBella and hundreds of community supporters who 
were all committed to quality housing for our vets.
  The Homes for Heroes event was founded in 2015 as a way for the 
Trinkleys to honor the memory of Megan's late father, a United States 
Air Force veteran. Homes for Heroes raised more than $40,000 last year 
and surpassed that number this year.
  Mr. Speaker, on any given night, some 40,000 of our veterans are 
homeless, and that is too many. But thanks to the work of Robert and 
Megan Trinkley and all of those who have supported Homes for Heroes, 
some three dozen veterans right now in our region sleep in safe, 
affordable housing.
  I am grateful for their efforts, and I applaud them for their service 
to the homeless veterans to assure that no hero he is left behind.
