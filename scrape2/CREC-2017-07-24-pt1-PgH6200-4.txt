                   NO APPROPRIATIONS FOR BORDER WALL

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the House 
appropriations package that will provide $1.6 billion for the 
construction of President Trump's border wall.
  As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have heard from 
many military leaders who all agree, a wall won't make our borders more 
secure or our Nation safer.
  There are more effective ways and technology that would be a better 
investment of our limited resources. Moreover, the President has failed 
to provide a cost for this wall, and it would be irresponsible for 
Congress to write him a blank check, especially after he promised over 
and over that the American taxpayers would not foot the bill.
  This wall only serves as a symbol of xenophobia and hate, while doing 
nothing to address our broken immigration system. Immigrants strengthen 
the fabric of our Nation, they serve in our military, they teach in our 
schools, and some, like myself, are fortunate enough to serve as 
Members of Congress.
