               FINDING LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR DREAMERS

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge Congress to move 
quickly on finding a legislative solution for DREAMers before January 
19.
  With every passing day that Congress delays action from now until 
March 5, approximately 122 people will lose their DACA protection. We 
cannot forget about the consequences that DACA termination will have on 
women and their families.
  Mr. Speaker, 53 percent of active DACA recipients are women. As the 
vice chair of the Democratic Women's Working Group, I am here to say 
that we need to represent all women and their families. All women just 
want a better future for themselves and their children. Without safety 
from deportation, families will be torn apart. Many DREAMers now have 
children of their own.
  It is time for Congress to act. I am standing here today speaking for 
women in this country.
