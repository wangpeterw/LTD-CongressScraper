                      PROTECTING PERSONAL PRIVACY

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, for years now the NSA has been collecting 
phone and online communications from everyday Americans from all across 
the country, defying the rights and liberties granted to us under the 
Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.
  The 2008 FISA amendments, specifically section 702, has led to 
massive government-led exploitation of personal privacy through the 
collection of American citizens' emails. We need serious reforms that 
balance the protections of our civil liberties and rights through our 
Constitution and also keep the American people safe.
  The NSA recently announced that they would stop collecting our emails 
and electronic communications under section 702, but what is to say it 
wouldn't start up again?
  That is why I am introducing legislation today to keep our country 
from backtracking on this progress. My bill will permanently codify 
this policy change and ban this privacy-evading collection from taking 
place again.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and 
defending our civil liberties.
