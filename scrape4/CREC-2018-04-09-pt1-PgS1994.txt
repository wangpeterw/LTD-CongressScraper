                      WELCOMING SENATOR HYDE-SMITH

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, we 
just welcomed a new colleague to this Chamber today. Senator Cindy 
Hyde-Smith was sworn in. She became the 51st Senator and the first 
woman to represent Mississippi here in the Senate. Senator Hyde-Smith 
brings experience as a State legislator and as the Mississippi 
commissioner of agriculture and commerce.
  I know I speak for all Senators on both sides of the aisle in 
welcoming our new colleague. We look forward to working together and 
continuing this record of accomplishment for the American people.
