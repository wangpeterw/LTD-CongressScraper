   HONORING MISSOURI TASK FORCE 1 FOR THEIR COURAGE AND SELFLESSNESS

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave members 
of Missouri's Task Force 1, who have risked their lives to help others 
in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.
  Missouri's Task Force 1 is one of 28 urban search and rescue teams in 
the country. Its 210 members are trained to provide emergency response 
and disaster relief services at a moment's notice.
  Last week, as the rains came down and the waters came up in Houston, 
47 members of the task force deployed to Texas with a mission: to turn 
potential stories of tragedy and despair into stories of salvation and 
hope, and they succeeded.
  In just one day during Hurricane Harvey, the team made more than 300 
water rescues and evacuations. Deployed to Houston for 14 days, these 
skilled crewmembers risked their lives to save the lives of others in 
Houston. Now they are monitoring a possible new deployment to assist 
after Hurricane Irma.
  We should all keep in mind the contributions and rescue efforts of 
Task Force 1. Their courage and selflessness demonstrated the best of 
humanity in the worst of times.
  I want to thank them for putting their lives on the line to help 
others in their time of need. You are all worthy of our respect, 
appreciation, and honor.
