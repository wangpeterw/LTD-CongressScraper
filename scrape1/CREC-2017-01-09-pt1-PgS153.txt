                        REMEMBERING STANLEY RUSS

  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to former 
Arkansas State Senator Stanley Russ of Conway, AR.
  Stanley Russ was born in Conway in 1930. He graduated from Conway 
High School in 1948 and went on to attend Arkansas Tech University and 
Arkansas State Teachers College, now the University of Central 
Arkansas, before earning a bachelor of science in education from the 
University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.
  Russ also served his country in multiple ways, including in the U.S. 
Army from 1952 to 1954, where he completed officer candidate school. 
Later, he served as a company commander in the Arkansas National Guard. 
Russ was inducted into the U.S. Field Artillery OCS Hall of Fame at 
Fort Sill in 1995.
  Senator Russ served in the Arkansas Senate from 1975 to 2000. He was 
the president pro tempore from 1995 to 1997 and served as the majority 
leader in 1997. During his time in public office, he was known as an 
advocate for public, private, and higher education.
  Russ was named one of the Ten Outstanding State Legislators in the 
United States by the Assembly of State Government Employees in 1981. 
Four years later, he was honored for Distinguished Service by the 
Municipal League of Arkansas. He was elected into the Arkansas Tech 
University Hall of Distinction in 1994 and the Arkansas Agriculture 
Hall of Fame in 2000.
  Stanley Russ was a beloved public servant who devoted his life to 
Arkansas. He was a leader who worked with colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle and didn't care who got the credit as long as the goal was 
accomplished. Stanley showed kindness and consideration to everyone who 
approached him. I sincerely appreciate his devotion to our State and 
its citizens.
  He will be greatly missed by all. My thoughts and prayers go out to 
his family during this difficult time.
