   CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MALCOM RANDALL VA MEDICAL 
                                 CENTER

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary of 
the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida.
  Named after its first director, who ran the hospital for 30 years, 
the Malcom Randall VA Center first opened its doors to our Nation's 
veterans on October 22, 1967. Since then, it has grown from its 
original staff of 500 to be the centerpiece of our Nation's largest 
veterans health delivery system.
  Today, the Malcom Randall VA Center serves over 140,000 veterans a 
year, consists of 14 hospitals and clinics, and acts as a teaching 
hospital in conjunction with the University of Florida medical school 
and other affiliates.
  The services Malcom Randall VA provides to our veterans cannot be 
overstated, and I am proud to know that this institution is in my 
hometown.
  Once again, congratulations to them for reaching this milestone.

                          ____________________
