                    PAYING TRIBUTE TO RICHARD THELEN

  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
an incredible constituent in my district, Richard Thelen.
  Seventy-two years ago, Mr. Thelen was aboard the USS Indianapolis 
with nearly 1,200 others when it was hit by two Japanese torpedoes and 
sank within a matter of minutes. He and 318 men of the crew survived 5 
days in the ocean surrounded by sharks without any food or drinking 
water. He defied truly remarkable odds.
  After this ordeal, Mr. Thelen went on to finish high school and was 
honorably discharged from the Navy. He was a truck driver for more than 
40 years and raised six children. Today, he is 89 years young, and it 
is a privilege to have him as a part of the Eighth District community.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform this body that I am prepared to 
introduce legislation to honor Mr. Thelen of Lansing, Michigan, and the 
rest of his shipmates, with the Congressional Gold Medal award.
  As we remember the survivors of this terrible tragedy, those we lost, 
and the recent finding of the ship itself, we thank you, Mr. Thelen, 
for your valiant service to our country.
