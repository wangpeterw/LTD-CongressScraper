                 DECORUM IS MISSING IN THE WHITE HOUSE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in the House we have a procedure that 
if words are untoward and not becoming of our stature as Members of the 
United States Congress, by any Member those words can be asked to be 
taken down.

[[Page H766]]

  It is unfortunate that in a tweet this morning the Commander in Chief 
said, of a Member of Congress who is a Federal official, he ``must be 
stopped,'' words to that effect.
  I left my hometown early this morning and had hoped there would have 
been some decent response from the Chief of Staff or other staff 
members of the White House to be able to say that that is an 
inappropriate attack on any Member of Congress or Federal official. I 
have yet to hear a clarification or apology that indicates that 
providing provocative words to take a Member down, or he must be taken 
down, is an inappropriate action or words for any Federal official.
  I hope that we can establish decorum not only in this body, but I 
hope we can establish decorum in the White House. It is sorely missing.
