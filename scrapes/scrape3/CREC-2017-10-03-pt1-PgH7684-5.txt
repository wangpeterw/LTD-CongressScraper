                      WORKING TO PROTECT DREAMERS

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, today, instead of working to 
protect DREAMers, enacting commonsense gun safety legislation, or 
reforming our tax system to benefit hardworking Americans and not just 
the wealthy, I have to stand here and speak out against H.R. 36, 
another radical assault against women's health and reproductive rights, 
a bill that would deny care to women in the most desperate of 
circumstances, a bill designed to restrict a woman's access to a full 
range of healthcare services, and a blatant attempt to chip away at a 
woman's right to choose.
  Congressional Republicans failed in their numerous attempts to strip 
healthcare away from everyone, so they will settle for just taking 
health decisions away from women.
  We settled this issue 40 years ago. Women have the constitutionally 
protected right to manage their own bodies. I will continue to defend 
the woman's right to choose and vigorously oppose any and all attacks 
against that.
