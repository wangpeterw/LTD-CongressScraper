              PUERTO RICO IS FACING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico is facing a humanitarian 
crisis. Puerto Rico is in desperate need for us to assist them. 
Hurricane Maria, soon after Hurricane Irma, has left a trail of 
destruction for Puerto Rico's residents. Currently, 3.5 million 
American citizens in Puerto Rico are without power, 20,000 people are 
on a waiting list to leave the island, and about $85 billion is needed 
in recovery funds.
  The island and its towns have been completely cut off by water 
flooding, broken bridges, lack of electricity, and no cell phone 
service. As a result, there are displaced senior citizens and children 
who cannot get basic goods and medical supplies.
  The people of Puerto Rico need supplemental funding not next week, 
but today. The Jones Act must be waived. Price gouging by airlines 
should not be allowed. Clean water needs to be shipped to the island, 
and hospitals need to be set up.
  It is our responsibility as Members of Congress and U.S. citizens to 
provide relief to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the small 
Caribbean countries in that area. Please, let's save Puerto Rico.
