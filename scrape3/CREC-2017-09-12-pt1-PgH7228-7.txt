                         BRING UP THE DREAM ACT

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Congress--and, actually, Congress today--
should act to pass the Dream Act. House Democrats are working to pass a 
permanent solution to protect 800,000 DREAMers, children who were 
brought here to the United States by their parents through no fault of 
their own, many of them as very young children. America is the only 
country they know. They have registered with the government. They pay 
their taxes. They make great contributions to our society.
  We have to ask ourselves: Do we want to deport these youngsters from 
the only country they have ever known? Is that the morally right 
question?
  We can argue the economics, and I can argue that it is an economic 
mistake to lose these individuals, but it is essentially a moral 
question. If a Member of Congress believes that we should deport 
800,000 productive people who only know this country, who were brought 
here as children, then come to the floor of the House and put that on 
the record. Vote ``yes'' or ``no,'' but bring up the Dream Act.
  This is an important question, and it is the work of Congress, and we 
should do it now.
