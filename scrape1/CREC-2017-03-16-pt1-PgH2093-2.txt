                      WE MUST IMPROVE FOOD ACCESS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, a healthy diet for many 
Americans may have nothing to do with commitment, but, rather, 
accessibility.
  Limited access to supermarkets and grocery stores with fresh 
nutritional food can be a challenge in both rural and urban 
communities. These are often called food deserts.
  This is a particular concern for the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program, or SNAP, which intends to provide nutrition to 
millions of Americans.
  According to the USDA, to qualify as a low-access community, at least 
500 people and/or at least 33 percent of the population must reside 
more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store. For rural 
areas, the distance is more than 10 miles.
  It is difficult to eat healthy when the easiest store to get to 
primarily provides packaged and processed food. SNAP recipients may 
find a local market convenient, but it often offers high-calorie foods 
with minimal nutritional value. These foods can often be a staple for 
families with limited resources.
  It is my hope that we can increase access to fresh food for 
communities throughout the country. Our families deserve no less.
  I look forward to working with the Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee 
to continue to look at the SNAP program so that it serves those it is 
intended to serve.
