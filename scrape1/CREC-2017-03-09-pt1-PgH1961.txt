                 BOB LEVINSON'S FAMILY DESERVES ANSWERS

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, today, March 9, marks 10 years since my 
constituent Bob Levinson disappeared in Iran. I had hoped that I would 
not have to come to the floor today to mark this day or to introduce 
another resolution on Bob. I had hoped that Bob would be home in south 
Florida with his wife, his seven children--one of whom is with us 
today--and his six grandchildren. Bob should be home in time to see his 
two new grandchildren born later this year.
  Ten years is too long. This family deserves answers. Iran must stop 
playing games, promising to assist finding Bob, agreeing last year to 
open a new dedicated channel for Bob's case, only time and time again 
refusing to follow through. Iran must provide meaningful information 
that will bring Bob home. This new administration must press Iran at 
every opportunity. I stand ready to work with them and with anyone who 
is committed to bringing Bob back home to his family where he belongs.
