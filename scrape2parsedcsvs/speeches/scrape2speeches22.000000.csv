The bill is also going to gut environmental protections and threaten the critical Bay-Delta ecosystem.

It is going to devastate the fishing industry.  We also have to think about drinking water for northern  Folsom Dam is in my district and Folsom Lake is in my district. It provides not only flood protection, but Folsom Lake provides surface drinking water for a lot of my constituents. We tried to put a simple amendment in here that would actually protect the quality of that drinking water. Unfortunately, H.23 would mandate pumping levels that could negatively impact the Folsom Reservoir water supply. That is going to place many of my constituents at risk.  This isn't a good bill. Let's kill this bill. Let's step back. Let Californians decide the best way to handle California water. That is what we ought to do.  Again, this bill is dramatic overreach. It is the Federal Government stepping into something that the State should actually decide. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this bill.

8071,topic-id,822,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.  My request today is simple: to provide our firefighters with the water they need to effectively fight wildfires. As we speak, two large wildfires are burning in my district on the central coast of So far, over 40,000 acres of land have burned between the Alamo fire and the Whittier fire.  With more than a dozen homes and structures of central coast residents destroyed, we cannot overstate the important and effective work of hundreds of local, State, and Federal firefighters to contain these blazes and prevent more damages.  I spoke with incident commanders and toured both burn sites in Santa Barbara County, witnessing firsthand the incredible damage wreaked by these fires to our region.  I was grateful for the opportunity to address our firefighters and first responders and to thank these brave men and women for willing to risk their own safety to protect infrastructure and save lives.  In one harrowing instance, a firefighter cleared a path, driving a bulldozer through flaming brush to rescue dozens of Boy Scouts trapped at a campground at Lake  Today, we have a duty as appropriators to provide these men and women, working tirelessly in difficult conditions, with the resources they need to effectively combat these frequent and devastating wildfires across our country, and especially in my home  Ignoring our wildfire response when dealing with water allocation is irresponsible and will put American lives in danger.  In addition to adopting this simple amendment to ensure our firefighters' access to water, I urge my colleagues to work to end the disruptive practice of fire borrowing.                              {time}  1900  We cannot continue to rob funds designated for wildfire prevention to pay for fighting fires and simultaneously expect agencies to carry out effective land management practices to reduce the impact of catastrophic wildfires in the future.  Our Federal land management agencies are overwhelmed by the dramatic increase in fires on public lands in recent years, and we cannot in good conscience continue to ignore their urgent need for both prevention and firefighting funding.  I am deeply concerned that this underlying bill today does nothing to address the issues of limited water resources for our agencies charged with fighting wildfires.  I call upon my colleagues to adopt this common-sense amendment and show our firefighters that Congress not only appreciates their efforts, but acts to support them as well.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.[[Page H5532]]    Mr.Mr.Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, my friends' concerns are well placed; his amendment is completely misplaced.  The fact is that, for 45 years, our environmental laws have made the management of our forests virtually impossible. After 45 years of experience with these laws, imposed with the explicit promise they would improve our forest environment, I think we are entitled to ask: How is our forest environment doing? And the answer is damning; our forests are dying.  Timber harvests of surplus timber have fallen 80 percent in those years. The result is severe overcrowding in our forests. An acre normally supports between 20 to 100 trees, depending upon the topography; but because of these laws, average density in the Sierra has now ballooned to 266 trees per acre.  In this crowded condition, these trees fight for their lives against other trees trying to occupy the same ground. And in this crowded and stressed condition, they fall victim to disease, pestilence, drought, and, ultimately, catastrophic wildfire.  The answer is not this amendment that seeks to derail this needed water storage; it is to restore scientific management to our forests to restore them to a healthy condition.  When I visited the command center of the Rim Fire several years ago that threatened Yosemite Valley, I asked the firefighters: What answer can I take, in your name, back to Congress? And the answer was: Treatment matters. We need proper forest management.  The good news for my friend from Santa Barbara is he will soon have the opportunity to vote on just such a bill, the Resilient Federal Forest Act, by Mr.Westerman of It treats this problem comprehensively. It passed the House Natural Resources We hope to bring it soon to the floor of the It will address the problems that plague our forests by restoring proper scientific management to our public lands.

8150,topic-id,140,"Mr.Speaker, today I urge President Trump again to make good on his promise of partnering with Congress to invest $1 trillion in America's infrastructure.  This week marks National Infrastructure Week; and yet, disappointingly, little action has been taken by this President and the majority in Congress to provide substantive funds for our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. Easing congestion on our highways is just one investment that will have a significant return, getting central coast residents to their jobs and back home to their families faster.  This is also an issue of safety for our constituents. California currently has over 1,300 structurally deficient bridges, 678 high-hazard dams, and 50 percent of its nearly 200,000 miles of public roads are in poor condition.  I urge my colleagues to work together in a bipartisan way to address the infrastructure crisis in our country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4237.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,17.0,June
8115,topic-id,463,"Well, first, to Senator There is a reason Members want to serve on the Senate Foreign Relations We had a long list of Members who wanted to join our committee in this Quite frankly, I think the reason they want to join is not only the challenges we have globally but the fact that this is a committee that works bipartisanly and respects the views of every single Member, both Democratic and Republican, on the Senate Foreign Relations  The bill we have before us reflects that--in the best tradition of the U.Senate and the Senate Foreign Relations That is due, in large part, because of the talent, leadership, and commitment of our chairman. I thank Senator Corker for allowing us to reach this very important moment in the U.Senate, to be able to vote on a bill that is consequential for America's national security.  I believe this is the first major bill we have had on the floor of the U.Senate, the first bill we have had amendments to, and I concur in the Senator's observations that our leaders allowed us to let the process work in the best traditions of the U. It is difficult for many of us to explain how the Senate operates at times. It really is difficult, but it is a body which respects the rights of each Member, and they have certain abilities to slow things down or bring us to a stop, and the process doesn't work the way it is supposed to work, but this bill has been handled very quickly on a major subject because we respected the rights of every single Member of the U.It doesn't mean we reach total agreement. We didn't, but we have a bill that accomplishes three very important things:  First, it stands up to the aggression of Russia and Yes, we have been talking about this--and I am glad Senator McCain is on the floor. Senator McCain has been one of the most ardent crusaders to point out the risk factors of Russia to our national security and that of our allies.  I started with Senator McCain in We sat down, and he informed me why we had to do certain things and make it very clear and not have any ambiguity because Russia would run right through that ambiguity. Thanks to that initial leadership, we have those provisions in the underlying bill. There will be no ambiguity as to what Congress is saying in regard to Russia's behavior.  I also acknowledge we have a review process in here. Senator Graham brought that to our attention very early in the process in January so Congress can insert itself.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.  The PRESIDING Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.

8116,topic-id,205,"That review process will give Congress the right role to review executive actions so we are stronger, working together. It also gives the President a stronger hand in negotiating with Mr.Putin and Russia because Congress has said: You must accomplish certain objectives, such as getting Russia's aggression to end in Ukraine or get Russia to stop supporting war crimes in Syria, to stop interfering with our democratic election systems. That is what we say, and we are very clear about that.  Then we take the third step, which I think is very important; that is, provide the wherewithal of U.leadership, working with our European allies, to protect our democratic institutions.  All of that is included in the bill that we are going to have a chance to vote on in a few minutes, and I want to thank all who were involved. I am going to include staff who worked so hard on this.  They were here 24/7 putting this bill together--Damian Murphy, in my office; Margaret Taylor; and Jessica Lewis, Dana Stroul, Lowell Schwartz, Sean Bartlett, Chris Barr, John Ryan, Leslie Bull, Danny Ricchetti, as well as Todd Womack, Rob Strayer, David Kinzler, and Ben  They were extraordinary in helping us reach this day.

(5) On December 29, 2016, President Obama issued an annex      to Executive Order 13694, which authorized sanctions on the      following entities and individuals:       (A) The Main Intelligence Directorate (also known as      Glavnoe Razvedyvatel'noe Upravlenie or the GRU) in Moscow,      Russian       (B) The Federal Security Service (also known as Federalnaya      Sluzhba Bezopasnosti or the FSB) in Moscow, Russian            (C) The Special Technology Center (also known as STLC,      Special Technology Center Petersburg) in Petersburg,      Russian       (D) Zorsecurity (also known as Esage Lab) in Moscow,      Russian       (E) The autonomous noncommercial organization known as the      Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing      Systems (also known as ANO PO KSI) in Moscow, Russian            (F) Igor Valentinovich       (G) Sergey Aleksandrovich       (H) Igor Olegovich Kostyukov.[[Page S3517]]       (I) Vladimir Stepanovich       (6) On January 6, 2017, an assessment of the United States      intelligence community entitled, ``Assessing Russian      Activities and Intentions in Recent U.Elections'' stated,      ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence      campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential      election.'' The assessment warns that ``Moscow will apply      lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the      U.Presidential election to future influence efforts      worldwide, including against U.allies and their election      processes''.     212.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Government of the Russian Federation has sought to      exert influence throughout Europe and Eurasia, including in      the former states of the Soviet Union, by providing resources      to political parties, think tanks, and civil society groups      that sow distrust in democratic institutions and actors,      promote xenophobic and illiberal views, and otherwise      undermine European unity.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF                    ARTICLE 5 OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:       (1) The principle of collective defense of the North      Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is immortalized in      Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in which members      pledge that ``an armed attack against one or more of them in      Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against      them all''.       (2) For almost 7 decades, the principle of collective      defense has effectively served as a strategic deterrent for      the member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization      and provided stability throughout the world, strengthening      the security of the United States and all 28 other member      nations.       (3) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in      New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, the Alliance agreed      to invoke Article 5 for the first time, affirming its      commitment to collective defense.       (4) Countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty      Organization have made historic contributions and sacrifices      while combating terrorism in Afghanistan through the      International Security Assistance Force and the Resolute      Support       (5) The recent attacks in the United Kingdom underscore the      importance of an international alliance to combat hostile      nation states and terrorist groups.       (6) At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, the member countries      of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization decided that all      countries that are members of NATO would spend an amount      equal to 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense      by 2024.[[Page S3528]]       (7) Collective defense unites the 29 members of the North      Atlantic Treaty Organization, each committing to protecting      and supporting one another from external adversaries, which      bolsters the North Atlantic       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--       (1) to express the vital importance of Article 5 of the      North Atlantic Treaty, the charter of the North Atlantic      Treaty Organization, as it continues to serve as a critical      deterrent to potential hostile nations and terrorist      organizations;       (2) to remember the first and only invocation of Article 5      by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in support of the      United States after the terrorist attacks of September 11,      2001;       (3) to affirm that the United States remains fully      committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and will      honor its obligations enshrined in Article 5; and       (4) to condemn any threat to the sovereignty, territorial      integrity, freedom, or democracy of any country that is a      member of the North Atlantic Treaty  The PRESIDING The majority leader.

7969,topic-id,185,"Mr.Speaker, our Nation is in the middle of a public health crisis. Drug overdoses are now killing more Americans each year than car accidents. And 336 Rhode Islanders died last year as a result of a drug overdose. That is up from 290 in 2015 and 238 deaths in 2014.  Nationwide, overdose deaths involving prescription and illicit opioids have quadrupled since 1999. This is a crisis that threatens Americans of all different backgrounds--young and old, Black and White, urban and rural. It is a crisis, plain and simple.  All of us who serve the government have a responsibility to stop it. That is why I was so alarmed earlier this month when I learned that President Trump is considering slashing funding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy by 95 percent. Slashing funding for the lead Federal agency in this fight would have a devastating impact on families in Rhode Island and all across our country.  Let's work together. Let's work across the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, to defeat this short-sighted proposal and, instead, advance real, comprehensive solutions to this public health epidemic.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4235-2.txt,2055,TRUMPCARE DROPS MILLIONS FROM COVERAGE,2017.0,17.0,June

I had the honor of going on a naval sub about 10 days ago, the Providence, and I saw the camaraderie on that ship. There were no Caucasian sailors or African-American sailors or Asian-American or Latin-American; there weren't gay or straight sailors. They were United States sailors, United States Navy personnel. And they come together in a camaraderie to serve our country and to serve each other as shipmates in a way that is gratifying to witness and is special for our  Now, I want to mention who these sailors were, because they need to be memorialized here.

He had no children of his own, but the sailors were his kids. He rescued up to 20 sailors to see to it after the crash that they survived and then went to try to rescue six others, and it is at that point that Gary Rehm lost his life. He lost his life serving his shipmates, as he called them, his kids, his fellow sailors.  They were shipmates and sailors and United States naval personnel. They weren't Filipinos or Vietnamese or any other description. Gary Rehm, Jr., was a hero trying to save others. The other six were heroes, too, serving our country, and they lost their lives.  It was a great experience to be on the Providence, and it is a great honor to represent Millington Naval Air Base, which serves our country for personnel and recruitment purposes.

8155,topic-id,3103,"Madam President, I know we are all glad to be back in Washington, DC, at work after a few days back home, and I know many of us are eager to continue our work to rescue the American people from the failures of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as  The failures of ObamaCare are well documented, and while they don't necessarily apply to everyone, particular individuals and small businesses in the so-called individual market have seen a meltdown of the insurance exchanges. The Presiding Officer in her home State of Iowa, I know, has had insurance companies pulling out to the point where people can't even find an insurance carrier who will sell a policy that qualifies under the Affordable Care That is because the Affordable Care Act was, unfortunately, a partisan exercise and a Big Government experiment that has failed.  All you have to do is look at the promises that were made at the time that ObamaCare was being sold back in 2009 and 2010. The President himself said that if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Well, that proved to be not true. He said that if you liked your policy, you can keep your policy. Well, that proved not to be true as well because people saw their policies canceled because they couldn't qualify under the new requirements of the Affordable Care  Perhaps the thing that stung the most was the fact that the President said back in 2009 and 2010 that an average family of four would see a reduction in their health insurance premiums by an average of $2,500. Well, what we have seen since 2013 is a 105-percent increase in insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act, and so instead of seeing a cut in their out-of-pocket costs of $2,500, what people have experienced--families of four--is an insurance premium increase of $3,000. Now, some people may be able to absorb that cost, but most people I know cannot. What it has meant is, they have had to reprioritize their spending so they have less to spend on other things in their life.  We do know, based on the promises made at the time the Affordable Care Act was being sold to the American people, that it has been a failed experiment. So the question is, What are we going to do about it? What are we going to tell the folks in Iowa who can't find an insurance policy or an insurance company who is willing to sell them an insurance policy on the individual market? What are we going to tell people in Texas who have seen their premiums go up by 105 percent since 2013 and have been priced out of the market or who found that the only policy they can afford is one with deductibles that are so high that basically they are denied the benefit of their insurance at all? What are we going to do about it?  A number of my colleagues have noted that even if Hillary Clinton were elected President of the United States, we would still have to be revisiting the failures of the Affordable Care Act because the failures are all too obvious and public and can't be denied, but despite that, and acknowledging many of ObamaCare's failings, many of our friends across the aisle--in fact, all of them so far in the Senate--have made clear they want nothing to do with providing any help or any aid to the people who are being hurt by the failures of They don't want to lift a finger to help the people who can't find insurance, who can't afford it, and the policies they are forced to buy limit them in a way that they simply have decided to opt out.  So instead of working together with us--you would think they would do[[Page S3877]]that. It would just be a logical thing to do because their constituents are the ones who are being hurt, in many instances. Instead, they have fought us tooth and toenail to preserve the broken status quo in healthcare that has failed so many people across the country, and they have made dubious claims about our efforts to address the problem to the best of our ability.  It reminds me of the old saying: Don't let the facts get in the way of a good story. Our friends across the aisle have simply washed their hands of any responsibility, even though they are the ones who passed the Affordable Care Act and created this failed experiment and put so many people in distress. Now they are in the process of attacking those of us who are trying to help people who are hurting, rather than lending a helping hand and working together with us in a bipartisan way.  Let me talk just a minute about Medicaid because this is one of the big attacks that is being made by our Democratic colleagues on our efforts to try to salvage healthcare for people who are hurt by the failures of the Affordable Care Much of the conversation has revolved around Medicaid and rightly so.  In my home State, 4.7 million folks currently rely on It is an important safety net program for people who are in low-income status--so for poorer folks. For those Americans, I want to make sure they understand, notwithstanding all the scare tactics, Medicaid is not going away.  Now, one of the common refrains is that Medicaid spending is slashed in the Better Care Act, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that Medicaid spending will grow by $74 billion over 10 years. So when they have talked about it being cut, it actually grows by $71 billion over 4 years.  I would also point out there are some who think the current rate of spending on Medicaid can go forward unabated without any changes, and that is simply not true. We know that according to the Congressional Research Service, Medicaid spending across the country totaled $494 billion in 2014. I guess that was the last year for which full statistics were available--$494 billion. If we do nothing to check the rate of growth of Medicaid spending, in 2023, it will be $835 billion. So you go from $494 billion to $835 billion. We simply cannot keep up with that pace of spending.  Many of us--the Presiding Officer being one of them--are concerned about cuts in our military, which is the one thing the Federal Government has to do because nobody else can do it. Right now, we have seen, during the last administration, cuts of about 20 percent in our defense spending.  Well, when you have runaway spending in entitlement programs like Medicaid, where nobody is placed on a budget and forced to spend wisely and efficiently, essentially by forcing the Federal Government to spend $835 billion for Medicaid spending alone, that is going to crowd out a lot of other meritorious and important spending, including for defense spending as well.  So we need to make sure Medicaid is there but that Medicaid is put on a responsible budget that grows year after year. In fact, during the life of this particular bill, over the next 10 years, it will go up $71 billion.  Here is another thing. Our friends across the aisle act like Medicaid is the very best program to come down the pike. Well, it is not, and there are a number of reasons for that. One is that Medicaid recipients don't always get the quality of care or the access to care we would hope for. That is because the States, which set the rate of reimbursement of doctors for Medicare beneficiaries, set it so low that it is roughly half the amount that is reimbursed based on private insurance. That is the reason why, in 2000, 67 percent of Texas physicians accepted new Medicaid patients. Today, it is 31 percent. So if you are on Medicaid, there is a two-thirds chance you will not be able to find a doctor to see you as a Medicaid beneficiary.  What we have done, instead, in the Better Care Act--particularly for the single adult population between 100 percent and 135 percent of the Federal poverty level--is, we said we will give you a refundable tax credit you can use to buy private insurance. Private insurance is highly preferable to Medicaid because, for one thing, it reimburses physicians at a higher rate and gives people greater access to physicians, hospitals, and greater quality of care. In my State alone, in the State of Texas, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as many as 600,000 new low-income Texans will benefit from the provisions of the Better Care It will help qualify them for a tax credit not available to them under  Simply throwing money at Medicaid will not help people at all. We need to reform Medicaid and make it more efficient. Frankly, one of the things I did back when we were debating the Affordable Care Act in the Senate Finance Committee, I actually filed an amendment that said Members of Congress would go on Well, it failed, but the point I was trying to make is that if Members of Congress were on Medicaid, we would fix Right now, it is substandard healthcare for the reasons I mentioned. Two-thirds of the doctors in my State alone refuse to see a new Medicaid patient because it pays them so far under the standard of private insurance or even  By providing low-income Americans access to private insurance instead of Medicaid, we can assist those who were previously left out of the healthcare market and will now be able to purchase a plan of their choice perhaps for the first time. Unless we act, we are going to continue to see skyrocketing premiums and deductibles and lost coverage.  The American people were told time and time again that under ObamaCare costs would go down and they would be able to keep their doctor, which has proven not to be the case.  I mentioned before on the floor of the Senate that in my previous life as attorney general of Texas, we had something called the Consumer Protection Division, and if some business made false claims about a service or product to the American people when it came to their healthcare, the U.Government would take them to court and we would win because it is simply a deceptive trade practice in that context. It is deception. It is deceit. Unfortunately, the American people were bamboozled by promises that were not kept.  We also know that about $1 trillion in ObamaCare taxes--new taxes that were imposed to pay for ObamaCare--have ultimately been saddled on American families with higher costs for healthcare. When ObamaCare was passed and all these new taxes were passed, my friends across the aisle acted as though they would simply be absorbed by somebody, but we all know that simple economics means that ultimately the consumers are the people who actually pay the tab. They are the ones who end up paying the taxes.  Some of our colleagues on the other side recognized the destructive nature of the Affordable Care Act tax scheme. For example, five Democratic Senators, including my colleagues from Minnesota, voted to repeal the medical device tax just 2 years ago. The medical device tax was a draconian form of taxation. It wasn't based on income--in other words, where you could deduct your expenses and just pay taxes on your net income--it was a gross receipts tax. In other words, it said in effect that everything you have earned before you deduct your costs of doing business is going to be taxed at a given rate, and that was true of the medical device tax.  Perversely, a tax on medical devices meant not only did the jobs to produce those medical devices move offshore, in the case of one Texas-based company, they moved their business essentially to Costa Rica in order to avoid the taxes because they simply couldn't afford to pay them and stay in business and keep the jobs they had.  It was also a tax on innovation, and that is the reason we saw a bipartisan response to repeal the medical device tax just 2 years ago, because this tax has chased away jobs and innovation in the medical sector and saddled consumers with higher costs.  By repealing those taxes in the Better Care Act, we not only will lower the bill at the pharmacy or the doctor's office, but we encourage competition, and that is common sense and ultimately benefits consumers.  Our plan also protects consumers from government mandates requiring[[Page S3878]]them to buy insurance that they don't want and can't afford. This way, families can choose what works best for them, free from the penalties by the government. Some individuals may choose to go with no plan at all.  The dirty little secret about the Affordable Care Act is that it can't work without a government mandate that you buy government-approved health insurance or else you pay a penalty. I can't think of any other instance where the government says ``You do what we say, or we are going to punish you and penalize you,'' as the Affordable Care Act does.  Even with the individual mandate and this threat of a penalty, we know that about 28 million Americans are currently not covered by insurance. Many of them are covered by so-called hardship exceptions. About 6.5 million of them just pay the penalty because it is cheaper to pay the penalty than it is to buy the insurance because the prices are so high.  When some of the critics say that without this economic gun to the head of a penalty, people will choose not to buy insurance for themselves, that is a choice they will make as We believe in freedom of choice, and when the marketplace provides a product that they believe adds value at a price they can afford, that is when consumers buy a product or a service. But they shouldn't have to do it because the government forces them to do so and penalizes them if they don't. The Better Care Act gives people the ability, free from a government mandate, to choose not to buy something they don't want. The Washington-forced mandates are gone.  The nonpartisan budget office has estimated that under our plan, average premiums will decrease by nearly one-third in 3 years.  These are some of the important facts we need to be debating, not the misrepresentations that unfortunately seem to fill the void.  I have shared multiple stories from my constituents back home in the last few weeks on the floor, and I plan to keep doing that as we continue our work on this legislation. The stories that I and my colleagues have heard are what have inspired me and motivated me from the beginning of this entire process. In fact, it is our job to represent our constituents. I would encourage all of our colleagues to listen to their own States and to share the trials of their constituents as well because the status quo is simply unacceptable. The Democratic leader has said as much. He said that if we set aside the Better Care Act and are actually interested in helping ``fix'' ObamaCare, they are willing to do that. But do you know what that is? Basically, what that represents is a huge, multimillion-dollar bailout of insurance companies without any other reform. That is what our Democratic colleagues are supporting by their failure to engage with us in making sure there are reforms in addition to the other things that we do.  The other alternative plan--you might ask: Well, if Obamacare didn't work as was advertised--which it clearly hasn't--and something needs to be done, what does that something look like?  In the case of our friend the Senator from Vermont, Mr.Bernie Sanders, he said: I have an idea. Let's just make the Federal Government provide insurance coverage for everybody, single-payer.  Well, that is simply a solution we can't afford when we look at the tradeoffs. It would essentially supplant all the private insurance that people get from their employers and require incredible increases in taxes in order to do that across the board. So I don't think that is an alternative our friends across the aisle want to support. They love the mandate, they love penalizing free American citizens when they don't purchase a product the government mandates, but they are not going to defend that. They are not going to defend that. They certainly won't advocate, at least openly here on the floor, for a single-payer system.  We saw one committee of the legislature in California recently vote out a single-payer system. This was just one committee, I think, in one house. The estimated cost of a single-payer system in California alone was double the annual budget of the entire You can imagine what the numbers would be here at the national level.  Like any piece of legislation, our draft bill can be strengthened, and we would invite anyone in good faith who is interested in strengthening the bill to work with us to do so. We are going to continue to talk and listen and exchange ideas on how we can continue to make improvements, but in the end, the choice is clear: You either ultimately support ObamaCare and the status quo, or you are willing to try to work with us to produce something better that provides more affordable healthcare from the doctor and healthcare provider of your choice. That is simply the choice people are going to have. A ``no'' vote against the alternative is simply a vote for the status quo for ObamaCare, and we know where that is going to lead--it is going to lead with a big, multibillion-dollar bailout of insurance companies without any reform. That is what our Democratic colleagues are hoping for if we are unsuccessful. But we think there is a better way to approach this, one that brings down cost and maintains choices and the freedom of choice for the individual consumer.  We will continue to plow ahead with or without their help because we think it is our duty to do so, and we have confidence that, working together, we can come up with a better care plan that suits the needs of Americans when it comes to their healthcare.

8016,topic-id,543,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  We, in the San Joaquin Valley, know that where food grows, water flows. That is not just a saying; that is the truth. It takes water to grow the food that we rely on to sustain ourselves.  Luckily, this year, we have been blessed with an abundance of rain and snow on the mountains--a record year. However, it is only because of the wettest year in California's historical record that the agricultural heartland of California, a place where half of our Nation's fruits and vegetables are grown, is, this year, free from drought.  Only 1 year ago, over 83 percent of California was in a moderate drought or worse. We know that the next drought is sure to come, threatening valley families and farm communities. It is either feast or famine. We measure water on 10-year averages. That is why we need solutions that solve this long-term challenge.  I commend Congressman Valadao for continuing this effort. As I noted in a letter I wrote to him in February, though, I have concerns that this legislation, without some improvements, will fail to be that long-term solution that the valley and our State so desperately needs. This solution must be, at the end of the day, multifaceted, must not pick winners and losers, as California water policies in the past have so frequently done, to the detriment of both the agricultural economy, which we have felt, and California's ecosystems. Sadly, some of the provisions within this legislation, in my opinion, I think fail to meet this test.  Language within titles 1 and 3 would pose threats to the wetlands of Grasslands Ecological Area, the largest wetlands west of the Mississippi, a vital component of the Pacific Flyway, in an area that contributes nearly $73 million a year alone to Merced County, which I represent.  Section 106 would drastically cut collections to the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, which pays for refuge water conveyance--that is very important--and that would transfer oversight of the fund to other water users. It would also, I think, supersede State laws in some areas that, frankly, over the experience I have had, in many years, will create more problems than it solves.  In addition to these concerns, I know from having worked on water solutions for over 30 years that both here and in Sacramento, the only path to legislative success is through bipartisan, bicameral action, as we experienced in December with the passage of the WIIN Act that, by the way, authorized four reservoirs that was contained in the WIIN Act that Senator Feinstein and I and Republicans in the House worked on together in a very constructive way.  So, as always, I stand ready to work with my colleagues in both the House and the Senate on a bipartisan basis to improve this legislation and get solutions to fix California's broken water system to the President's desk.  I support moving this legislation forward to the But let's be clear, this is a work in progress, and much more work remains for this legislation, I think, to be successful.

8036,topic-id,474,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  This amendment is about rescheduled water, and this is a technical term that, for people who aren't familiar with water use in California and other parts of the country, it allows people with water rights, whether they be senior or junior water rights, to reserve that water, in other words, to reschedule it, to hold it off for another time when it might be more valuable to use. And so this is an important tool.  I agree with Congressman LaMalfa that water users throughout California should have flexibility to use their water supplies in ways that are most beneficial to be able to reschedule it.  I do have some concerns that this amendment may have unintended consequences with other water users downstream should it become law without changes. Specifically, it is critical that those with more junior water rights, like some of the areas I represent south of the California delta, are not negatively impacted when they reschedule their water from senior water rights holders.  Water is precious. You have water shortages. So if I want to reserve it for later in the year or for the next water year, that means rescheduled water. So for these water users, we want to protect that ability.  Additionally, in the event that a future wet year causes spilling of rescheduled water, it is critical that the priority of the water spilling is addressed in a fair and equitable manner.  I would like to work with the gentleman to address these concerns. And I thank him, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr.Mr.Chair, I am very pleased to be able to work with my colleague, Mr.Costa, to ensure that these concerns are met and addressed as the bill moves through the  I believe the ability to reschedule water deliveries for these periods when they are needed should be offered as widely as possible, and I appreciate the support in that goal.  Indeed, the opportunity that we can help the Central Valley with this, I relish that opportunity to do so. More facilities to store more water is, indeed, very important so we have more flexibility for Mr.Costa and his neighbors, constituents.  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock).  Mr.Mr.Chair, I just want to say that this is a very good amendment. The committee supports it, and it is essential to providing the flexibility that is necessary.  I might point out to my colleague from California, when we originally developed this bill more than 5 years ago, we consulted more than 60 water agencies throughout northern and central California, including many in Democratic congressional districts. Senior water rights are essential to northern This bill strengthens them, and Mr.LaMalfa's amendment adds the management flexibility that is long overdue.

8049,topic-id,484,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I would like to first, again, thank the Rules Committee chair and Ranking Member Slaughter for making my amendment in order, as well as acknowledge my colleague from California, Congressman LaMalfa, for his work on this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, a record drought and the most destructive wildfire seasons on record have brought renewed attention to California's headwaters. These forests, meadows, and other source waters play a vital role in California's water supply and management system, and they are under threat from a host of factors, including wildfires, climate change impacts, and poor management policies.  More effective forest and headwaters management practices, such as increased use of forest thinning and watershed restoration, have demonstrated the potential to provide a measurable increase in water supply to the Central Valley Project reservoirs that receive runoff generated by these headwaters in the Sierra Nevadas, the beautiful mountains that we have in  The Sierra Nevada mountain range, many people don't realize, generates nearly 60 percent of California's developed water supply--60 percent. And that is why the abundance of snow on the mountains during the wintertime is so critical.  Some estimates indicate that simply by instituting more effective headwaters management policies, that up to 300,000 acre-feet of additional water supplies--300,000 acre-feet--could be generated each year.  Now, that is a significant yield of water when you look at the overdraft crop problems that we have and some of the other authorization of surface storage that we have made last year during the WIIN  As a matter of fact, the Bureau of Reclamation has analyzed that some of the projects that I support, such as raising Shasta Dam 18 feet, would generate anywhere from 75 to over 100,000 acre-feet of water annually. So if we can generate an additional 300,000 acre-feet by better managing our headwaters, this is almost three times that yield.  Simply managing our forests better could, in many instances, quadruple our water supply and better produce environmental outcomes for our forest ecosystems.  To put this in context, this is enough water to irrigate over 100,000 acres, of which we have significant overdraft of land, or provide daily water for an additional 500,000 homes in California for an entire year.  My amendment would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into partnerships to determine the amount of water that could be untapped by doing these kinds of efforts.  Fixing California's broken water system, as I have said repeatedly, means using all of the water tools in our water management toolbox. Included in this amendment, we would be having the opportunity to improve our headwater management in an integrated and multidisciplinary approach that is responsive to the changing conditions that we face as we know that will continue to occur.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from northern California (Mr.Huffman).

Recycled water, on-farm recharge, and other innovative methods of increasing water supply, we have found, improves the situation, but there is no silver bullet to solving California's long-term water challenges.  In the Valley, we understand that, and this is why many communities moved forward on efforts to diversify their water supplies. For example, the Del Puerto Water District has partnered in northern Merced and Stanislaus Counties with the cities of Modesto and Turlock on a project that uses treated wastewater to irrigate agricultural fields, creating significant water security for about 30 percent of Del Puerto's Central Valley water supply that is rarely delivered.  This is cost-effective and costs less than other alternatives.

8210,topic-id,527,"Mr.President, today I wish to remember metal mining's greatest disaster, the Granite Mountain/Speculator Mine Fire that took place 100 years ago in Butte, MT, that claimed the lives of 168 men.  On the night of June 8, 1917, approximately 410 men were in the mine, working to meet the demand for copper that was created by our Armed Forces on the frontlines during World War An electric cable had been lowered into the mine earlier in the day and had gotten away from the workers, falling into a tangled coil. Later that evening, as crews examined the damaged cable, a lamp accidentally ignited the cable and sparked a fire that would fill the mine with smoke and poisonous gas.  Unable to lower cages due to fire damage, in an act of pure bravery, over 100 rescue workers immediately jumped into harm's way to try to rescue their trapped brothers. Miraculously, none of the rescue workers were killed, but sadly, after the conclusion of rescue efforts, a total of 168 miners were lost. The community of Butte grieved together, as did the entire Montana family.  Today I want to honor those who perished that tragic day and honor those whose families who would never be the same after it. Would you please join me in a brief moment of silence to remember those miners and their families?  This proclamation is meant to recognize the strength of those Montanans who sacrificed their lives in support our Nation's military work in World War I, as well as those who jumped to help a fallen brother without question. The tragedy that befell our mining community highlights the strength found in the hearts of not only Montanans, but all Americans, and the moments that make heroes out of ordinary men and bring communities together.  So that future generations will not forget the men who perished that day, a memorial was built in honor of those who died in the Granite Mountain/[[Page S3326]]Speculator Mine If you are ever in our beautiful State, I hope you will take time to visit.  One hundred years after this tragedy, we are also reminded of how far we have come in hard rock mining. Jobs that were once seen as high risk are now very desirable, not just due to high wages, but more importantly because of advances in safety. In fact, according to the Department of Labor, fiscal year 2016 was the safest year in mining history. The continued progress toward safer mining has been a shared effort across State and Federal agencies, as well as the mining community itself. New technology, better practices, special initiatives, and improved training have led to a culture in mining communities and industry that prioritizes safety. The Granite Mountain/Speculator Mine Fire reminds us so that we must continue to push for even safer mining.  Lastly, I want to take a moment to thank those hard rock miners who are spread across our beautiful country and who continue to serve the American people. Thank you for all that you do. We must continue to prioritize safety that we never again have a tragedy like that of the Granite Mountain/Speculator Mine                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3325-2.txt,2138,GAINING RESPONSIBILITY ON WATER ACT OF 2017,2017.0,7.0,July

8053,topic-id,1229,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.23.  This amendment updates a small portion of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, or the WIIN Act, to protect endangered species and assess water storage opportunities.  First, it sets a reasonable timeframe for the completion of expanded water storage opportunities at the New Melones These opportunities can increase available storage for conservation, transfers, and rescheduled water projects to allow for maximum storage within the reservoir. Conservative estimates of increased water storage have been at 100,000 acre-feet, which will provide water for over 400,000 people for a year.  With such a precious resource, we must ensure our water storage capacity is being used responsibly. This timeline of 7 years is consistent with other provisions of the WIIN Act, and will ensure the study will be completed so we can make best use of our water storage capacity.  Additionally, this amendment helps protect our threatened and endangered species.  In Western States, water users can buy and sell water rights. This provision prevents individuals from using funding set aside for species conservation to buy water rights and sell them back to the government.  Funding in section 4010(b) of the WIIN Act was allocated to benefit endangered species populations through habitat restoration, improved monitoring, and conservation fish hatcheries. This policy has been in effect for the Central Valley Project Improvement Act for over a decade and needs to be applied to this section as well. This ensures funding will be used for its intended purposes to help endangered species, not to buy and resell water rights.  Finally, this amendment extends a program to protect native fish in the Stanislaus River for 2 years. This program allows for the taking of invasive species that prey on native salmon and steelhead in the Stanislaus It was originally authorized for 5 years. However, since the spawn cycle for these salmon is 3 years, it needs to be extended to ensure two full salmon cohort cycles can be observed.  In conclusion, this amendment protects native and endangered species, and ensures we are making the most of water storage capacity at the New Melones  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

Amendment 5 Offered by Mr.DeSaulnier  The Acting It is now in order to consider amendment 5 printed in part C of House Report 115-212.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       At the end of title IV, insert the following:     406. REVIEW OF AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND       Section 3405(e) of the Central Valley Project Improvement      Act is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(4) The Secretary, through the office established under      this subsection, shall review available and new, innovative      technologies and programs for capturing municipal wastewater      and recycling it for providing drinking water and energy, and      report on the feasibility of expanding the implementation of      these technologies and programs among Central Valley Project      contractors.''.  The Acting Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from California (Mr.DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Chairman, my amendment asks for a review of existing best practices worldwide for the capture and reuse of wastewater and a feasibility study on the expansion of these efforts.  Existing policy requires a review of conservation plans of Central Valley Project contractors. I believe we should look further than just what we are currently doing and learn from new, emerging technologies and practices from around the world for recycling wastewater.  Capturing wastewater for reuse is not new. Orange County, California, implemented its Groundwater Replenishment System in 2008, which augments the water supply for 850,000 residents with treated wastewater and helps reduce the area's dependence on water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta.  In Singapore, an initiative to recycle wastewater supplies approximately one-third of the country's water demand. In Israel, treated sewage water meets approximately one-quarter of the country's needed water.  Across California, more than 200 billion gallons of municipal wastewater are already reused each year. According to one report, California has an unrealized opportunity to grow that number to between 390 billion and 590 billion acre-feet per year.  The need for innovation to increase the amount of available water is very clear. Between 2011 and 2013, even before the onset of one of the State's most severe droughts on record, water stored in the Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed and the Central Valley dropped by nearly 20 billion cubic meters, or two-thirds of the volume of Lake  We need to prepare for more severe droughts in the coming decades. With innovation and technologies available in the United States and around the world, we could and should continue to look for new ways to augment our water supply and enhance our water security.  Around the world and across the United States, innovation and technologies for capturing and recycling wastewater are improving, and their costs are falling. The purpose of this amendment is to understand the current state of these technologies and to identify opportunities for expanding them.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleague to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, this amendment adds a superfluous provision that requires a study on a subject that we have already studied to death.  We find the left constantly proposing these technologies to manage our existing water shortage often as an excuse not to expand our ability to store new water supplies.  The problem is not complicated. These recycling projects are typically four times as expensive as traditional water storage, according to a 2016 study by the California Public Utilities  If we had exhausted our existing resources, then these technologies might make sense if the alternative is no water at all. But that is not the alternative. The alternative is to develop our resources at about one-fourth the cost of these technologies the gentleman is trying to sell us--four times the cost.  No consumer in his right mind would pay four times more for the same product. Only politicians would do that, and the problem is when politicians make this choice, consumers end up paying.  Which brings me to my second objection to the gentleman's amendment. Our traditional water projects are paid for by the users of the water in proportion to their use, as is the beneficiary pays principle that has guided our water projects for generations.[[Page H5529]]                                {time}  1815  These policies protect taxpayers from footing the bill for somebody else's water.  The title 16 recycling projects the gentleman is promoting are not paid for by the water users but rather by general taxpayers, meaning these projects literally rob Petersburg to pay  If the gentleman would like to confine the provisions of the bill to require his constituents to pay four times more for their water or that his constituents pay to subsidize the water for my constituents, I would be happy to support him.

8102,topic-id,1434,"Mr.President, today is the fifth anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA provides temporary legal status to immigrant students who arrived in the United States as children and infants, if they register with the government, pay a fee, and pass a criminal background check.  The program is based on the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation I introduced 16 years ago in 2001. That legislation gave undocumented students who grew up in this country a chance to earn a path to legal status and citizenship. These young people have come to be known as What used to be a word reserved for rock-and-roll groups is now a word that has become part of our common language to describe an immigration challenge and opportunity.  These DREAMers came to the United States as children. They are American in every way except for their legal immigration status. We have already invested a lot of money in these kids. We educated them. We made them part of this country, and it makes no sense to squander their talents by deporting them at this moment in their lives.  In April 2010, I sent a letter to President Dick Lugar, the Republican Senator from Indiana, joined me. On a bipartisan basis, we said to President Obama: Stop deporting these young kids. They did nothing wrong. Their parents made the decision to come here. Give them a chance. The President responded. It is now clear the DACA Program he created by Executive order has been a great success. More than 780,000 DREAMers have come forward and received DACA protection and status that has allowed them to contribute more fully to this country as students, as teachers, as nurses, as engineers, as entrepreneurs.  A recent study by the Center for American Progress found that ending DACA--saying to these 780,000 young people they are no longer part of America--would cost us. It would cost our economy over $400 billion in gross domestic product over the next 10 years. These are productive citizens doing good things for I should take that back. They are not citizens yet. They are productive people doing good things for America whom I want to make citizens if the DREAM Act becomes law.  I have many differences with President Trump on immigration. For example, the President's January 25 Executive order makes up to 8 million immigrants priorities for deportation, and seeks to create a deportation force by tripling the number of immigration agents. This ignores the reality that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are law-abiding individuals who make important economic contributions to this country, and have deep roots in the United  I am grateful, and I say that publicly. I have said it before. I am grateful President Trump has decided to keep the DACA Program in place. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and the U.Citizenship and Immigration Service Director nominee, Francis Cissna, have promised me personally and publicly that they will maintain the existing guidelines for the DACA I appreciate this commitment. I intend to hold them to it.  Congress also has an obligation to do its job. We ought to do something we rarely do in the U.Senate--pass legislation, fix our broken immigration system. Think about this: On June 27, 2013--4 years ago--the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed comprehensive immigration reform by a vote of 68 to 32, better than 2 to 1. I was glad to be part of the Gang of 8 Democratic and Republican Senators who worked for months on the bill that passed by this margin. It strengthened border security, protected American workers, and it established a tough but fair path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people in this country.  Unfortunately, the Republican majority of the House of Representatives would not debate it, would not consider it, would not bring it for a vote, and it died in the U.House of If they had done their job, their work, it would have passed with a bipartisan majority. President Obama would have signed it into law. I might not be standing here today talking about this issue.  Over the years, I have come to the floor of the Senate to tell story after story about DREAMers, the young immigrant students who grew up in this country. These stories put a human face on the DACA Program and the DREAM legislation. They show that immigration makes our country stronger.  Today, I want to say a word about Gissel This is She came to the United States at the age of 3. Her family emigrated from She grew up in my home State of Illinois, in the town of She was an honors student in high school. She attended their gifted program. She had a big responsibility personally. From a young age, she was one of the primary caregivers for her brother who suffers from severe autism. During the little spare time she had, Gissel was a volunteer in her community, helping organizations provide care for children with autism.  As an undocumented student though, Gissel was not eligible for any Federal assistance to go to college, but as a result of her academic achievements in high school, she received a private scholarship to attend the University of Illinois at As a college student, Gissel was a writing tutor and a leader in student organizations for future teachers. In 2010, she graduated from the University of Illinois Chicago and the College of Education with a degree in elementary education. After the graduation ceremony, Gissel received a Dean's Merit She delivered the graduation speech for her class.  She wanted to start using her degree as an elementary school teacher, but because she was undocumented, that wasn't possible. Instead, she continued her education and earned a master's degree at the University of She was accepted into a disability leadership program as a family advocate.  Then, in 2012, the world changed for the better for President Obama established the DACA She immediately applied for Then, in 2013, she completed her master's degree and became an elementary school teacher. For the last 4 years, Gissel has been a teacher in the Berwyn South School Last year, she was awarded a certificate of achievement for her leadership as one of two teachers to implement the first-ever dual-language program in the district.  Gissel sent me a letter. I would like to read part of it as part of the Here is what she said:       DACA has enabled me to become a meaningful member of      society by opening doors that would have otherwise not been      accessible. DACA recipients, like myself, are more than just      a policy. My hope is that when people listen to our stories,      they will notice the kind of individuals that we are and the      kind of contributions we make--not only to the economy, but      to our society.  I reflect on that paragraph to think about this young woman, the challenges she has faced within her family, and challenges imposed by the fact that she was undocumented. She has never lost sight of her commitment to her family, to her disabled sibling, and to many others in her community.[[Page S3507]]  Now she wants to be a teacher. Wouldn't you be proud and honored to have your child in a classroom with someone with Gissel's master's degree and values? I certainly would. Gissel and other DREAMers have so much to give to the United States, but without DACA and without the DREAM Act, Gissel would be deported back to Mexico--a country she hasn't lived in since she was 3 years old.  Will America be a stronger country if we send away people like Gissel, if we deport them and say we don't need them in our future? Of course not. The answer is clear. Gissel will make America a better place. Today we celebrate the DACA Program, which has given Gissel and hundreds of thousands of other DREAMers the chance to finally come out of the shadows, but we also recognize DACA as a temporary solution.  Ultimately, Congress--and especially the Senate--must step up and show leadership here; make certain that we address the failings and weaknesses of our broken immigration system; say to the 780,000 protected by DACA that you stepped forward, paid your fee, submitted yourself to a background check, and have been given a temporary opportunity to be part of Now it is our job to translate that into a permanent opportunity for these young people to make America a better place.

8133,topic-id,378,"Mr.President, I wish to speak on behalf of Peter John Camino, who is being inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Every year since 1992, Wyoming has recognized individuals who have made substantial contributions to agriculture in our As a third-generation rancher dedicating much of his life to Wyoming's agriculture industry, Peter John is well deserving of this honor.  Peter John grew up on his ranch that his grandfather founded near Buffalo, After attending college, he joined[[Page S4614]]the military and served honorably for several years. Ultimately, the ranch lifestyle called him home and he returned to Wyoming to take over the family operation. Peter John has said the sheep business was thriving upon his return and fondly remembers the community support and good times.  Fortunately for Wyoming, Peter John not only stuck with the agriculture industry during the good times, but took on leadership positions and persevered through the hard times as well. Peter John served as president of the Wyoming Wool Growers Association and played a crucial role in strengthening the organization. He has been described by coworkers and friends as a courageous leader who would always take time to listen to members of the organization. As president, he guided the sheep industry through some tough times and advocated for its cause at the local and Federal levels.  Leadership, courage, and collaboration are only some of the admirable qualities Peter John possesses. He has also shown dedication and selflessness while volunteering in his community and passing on his knowledge of the agriculture industry to younger generations. In addition to volunteering with his church and Knights of Columbus, serving on the board for Johnson County Fire District, and advising the University of Wyoming's Sheep Program, he also serves as sheep superintendent for the Johnson County Fair and often invites schoolkids to his ranch to teach them about ranching, the sheep industry, and the value of wool.  I want to extend my congratulations to Mr.Camino and thank him for his service and years of hard work. Peter John truly lives the ``Code of the West,'' and I am proud to have the opportunity to recognize his achievements as an inductee into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Wyoming is well served by his lasting and continuing contributions to our                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-31-pt1-PgS4613-2.txt,1542,GAINING RESPONSIBILITY ON WATER ACT OF 2017,2017.0,31.0,July
8032,topic-id,22245,"Mr.Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.23 because it upends decades of State and federal water law and needlessly pits water users against one another. On the heels of the worst drought in California's history, this bill mandates that certain interests come out ahead of others.  California has just recently emerged from six years of a punishing drought that forced every resident to conserve water, caused millions of acres of agricultural land to be fallowed, and dramatically increased our State's risk of major wildfires. The drought was a massive disaster and Congress should respond by investing in long-term resilience against future droughts such as water conservation, recycling, groundwater recharge, and desalination. What Congress should not be doing is using the drought as an excuse to permanently upend a century of water law and countless protections for threatened and endangered wildlife.  H.23 weakens or overrides decades of State and federal law, including the State and federal Endangered Species Acts; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Central Valley Project Improvement Act; and the San Joaquin River Settlement This list should set off alarm bells for any proponent of States' rights or cooperative federalism. For over a century, the Federal Government has deferred to State water law whenever possible. The GROW Act unwinds that history entirely.  By discarding a century of water law and species protections, this bill will decimate the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem, drive the Delta smelt to extinction, and accelerate the decline of the wild salmon and steelhead runs which have been an important part of the Northern California economy since the mid-19th century.  This irresponsible bill also overrides science-based management of the delicate Delta infrastructure and would gut several of our most bedrock environmental laws. For these reasons I strongly oppose this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr.Hill). All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-24.

PURPOSE AND       ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this part is to authorize      implementation of the       ``(b) Findings.--Congress finds that since the date of the      enactment of this Act, the following conditions now persist      with regard to implementation of the Settlement:       ``(1) Millions of dollars of economic damages have occurred      due to seepage from rivers flows and other impacts to third      parties affected by the Settlement and San Joaquin River      Restoration Program and such impacts will continue for the      duration of the Settlement and Restoration Program      implementation.       ``(2) Estimated costs of implementing the Settlement have      more than doubled from the initial estimates for implementing      the Settlement, from a high-end estimate of $800,000,000 to      more than $1,700,000,000, due to unrealistic initial cost      estimates, additional, unanticipated cost increases related      to damages to land from seepage and to infrastructure from      subsidence, and from increased construction costs to complete      channel improvements, and other improvements not originally      identified, but anticipated in the Settlement as necessary to      implement the Restoration       ``(3) Achievement of the Settlement's Water Management      Goal, to reduce or avoid water supply impacts to Friant      Division long-term contractors, including the Friant-Kern      Canal and Madera Canal capacity restoration projects have not      progressed and are likely impossible given available and      likely future funding and regulatory constraints.       ``(4) Implementation of the Settlement's Restoration Goal      has already fallen short of the schedule agreed to by the      Settling Parties and Congress, which required the      reintroduction of Spring-run and Fall-run Chinook salmon in      the river by December 31, 2012, and the majority of Paragraph      11 improvements construction to be complete by December 31,      2013, with the remainder of the paragraph (11) improvements      to be completed by December 31, 2016, neither of which      deadlines have been met and the Secretary has now made      findings that such improvements will not be completed until      2030 at the earliest and likely beyond that timeframe, which      schedule assumes full funding of the Restoration Program,      which has not occurred.       ``(5) Catastrophic species declines in the Sacramento-San      Joaquin Delta and other changed conditions have affected the      Friant Division's water supply in ways unimagined during the      time of the Settlement's signing, resulting in additional      reductions in water supply for the Friant Division beyond      what was agreed to in the       ``(6) Recent scientific assessments of likely future      climate change suggest that no amount of additional flow in      the San Joaquin River will sustain Spring-run Chinook salmon,      one of the target species for maintaining a self-sustaining      population below Friant       ``(7) In consideration of existing conditions, it is not      reasonable, prudent and feasible to implement the Settlement      as originally authorized.''.

In this title:       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means, as      applicable--       (A) the Secretary of Agriculture; or       (B) the Secretary of the       (2) Water right.--The term ``water right'' means any      surface, groundwater, or storage use filed, permitted,      certificated, confirmed, decreed, adjudicated, or otherwise      recognized by a judicial proceeding or by the State in which      the user acquires possession of the water or puts it to      beneficial use. Such term shall include water rights for      federally recognized Indian Tribes     703. TREATMENT OF WATER       The Secretary shall not--       (1) condition the issuance, renewal, amendment, or      extension of any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment,      easement, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy      agreement on the transfer of any water right (including joint      and sole ownership) directly or indirectly to the United      States, or on any impairment of title or interest, in whole      or in part, granted or otherwise recognized under State law,      by Federal or State adjudication, decree, or other judgment,      or pursuant to any interstate water compact; or       (2) require any water user (including any federally      recognized Indian Tribe) to apply for or acquire a water      right in the name of the United States under State law as a      condition of the issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension      of any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement,      right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement.     704.

Mr.Mr.Chair, I have an amendment made in order under the rule.  The Acting The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Page 63, strike line 19 through page 64, line 2 and insert      the following:       (d) Program for Water Rescheduling.--The Secretary of the      Interior shall develop and implement a program, not later      than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, to      provide the opportunity for individuals or districts that      receive Central Valley Project Water under water service or      repayment contracts or water rights settlement contracts      within the American River, Sacramento River, Shasta and      Trinity River Divisions to reschedule water, provided for      under their Central Valley Project water service, repayment      or settlement contracts, within the same year or from one      year to the next.       Page 64, strike lines 3 through 12, and insert the      following:       (e) Definition.--In this section, the year type terms used      in subsection (a)  The Acting Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Chair, I thank Mr.McClintock for managing this bill and for his help on this.  I am pleased to support the bill, the GROW Act, which, contrary to some claims, protects northern California water rights and keeps more water in the north than the status quo. I should know because I represent the source of the overwhelming majority of California's usable water.  The underlying bill improves water efficiency by allowing junior water contractors in the Sacramento Valley to carry over water supplies from one year to the next in Lake Shasta, retaining access to those supplies the following year, which promotes efficiency when you are banking that additional water for future use.  This amendment improves the bill by ensuring that all Federal water contractors in the Sacramento Valley have the same ability to reschedule their water supplies.  Mr.Chair, under the current system, water contractors are forced to use it or lose it. If water allocations are not fully used each year, the ability to access that water is lost.  Now, around Washington, D.C., that use-it-or-lose-it attitude usually means a lot of money that sits in certain agencies' bank accounts or in their pots, it is just used up. Why would we want to do that kind of thing with water? We need to be banking it and saving it, where practical, to be usable in the next year or to pass to others who could use it as well.  During wet years, farms and ranches may choose to reschedule a portion of their water for the following year. This bill and this amendment will significantly improve planning and delivery of water supplies by ensuring maximum flexibility, flexibility which we need, and allowing water to be accessed when it is needed most.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5503.txt,355,GAINING RESPONSIBILITY ON WATER ACT OF 2017,2017.0,12.0,June

8021,topic-id,375,"Mr.Chairman, we have a serious case of legislative amnesia here. Apparently, the sponsors of this bill and those who are speaking in support of it have totally forgotten what we did last year. The WIIN Act last year addressed every single problem that has been presented here this afternoon: new reservoirs, four were authorized in the WIIN Act, which became law less than a year ago--7 months, to be exact; all of the issues of the outflows of water to the delta were addressed so that additional export of water from the delta could occur.  I am wondering: What are we doing here with this piece of legislation, aside from totally eviscerating the protections for the largest estuary on the West Coast, of the Western Hemisphere? The environmental protections are eviscerated.  What are we doing with this legislation besides--oh, you wanted to talk about private water rights? Those private water rights are set in place by the laws of the State of California, which are overridden by this piece of legislation.  Yes, that is true. This legislation removes the water rights that the State of California has given to individuals as well as irrigation districts, but they are stripped away.  What is this all about?  Last year, a 2-year effort was completed and the WIIN Act was passed by this Congress, signed into law. It is in existence. Reservoirs can be built. Water conservation will take place. All of the things that we need to do are in place today.  So why are we fighting this fight? Because we don't know how to stop fighting? Because we don't know how to actually implement a law that we passed last year?  And, by the way, where is the funding for all you want to do here? There is no money in this. You want to do these things. You want water; you want reservoirs--put up the money. Don't just sit here and regurgitate what we have done for the last 5 years and totally ignore the progress that was made with the WIIN legislation.  We ought not do this. I am opposed to this, and, hopefully, we will find some sensible action.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Tipton).

8106,topic-id,1346,"Mr.President, I am very pleased that the Senator from[[Page S3508]]Alabama is presiding over this very important debate because one of the most important issues to both of our States, Colorado and Alabama, is the economy and the economic well-being of our great country. The amendment that I will be discussing today goes to the very heart of our opportunities in space, our opportunities in innovation, our opportunities to ensure that we have the most reliable information as it relates to weather and to weather events.  It is a great partnership that we have had with the Senator from Alabama, who has been absolutely critical and instrumental in ensuring a persistent, reliable space presence. I thank the Senator from Alabama, Mr.Strange, for his incredible leadership when it comes to making sure that we are able to reach space, that we are able to continue our space mission. Whether it is in the defense of this country or in understanding where the next tornado may strike, I thank the Senator from Alabama for the leadership that has been provided to ensure that constant presence and persistence.  Of course, I rise to speak in support of the bipartisan Gardner-Nelson-Warner et al. amendment, amendment 250. Yet, truly, to the Senate--to my colleagues here--I rise in support of America's role and leadership in space.  I rise on behalf of the hardworking men and women across this Nation who make our country's aerospace industry second to none, because, over the past 70 years, the United States has led the way in space exploration. From the Apollo missions to the space shuttle to the Orion program, we are the leaders in exploring the great frontier of space. That is who this country is. That is who we are--explorers, pioneers. We were the first to the Moon, and I hope we are the first to Mars, but we cannot give up that pioneering innovation that has led this country to greatness.  I will share with colleagues of the Senate a CNBC story from March that China is building a manned spacecraft that is capable of sending astronauts to the Moon as well as to near-Earth orbit flight.  Can you imagine the day when the stars and stripes on the lunar surface stands not alone but stands next to the stars of a flag of another nation--perhaps China's, perhaps somebody else's?  When it comes to our access to space, this debate is absolutely critical because without the passage of amendment 250, we lose a tremendous portion of our access to space. We lose it for commercial applications, and we lose it for civil applications.  In the past few months, this China activity has shown the importance of U.leadership. That is why this bipartisan amendment comes with a very simple point. It ensures that NASA and our commercial space industry will continue to be the country's leader in aerospace.  The ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, of Virginia, is coleading my amendment. The Senator has done a phenomenal job in leadership on the Intelligence Committee in leading this amendment.  I see that my colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, has joined this debate. He has done a phenomenal job in leading this effort. As the ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, with jurisdiction over NASA, Senator Bill Nelson is the leading cosponsor of this effort.  They understand how important it is to address this issue for NASA and other space missions.  I stand here in support of the greater goals of the underlying bill that we will be amending today. I believe sanctions against our adversaries are warranted and justified and, indeed, should move forward. This amendment is not designed to undermine the intent of the bill, but it seeks to ensure that space exploration may continue as it is currently planned.  Without this bipartisan amendment, multiple missions on the books today--that are already planned today--will be delayed or even canceled and will be subjecting the U.taxpayers to significant cost increases. Without this amendment, missions like the commercial resupply program, which delivers critical supplies to the International Space Station, will be jeopardized by the language of the bill as it is written. American astronauts at the International Space Station, as we speak, are dependent on those supplies, but we are cutting off the American lifeline without the adoption of this amendment. Future missions, like the commercial crew program--a partnership between NASA and private industry to bring astronauts to the International Space Station on a U.S.-manufactured spacecraft--will be put at risk without the adoption of this amendment.  Without this bipartisan amendment, we will continue to rely on Russian spacecraft to take U.astronauts to the International Space Let me just make that more clear. Without the adoption of this amendment, NASA and our astronauts will be dependent on Russia for access to space for even longer. Rejection of this bipartisan amendment results in further Russian dependence.  I do not believe this was the intent of the language when the bill was first written. The Gardner-Nelson-Warner-Shelby et al. amendment creates the certainty that NASA needs and supports to ensure currently planned NASA and commercial launch missions can continue without interruption.  NASA contacted my office yesterday and said of amendment 250: ``We believe this provides us the flexibility to maintain our commitments to our national space program.''  It is not just the commercial crew and cargo missions that are going to be impacted. Several other missions will be subjected to delays--missions like the Joint Polar Satellite This constellation of satellites will give us the ability to constantly monitor the globe for significant weather events, such as floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes. As I stand here today, the three Senators on the floor who are listening to this important debate--with more on C-SPAN--have been impacted dramatically by floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes.  In 2013, we had dramatic flooding in Colorado that damaged thousands and thousands of homes and cost lives. I know the Presiding Officer has faced the same challenge when it has come to tornadoes and incredibly tragic weather events. The Senator from Florida has faced hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. That is the importance of this amendment--to understand our weather systems and predictions.  I am proud to say that JPSS is being developed in my home State of The JPSS and other essential programs in which we have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars already, are now put at risk of significant delays or cost increases to the taxpayer without the adoption of this amendment.  I am also on the floor to talk about a longer term mission that I truly believe in and hope to see our Nation achieve, one that goes to the very heart of our pioneering spirit of who we are as a people. It is our future manned mission to  As I have spoken on the floor before, as I child I wanted to be an astronaut. I was inspired as I watched NASA astronauts explore that next frontier. I believe that the next destination for human beings to explore is, indeed, Mars, but without this bipartisan amendment, the Mars 2020 rover, which will continue to prepare us for that future manned mission, will be put in doubt. It will be a significant setback and will make the future goal of getting to Mars seem that much further away.  This amendment, amendment 250, allows these missions to move forward with certainty and as scheduled. It is a bipartisan effort to affirm America's leadership in space.  Let's be clear. Last summer we had a debate on this very same issue--that by 2022 we were going to have an ``America first'' opportunity. That is the spirit of this amendment--to make sure that we have access to these vital and critical space missions, access to space, and to continue to grow economic opportunities for the American people. That is what this debate is all about.  I yield the floor to my colleague Senator Nelson and then, of course, will continue with debate.

8110,topic-id,404,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Arizona as well for allowing this vote to move forward, but in his statements, he said NASA needs to do the same. He repeated it several times.  I would just say that this amendment could actually be titled ``NASA Needs to Do the Same'' because what we had agreed to last year, when it comes to defense, is a way forward on the Atlas V rocket, the RD-180. We agreed to that. I believe it was a unanimous consent agreement. If there was an objection at that time, then it should have been expressed when we made this agreement.  Our colleagues across the aisle, for a unanimous consent, it takes all of us 100 people to agree to a unanimous consent agreement. That agreement was made on the National Defense Authorization NASA needs to do the same.  Our colleague, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, made the point of parity between civil, commercial, and defense. That is what this amendment does.  There are a lot of issues that we come to the floor and we talk about this issue not being rocket science: It is not that difficult. It is not rocket science. Well, we actually have an issue that is rocket science. The mission set before American astronauts is jeopardized if this amendment doesn't pass. The taxpayers of this country face billions of dollars in costs if this amendment doesn't pass. Reliance on Russian technology to get to the space station or resupplying American astronauts will increase if this amendment doesn't pass.  If we want to talk about protecting the people of this country, let's talk about the victims of floods in Colorado, let's talk about people who have died in tornadoes because we didn't have the most accurate ability to forecast where they were coming from, when they were going to strike, and who would be hit. This amendment will allow these weather satellites to go into space to protect the men and women of this country from natural disasters. Again, it brings parity to an agreement that was decided upon through unanimous consent last year.  I support the underlying legislation, and I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to support it as well. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee for their leadership on this committee.  I yield the floor.

8019,topic-id,323,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.23, legislation sponsored by my good friend and Western Caucus member, David  For years, Western communities have suffered as a result of frivolous lawsuits, inefficient policies, and burdensome regulations that have prevented adoption of commonsense water solutions. These factors, coupled with a lack of rainfall, exacerbated a manmade drought that lasted for 5 years.  Rather than capturing precious water supplies, failed government policies that refused to put Americans first allowed billions of gallons to be funneled into the San Francisco Bay and Pacific These deliberate diversions killed thousands of jobs, harmed our country's food supply, and led to local unemployment levels as high as 40 percent.  Today we have an opportunity to right these wrongs by passing the GROW Act, legislation that is supported by approximately 100 different cities, agriculture groups, water associations, irrigation districts, local chambers of commerce, and businesses throughout the country.  Most of the major provisions in this bill have been passed by this body numerous times. In fact, we have been working to enact similar legislation for nearly 5 years.  For example, title V includes Western Caucus member Tom McClintock's Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, an excellent bill that will streamline the permitting process for important water storage projects.  Title VI includes Western Caucus member Dan Newhouse's Bureau of Reclamation Water Project Streamlining Act, much-needed legislation that will result in increased storage of surface water.  Title VII includes Western Caucus Vice Chairman Tipton's Water Rights Protection Act, an essential bill that protects private water rights from Federal takings.  I strongly support these titles and the underlying bill. It is far past time that we put our communities, families, and America first.

I especially want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his work on the American Health Care Act and what that means to so many of our constituents to truly be able, after this rise of premiums where people are paying more to get less in healthcare, to really bring us to a moment where we can have patient-centered healthcare. I just want to thank him for that.  These are actually hopeful times for the American people. Regrettably, as we know, working America hasn't received a pay increase in almost a decade. Their savings have remained decimated since the financial crisis. So to get this economy moving again, our President knows, this Congress knows that, number one, we do have to return to patient-centered healthcare, not for what that means just to our families, but what it means to our economy.  We have to have fundamental tax reform as well, and I know that our House Ways and Means Committee is working on that assiduously, but we also have to have fundamental reform of our regulations. There is no regulation that has imposed more burden on our economy than the Dodd-Frank In fact, it is more burdensome to our economy than all Obama-era regulations combined. It is simply that bad.  When they passed this bill in the wake of the financial crisis, they told us that it would lift the economy. But instead of lifting the economy, we are mired in the slowest, weakest recovery in the postwar era.  They told us that it would end bank bailouts, but cynically, it codified them into law and backed it up with a taxpayer bailout fund.  They told us and they promised us it would make the economy more stable, but instead, the big banks have gotten bigger and the small banks have gotten fewer.  They told us and promised us it would help the consumer, but instead of helping the consumer, free checking at banks has been cut in half. Bank fees have increased. Has anybody within earshot tried to get a mortgage recently? They are harder to come by. They cost hundreds of more dollars to close. There are fewer credit card offerings.  What has happened here is, under Dodd-Frank, those who are seeking credit are now paying more and receiving less. This is hurting not only our families, but it has hurt our economy. Small business lending hasn't recovered, entrepreneurship is at a generational low.  So that is why it was so important that on Thursday of last week this body, this House, took action and passed the Financial CHOICE The Financial CHOICE Act represents, for all of America, economic opportunity for all, bank bailouts for none.  It replaces the era of bank bailouts with bankruptcy for these large financial institutions. It replaces Washington micromanagement with market discipline. That is how we help to grow this economy. It will create more credit for more people.  There is a whole part of this legislation that is totally devoted to our small banks and credit unions because it is our small community financial institutions that help finance our small businesses. It is our small businesses which are the job engine of That is what has been choked off by this heavy hand of Obama regulation.  So I was proud to play a very small role in the House to bring the Financial CHOICE Act to the House so that we can indeed, as the acronym suggests, create hope and opportunity for investors, for consumers, for entrepreneurs. We want the animal spirits in the American economy to move again. We want that budding optimism that tomorrow can be a better day, that you can be your own boss, that you can start your own small business. We want that opportunity to flourish yet again in That is what we managed to do with the Financial CHOICE  I am very happy that we have now sent it over to the We look forward to having the Senate act upon this.

I thank the chairman also for organizing, once again, an opportunity for us to speak directly to the American people, and for his tremendous leadership on the values that we conservatives hold very dear.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about a piece of legislation tonight that we plan to bring to the floor of the House this fall. The right to defend yourself doesn't end when you cross State lines, which is where my Concealed Reciprocity Act of 2017, also known as H.38, comes into play. We currently have 196 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle.  My bill simply provides law-abiding citizens the right to carry concealed and travel freely between States without worrying about conflicted concealed carry State codes or onerous civil suits.  As it stands, the patchwork of agreements is confusing for even the most cautious concealed-carry permit holder, and it has caused law-abiding citizens, like Shaneen Allen, a single mother from New Jersey, to unwittingly break the law and suffer arrest and detention.  Now, the Constitution's very clear. If you look at Article IV, section 1, it says: ``Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other . . . ''  That is why a driver's license is recognized in other That is why a marriage license is recognized in other That is why divorce proceedings are recognized in other States; in the same way the concealed-carry permit or the right to carry concealed should be recognized.  In the Senate, Senator John Cornyn introduced companion legislation. Senator Cornyn has long been a champion for our Second Amendment rights, and I am pleased to work with him as he continues his strong leadership on national concealed carry reciprocity.  I have already received a tremendous amount of support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who recognize our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. However, the left continues to spread misinformation and employ fear tactics about this bill, erroneously saying it will increase crime and arm criminals.  First of all, under this law, an individual who travels to a different State has to follow the laws of that In the same way with a driver's license, when you drive into another State, they recognize that you are a legal driver, but you have got to follow their laws.  Second, every single person who wants to buy a firearm still has to go through the Federal background check. My bill does nothing to change that.  Further, statistics have shown that violent crime has decreased as gun ownership and concealed-carry permits have increased. Since 1991, 25 States have adopted right-to-carry laws. The number of people with carry permits has risen to over 12 million people, and the Nation's violent crime rate has decreased 51 percent.  Also, if a criminal with malice intent wants to get a gun, I can guarantee you that he or she isn't worried about following the laws that are on the books. Unfortunately, we can't change that, but we can ensure that law-abiding citizens can legally carry concealed firearms to defend themselves.  As a shock to no one, big city liberal Michael Bloomberg has promised to spend $25 million to stop this legislation. He could spend all the money he wants, but our gun rights are not for sale.  With a groundswell of support from Americans across the country and a pro-Second Amendment President, we will make national concealed carry reciprocity a reality this More and more States are recognizing the rights of law-abiding citizens to carry a concealed handgun without permission from government, including two this year, bringing that total to 12.  In my home State of North Carolina, lawmakers in the House voted in favor of House bill 746 to make a concealed-carry permit no longer necessary in locations where it is currently permissible to openly carry a handgun. It is a commonsense bill. I am proud of the leadership of the folks in It just demonstrates that all across this country, the American people are recognizing that our right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  So I would just offer this very simple piece of legislation, following the Constitution that says a law-abiding citizen trying to do the right thing is not going to be criminalized because they have crossed an invisible line in the ground.  I am pleased to be here today to talk about it, and I am thankful for having this opportunity and support.  ",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgH4901-4.txt,2140,NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK,2017.0,13.0,July
8008,topic-id,865,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, so much for regular order. The bill before us today has not received a hearing in committee where witnesses could have testified about its effects. It has not gone through the markup process so that the committee of jurisdiction could actually debate and offer amendments to improve it.  Moreover, we are about to vote on a bill with several provisions that no one has ever seen before last Wednesday, aside from a small group of Republican offices and special interests that have been working on the bill.  Now, this closed-door process not only ignores the changing conditions of drought in California and how the State has already been adapting to meet water conservation needs, but it also ignores all of California's water provisions that were included, albeit at the last minute, in the WIIN Act last year, which is now Federal law.  There has been no discussion, no hearing, no way to know how the provisions of this bill that overlap with the enacted law will actually be implemented by the Trump administration. This is legislating blind, and it is a bad idea.  On some level, I do understand my Republican colleagues' fear of regular order on this bill. The more sunlight and public scrutiny that this bill gets, the uglier it looks. Make no mistake, if enacted, this bill will hurt a lot of people.  This bill takes water away from fishermen, from tribes, the environment, Delta farmers, and others in order to redistribute it primarily to a small group of some of the Nation's biggest and most politically connected agribusiness interests.  My Republican colleagues often talk about States' rights, yet this bill repeatedly overrides State laws over the objection of that I am talking, of course, about  A letter of opposition to H.23 recently came from Governor Jerry Brown, sent to the speaker of the house in the California Congressional Delegation attesting to this. Governor Brown writes: ``This bill overrides California water law, ignoring our State's prerogative to oversee our waters. Commandeering our laws for purposes defined in Washington is not right.''  This assault on California law and its values are why both California Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Kamala Harris oppose this bill as well.  Now, here are just a few examples of the sections in this bill that preempt State law. Section 108(d) begins with the words ``California law is preempted'' on page 21, paragraph 3. That section goes on to remove State protections for certain fisheries.  Section 113 of the bill preempts California law that requires the restoration of California's second longest river and that river's native salmon runs.  Section 108 of the bill tells the State of California that it is barred from managing the State's water in any way that would ``protect, enhance, or restore . . . any public trust value.'' In other words, the broader public interest can't be considered by the State when it is managing the water that belongs to the people of  Additionally, this bill eliminates existing fishery protections, which could put many of California's native fisheries and the thousands of jobs they support on a path to extinction. That means that this is more than just a California problem, because fishing communities in Oregon and Washington also depend on California salmon runs.  There was a recent UC Davis report that found that if present trends continue, many of California's salmon runs are on a path to extinction in the decades ahead. This bill would hasten that prediction into reality.  This is not just an environmental impact. It is a human one as well.

Congress could be supporting a range of modern water technologies like reuse, desalination, water use efficiency, storm water capture, and groundwater storage and remediation. These are the tools that have increased California's water supplies in recent years and are making our State more drought resilient, but this bill does none of that.  These are not controversial suggestions working on these modern water supply tools; in fact, it was the reclamation commissioner for President George Bush who described the water that we could tap through reuse as the next great river of the American[[Page H5505]]We should be focusing on those kind of noncontroversial consensus solutions.

8026,topic-id,753,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Responding briefly to a bit of hyperbole just now that somehow environmental laws have created a ``desert that produces nothing in California,'' we do need to remember the facts.  The truth is, even through this historic drought, farm employment rose statewide each year during the drought. The agricultural economy is thriving, and, thankfully, this year, even the most junior Federal contractors are enjoying a 100 percent allocation. They are fully realizing the vision of being the breadbasket of this country and the world. It is hardly a desert that produces nothing.  With that, I do need to contrast what has been happening on the other end of the system, many of the communities I represent, where fishing communities really do have nothing.  The California salmon season this year will be little or nothing. The Yurok Tribe that I represent that is dependent on fisheries, salmon fisheries in California since long before there was agriculture, will, for the second year in a row, close its Tribal fishery. We are seeing folks selling their boats. We are seeing fishing communities impacted in dramatic ways. There is real genuine hardship, much like what was just described by my friend. So the facts do matter.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Bakersfield, California (Mr.McCarthy), the majority leader.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his work when it comes to water in  Mr.Chairman, water is not optional, not in my district, not in California, not anywhere. But over the past 5 years, my constituents have struggled to survive without life-giving water in the face of a catastrophic drought.  This past winter, heavy rains and snowfall have brought much-needed relief. In fact, there was so much water this past winter we ran out of room to store it.  But we cannot always expect a year to bring monsoon-level rains and record snow. What happens if next year's rain and snowfall is average, or below average, or we have another drought? The Federal and State regulations that keep us from pumping and storing water will come back to haunt us.  The water bill passed by this body and signed into law last year was a downpayment on California's future. Today's legislation is another major investment in our State's future.  So let's look at pumping. There is no reason--absolutely no reason--we should prioritize potential benefit to fish over real benefits to families. This legislation increases delta pumping and will bring immediate relief to two-thirds of California south of the delta.  But a long-term solution demands more pumping. While California's population has doubled since the 1970s, we[[Page H5510]]haven't completed a single major storage project in that time.  Now, that is worth restating. While California's population has doubled since the 1970s, we have not completed a single major storage project in that time. How can California grow and thrive in the future if we depend on inadequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years ago?  Currently, five reservoir projects have been stalled in regulatory and red tape for decades. If these reservoirs alone are built, we could store between 1 to 1.5 million acre-feet of additional water in our So we need to build more storage as soon as possible.  Last year's water bill jumpstarted the process for building new reservoirs in California and the It was a bipartisan bill, with the vote being hundreds of votes out of the House, more than 70 in the  Today's legislation builds on that by requiring the Federal Government to finally finish the feasibility studies for the five storage projects in Then we reform the permitting process so other projects aren't held up for years trying to get approval from a dozen different agencies.  So I want to thank Congressman David Valadao for his hard work, his persistence on this issue. Ultimately, American citizens haven't gotten the water they need because their government was failing them. Last year's bill was the start to change all that. Today, we take another major step to bring our communities the water they contract and pay for.                              {time}  1730  Now, Mr.Chairman, you are going to hear a lot of people on this side of the aisle talk about the need from Unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle, it looks like you will just hear from one.

We just heard that there hasn't been a single major storage project in California since the 1970s. That is going to come as shocking news to the folks of the Metropolitan Water District which completed a huge storage project, Diamond Valley, during that period. It will certainly surprise the folks in Contra Costa, which completed Los Vaqueros without any special environmental shortcuts and with their own financing for the most part. It will surprise local water districts around the State, including my own Marin Municipal Water District, which completed two dam expansion projects in that same timeframe. It will surprise the folks at the current and semitropic groundwater banks that expanded significantly groundwater storage during that timeframe.

It is not a definition that I think is recognized anywhere else other than just now on this floor, but I appreciate it.  Mr.Chair, there are many problems with this bill, and I do want to urge my colleagues to oppose it. I can't keep track of the number of times the State of California has come up in our debate here these last several minutes. So let's look to the State of California and see what the State of California says about this bill.  The Governor of the State of California opposes it in a hard-hitting letter that went out to the California delegation and others just a few days ago. The new attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, wrote an equally critical letter opposing this bill. Both U.Senators from California oppose this bill.  It is going nowhere in the Senate and will not become law because of fundamental flaws that have been brought up each of the past several years that this bill has been introduced in this  It overrides California State sovereignty and State water laws in ways that are unacceptable to the people of California and to the government of So when we keep bringing up California, let's just be very clear that California doesn't want this bill. California opposes this bill.  Now, I represent the downstream end of some of these water systems that we are talking about. When we talk about people and fish and jobs, it is important to remember that fishing jobs matter, too. In the communities that I represent, and also communities throughout Oregon and Washington that depend on California salmon runs, they are hurting.  This summer we are going to probably see a closure, for all intents and purposes, of the commercial salmon season. We are certainly going to see a closure of the Yurok Tribal Salmon Fishery for the second year in a row. That is not only economically devastating to Tribal communities that I represent, it has an emotional impact as well. These are communities that are hurting. In fact, the Yurok are reporting suicide rates among young people that are alarmingly high. The closure of this sacred fishery that is their grocery store, that is a sacred part of their existence, is certainly not going to help, and I think could very well contribute to the very severe problems that they are experiencing.  Fishing jobs matter, the environment matters, downstream communities that depend on this water that would be redistributed and reallocated by Congress through this short-sighted bill, that all matters, too.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this wrong-headed bill, and I urge my colleagues across the aisle to do what we have been inviting them to do each of the past several years, and that is to reach across the aisle on bipartisan, commonsense water solutions. There is a lot that we could do together. Many of my colleagues served with me in the California State legislature. They know, because we did it together, that there is a different way. There is a better way.  We were able to pass landmark, bipartisan water legislation during our time together in Sacramento, and we did it because we didn't try to pick winners and losers. We found all sorts of low-hanging fruit and consensus solutions, and we came up with something that was supported across party lines, and in every region of the We can do that here, too, but we won't do it through this bill.  Mr.Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Abundance or shortage, that is the question. And I want to thank and salute Mr.Valadao for his work on this issue and for putting that choice so clearly before the House today.  It is true, we can choose to continue down this sad road that we have been on. That means increasingly severe government-induced shortages. It means higher and higher water and grocery prices and a permanently declining quality of life for our children who will be required to stretch and ration every drop of water in their bleak and parched homes.  With this bill, we choose a different future. We choose abundance. We choose a future in which water flows again to the fertile fields of the Central Valley, providing full employment for families and affordable groceries from America's agricultural cornucopia. It is a future in which families need not watch their gardens shrivel and die, and towns and cities need not fear mandatory water rationing and uncertain and unpredictable supplies.  It is a future in which long-established water rights are safe and secure from the whims of politicians and bureaucrats. We choose a future in which thriving populations of young salmon can swim to the sea unmolested by the non-native predators that now kill 90 percent of them before they reach the ocean; a future in which new fish hatcheries assure the release of millions of additional salmon to supply a revived and rapidly expanding commercial fishing industry.  We choose a future in which great new reservoirs can store vast amounts of water in wet years to assure abundance in dry ones; a future in which families can enjoy the prosperity that abundant water and hydroelectricity and affordable groceries provide, and the quality of life that comes from that prosperity.

We cannot allow Russia's hostile actions toward Western democracies to go unchecked. This legislation sends an important message to Russia and the world that the United States stands strongly against Russia's anti-democratic actions.  At the same time, the original version of the legislation would have had unintended consequences for our nation's civil and commercial space sectors. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, and commercial space missions are critical to space exploration, weather data, and sending U.astronauts to the International Space Station, as well as supplying them with cargo and instruments for scientific research. Under the original legislation, these missions would have been threatened or prevented from moving forward. In response, Senator Gardner introduced an amendment that would exempt NASA and commercial space-related launch activities from the sanctions bill. I was proud to cosponsor this amendment.  In addition to our defense assets, Virginia is at the epicenter of the Nation's civil space program and commercial space industry. For more than 70 years, NASA's Wallops Flight Facility has served as a key national asset to the U.space program, an economic driver for the Eastern Shore, and an invaluable benefit to the The Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at Wallops Island serves as a leader in commercial space, partnering with Virginia-headquartered Orbital ATK to launch critical cargo to the International Space Finally, research projects at NASA Langley Research Center and Virginia's superb academic institutions are developing tomorrow's innovative technologies and scientific discoveries. As Governor and now Senator, I have remained a strong supporter of Virginia's booming industry, research, and launch services. Without Senator Gardner's amendment, some of these activities in Virginia would cease to exist.  To be clear, I stand in agreement with my Senate colleagues on the issue of Russian sanctions. I also believe that our space program must transition to American-made rocket engines and parts, and I know that U.companies are working hard in conjunction with NASA toward that goal. But we need time for that transition to occur, and this important amendment would make it possible without hurting our current capabilities. In addition, while the Department of Defense has been afforded the opportunity to develop new technologies while maintaining the status quo, it is only fair that we provide the same chance to civil and commercial space entities.  For these reasons, I was proud to cosponsor Senator Gardner's bipartisan amendment to 722. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to enhance and expand our Nation's space program.

8125,topic-id,1261,"Mr.President, four years ago, a narrow majority of the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. That 5 to 4 decision crippled the Federal government's ability to protect minority, elderly, and disadvantaged voters across the country. The impact of this disastrous ruling has been even worse than imagined.  Before the ink even dried on the Court's opinion, Republican officials in several States rushed to enact laws making it harder for minorities to vote. Prior to Shelby County, the Federal government had the ability to prevent racial discriminatory voting changes from taking effect before those changes occur. Proposed laws and new voting procedures would first have been reviewed by the Federal courts or the Department of Justice to ensure that voting rights would not be harmed if the changes went into effect. But without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act after Shelby County, discriminatory laws quickly passed Republican legislatures in several  Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion in Shelby County noted several[[Page S3734]]times that the protections of the Voting Rights Act are no longer appropriate because our ``Country has changed.'' It is true that our Nation has changed--we have made progress. But there is no question that the scourge of racial discrimination still exists. There are still those within our society intent on suppressing the right to vote and keeping minorities from exercising their constitutional right to participate in our democracy. Since the Shelby County ruling--and now emboldened by the Trump Administration--these forces are more concerning than they have been in decades.  Unfortunately, what has transpired in the aftermath of the Shelby County decision makes the need for the full protections of the Voting Rights Act unmistakably clear. Voter suppression efforts have found renewed life in numerous jurisdictions across the country. Thankfully, in some cases the courts have been able to provide a backstop. Based on strong evidence that hundreds of thousands of minority voters have been disproportionately prevented or discouraged from voting by Republican-enacted voting restrictions, Federal courts have blocked or rolled back many of these laws. Importantly, Federal courts have repeatedly found that these States enacted laws with the intention to discriminate.  Just last month, the Supreme Court left in place the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that blocked North Carolina's harsh voting restrictions, including a strict photo identification law. The Fourth Circuit concluded that the Republican legislature had passed the law with the intent to racially discriminate against African Americans, and found that ``the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision.''  In April of this year, Federal district court ruled for a second time that Texas's photo ID law was enacted with the intent to racially discriminate and had a racially discriminatory effect on Hispanic and Black voters. This ruling came after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed that the Texas law should be struck down because of its discriminatory effect on minority voters. But just weeks ago, the Republican-led Texas legislature and Governor enacted a new law in an attempt to escape the court's rulings.  Federal courts in Kansas and North Dakota have also acted as a bulwark against attempts by Republican officials to disenfranchise minority voters. In Kansas; courts have issued rulings rejecting repeated attempts by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach from making voter registration more difficult. In North Dakota, a Federal district court held that the State's strict photo ID law disproportionately burdened Native Americans and blocked its implementation in the 2016 election.  These decisions are only the tip of the iceberg of what has transpired since Shelby While our courts are acting to guard against attempts to block minorities from accessing the ballot box, each of these cases requires years of litigation, money, and resources. And these are just the voting changes Republicans are enacting at the State level. Many of the efforts at the local level have gone unnoticed but have equally devastating effects on the voting rights of minorities.  The original Voting Rights Act would have prevented many of these discriminatory laws. But the Supreme Court's decision has taken this country back to an era before the Civil Rights movement--a bad time in our history where some states openly discriminated against minority voters. We are constantly reminded how costly the fight for voting and civil rights has been in this country. Just yesterday, we marked the 53rd anniversary of three civil rights activists who were killed in Mississippi for registering minorities to vote. James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman gave their lives in 1964 when they were murdered while fighting in Mississippi for racial equality and free access to the ballot box. Their example, and the example of generations of civil rights activists who gave their sweat, blood, and sometimes their lives must inspire us and drive us to do more. It is now imperative for us to do everything in our power to correct the Shelby County decision and reinstate the full protections of the Voting Rights Act for the next generation.  The legislation I am introducing today would restore and update the Voting Rights The Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2017 not only modernizes the Voting Rights Act in response to Shelby County, it also modernizes the law to provide tools to combat current forms of voter discrimination. This bill responds to calls from community leaders and grassroots activists working in communities whose voting rights have been threatened or suppressed. It responds to voting rights experts and civil rights leader who have called for strong legislation to counter the voter intimidation and patently discriminatory efforts that were unleashed after the Shelby County ruling.  I am proud to introduce this bill with forty-six original cosponsors, nearly every single member of the Democratic caucus. I am also proud to be joined by Senator Durbin, who worked with me to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in 2006. In addition, the House of Representatives is today introducing a companion bill led by Congresswoman Terri Sewell, Congresswoman Judy Chu, Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham, my friend Congressman John Lewis, and over 175 members of the House Democratic caucus.  We are all joining together to introduce this bill today because we will not let systematic and persistent efforts to suppress Americans' right to vote go unchecked. We will not stand idly by while this country reverts to a bygone era where it was acceptable to disenfranchise our own citizens because they were Black, Hispanic, or disadvantaged. These unconstitutional and discriminatory efforts deserve a strong response.  Protecting Americans' constitutional right to vote is not a partisan exercise. The original enactment and every reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act has always been bipartisan. When we last reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006, I worked closely with the Republican chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees--former Senator Arlen Specter and Representative Jim And past reauthorizations of the Voting Rights Act have been signed into law by Republican presidents.  But now, the Republican majority--in both the House and the Senate--refuses to protect the right to vote, restore the Voting Rights Act, or address other critical civil rights issues. Since the Shelby County decision, Republicans at every level of our government have acted to make it harder to vote. This has become the legacy of today's Republican They should think seriously about reversing course, rather than trying to reverse the gains we have made in history. One significant step would be to join with us to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore the historic and critically-needed protections of this landmark civil rights law.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgS3733.txt,1383,GAINING RESPONSIBILITY ON WATER ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,July

Now, in the Sacramento region, where I now represent, we have tried to take a balanced approach, working to protect the environment while providing water for our farms and our cities.  It is misleading to claim that H.23 will solve our drought problems. This legislation only prioritizes certain regions or industries instead of taking the comprehensive approach we need.  And by giving the Federal Government power to dictate the best uses of the State's water, H.23 sets a disastrous precedent for other States across the country that should raise alarm on both sides of the aisle.  The bill we are discussing today undermines a State's autonomy. Ultimately, I am concerned that this bill will weaken environmental protections for the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta, and harm our State's ability to manage its own water.  That is why I join my district and the State of California in strongly opposing this bill. We cannot afford to[[Page H5507]]give up California's right to control its own water future. We must focus on an all-of-the-above strategy that puts us on the path to a sustainable water supply while protecting our environment.

8078,topic-id,495,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize Alaska's one and only professional sports team and an organization that has become part of the fabric that makes up the Alaskan society, the Alaska  The team started as a small semi-professional hockey team in the late eighties known as the Anchorage Aces, but quickly gained the support and popularity of the community and rose through the ranks to become a professional hockey organization in 1995. In 2003, after becoming the Alaska Aces, the team joined the East Coast Hockey League and almost immediately became one of the league's powerhouses, winning three ECHL Kelly Cups in 2006, 2011, and most recently 2014.  The Aces have produced some of the biggest Alaskan professional athletes such as Scotty Gomez, who went on to win two Stanley Cups and became an NHL All-Star on multiple occasions, and Eagle River's Brian Swanson, whose hockey career took him to the National Hockey League, Europe, and finally back home to the Aces before he retired in 2012.  As good as the team has become, it is their dedication to the community that made them a staple with multiple generations of Whether it was their ``Skate with the Aces'' events in which families could skate with the players and get to know them after home games or the ever-popular military appreciation games, this organization has made a lasting impact on the lives of many hockey players and fans alike.  The Aces are full of fond memories and traditions such as the cowbell crew, which is the name given to its enthusiastic fan section. Then there is Bobby Hill, also known as ``The Horseman,'' who is not only the Alaska Aces superfan in charge of keeping the energy alive at every home game by going up and down the length of the ice riding a hockey stick, but is also a Special Olympics Gold medalist.  The Alaska Aces will be dearly missed in what is certainly an unfortunate end for such a storied franchise. Economic times have taken a hit on many sectors of the Alaskan economy, and we have seen the impact with our sporting events, but Alaskans are resilient and our sports teams and athletes are no different. Hockey has a rich history in Alaska and is culturally ingrained in the fabric of our Alaska has over 45 hockey associations, reflecting the passion and involvement shared by Alaskans of all ages. It is this passion and dedication to the sport that will surely keep the spirit and memory of our Alaska Aces alive.  I want to commend the leadership of the team's owners, the dedication of its fans and players, and the community for making the Alaska Aces one of the league's best franchises and perennial contenders for the ECHL Kelly Cup every season. The Aces play their very last game on April 8, 2017; however, the memories that countless Alaskans have with our hockey team will not fade, but will last a lifetime.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgS2613-2.txt,1694,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,June

8107,topic-id,1053,"Mr.President, I thank Senator  Indeed, this is an example of the Senate working together. There is, simply, a problem in the bill that was passed.[[Page S3509]]It is a technical problem, but it goes to the heart of our military-civilian space program. It goes to the heart of the cooperation that we have had with Russia that goes back to the Soviet Union days when, in fact, in 1975, in the middle of the Cold War, a crew from America rendezvoused and docked with the crew from the Soviet Ever since that crew, which was led by Tom Stafford, of the United States, and General Alexey Leonov, of the Soviet Union, we have had cooperation in space, and that program continues today on the International Space  Before I get into talking about the details of the amendment, as Senator Gardner has discussed so well already, I hope that the Senate will treat it as technical in nature because it corrects what was not intended. Unless corrected, it will be disastrous not only for NASA but for all of the burgeoning commercial space industry, which we are bringing back to What has happened over the last four decades, in the meantime, is that a lot of that commercial space industry has flown the coop to other launchers from other nations. But it is coming back to America.prayers for the Victims of the Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting  Mr.President, before I get into the substance, I just want to speak with regard to the terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday and of my feelings about this violence that has occurred. I don't know whether it has occurred because of the excessive rhetoric and the sharpness and the fact that politics has become a blood sport, but we are so divided.  This is what I want to say. We are Americans first, regardless of party. In times of threat, we come together. We are all on the same team.  This Senator has prayed, as I know others have, for the complete recovery of all of those who were wounded yesterday, two of whom were apparently grievously wounded. We pray for their full recovery. It was a heinous attack. Let's come together in bipartisanship.                     Amendment 250, as Modified  Mr.President, right here is an example of coming together. Recognizing there is a technical problem, we are coming together to fix that problem. Let's do this in the spirit of what Americans do. We are Americans first.  I am obviously here, as I demonstrated in my vote yesterday, for the Iran sanctions bill, as well as the Russia sanctions amendment, which we adopted yesterday. Both were bipartisan efforts. I wish to thank our colleagues, especially the members of the Banking and Foreign Relations  This Senator is a cosponsor of the sanctions bill which addresses Iran's support for terrorism, ballistic missile activity, and human rights violations--these destabilizing activities--and this bill strengthens the hand of the United States in countering These are destabilizing activities separate and apart from the Iran nuclear agreement, and to date, the United States has the evidence that they have complied with the Iran nuclear agreement.  At the same time, we are facing an aggressive Vladimir The Russia bill which we debated yesterday and which will come to final passage shortly strengthens our hand against Putin's The U.intelligence community has already made clear that Putin attempted to interfere in our election. Let me tell my colleagues, that didn't stop with the past election. It is continuing. And we better be ready for it next year in the 2018 elections because Putin and the GRU have done all the groundwork. But that is nothing new because he had done it in elections before in Europe, and he has been doing it in elections right now, as we saw in It boomeranged on him, thank goodness. We will see an attempt on the upcoming German elections.  The intelligence community has made it very clear--the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee is here--that Putin and the GRU are likely to do this again. That is why I say beware. They have laid the groundwork for next year's elections to try to interfere. Putin's influence campaign struck at the very core of our democracy and simply must not be permitted to do it again.  Now is not the time to cozy up to Russia; rather, the United States must redouble our cyber defenses and our cyber offenses to deter him, to make him feel enough pain so that he won't do it again. The sanctions we will adopt today are tough. We need this, but we need more.  Shortly, we are going to vote on the amendment Senator Gardner has explained. Interestingly, in all of this angst and conflict with Russia, we get along with Russia in the civilian and commercial space program. We have had peaceful cooperation in outer space ever since what I told my colleagues about; that is, since 1975, in the middle of the Cold War, the rendezvous and docking and living together in space for 9 days, a Soviet crew and an American crew. That has been the central theme of our space program since that time. The shining example of that now is the cooperation in the International Space Station, the football field-sized--it is 120 yards long; think one goalpost to another. People don't have any idea of how big it is on orbit. It circles the Earth every 90 minutes.  We have been working in space together with many nations but especially our partner the Russians for over 16 years. So the peaceful cooperation in space has been good for business. It has been good for jobs in And we are working to grow our share of an over $300 billion global space economy.  That is what this amendment is about. It is about fixing the question on the purchase of those RD-180 engines, the Russian engine that is used in the Atlas V, that is used not only for defense launches but for commercial launches and will be one of the two rockets launching American astronauts within a year and a half to and from the International Space  So this amendment is for the benefit of our economy, as well as the betterment of our civilization.

8009,topic-id,751,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Mr.McClintock for yielding me the time and for his kind words.  Mr.Chairman, I am not going to respond to the other side of the aisle because some things that are said on this floor are so ridiculous that they don't deserve a response. So I just want to talk today, Mr.Chairman, about the facts that we face in the San Joaquin  So in the southern and central San Joaquin Valley, we have about 3 million acres of farm ground, land that is the most fertile farmland in the world--not just in the United States, in the world. We are in danger of losing about a third of that farmland largely because the leftwing government in California has overreached so far that they are now taking away people's private property rights.  So I want to talk first about our water shortage. So this is the shortage of water that we have in the valley. So it is about 2.6 million acre feet are what we need on average to farm all of the land that we have historically farmed in our area.  Now, these are farms that provide food for not only the people of the United States and all over the world but also for the families that work on these farms.  So we hear a lot about drought, and we have had supposedly a severe drought, and it was no question a severe drought, but what the left continues to not want to talk about is all the water that gets dumped out into the ocean every year. So just from October of last year to just a couple days ago, 46 million acre feet of water have gone out to the ocean. So if you go back to the chart I just had, we are only short 2.6 million acre feet. So of the water that has flown into the delta in the middle of California, 92 percent of that water has gone out to the ocean, and it has been wasted.  Now, some on the other side of the aisle, they continually talk about global warming, and they continually talk about how the oceans are rising. Well, if you believe the oceans are rising, why would you want more water to flow out into the ocean? I don't understand that.  So this is about a million acres of farmland that is going to come out of production if we don't do anything about it. About 1 million acres over the next decade will begin to come out of production. In fact, some this year is already out of production because none of the water was moved early enough so that it could get to farms in time.  So even though we have flooding--so this picture was taken just a couple days ago--this is water spilling over the top of the dam that is going to go all the way out into the ocean and be wasted, for an ocean that supposedly is rising because of global warming. So this is happening because, as Mr.McClintock said, we are not building water storage projects.  So what this bill does is it reverts back to what the Founding Fathers of our State built, mostly Democrats, by the way. It was Democrats working with the Republicans who built this water system in So if we take the existing water system that we have, we add to that four or five facilities, like Mr.McClintock is talking about, all the land gets farmed, all the species get saved, everybody goes to work.  What you will not hear from the left, and this is very disturbing, I only picked the least disturbing of all the pictures, but I think it is important for people here in Washington and all over the United States to understand this, this is just one family of many of thousands of families where their homes actually ran out of water. So this picture is not from Africa, it is not from somewhere in Southeast This is a picture from my area, from my district, from the central and southern San Joaquin These are people who are out of water.  So the left always talks about wanting to protect people, wanting people to be able to work, yet we have people with no water in their homes, and yet they are willing to see 92 percent of the water flush right out by the Golden Gate Bridge and be wasted for an ocean that supposedly is filling up.

After all, there is a reason that the United States House of Representatives is often called the people's It is because our job is to fight for the priorities of the people that we are privileged to represent here.  Over the past 6 months, Republicans have been fighting for the people, fighting to fundamentally change Washington and to return power to the American people where it really belongs.  We have been doing this against a strong headwind of obstructionists, sometimes from colleagues across the aisle, sometimes from certain in the media more interested in a liberal agenda than in accurate reporting, and sometimes from embedded bureaucrats and special interests within the government industrial complex who really don't want to see the Washington swamp drained. But in spite of that, we are succeeding.                              {time}  1700  And while many of these conservative winds have gone unreported and, therefore, flown under the radar, the truth is that we are indeed steering the ship in the right direction, we are steadily undoing the damage done by out-of-touch policies by the Obama administration.  Case in point is a fact that has not garnered a lot of headlines, but should have, something that Congressman Walker pointed out earlier: the fact that in the first 100 days of this 115th Congress, we have passed more bills--158 to be exact--than were passed during the first 100 days of any and all of the four prior administrations: the Obama, Bush, Clinton, and H.Bush administrations. And as proof of our productivity, we have signed more of those bills into law than in any of the other administrations' first 100 days as well.  But it is not just the quantity of the bills that we are turning into laws. It is about the quality and the substance. We are passing legislation that is making government smaller. We are passing legislation that is making government less costly. We are passing legislation that is making the government finally more accountable to the people.

Today we have seen pictures, horrible pictures of some of the best agricultural land in the world that has been totally destroyed by the policies of people who are now claiming that they like the environment too much and that that should have, perhaps, something more to do with their decisionmaking than what benefits people. Well, what happened is we have turned one of the most productive food-producing areas of the world into a catastrophe, a desert that produces nothing.  And who has been in charge of this? Who has been in charge of seeing this total destruction of what could be a garden for the people of the world? It has been, yes, the Obama administration appointees for the last year and, yes, in California, where we have had a leftwing liberal Democratic administration appointing radical environmentalists the same way Obama appointed radical environmentalists to determine policy.  And what does that mean to us? It means there is less food being produced. It means we have turned productive land into a horrible desert that even animals can't exist upon.  No, it makes a lot of sense right now. What makes sense is that now we have gone through this drought and seen this destruction that didn't need to happen. What we need to do is build dams. What we need to do is to make sure that the water that we now have is being stored properly so that the people of our State don't suffer, so that wealth that can be grown from the land in central California, which used to be the world's breadbasket, that that wealth doesn't just disappear from the face of the planet.  No, you can't really love nature unless you also love people, and right now the people of California deserve to have some planning done about storing water when we have it rather than suffering and having this type of destruction during our droughts.

8089,topic-id,896,"Mr.President, I join the majority leader in welcoming everybody back to the Senate after the 2-week recess. We have a lot of business to attend to this week. Most importantly, we have to pass a spending bill to keep the government open.  So far, the discussions between our two sides have been constructive and are progressing nicely. Without interference, I believe our two parties can come together on an agreement by the end of the week. The four-corner negotiations--that is Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, and I--have been going very well, and a monkey wrench was thrown into them.  I will caution: If the administration insists on poison pill riders or extraneous funding requests, then our talks could get sidetracked, particularly if the administration demands funding for a border wall.  Democrats have been long clear that the border wall is a nonstarter. More than a month ago, here on the floor, from this desk, I warned against including funding for the border wall in any must-pass government spending bill. If the administration insists on funding for a wall in this bill, it will endanger the prospects of a bill's passing and raise the prospects of a government shutdown because a border wall, we believe, is a pointless waste of taxpayer money for several reasons.  First, President Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, not American taxpayers. The idea that President Trump is fulfilling a campaign promise when he says that America will pay for the wall now and Mexico will pay it back later is untrue. He will only fulfill his campaign promise if he gets Mexico to pay for the wall now. That is 1.  Second, the Trump administration has not shown us any specific plans about how and where the wall will be built. How high will it be? How much will it cost? Where along the Rio Grande River will it be built? The President's own Secretary of the Interior, Mr.Zinke, said:       The border is complicated, as far as building a physical      wall . . . the Rio Grande, what side of the river are you      going to put the wall? We're not going to put it on our side      and cede the river to And we're probably not going to      put it in the middle of the river.  Zinke said it well: How, where, when, and how many dollars is this wall going to cost? Before rushing into it, we ought to see some real plans, not just talk.  Third, the cost of the wall is staggering. Some estimates peg it as high as $50 billion. That money could be spent a lot better elsewhere on things like infrastructure and education. For example, with $50 billion, we could connect more than 98 percent of Americans to high-speed internet, more than double the Federal funding for roads and bridges across our country, and update every VA building listed in the VA's long-range strategic capital plan. The money would be better spent elsewhere.  Fourth, there are much better ways to protect our borders--with drones, fences, and other more cost-effective measures. The President said the wall is needed to stop the flow of drugs, but drugs come into our country in several ways, including by water, through tunnels, and snuck in by cars and trucks. We have all seen the pictures on TV where they hide them in the carburetor of the car, and no one finds them.  A huge, expensive wall will still have to have border crossings for vehicles. A huge, expensive wall could still have tunnels dug beneath it. In reality, a combination of drones and fencing and other more sophisticated means would be a much more effective way to secure the border.  Fifth, in order to build the wall, the President--the Federal Government--would need to take private land, using eminent domain from thousands of law-abiding Much of the[[Page S2475]]land on the border is privately owned. It is not owned by the Federal Eminent domain? A lot of people on that side of the aisle don't like it, and we all know it would take a very long time to get it done.  For those reasons, it is not just Democrats who oppose the wall, many Republicans oppose the wall. According to a Wall Street Journal survey: ``Not a single member of Congress who represents the territory on the southwest border said they support President Trump's request for $1.4 billion to begin construction of his promised wall.'' That includes my friends Senators Cornyn, Cruz, McCain, and  For the very same reasons, the American people don't support the idea of a border wall by almost a 2-to-1 margin. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that 64 percent of Americans oppose a wall on the border with Mexico, versus only 33 percent who favor it, and that poll didn't even include the fact that Mexico would not be paying for it under the President's plan.  Now, I say to my colleagues and to President Trump, we Democrats don't mind having a debate on the wall in regular order. We don't think it would pass, given the amount of opposition on both sides, but certainly a proposal with as many flaws as this one shouldn't be the thing the administration uses to hold the government hostage and certainly shouldn't be pushed through without debate, without regular order, without answers to these questions.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-24-pt1-PgS2474-5.txt,1036,GAINING RESPONSIBILITY ON WATER ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,July

Thoughts and Prayers for the Victims of the Congressional Baseball                            Practice Shooting  Mr.President, we are still all a bit shaken by the horrors of yesterday's shooting. It was a senseless act of violence, made even more chilling by the circumstances at a baseball practice for a bipartisan charity event. I understand that Representative Scalise is still in critical condition following surgery last night. When we hear the word ``critical'' attached to his condition, it sends shivers down our spines. We hope and pray for a quick and full recovery. I know that all of his House colleagues are wishing him well right now, and I want him to know his friends in the Senate do as well.  The same goes for the other four who were injured in the attack, including two members of our Capitol Police Our thoughts and prayers go with them as well. We remain grateful for their service and bravery and for the service and bravery of all of our Capitol police officers. Their presence at the field yesterday--the presence of those two Capitol police officers at the field yesterday prevented a bad situation from getting worse and undoubtedly saved lives. Had the two brave police officers not acted or if they had not been there, it might well have been a massacre.  We would all be wise to reflect on the importance of civility in our Nation's politics this morning. We disagree vehemently at times in Congress and folks out in the country do, too, but the level of nastiness, vitriol, and hate that has seeped into our politics must be excised. Let us all strive at all times--whatever our disagreements--to respect those who disagree with us, to seek a greater understanding of them, to walk in their moccasins--as Native Americans have always said. Let us strive always to conduct our politics with civility.  I was heartened to hear that the congressional baseball game will still be played this evening. Let it be a symbol that hate and violence do not cast too long or too great a shadow, that we can and will come together this evening, and the game will go on. I will be going to the game with the three congressional leaders as a show of solidarity.  Mr.President, last evening, the Senate showed it can come together. Last night, we voted, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion, to strengthen a package of sanctions against It was the product of diligent weeks of bipartisan negotiations. I saw the Senator from Maryland behind me a few minutes ago. He deserves lots of credit, as do the Senators from Ohio, Tennessee, and The final result is a very good one for our country because yesterday the U.Senate said to Mr.Putin, in no uncertain terms, that when he violates international norms and interferes with our election, he will not escape reproach.  Not only did we pass a new round of tough sanctions for Russia's meddling in our election, we codified existing sanctions into law, making them harder to lift, and we moved to make the Congress--not the President--the final arbiter of sanctions relief when necessary. Any ideas of the President that he can lift sanctions on his own, for any reason, are dashed by this legislation.  The House of Representatives should take notice that 97 Senators voted in favor of this package. I hope Leader Ryan will move with the same haste to pass this package of sanctions through the I hope the President will sign it. The months-long effort to forge bipartisan consensus on Russia sanctions--an issue that gets to the vital interests of our country, the wellspring of our democracy--gives me hope that Democrats and Republicans can come together and work together on a number of big issues this year.  There are several issues coming before this body soon where we can come together: another budget--passing another budget; reauthorizing flood insurance and children's health insurance; raising the debt ceiling. Each of those issues will, by definition, demand bipartisan effort.  A lesson that all of us have learned here in the Senate is that legislation is made better and much more likely to pass when both parties are involved in crafting it.  I have noticed the media has been questioning all morning why Congress isn't more bipartisan. We should be. But when the Russia sanctions agreement passes and the budget deal passes, both major bipartisan efforts, they are proof that we can get things done together. If those agreements were given a little more recognition by the media--the fact that we can at times, at least, work in a bipartisan way--that would help. For too many of us on both sides of the aisle, it seems as though when there is divisiveness, it gets far more attention in the media than when there is comity between the parties.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, finally, I would suggest to my colleagues that the most immediate place where we can translate the rhetoric calling for us to come together into reality is on healthcare. A goal many of us share on both sides of the aisle is to improve the law, bring costs down for consumers, stabilize the marketplace, and make it easier for older Americans to afford the ever-rising out-of-pocket costs of prescription drugs.  I would conclude by stating that we can make the rhetoric of bipartisanship not empty by both parties coming together and working together on healthcare. We have shown thus far in this Congress with the passage of the budget and Russia sanctions that significant legislation can best be served by bipartisanship. Opening up the process and having us all come together on healthcare would be a very good, concrete reaffirmation of bipartisanship and would translate the rhetoric--not bad at all--that we have heard here today into reality.  In conclusion, the rhetoric about bipartisanship can be strengthened. Hopefully healthcare is a place where we can strengthen it, by opening up the process, having hearings, and having open discussion.

Over many decades, Federal attempts to manipulate Federal permit, lease, and land management process to circumvent long-established State water law and hijack privately held water rights have sounded the alarm for all non-Federal water users that rely on these water rights for their livelihood.  The Federal Government's overreach and infringement on private property rights that led to the introduction of this original bill in the 113th Congress involved the U.Forest Service's attempt to require the transfer of privately held water rights to the Federal Government as a permit condition on National Forest System lands. With this permit condition, there is no compensation for the transfer of these privately held rights.  This Forest Service permit condition has already hurt a number of stakeholders in my home State of Colorado, including Powderhorn Ski Area in Grand Junction and the Breckenridge Ski The same nefarious tactic has been used in Utah, Nevada, and other Western States, where agencies have required the surrender of possession of water rights in exchange for approving the conditional use of grazing allotments. This Federal water grab has broad implications that have begun to extend beyond the recreation and the farming and ranching community and are now threatening municipalities and other businesses.[[Page H5509]]  In 2014, the Forest Service proposed a groundwater directive that would have expanded the agency's reach over groundwater and established new bureaucratic hurdles to interfere with private water users' ability to be able to access their water.

8011,topic-id,920,"Mr.Chairman, the first slide that I wanted to present here is one that I think is very important when we talk about water going out into the ocean.  The first bar there, the dark blue one, is how much water was flowing through the estuary this past year.  The second bar is actually a little bit of an exaggeration. If we took every[[Page H5506]]single reservoir that we propose in this bill, multiplied it by ten--ten times the amount of storage that we are proposing--we still wouldn't use all that water. There would still be quite a bit of water flowing out into the ocean. So multiply every single project times ten, and we still don't use up all the water.  So there was a lot of water wasted this year alone that we had the opportunity to capture if this bill had been presented earlier or passed into law, and we had the opportunity to actually make a difference.  Why does that make a difference to so many folks? It makes a difference because the Central Valley is very important to the country. We feed the When you look at all the different commodities, and this is just a small sample, we produce over 400 different commodities, and a lot of these, a big majority, some of them as much as 99 percent of the different commodities that go through.  So everyone sitting at home around the country should pay attention, because this affects their food supply. Even here in the Capitol, when you make yourself a salad at the salad bar, those salads, all those different products are produced mostly in the Central Valley, and so that is why this legislation is so important.  The reason why it is important to my farmers to get this done, even in a year like this, where we had a 200 percent rainfall, with the amount of water that was flowing through that was, again, in my opinion, wasted, they didn't find out until it was too late. Planning decisions need to be made over at the beginning of this when the rain is coming down and they know that the water is there, not in March or in April, because the opportunity has passed.  Farmers are very optimistic people. They put stuff in the ground, cover it with dirt, and hope that it will grow so they can feed the world, but having them wait until April to make those decisions to plant those commodities and create those jobs is just way too late.  Now, this is the one that I think is the most important. This is Mendota, This is a farm worker. This is what happens when we allow water to flow out into the ocean that is wasted. People are living in shantytowns. These are people who want to work and people who want to feed the world, people who want to provide for their own families, and not wait for a check from the government. They just want to know when they are getting their water so that they can start to produce crops and feed the world, but this, because of the policies through Washington, D.C., is what we end up with.

8108,topic-id,1673,"Mr.President, first of all, I wish to thank my friend, the Senator from Florida, for his comments. There is no one in this body who is more familiar with and more knowledgeable about our space programs than is Senator  I also want to associate myself with two comments he made. 1, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I echo what he said about the very real, tangible threat the Russians, their spy agencies, and their agents pose to not just our democratic process but--as the Senator from Florida has outlined, not only did they attack us in 2016, they attacked the Dutch, which is why they had to hand-count their ballots, and they attacked the French, and Facebook took down 30,000 Facebook accounts because of fear of Russian manipulation. They will attack the  One of the things that is so concerning to me is that if you add up the amount of disruption the Russians have caused in Western societies at large without firing a shot or shooting a missile--and all that for less than 5 percent of the cost of an aircraft carrier--it is a pretty good return.  Our country needs to be strong against Russia, and I support the Russia sanctions, but I also support, as the Senator has indicated, a really critical part--that we continue our space program. I stand here to join with Senator Nelson and my good friend, the Senator from Colorado, Mr.Gardner, in support of this amendment 250, which will allow civilian agencies to continue to launch crucial science, civil, and commercial space missions and which will continue to support NOAA and NASA, which depend upon their research.  Without this amendment--and I think this is an amendment that corrects a mistake in the original bill--billions of dollars and years of planning that have gone into missions like, as the Senator mentioned, the International Space Station, commercial cargo, Mars 2020, and the Joint Polar Satellite System, just wouldn't be possible. In many ways, without this amendment, we could even become more dependent upon Russian technology.  Again, as the Senator mentioned, I think the overwhelming majority of this body is very supportive of sanctions against We are very supportive, and I appreciate the opportunity to add stronger sanctions against Russia and sanctions that this[[Page S3510]]President cannot arbitrarily withdraw. But we have to make sure that in this bill we don't do unintentional harm to our space interests--space interests that I know are in Colorado and Florida and my home State of Virginia, where we have a flight facility at NASA Wallops, which is over on our Eastern Shore, where we launch both NASA and commercial satellites.  We have one of America's leading commercial and military companies, Orbital ATK, which is headquartered in Virginia and launches the Antares rocket from The fact is, without this amendment, Orbital ATK would be prevented from buying the Russian RD-181 engines for its Antares rockets. That will do nothing to help America's space mission. The fact is, without those engines, Orbital would not be able to fulfill a $1.2 billion contract for launching from  Quite simply, as the Senator indicated and I am repeating, this amendment is broadly bipartisan. My friend Senator Gardner and I chair the Cyber The amendment is supported by our leading expert in the Senate on space, Senator Nelson, as well as Senator Shelby and Senator Bennet and a host of others. I imagine the Presiding Officer is also a supporter of this. The amendment would simply provide civil and commercial space parity with the defense industry, for which an exemption has already been provided. It is in the interests of defense and civil space to continue the current status quo in order to maintain a competitive environment until a domestic capability has been developed.  Let me be clear. I think it is important that over a very short time, we get away from purchasing Russian rockets, but we need that transition period, and the transition period the chairman of the Armed Services Committee laid out on the defense side ought to be extended as well on the commercial side.  So a ``yes'' vote on amendment 250 will support continued access to space for NASA, as well as for those equally important commercial space missions. One of the things that I feel is so important about the commercial space missions is that we have to have that competition, candidly, with NASA and to push our defense industry if we are going to bring down space costs. To put a dagger in the heart of our commercial space industry as it has been slowly evolving would be a grave mistake.  I have taken on this issue on the intelligence side as I have tried to get smarter on the whole question of our overhead capabilities. The amount of dollars that we spend and the lack of competitiveness that we have in terms of some of our more traditional government-purchased space assets are both a waste of taxpayer dollars, and, candidly, we have an architecture overhead that is not modern enough to recognize the threats that Russians, Chinese, and others pose in terms of the ability to jam our satellites and use laser beams and other things. In a sense, in many ways, it is almost as if our defense and the intelligence community, on overhead architecture--nobody ever saw a James Bond movie. We built these large, bulky platforms in the sky with the assumption that America would always dominate space. That dominance--it is unfortunate because our adversary changes, it is coming to an end, and we need the competition from the commercial industry, quite honestly, to push the IC and push the defense toward smaller, more resilient, and more flexible platforms.  While I share the desire of the chairman of the Arms Services Committee to get us off this Russian hardware, we do need this transition. I think the amendment that has been put forward by the Senator from Colorado provides that transition, led by the transition that was laid out on defense. I believe commercial space needs that same type of transition.  I hope the amendment will pass. I look forward to our continued bipartisan support of both NASA and commercial space and obviously our defense assets and IC assets as well.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, the Russian sanctions amendment passed by this body 97 to 2 last year--I take it the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Virginia were here at the time; it was one person who was not--was negotiated between Senators of both parties on multiple committees, including Foreign Relations, Banking, and Armed It was specifically designed to impose tough sanctions on Russian defense and intelligence sectors, to impose tough sanctions on the Russian military industrial complex and intelligence agencies that have made it possible for Russia to invade Ukraine, annex Crimea, terrorize Syria, threaten our NATO allies, and attack America's election in 2016. Have no doubt about what this amendment is, my dear colleagues and friends. It is a giveaway to the Russian military industrial complex.  There has always been a collection of lawmakers, executives, and lobbyists who have accepted continuing, even deepening, our Nation's dependence on Russian rocket engines. That is exactly what will happen if we allow this amendment to pass, and the door will once again fly open for taxpayer dollars to be used to subsidize purchases of Russian rocket engines--purchases which line the pockets of Vladimir Putin's cronies.  My friends, if you want to vote to buy more Russian rocket engines, just say it. That is fine. That is fine with me, but to cloak it in some kind of bipartisan agreement that somehow we are going to have to continue to buy these Russian rocket engines, after we had an agreement last year 97 to 2--97 to 2--what does this do? This undoes last year's 97-to-2 agreement. We don't need this amendment to meet America's needs in space.  As a result of last year's bipartisan agreement and the NDAA, the Department of Defense is on a path to gradually eliminate dependence on Russia as quickly as possible while fostering competition among American companies. NASA needs to do the same. NASA needs to do the same. NASA needs to do the same.  Sanctions, by definition, require tradeoffs. Sanctions are not free. Countries that impose sanctions must be willing to pay a cost, too, if and when a greater principle, a great national security interest, is at stake.  Let me conclude because I note the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member here. There are costs and tradeoffs the United States has been asking our European allies to make in the last few years. We have leaned on France to cancel a sale of naval vessels to We have been warning Central and Eastern European allies against deepening their dependence on Russian energy with various energy deals and infrastructure projects. We should not be asking our allies to make these sacrifices unless we are prepared to do the same.  We will probably pass this amendment. If there is ever a doubt in any of our constituents' minds about the influence of special interests, it will be with passage of this amendment--which, by the way, with all due respect to my friends and colleagues, was the one thing they didn't want. The one thing they didn't want was an on-the-record vote on this amendment, which is why I am confident it will lose, but I want every Member of the U.Senate to look in the eyes of the mother whose son was just killed by a Russian sniper, as I did, down in Mariupol not too long ago.  I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. I know how it is going to come out, but Members of the U.Senate will at least be on record. I say this is not the most courageous chapter in the history of this institution. I urge a ``no'' vote.

8157,topic-id,904,"Madam President, from day one, this administration, President Trump, and congressional Republicans have attacked rules that protect working families.  Just 1 hour after taking the oath of office, President Trump indefinitely suspended a plan that made it easier for working families to be able to afford a mortgage. Ten days later, he issued an Executive order that requires agencies to identify and eliminate two rules for every one new rule they issue, and that was just the beginning. Congressional Republicans spent the first few months of the year eliminating rules that protected workers, students, and families. They killed a rule that required companies in dangerous industries to track when their employees were injured. They even killed a rule that helped keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.  These rules all had one thing in common--they all made sure the public health, safety, and security of Americans came ahead of industry's bottom line.  Oh, and there was a second thing in common for these rules: Industry hated them. With President Trump in office and Republicans in the majority in Congress, those industries were ready to cash in, and they had their wish list ready.  Although the attack on public-centered rules has increased in intensity during this administration, I just want to say it is not new. Powerful companies have long understood that the fight in Congress is just the first of many battles. If Big Business can't weaken or kill bills they don't like in Congress, they turn their attention to the agencies tasked with implementing those laws, working to tilt the rulemaking process in their favor, and they don't waste any time getting started.  Long before rules are even announced, giant corporations intensely lobby agencies--setting up meeting after meeting--to make sure the agencies will prioritize corporate interests. As rules wind their way through the rulemaking process, the lobbying intensifies. Companies bury agencies in mountains of expensive, industry-funded comments. They cite sham research and bought-and-paid-for experts. If, at the end of that long, arduous process, a strong, public-centered rule is published anyway, those companies sue, looking to busy judges who are unfamiliar with the issues to overturn the decision of expert agencies.  There are no two ways about it. The rulemaking process is broken. There are far too many opportunities for giant corporations to influence the[[Page S3879]]rulemaking process, and there are far too few opportunities for meaningful public participation, but Republicans don't want to fix this problem--no way. They want to make the rulemaking process work even better for their corporate buddies and work even harder against American families.  And, boy, did they pick the right person to lead the charge. President Trump nominated Neomi Rao--a law school professor who advocates for weakening and handcuffing agencies--to run the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs known as  OIRA is a small, little-known but intensely powerful office that renews economically significant Federal rules. Before the Department of Labor can issue a rule on workplace safety, for example, or the Environmental Protection Agency can issue a rule restricting water pollution or the Department of Education can issue a rule protecting students from shady, for-profit colleges, that rule must be submitted to OIRA to sign off. If OIRA doesn't like the rule, it can change the rule or hold it up for months at a time. When a rule finally makes it out of the OIRA ringer, chances are that any changes will be slanted in favor of corporate interests.  Professor Rao's view of agencies makes her the wrong person to lead this powerful agency. She believes judges should pay less attention to the conclusions of experts at Federal agencies, and Professor Rao is especially critical of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--the This is the agency that has forced the biggest corporations and banks in this country to return more than $12 billion directly to Americans they have cheated and held big banks like Wells Fargo accountable when they have ripped off customers.  Professor Rao says the CFPB's problem is its independence--seriously. Maybe Professor Rao thinks that little agency just doesn't kowtow enough to the big banks. If Professor Rao had her way, independent agencies like the CFPB would be handcuffed by OIRA, the agency she wants to run. It is no surprise that the Wall Street giants that have been trying to take down the CFPB for years love Professor Rao's views.  If confirmed, Professor Rao will be perfectly positioned to put her theories into practice. She will head the Trump administration's efforts to toss out the rules big businesses don't like. She will determine whether rules go through the slanted OIRA process. She will have a chance to gut strong rules that help working families.  The rulemaking process is broken, and there is a lot Congress should be doing to fix it, to try to make it work better for people all across this country--for workers and for families and for people who get cheated, but the Trump administration wants to go in the opposite direction.  Any Senator who believes corporations need more say in the rulemaking process should vote for Neomi Rao, but anyone who thinks we are supposed to be here to work for the American people will vote to reject her nomination.

8174,topic-id,564,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this.  You know, as a physician, we take an oath. We say: Do no harm.  And today in America and here in Washington, D.C., we are debating physician-assisted suicide, where we are authorizing physicians to take someone's life--to assist in taking someone's life. To me, this undermines the very thing that healthcare is all about.  Who is most affected in this situation?  Our most vulnerable citizens: the disabled and the poor.  As a doctor, I can tell you, what has always been in my heart is this is about care and about comfort, and those are our priorities.  Physician-assisted suicide does not provide comfort. It merely ends life.  In Washington, D.C., a doctor can decide that you may be going to die within 6 months if you have a terminal disease--a terminal disease if you are untreated. Many terminal diseases would be terminal if they are not treated. With that, the doctor can write a prescription. There is no tracking of that prescription once it is given and there is no witness of the patient taking this prescription. They can simply go home to die alone.  In one State where there is physician-assisted suicide, they have had an increase in suicides outside of physician-assisted suicides. I think that what we are saying to too many people is: You are not needed.  Again, this undermines what I think we are all about and what healthcare should be all about.  I think of the movie, ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' which so many people watch every Mr.Potter says to George Bailey: ``George, you are worth more dead than alive.''  Is that really who we want to be?  As a resident in Chicago in the 1980s, one of our responsibilities was to do physical exams on everyone admitted to the hospital regardless of what they were admitted for. I can remember a doctor coming up to me and saying: We just admitted our first AIDS patient, but you don't have to go see him.  And this is a time when people didn't know what was going on, what was causing this, how it was being spread. And I thought that was wrong and I went in anyway to examine this patient. I had to go in like it was a lunar landing because there was so much uncertainty about what was causing death to so many people. This patient was very sick. I learned so much from this one patient because there were so many things wrong, but it didn't compare to what I learned when I finished that exam and he looked at me and said: You just examined me more than anyone.                              {time}  1715  I have never forgotten, throughout my entire medical career, the value of human life and what it must feel like to be discarded. He died the next day. I still know his name. And he taught me a valuable lesson on his very last day of life: Healthcare is about cures, it is about caring, it is about compassion, and society should be about the same thing, and the ideal that every person has value until their very last breath.  I am pleased to say that the President's budget addresses this issue, and we will, too, here in the House because you and your loved ones matter.

8202,topic-id,166,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lieutenant Deputy Kevin A Yell County Sheriff's deputy, Kevin was killed during a traffic stop on May 11, 2017.  Lieutenant Mainhart had served as a police officer for 20 years in West Memphis, Arkansas, before returning to Yell County 5 years ago to protect and serve his hometown. He lived a life of service that his wife, Pam, and two sons, Lucas and Cody, can be proud of.  While words will never be able to console the pain and grief his family, community, and the State of Arkansas feel, we can take solace in the words of Christ, who said: ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''  Yell County has lost a true friend and a servant. I thank Lieutenant Mainhart for his service and sacrifice and send my most sincere condolences to his friends, family, and all those affected by this senseless act of violence.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgH4396-2.txt,2224,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,22.0,April

Let the record reflect how proud I am of Mr.Capp's service to fellow Hoosiers and our country.  After graduating from Valparaiso University School of Law in 1977, Mr.Capp served in the private sector for 8 years prior to joining the U.Attorney's Office in 1985. During his tenure, Mr.Capp served as interim U.attorney, as well as first assistant. On April 28, 2010, Mr.Capp was sworn in by Chief Judge Philip Simon as the U.Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana and has been serving in that capacity ever since.  Mr.Capp has undoubtedly left this office and community a better place. Mr.Capp's tireless commitment to his work helped alleviate gang-related violence and drug-related offenses.
