                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, the Earth belongs to You and everything in it. Even 
when wrong seems overwhelming, You continue to rule. Create in our 
lawmakers a hunger and thirst for integrity and honesty. Give them pure 
hearts and truthful lips, accompanied by a passion to glorify You.
  Lord, provide them wisdom to live for the honor of Your Name as they 
remember that they are Your ambassadors. May they look to You for help, 
knowing that You surround them with the shield of Your Divine favor.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
