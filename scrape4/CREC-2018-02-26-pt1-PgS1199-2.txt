                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Gracious God, lover of our souls, inspire our Senators to acknowledge 
Your greatness and to depend on Your wisdom and power. May they find 
their strength and usefulness in their total dependence on You.
  Lord, deliver them from those who hate the upright and surround them 
with the shield of Your Divine favor. Give them the wisdom to find 
common ground in order to accomplish the best for our Nation and world. 
Remind them that righteousness elevates a nation but sin destroys. 
Prepare their hearts and minds for all the challenges they will face in 
the days to come.
  And Lord, today we thank You for the legacy of our Nation's first 
President, George Washington.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
