                        OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, today we are talking about infrastructure. 
I want to focus on one aspect of infrastructure that touches the lives 
of all Americans, especially in my home State of California, and that 
is water.
  I know firsthand the urgent challenges facing our water 
infrastructure. The crippling recent drought and subsequent record 
rainfall has prompted more discussion on a need for a smart water 
management strategy to improve drinking water, water reuse, and 
recycled water systems for communities across the United States.
  We must take meaningful steps to increase our water conservation, 
reduce unnecessary energy use, and cut costs for Americans. Let's 
commit to investing in technology and science-based solutions that will 
address the weaknesses in our water drinking systems from threats like 
climate change, crumbling pipes, and water source contamination.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to focus on legislation that will 
put Americans back to work building the systems we need to support the 
future of this great country.
