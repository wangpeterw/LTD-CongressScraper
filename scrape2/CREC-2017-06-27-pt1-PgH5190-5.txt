                   MAINTAINING GREAT LAKES' ECOSYSTEM

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, the Great Lakes are a national treasure, 
and nobody knows this better than the people in my home State of 
Michigan.
  Our environment, economy, and quality of life depend upon maintaining 
a healthy Great Lakes ecosystem. One of the most harmful threats are 
invasive species like Asian carp that decimate every ecosystem in their 
path.
  Last week, we learned some alarming news when a live Asian carp was 
found just nine miles from Lake Michigan beyond the electric barrier. 
If Asian carp are able to infiltrate the Great Lakes, it would be 
devastating for Michigan's fishing, boating, and tourism industries and 
all the jobs they support.
  The Army Corps of Engineers has completed a report called the 
``Brandon Road Study'' that provides a roadmap of how to best prevent 
Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes. They should release it 
immediately.
  We must take bipartisan action before it is too late. We simply 
cannot allow, Mr. Speaker, Asian carp to wreak havoc on the Great 
Lakes.
