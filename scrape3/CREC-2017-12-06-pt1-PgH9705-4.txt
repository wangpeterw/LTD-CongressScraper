                          WATER FOR THE WORLD

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when we turn on the tap, clean water 
flows out and we hardly even think about it. The same thing happens 
when we turn on the shower or flush the toilet. But for a lot of the 
world, this just isn't true.
  According to the USAID, over 700 million people lack dependable 
access to clean water. But it is not just water. One in three people 
don't have access to a toilet. Many don't know the basic hygiene 
practices. As a result, over 800 children a day die.
  However, progress has been made. The Water for the World Act that 
Representative Blumenauer and I authored in the 113th Congress made 
great strides to guarantee safe water, sanitation, and hygiene to 
everyone.
  But there is still work to be done. Eighty percent of the countries 
receiving aid report that water issues remain. The poor still lack 
water and sanitation. With our God-given resources, we have an 
obligation and a privilege to make sure people receive the basic of 
life: clean water.
  And that is just the way it is.
