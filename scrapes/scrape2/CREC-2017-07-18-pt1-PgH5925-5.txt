          RETIREMENT OF CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT JOSEPHINE YENKE

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Chief Master 
Sergeant Josephine Yenke's retirement, after 28 years of honorable 
service to our Nation in the United States Air Force, Air Force 
Reserves, and Air National Guard, to her home in Hawaii.
  Chief Yenke began her service in Hawaii with Headquarters Pacific Air 
Forces in 1998 and has contributed significantly, making a long-lasting 
impact on our troops, servicemembers, and country, including mobilizing 
support for deploying troops through our country's long period in 
conflict.
  Chief Yenke recently retired as the headquarters individual reservist 
readiness and integration organization detachment two superintendent at 
Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, where she served as the key 
senior enlisted adviser, assisting the commander with managing and 
directing personnel resource activities for over 400 reservists.
  Chief Yenke has given many years of her life in the service of our 
country and embodies the skills and expertise that our Reserve 
component servicemembers bring to our total force.
  Our grateful Nation thanks Josephine for her and her family's service 
and sacrifice, and we wish her the very best as she begins this new 
chapter in her life.

                          ____________________
