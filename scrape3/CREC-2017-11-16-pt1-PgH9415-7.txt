                   TAX BURDEN ON HARDWORKING FAMILIES

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, on the floor of 
the House of Representatives, we saw a vote on what has been called the 
middle class tax cut. Unfortunately, I am here to remind all of us, Mr. 
Speaker, that it really is a tax scam.
  When we have looked into the many communities across America and seen 
families like the hardworking families in the district that I represent 
in California, the average family or household that files a tax return 
every April 15 makes an average income of about $69,000.
  That family, according to what was just passed on this floor, is 
going to be leaving behind over $1,000 more than they normally would 
have when they do their taxes. That hurts. That family is a hardworking 
family. That family cannot afford to miss out on $1,000 of their hard-
earned money.
  I heard people say earlier that that is not going to happen. That is 
just not true.
