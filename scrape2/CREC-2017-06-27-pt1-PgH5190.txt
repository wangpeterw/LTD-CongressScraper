                       HONORING JAMES WILDERMUTH

  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Indiana's Rural 
Teacher of the Year, James Wildermuth of North Miami Community Schools.
  Mr. Wildermuth is well deserving of this high honor awarded by the 
Indiana Small and Rural Schools Association. He is truly an exceptional 
Hoosier educator who has had a profound impact on student achievement 
and who exemplifies leadership in a way that should inspire all of us.
  In addition to his 17 years as a teacher, Mr. Wildermuth also serves 
as a district adviser for the local Future Farmers of America program.
  I am grateful that North Miami's students have Mr. Wildermuth as a 
role model and a mentor, always keeping them not only engaged in the 
lesson at hand but focused on using these lessons to succeed in life.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Second District Hoosiers, I want to thank 
Mr. Wildermuth for all he does to educate, support, and guide his 
students on the path to achievement and to make our community stronger.
