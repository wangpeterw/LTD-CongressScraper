                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Infinite Father, thank You for Your providential care. You lead us as 
a great shepherd beside still waters. You restore our souls.
  Fill our lawmakers with optimism and hope as they remember that all 
things are possible to those who believe. With confidence in Your 
strength, may they face the future unafraid. Lord, help them to 
overcome every obstacle that would discourage them. May they cast their 
cares on You, remembering that You will keep them from stumbling or 
slipping.
  Lord, lead us all to undergo all necessary discipline, diligence, and 
sacrifice, to do Your will on Earth even as it is done in Heaven.
  We pray in Your powerful Name. Amen.
