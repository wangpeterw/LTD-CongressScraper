                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  As the Members of the people's House find their way back to the 
Capitol in anticipation of a busy second session of the 115th Congress, 
we ask Your continued blessing on our Nation.
  May the days of celebration near the end of 2017 and the welcoming of 
a new year inspire hope and good will among the Members of the people's 
House, that the issues to be faced might be addressed with wisdom and 
timely consideration.
  Bless as well those who have labored in these halls and offices, even 
while Congress has been in recess. Without their steady and faithful 
service, the work of Congress would not be possible.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
