rollcall vote No. 441.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, due to a delayed flight I was 
unable to return to D.C. in time for the first round of voting. Had I

  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, today I missed rollcall vote No. 441 due to 
family commitments. Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye'' to 
provide necessary relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey.
