                      BILLIONAIRES-FIRST TAX BILL

  (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about the Republican's 
billionaires-first tax bill.
  Mr. Speaker, the Tax Policy Center determined they will raise taxes 
for approximately 38 million middle class households. Americans agree 
that we need more jobs, higher wages, and lower taxes. But the 
Republican bill rewards billionaires, prioritizes corporate profits, 
and hurts working families.
  It is welfare for the wealthy paid for by the hardworking middle 
class American. It fails the President's own Trump test, which says 
their tax plan would not benefit the wealthiest of us. Guess what. It 
does.
  Worst of all, New Jersey families suffer the most. The bill guts the 
critical State and local tax deduction. That means one-fourth of all 
New Jerseyans will be paying more taxes.
  Why should billionaires receive tax relief instead of New Jersey's 
middle class families?
  Americans must reject this billionaires-first, bloated, backwards 
bill. It will do nothing to raise wages or bring real relief for 
working families.
