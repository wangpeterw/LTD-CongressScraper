1143,topic-id,151,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to offer my support to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  This legislation is crucial toward protecting the most vulnerable among us: the unborn.  As a doctor, it is my job to stay current with the latest medical research, and I have done so in my job in Congress, too.  The research overwhelmingly shows that children 20 weeks or less are capable of showing pain. This is brought forth by the fact that when an in-utero procedure is done, both the mother and the unborn child are given anesthesia. Not to do so allows that child to recoil in pain and show a stress response in the uterus.  I have heard, personally, as a physician, heartbeats in babies as early as 6 weeks of age in utero.  So this legislation is critical, it is needed, it is past due, and I urge my colleagues to support this.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7686-5.txt,2244,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As it has been obvious here today, it is always difficult to talk about this issue, but when we talk about pain-capable unborn children, we are referring to, in particular, children who are still in the womb at 20 weeks.  As it has been pointed out by my colleagues time and time again, scientists have proven that unborn children, even at 20 weeks old, are capable of feeling pain. The goal of this legislation is to protect these children by ensuring that they cannot be aborted.  Today, if a physician performs an in utero surgery on a 20-week-old unborn child, the standard protocol for the child is to be treated as a patient, not just a blob of tissue. That child would be given an injection of pain medication before the surgery, and this is above and beyond the anesthesia given to the mother before the surgery.  These babies have demonstrated to medical experts that they respond to painful stimuli because they flinch and they recoil from sharp objects.

443,topic-id,424,"Mr.Chairman, for too long Congress has been allowed to play by a different set of rules than the American people in regard to how we budget. No one lives in a world where there is seemingly an endless supply of money, that is, until you enter the fantasy world of Washington, D. However, hardworking American families, businessmen, and businesswomen live in the real world. They have to budget. They have to prioritize and make trade-off decisions: wants versus needs, what is good and what is essential. The bottom line, they have to live within their means.  But, apparently, our government has been exempt from such basic principles of fiscal responsibility under which we the people must live. The prevailing budget philosophy over the years among our representative leaders has been as follows: as long as we can borrow it, you can bet your bottom dollar we can spend it. And spend it they have.  This borrowing-and-spending delusion has left us on the brink of bankruptcy. We are $20 trillion in debt, which puts our country in the worst debt position in the history of America, and this with the sacred constitutional charge to secure liberty for our posterity. That means give freedom to our children.  Mr.Chairman, there is no freedom with this level of debt. If we don't do something about this looming debt crisis and stay on our current spending trajectory, in less than 10 years, we will be at $30 trillion in debt. We will have $1 trillion in annual deficit. We will be spending more--get this--on our interest on the debt we owe than on national defense.  Mr.Chairman, enough is enough. I rise in support of this budget, a budget that begins to rein in this reckless spending, a budget that funds our national priorities and our core responsibilities and initiates a historic opportunity for tax relief for middle and working class families.  Let's stop spending our children's future and stop pretending that they won't inherit a disaster as a result. Let's live in the same reality as every other Let's focus on our main mission as a limited Federal Government by rebuilding our military, by maintaining our infrastructure, and by securing our food supply so we can maintain the ability to feed our own people.

They returned to Casper and raised six children: Tom, David, Dona, Laura, Karla, and Many of their children attended Anthony's. In Casper, Don had a successful career as a partner with a local oil and gas firm. He is also active in the community as a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Knights of Columbus, and a lifelong member of Anthony's Catholic   The Galles and Murphy families were joined together in 2005. In the presence of their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, Don and Rita were married at Anthony's Catholic Church on December 29, 2005. As the place where they first met as children, the church holds great memories and a deep personal connection for them both.   Over the years, Don and Rita have generously contributed their time and resources to both the church and school. They have also given back to our community in numerous other ways. For example, Don and Rita made an essential donation to purchase land and a building to expand the Casper Seton House, which assists homeless mothers and children. Their kindness, devotion, and generosity are true reflections of their character and the values they have passed along to their family.   It is with great honor that I recognize these outstanding members of our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our congratulations to Donald and Rita Galles for receiving this special award.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-05-pt1-PgS6354.txt,1881,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,5,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
236,topic-id,1859,"Mr.President, it is always such a privilege to come to the floor and hear Senator Isakson, of Georgia, speak, as he speaks so eloquently. He comes here and makes perfect points. He was talking about the tax system looking to the future. What we have is a tax system that looks backward, regrettably. A number of years ago, we had a Treasury Secretary named Bill Simon, who said: ``The Nation should have a tax code that looks like someone designed it on purpose.'' That is what we are trying to do now--have a Tax Code that looks like it was designed on purpose.[[Page S6311]]  The person who really understood this was Ronald As we take a look at tax proposals, it is not about taxes; it is about much more--about a better life for the American people. Ronald Reagan said that tax reform is the door to a bigger future and, I would add, to a brighter future. He said it was the door to a future as big and hopeful and full of heart as the American dream. That is what we are talking about here today, a bright, big future, as big and bright as the American dream. That is what we are aiming at with this plan, a big and hopeful future for all  It all starts with increasing the amount of money Americans get to keep in their pockets as a result of their hard-earned paycheck dollars. That is the most important thing. That is what families are concerned about. That is what I hear about every weekend in Under the outline the Republicans have proposed, every working man and woman in this country will be better off. That is our goal, to make everyone better off and to make the country better off, more prosperous, with a strong, healthy economy. That is what we are hearing about today on the floor and what we heard about from the Senator from  When we cut the amount of money people have to pay in taxes, it is essentially like giving them a raise. That is what this is about, giving people a raise. We want working people to keep more of their hard-earned money. One of the ways you can do that, which is very popular, is by doubling the standard deduction. It is easy math to do. The current standard deduction is around $12,000 for a couple who files jointly. The Republican proposal doubles it to $24,000. That means the first $24,000 of a couple's income will not be taxed at all.  Beyond that, we are going to reduce the number of tax brackets. People will like that. It is so complicated, the system we have now. We will move people into lower brackets. Isn't that what we are trying to do? Yes, it is. If you used to be in a bracket and paid 25 percent, there is a pretty good chance that a significant amount of your income is going to be moved down to the 12-percent range. For most people, that is like getting a big raise when they take a look at their paychecks at the end of the week. That is what Republican tax relief looks like.  The second thing we want to do is to actually make it a lot simpler. We talked about lowering the number of brackets, making it simpler for everyone who does their taxes. The instructions you get now from the IRS for the 1040 tax form are 106-pages long, and that is if you just limit yourself to the instructions. Remember that there are 15 different worksheets to fill out just so you can fill out your 1040 form. When more people take the standard deduction, they can save a lot of time and not have to go to the 15 worksheets and the 106 pages of instructions. They get that standard deduction, which has now doubled, making it a lot easier, with a lot less time having to be spent on taxes.  What else are we going to do?  We want to cut out a lot of the loopholes and complicated rules so most people will be able to just fill out a form on a single page. Think of the hours that is going to save families--the millions and millions of hours--when you multiply it across the country. Plus, think of the stress people will not have to be living under in their wondering if they actually followed the instructions properly. When you call the IRS help line, you get different answers from different people with whom you talk. It is hard to get a single answer because the complicated system makes it hard to get the answer right. So you end up with the expense of hiring lawyers, tax accountants, and people who can help you navigate a complicated system.  People are looking for simpler lives, more free time, and more money of their own they can keep, not complicated government forms so the government takes more of their money. There is a lot of room for us to improve the simplicity of the tax system and the actual challenges that come from filling out the forms.  The third thing we want to do with the plan, of course, is to get the economy growing faster so it is a strong and healthy economy, with more prosperity and higher take-home pay in the paychecks. With that, you will actually get an economy that creates more jobs and has more people working, which is a big part of tax reform. It is a direct benefit for American families. When you cut taxes on small businesses, they can afford to hire more people or they can use the extra money to pay their workers more. There is a lot that can be done to reach that level of prosperity--in individual paychecks as well as in having more people in the workforce.  Under the outline the Republicans released last week, the top rate for most small businesses is going to drop from almost 40 percent down to 25 percent, allowing the businesses to pass on those savings to their customers and the savings to their employees. Larger businesses are going to get a tax break too. The idea is to lower taxes for everyone.  When you take a look at it from a business owner's standpoint, 70 percent of the cost of corporate taxes actually does not get paid by a corporation; it gets paid by the people who work for those businesses. If we cut taxes, more of that money is going to go to the workers. You will have higher wages, better benefits, and more jobs, and businesses will actually be able to lower their prices. Every time there is a tax increase, a business has to raise the cost of a product to be able to collect that tax and send it to the government. I would rather have that money go into the pockets of the people who are shopping in the store or using that business rather than into the pocket of the Federal  Senator Isakson was talking about something called repatriation and the amount of money businesses are taxed that do some business overseas. If we can cut the taxes they pay on the money they earn overseas, it means those businesses can bring back that money to the United States and spend it here. How much is it? Right now, about $2.6 trillion is sitting overseas because those businesses get taxed twice--once on the business done overseas and then once on the business done when they bring those profits back to the United When we get that money back, that is going to help grow the economy here as well. It makes sure the American Tax Code ought to be helping American businesses and the American economy, not helping foreign countries. We need to get that money back and put it to work in the United  Those are all of the things the Republicans are proposing. It means more money in the pockets of American workers, and it means simpler taxes and more jobs for American workers. Isn't that what we are looking for? Isn't that what prosperity means for America? Isn't that what a healthy economy means--job growth and the sort of things that happen when we get the kind of tax reform we have proposed?  I want to address one other thing I have heard over the past couple of days as our plan has come out. I have heard some Members on the other side of the aisle say that under the Republican plan, certain people will win more than others. Under the Republican plan, the goal is for everyone to win. The American economy will win. When we have a growing economy, people keep more of their hard-earned money. That is the goal. That is why the President and the Republicans in Congress wanted to take up tax relief right now in the first place. We need to do this to help all American families.  This gets back to Ronald Reagan, in that tax reform--tax reductions, tax relief--means a big and hopeful future for all That should be the goal. It should be the goal of every Member of the U.It should be the goal of every We want to make taxes fairer and simpler and lower for everyone.  There are too many people in Washington right now who want to use America's tax laws to punish or reward one group of Americans or another. Too many people in Washington want to use this debate over tax reform to stir up conflict and resentment. We hear it already in the Democrats' talking points. There are some Democrats in this Senate who think that is good politics. Well, it is terrible policy and terrible for the direction of our country and economy.  The tax plan the Republicans have released this last week does nothing to[[Page S6312]]change who bears the burden of taxes in the country. People who are fortunate and have high incomes will pay their fair share; people who make less will pay less. That is how the Tax Code is spread today. Nothing in this plan changes that.  We have a lot of work ahead of us. We have to figure out the exact income levels for each of the tax brackets and the size of some of the tax credits families get. These are all important details. That is the kind of debate we are going to be having--the markup on the budget and the mathematics of the tax bill coming through committee.  I am so grateful to Senator Hatch and members of the Finance Committee for all of the hard work they will be putting into this over the next several weeks.  I will refer back to the quote of the Treasury Secretary, Bill Simon, who said: ``The nation should have a tax code that looks like someone designed it on purpose.'' This is our chance. We need to make sure we take full advantage of it.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

594,topic-id,1036,"Mr.President, last weekend a man camped out on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las He stockpiled 23 weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He set up bipods and scopes. He brought a hammer to knock out the window. Then, on Sunday, he opened fire. He kept firing for 15 minutes, stopping only to reload and switch weapons. Over 15 minutes, he murdered 58 Americans and injured more than 500.  The day after the shooting, I was in I had seven or eight meetings, and not a single person in those meetings brought up the worst shooting in modern American history--not one.  I am not sure if it was two mass shootings ago or three when we started to accept this as a normal condition of American life, when we lost our belief that it was within our power to protect our fellow Americans at a country music concert or at a nightclub or at a movie theater or at a school.  I know there are strong beliefs about guns in America--principled beliefs--but there are also steps that the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to take. There are 90 percent of Americans who think we need background checks for every gun sale, including 74 percent of NRA members. There are 89 percent of Americans who think we should prevent the mentally ill from purchasing guns. There are 82 percent of Republicans who want us to bar gun purchases for people on the no-fly or terrorist watch list. Yet Congress has done nothing to respond to the American people. We did nothing after Aurora, after Newtown, after Orlando--nothing.  Unlike Washington, in Colorado, after the two mass shootings in Aurora and at Columbine, our legislators rose to the occasion and made tough choices after we suffered two of the worst mass shootings in our Nation's history. After the massacre at Columbine, we closed the gun show loophole. After the tragedy in Aurora, we strengthened our background checks in a Western Last year, those background checks blocked 8,704 people from buying guns. That may sound like a lot, but 380,000 people applied for guns in Colorado last year. That means just 2 percent of those folks who applied were blocked and that 98 percent were able to buy guns without a problem.  Who were the 2 percent whom Colorado is blocking but whom this Congress fails to block? Among them were murderers and rapists and kidnappers and domestic abusers.  No one could come to this floor and tell me Colorado is worse off because we have kept guns out of the hands of those people. The average wait time for those background checks is 12 minutes. That strikes me as a fair tradeoff to keep guns out of the hands of murderers and kidnappers and rapists. Yet here in Washington, despite now an annual tragedy--tragedy after tragedy--Congress has done nothing. We haven't even done the simple things like close the gun show loophole or stop people on the terrorist watch list from buying weapons.  This is not about taking guns away from people who have them. It is about keeping guns out of the hands of people who nearly everybody agrees should not have them. It is about stopping more people like the Las Vegas killer from modifying his rifles to become almost fully automatic and far more deadly. I cosponsored a bill this week to ban those modifications, and I am encouraged that some of my Republican colleagues seem to be open to that idea.  I know we cannot stop every madman or every random act of violence in this country--we cannot--just as we cannot stop every murder from happening, but that does not mean we should not make them less likely or that we cannot take steps to limit their harm, steps that are backed by the overwhelming majority of Americans and that are fully consistent with the  I remember, after the shooting at the Pulse Nightclub, I was supposed to take my daughter to camp that day.[[Page S6334]]She was going to be away from us for a month. I can remember I did everything I could to keep her from hearing the news that day, as the numbers of fatalities increased during the course of the day, because I didn't want her to leave us--she was about 12 at the time--with a sense of fear, the fear I felt and the country felt. I am so sorry my children and America's children have to grow up in a country where mass shootings are common, where we are beginning to see them just as part of our lives.  I heard somebody the other day on television say that is the price of freedom. What a shame that somebody would say that in the United States of What a surrender that represents to our children and to the victims of these crimes. I didn't grow up in that America, but conditions have changed. We have let it happen. The result is, we now have an entire generation of Americans--of our countrymen, our sons, and our daughters--who are growing up with a reasonable fear that they could be victims of a mass shooting or that their moms or their dads might not come home one day.  I think our kids have enough to worry about. They have every right to see a movie with their parents, to go dancing with their friends, or to see a concert on their one night off without having the fear of being shot down by people who have no business carrying such powerful weapons. They have a right to expect that this Congress will finally do something about gun violence in our country--violence which is far greater than anywhere else in the industrialized world.  In the wake of these horrific acts, as always, Americans spring into action. First responders secure the area and care for the wounded. Neighbors hold vigils to honor the victims and support grieving families. Journalists shed light on what happened and why. Citizens speak out to demand action from their elected officials. They are doing their jobs, and it is time for Congress to do ours.  I yield the floor.

447,topic-id,432,"Mr.Chairman, it has been an honor to work with the chairman of the Budget Committee as a new Member of Congress because it is such a learning curve to understand the challenges that we have in our country in so many ways, but especially on the fiscal side of things.  I would like to spend my time talking to my grandchildren right now. I am talking to your grandchildren as well.  In the last 48 hours, I have had an opportunity--it was more of a responsibility--to chat with my grandchildren about the horrific events that occurred in Las When you are 8 or 16, you assimilate those things in different ways. I talk to them a lot about responsibility for behavior, responsibility for money, and responsibility for their own lifestyles.  I talked to them today to say that we are not going to put you into the debt hole caused by the spending that has occurred over the last decades in this country. We are not going to pass that along to you, because the hole is only getting deeper and more extensive, and we are passing it along to those next generations. Not only is it not right, it is morally wrong and absolutely irresponsible.  We have to ask ourselves the questions: If not now, then when do we begin to bend the spending curve? If we don't do it, then who will?  We know that mandatory spending within our grandchildren's lifetime will eclipse almost, if not, 100 percent of the Federal budget. That means no money for research, for medical, for education, and for all of those discretionary dollars that are so wisely spent.  We have to begin to bend the spending curve now, and that means cuts in mandatory spending, while responsibly using the other dollars, the discretionary dollars, to advance good programs.                              {time}  1530  That takes discipline, that takes effort, that takes making tough decisions that are unpopular but necessary for the future of our country.  Our Budget Committee wrestled long and hard to present what you are going to vote on, and I am proud of the fact that with the discourse and debate that we had over tough issues, in the end, the American people are taking a next first step forward towards fiscal responsibility that reflects the reality that we owe to our grandchildren, just like our parents and grandparents felt that they needed to do for us during the Great Depression and a couple of World Wars to make sure that we have a physically viable country. This budget is a next first step.

494,topic-id,868,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to address the House on this issue. I hear so much from my friends on the other side that I agree with, and I very much would like to work closely with them.  I point out to the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, my friend from Ohio, that while we have the highest corporate rate in the world, 35 percent, which is clearly not desirable, I served in Switzerland for 4 years, where there were 700 American companies because the tax rate was so much lower. Yet that 35 percent rate, in actuality, turned out to be less than 14 percent across all American corporations, and a quarter of American corporations pay zero.  As we look at refining this, it is not just about dropping that rate. It is about making sure that every American corporation pays a fair share of their taxes to the U.citizens.  I rise in opposition to the Republican budget resolution. Budget resolutions, by their nature, are political documents. But this one also has an instrumental purpose, because the only reason this budget resolution is on the floor is to pave the way for the partisan process for the tax bill, which will significantly increase the deficit in order to give tax breaks to those who need them least.  I think everyone in this body agrees that the average American taxpayer, those who have had virtually no raise for 30 years, deserve and need tax breaks. If we can give them that tax relief, the economy will grow faster.  But the Senate reconciliation instructions that will ultimately pass are written to allow for a $1.5 trillion increase in the deficit, and that is assuming that the fuzzy math and the rosy expectations actually work out. I appreciate the charts that my friend and colleague, Mr.Rooney, showed that pointed out that we would like to get to 3.1 percent economic growth. I heartily agree.  But if we look at the period right now where we now have the worst disparity in wealth and the worst disparity in income that we have had in a long time, that tracks this decline from 3.1 percent to 1.6, 1.8, 2 percent.  When I started off in our family business, the corporate tax rate was 78 percent, and our economic growth was a lot higher. Not that we want to go back to 78 percent, but putting more money in the hands of the top 1 percent is not what is going to make this economy grow more quickly.  Actually, looking at the critical programs that are cut in this Republican budget gives us almost a handy guide of more effective ways to spend money. For example, this budget cuts transportation spending by 25 percent at a time when we have a D in our infrastructure by the American Society of Civil Engineers, when President Trump and candidate Hillary Clinton both campaigned hard on more infrastructure investment, not a cut.  This budget cuts student aid by $211 billion when we know from our Joint Economic Committee hearings that the student debt our young people carry is one of the reasons they don't start new businesses, one of the things that suppresses the growth of new businesses in  We also know that human capital is the key to economic growth all through history and today. It contains massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, making healthcare more expensive for those who can least afford it, and that is not a way to grow the economy.  We have an opportunity to enact fiscally responsible, sustainable, bipartisan tax reform that focuses on the Americans whose wages have been stagnant for 30 years. I believe the Democrats are prepared to engage in real reform. It should be simpler. It should be fairer. We should absolutely do away with the special deals and credits and gimmicks, but we need a lower rate for most Americans, and not make sure that 80 percent of the tax benefits go to the people who need them the least, who have the smallest propensity to spend and to invest.  There are many other things wrong with this budget. Let me just point out two particular problems. Number one, the budget attacks the Arctic National Wildlife It essentially sacrifices wildlife and environmental protections to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest.  ANWR encompasses more than 19 million acres and is one of the last intact landscapes in It is essential that we protect this wild and spectacular land. The government briefly opened ANWR to seismic testing in the 1980s, and the damage from that activity is still visible today. Truck tracks still scar the expansive tundra where the permafrost never healed. Since then, the Federal Government has protected ANWR from harmful oil and gas drilling because of concerns about the impact on species like polar bears, muskoxen, and caribou.  Mr.Chairman, there are 37 land mammal species, 8 marine mammal species, 42 fish species, and more than 200 migratory birds that inhabit the Seismic testing could do lasting damage to the fragile ecosystem way before drilling. Seismic activity sends shock waves underground, disturbing denning polar bears.  The Acting The time of the gentleman has expired.

495,topic-id,246,"Mr.Chairman, the caribou are a food source for Alaskan indigenous groups who have lived off the land for thousands of years. All of this devastation will likely do very little in the short run to reduce the deficit. The oil prices are so low that no oil company is going to attempt to extract fossil fuels at this time.  We believe the ANWR must be protected from the budget for future generations, its wildlife, and the native people who inhabit it.  Part two, Mr.Chairman, is the budget also attacks Federal Government employee retirement benefits. It instructs the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to reduce the deficit by $32 billion. This clearly targets Federal employee retirement benefits because that is the only substantial mandatory spending within the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's jurisdiction.  By slashing these promised benefits, the budget will eliminate any sense of financial security that Federal employees currently have. We should be protecting their rights and benefits. This was the original bargain they made. Most gave up much more lucrative careers in the private sector for the opportunity to serve all Americans, and for a small but secure Federal pension.  It is also going to make it a lot more difficult for us to recruit and retain the quality employees who make America great.

106,topic-id,406,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, I rise in opposition to this budget substitute, which is, put simply, an abdication of our fiscal responsibility as a governing body.  Our country is $20 trillion in debt, with $9 trillion added to the national debt during the Obama years. We have the responsibility to our children and our grandchildren to stop this Congress' addiction to spending. It is a responsibility that I take seriously; it is a responsibility that the members of my committee take seriously; and it is a responsibility that Republicans in the House take seriously.  Clearly, it is not a responsibility that our friends across the aisle take seriously. Our budget works to end the addiction to spending that has dominated Washington for far too long.  The House budget, passed out of committee with unanimous Republican support in July, begins to address our spending addiction by balancing the budget over 10 years so that we can start paying down our national debt, and it addresses mandatory spending in a significant way for the first time since 1997.  This budget substitute does quite the opposite. The Democrats' budget raises taxes by $2.7 trillion, which would be the largest tax increase in U.history. It increases spending by $6.2 trillion, compared to the budget passed by my committee. It never balances, with a deficit in 2027 of $852 billion.  What we hear from the other side of the aisle and what we see in this budget is simply more of same: more spending, more tax increases, and more debt. I don't think that is acceptable, and neither do the American people.  Since we began this budget debate yesterday, my counterparts on the other side of the aisle have been throwing out misleading numbers about our budget and our tax reform effort in order to hide the fact that they offer no new solutions to the most pressing problems our country faces.  Here is a number that they should keep in mind while they discuss this fiscally irresponsible substitute. The national debt for every person is over $63,000. Every man, woman, and even child in our country has a $63,000 weight hanging over their heads. Our budget takes real steps to fix this crisis. This budget substitute does not. Honestly, it is as simple as that.  Mr.Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this Democrat substitute, and I reserve the balance of my time.

400,topic-id,1250,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of 71, our budget, Building a Better Our budget takes real, tangible steps to balance the budget, build a stronger military, unlock tax reform, and support an economy that creates opportunity for all  In past years, our budget resolution was a vision document, but this year it is different. With the election of President Trump, our budget goes from being a vision document to being a governing document that outlines how we build a better America for our children and our grandchildren.  Today, we have the opportunity to fulfill our promises to the American people. Balancing the budget by 2027 is our top priority. Our national debt stands at $20 trillion, with $9 trillion added over just the last 8 years. For too long, both parties in Washington have failed to abide by a simple principle that all American families and small businesses do, that we must live within our means.  Balancing the budget requires us to make some tough decisions, but the consequences of inaction far outweigh any political risk we may face.  Unless we take bold steps to bring our excessive spending and debt under control, a sovereign debt crisis is the natural conclusion. Failure to take swift and decisive action is not only inexcusable, it is immoral.  The budget resolution before us takes real steps to put our country on a sound fiscal path that balances in 10 years and will allow us to start paying down our national debt.  Building a Better America also assumes bold reforms to strengthening programs that our seniors and our most vulnerable citizens rely on and ensure that these programs can continue to serve them for generations to come.  While our budget includes reforms to discretionary spending, we also strongly believe that mandatory spending must be addressed in this budget resolution and in budget resolutions to come.  Mandatory spending is already more than two-thirds of all of our Federal spending, and that number will only continue to grow, and that is why our committee felt strongly about addressing mandatory spending programs in this budget through reconciliation.  Our budget requires 11 authorizing committees to find a minimum of $203 billion in savings and reforms over the 10-year budget window with an expectation that the reforms will result in significantly higher savings.  This package of mandatory reforms is the largest since the 1990s, through reconciliation, and it is the first step to change the culture of Washington in our spending.  Our budget also promotes tax reform and regulatory reform to get the Federal Government out of the way and allow our free market economy to thrive. The larger the government, the less freedom individuals and businesses have to thrive, grow, hire, and innovate. The Obama economy left millions of Americans behind with over 14 million people leaving the labor workforce in just the last 8 years.[[Page H7778]]  Through reconciliation, our budget specifically paves the way for progrowth tax reform that will reduce taxes for the middle class Americans and free up American businesses to grow and to hire. It will also simplify the Tax Code, allowing about 9 out of 10 Americans to file their taxes on a simple postcard.  Many of our friends across the aisle and in the media said that a 1.9 percent economic growth is the new normal and that we are doomed to continue the economic stagnation of the Obama years.  They have a pessimistic view of our Nation's ability to create jobs and to build our foundation of greater opportunity for all.  America has the greatest workers, the greatest innovators, and the entrepreneurial ethos to far surpass the economic growth of the last 8 years, if only the Federal Government would get out of the way.  In this budget, we put our trust in the American people. But a stronger economy is not enough; we must also strengthen our military.  The number one job of the Federal Government is to protect its citizens. Over the last 8 years, the weak foreign policy of President Obama has led to an increase in threats from all corners of the globe while the funding for our men and women in uniform has failed to keep pace. Building a Better America invests $621.5 billion in our military and $75 billion specifically for the global war on terrorism for fiscal year 2018. These resources will help our men and women in uniform complete the mission with which they have been tasked.  Building a Better America presents us with an opportunity to change the trajectory of our country forever. The election of President Trump was a signal to all of us that the American people will no longer accept the status quo.  This budget is also a very personal one for me. As I and my committee have gone through the long and arduous process of getting this budget to the floor, I have had to stop and think about not just what we are doing but where we are going.  I have a picture of my six grandchildren taped to the back of my voting card. I was a nurse for more than 40 years and still hold my license today. Government and public service was never an ambition of mine, but when I saw what was happening in my State and in this country, I couldn't sit back and do nothing.  Every time I put my voting card into a slot, I am reminded of why I left the career that I loved to join the political fray. It is for them. It is for my children and grandchildren and for yours as well.  I grew up in an America where a poor girl, whose parents' only ambition was for her to finish high school, could graduate from college, become a nurse, and eventually become a Member of the House of  I grew up in an America that was a land of--that is a land of opportunity and was a land of opportunity then of strength and of compassion. But that America is slipping away from us. For too many young people in this country, the opportunity to live the American Dream is out of reach. A government that was supposed to be of, by, and for the people has left them behind.  Building a Better America requires a government that spends within its means, a military with the resources to complete the mission, an economy that creates the opportunity for all, and a Federal bureaucracy that respects the taxpayers.  It also requires an understanding that the greatness of America does not lie in the grand buildings and the stone pillars of Washington, D.The greatness of America lies in the spirit and the tenacity of the people.  We designed Building a Better America to put this vision into practice, to empower individuals to live their version of the American Future generations of Americans are counting on us, and failure is not an option.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the members of this committee for their hard work that they have done, for the months that we have worked tirelessly to come together and build a budget that reflects our principles.  It hasn't been easy, but producing a budget that puts our vision for fiscal sanity into practice will be worth it, and I thank each and every one of you for your hard work.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

414,topic-id,784,"Mr.Chair, I want to remind my colleagues from the other side of the aisle that, during the time of the previous administration, there was $9 trillion added to the debt, 1.9 percent economic growth, and that was the high of that period of time, and there were 14 million people who left the labor workforce. If their policies worked, we wouldn't see these kinds of statistics.  Mr.Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock), a member of our Budget  Mr.Mr.Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership on this important issue.  Mr.Chairman, for the first time in many years, this budget uses reconciliation for the purpose it was intended: to bring mandatory spending under control.  The appropriations that dominate so much of the debate comprise less than one-third of our total spending, and that is called discretionary spending. The budget sets a level; the appropriations process spends to that level. That is everything from general government to defense.  We have actually been able to bring that under control, but the other two-thirds of spending is called mandatory spending. It is beyond the annual control of It continues automatically until and unless the statutes that call for it are actually changed.  It is the mandatory spending that is eating our country alive. Mandatory spending is supposed to be controlled by reconciliation. Instructions are sent to the various authorizing committees to make whatever changes are necessary in current law to stay within our means. But this powerful fiscal tool has been ignored or squandered in past budgets, and this neglect is undermining the solvency of our country.  For the first time in many years, the House budget finally restrains mandatory spending by instructing our committees to find at least $200 billion in savings over the next decade. That means this budget will get us back to balance within the decade, and this is why it is so important.  If the Democrats had their way and we maintain our current path, the Congressional Budget Office warns that in just 4 years, in 2022, our deficits will surpass $1 trillion a year. That is where economists warn we run the risk of damage or even loss of our access to credit, a sovereign debt crisis.  If you want to know what that looks like, Venezuela is going through it right now, and within our own territory, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico--pension systems implode, basic services falter, the economy collapses.  Two years after that, in 2024, 6 years from now, the CBO warns that the annual interest cost on our debt will reach $654 billion. That is more than we currently spend on defense.  I would remind my friends on the left that you cannot provide for the common defense or promote the general welfare if you can't pay for it, and the ability of our country to do so is being undermined by our spending trajectory.  At the same time, we charge the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, sending trillions of dollars of capital and hundreds of thousands of jobs to other countries. In the last 8 years, we have averaged only half of our postwar economic growth.  I remind my friends that corporations do not pay corporate taxes. Corporate taxes can only be paid in one of three ways: by consumers through higher prices, by employees through lower wages, by investors through lower earning. Cutting corporate taxes means lower prices for consumers, higher wages for employees, and higher earnings for investors.  Tax relief is absolutely vital to reviving the economy, but experience does warn us that revenue growth only partially offsets revenue lost to tax reductions. Indeed, when we are told that the choice is between taxes and debt, those are two sides of the same coin.  Taxes and debt are the only two possible ways to pay for spending. Once we have spent a dollar, we have already decided to tax it. We either tax it now, or we borrow it now and tax it later. Either way, it is entirely driven by spending. By restraining spending, this budget makes possible the tax relief that our economy desperately needs to grow.  Frankly, we could do much more if we summon the political will, and I will be presenting such a budget tomorrow on behalf of the Republican Study  But this budget moves us a long way in the right direction. It sets in motion the policies that Presidents from Calvin Coolidge to John Kennedy to Ronald Reagan have all used to revive and expand our economy. It brings us closer to that day when families will awaken to a new and prosperous morning for  ",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgH7777-2.txt,2063,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON.

Mr.Chairman, I do want to just begin this next section by making a brief comment about my good friend from Kentucky, who has been using some information off of Forbes as he responds to our speakers. I just want to say, I went out to look at Forbes to see what was on Forbes while we were on this brief intermission, and I found this article that was in Forbes just the day before yesterday that does say that the GOP tax framework is a pay raise for middle class families.                              {time}  1715  I encourage people to take a look at this. It actually does some scenarios for what we know at this point in time. However, I do want to say that what has been put out is a framework. It doesn't really have enough details to give too much on these scenarios, because there are some very important pieces that are missing.  Guessing on these key points really doesn't allow us to do a proper analysis. Things like the brackets have not been definitively defined, and neither have the income thresholds or the enhanced child credit.  I think it is a little bit disingenuous to think that is really where we should be using those numbers right at this point in time to give a definitive scenario. I did want to say that that would be a good thing for people to look at if they would like to get a brief idea.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

513,topic-id,1586,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter that has been signed by 242 agencies and think tanks supporting this budget.  Among those who have signed this letter are the American Bankers Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, Americans for Tax Reform, Business Roundtable, Financial Services Forum, Manufactured Housing Institute, National Association of Manufacturers, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, National Grocers Association, National Retail Federation, Tennessee Chamber of Commerce & Industry, The Kentucky Chamber, and U.Chamber of Commerce, among many others.                                               September 28, 2017.     To The Members of the United States Congress: We urge      Congress to expeditiously pass a budget resolution with      reconciliation instructions so that the promise of tax reform      can be made a reality.       It has been 31 years since Congress last reformed the tax      code. Since then, the code has become an anchor weighing down      the economy, job creation, and wage growth for American      families.       This Congress has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix      the problem. Over the past several years, tremendous work has      been done to prepare for this moment. In the 113th Congress      the Ways and Means Committee conducted a comprehensive look      at tax reform. Last year House Republicans released a      Blueprint for reform. During the last Congress, the Senate      Finance Committee convened bi-partisan working groups that      tackled all the major aspects of reform.       President Trump has outlined his goals for reform, and the      ``Group of Six''--consisting of members from the House,      Senate, and Administration--has presented a framework to      guide the drafting and markup of legislation in the Ways and      Means and Finance       While much work remains to be done, we believe Congress is      well-positioned to move forward with comprehensive, pro-     growth tax reform.       The single-most important next step is for Congress to      adopt a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions      that will permit tax reform to move forward without the      threat of a filibuster.       Just like Members of Congress, each of our organizations      will continue to advocate for specific priorities within tax      reform as the relevant committees and ultimately the full      House and Senate consider tax reform legislation.       But failing to pass a budget resolution now may mean that      tax reform never moves forward. That outcome is unacceptable      to all of us and ought to be unacceptable to every Member of      Congress who has advocated for reform.

It is essential that the Federal budget returns to balance within the 10-year budget period because runaway Federal debt is not political or partisan--it is an economic, generational, and civil rights issue.

Re 2018 House Budget Resolution and the Compact for a          Balanced     Diane Black,     Chairman, House Budget Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Black: We have reviewed the text of the      budget resolution reported by your Committee (House      Concurrent Resolution 71) and write to offer our support.      That rarest of political outcomes--sound policy that      represents a win-win scenario for normally divergent      factions--is possible as the budget process moves forward.       Our nation is facing a fiscal crisis. It is essential that      the federal budget returns to balance within the ten-year      budget period because runaway federal debt is not political      or partisan--it is an economic, generational and civil-rights      issue. We commend you and your Committee for reporting a      resolution that balances within the budget period; its      adoption is very much in the national interest.       We also commend the Committee for including Section 501 in      the resolution, which endorses adding a balanced budget      requirement to the       Section 501 identifies the Compact for a Balanced Budget,      which we represent on behalf of current and future member      states. We believe the most practical, prudent enforcement      mechanism is the state-of-the-art balanced budget amendment      (BBA) being proposed by the This state-of-the-art      BBA has been specifically designed to overcome concerns      expressed in 40 years of congressional hearings that have      considered how a BBA should be drafted. Such concerns may      have prevented prior BBAs from being proposed.       To advance the policy prescription in Section 501 of the      budget resolution in the House, we recommend: updating this      section to reflect that the concurrent resolution to      effectuate the Compact (House Concurrent Resolution 73) was      introduced on July 26, 2017; and incorporating the language      of House Concurrent Resolution 73 into Section 501. This      could be done as one of several amendments you are probably      already planning to bring up during floor consideration as      the manager's package, and requires only a majority vote as      opposed to the two-thirds required for balanced budget      amendment proposals made by members of       Taking these steps establishes a strong enforcement      mechanism, sustaining the budget resolution following its      adoption. It would also strengthen the appeal of the budget      resolution to fiscal conservatives in the House and taking      these steps prior to the consideration of legislation to      raise the debt ceiling should expedite approval of that      legislation.       Supermajorities of Americans have demanded a balanced      budget for decades. Our nation's debt threatens future      generations to default or austerity, but we believe there's a      chance here for a third option: principled leadership on the      matter of debt and spending.       We hope you and your Committee members will agree that      there is a path here which acknowledges the need for long-     term fiscal[[Page H7803]]     sanity while also meeting shorter-term political and policy      needs.

523,topic-id,1483,"Mr.Chairman, I want to just bounce off of that and take a look at the chart that we have here. When we take a look at interest--and somehow we don't always talk that much about interest here. We talk about borrowing money and raising our debt ceiling continually. I have been here now for 6\1/2\ years, and the conversation is about raising that debt ceiling so that we can pay for our debt, but there comes interest on that.  Just as when we go to a bank and we borrow money, we have to pay interest on that. I remember years ago, when I bought my first house, we were at a period of time when President Carter was the President and the interest rates were outrageous, and our interest rate on our house at that time, when we purchased it as a young married couple, was, I think, somewhere between 14 and 16 percent.  Interest rates now are very much more reasonable for young couples purchasing. And so I want to turn our attention to this chart here to take a look at the outlays in 2027 under the CBO baseline.  If we continue down this path that we are going in, without taking a look at our mandatory spending, the amount of money that we borrow, and the debt that we pile up with an interest to it, just what will that look like?                              {time}  1745  I think if we look at our own household and we would say that our interest that we are paying on the credit card or whatever, or the car interest or the House mortgage, if it were more than all of the other things like the food and maybe the education for our children and buying books and pencils and things that they need for school, we would be looking at the way in which we were managing our household income and saying, wow, that is not something we want to keep doing. We are going to have to get on some kind of a budget plan and reverse the trajectory of where we would be going.  So here we are. At the end of the period of 2027, if we look at 17 years down the road and we don't do anything about the kind of mandatory spending, which is two-thirds of our budget, currently, and continues to grow, here is what happens:  We see $768 billion being spent on interest alone.  We see the next one down, the defense, at $741 billion. We would actually be paying more in interest than we were in the security of our Nation and supporting our men and women who serve in the military, and all of the supplies and the necessary equipment that it takes to protect them as they protect us.  Look at what happens with We will be spending less on Medicaid that is for people who are the blind, the disabled, the elderly, the children, the pregnant mothers.  We talk about wanting to put our money and our values where we see the values really belong. Is this really where we want our values to be in the money that we spend, $768 billion in interest compared to what we are spending on our military, what we are spending on our Medicaid?  Look at our veterans, our veterans that we talk about how much we honor them: $248 billion as opposed to $768 billion in interest.  Again, we must question where we are going and if this is the right direction. Is this the direction that we can all just raise our hand up and say, yes, we are making good decisions for the future of our country? Because look at where the interest is compared to the other programs that we both, Republicans and Democrats, have said are so important to us.  Over and over again, we have had colleagues on both sides of the aisle go and speak about the importance of what our values are. Our budget is a vision of what our values are.  Transportation, and I have heard more and more times on both sides of the aisle talking about infrastructure, how important that is for our Look at what our transportation and our infrastructure will be. I don't know that we want to spend only $110 billion on that and $768 billion on interest. Think of how many roads we could build, how many bridges we could repair if we reverse this trajectory.  Then, finally, at the bottom here is science-based technology. We all want to be competitive with those around the world to make sure that we are spending the money where we need to spend the money to stay in front of these other nations with our science and our space and our technology.  I want to recommend here that there are only two other programs, Social Security and Medicare, that exceed that net interest. So we will say Social Security, Medicare, and then our net interest; and from there, everything else that we say, both the Republicans and the Democrats, are so important, that we say are our values, are going to be underneath the interest. I don't think that is really where we want to go.  I have to think, my oldest grandchild right now is 19 years old, soon to turn 20, when he is 30 years old, he might say to me: Mimi, what were you doing when you were in Congress? What were you doing to help us, because now we are paying more in interest than we are all of these other programs that we contend to be so important to us?  So these are difficult decisions to make, I will acknowledge that. But I will also say to you, as someone who--I consider myself to be a policy wonk. As I look at these various programs, I say there is nothing that we are doing in my life that I did 40 years ago that I am doing exactly the same. So if a program has been around for 40 years, should we not want to say maybe we can reform it? Not necessarily cut, but, in the reforming, you may find a way to decrease the spending that you are doing in that program.  Can't we all lock arms, Democrats and Republicans, and acknowledge that there are some decisions that have to be made with programs that have been there for a very long time?  Can we not acknowledge that there are some programs that perhaps have fraud, waste, and abuse that we can take care of, take that money and use it in these places where we really say our values lie?  So I would say that, as we talk about this budget, I am very proud of what we have done in this budget, in the cuts or, as I say, reforms in those programs that would result in $203 billion worth of savings over a 10-year period, that these are programs that we gave the committees of jurisdiction an opportunity to look within their jurisdiction and to make those decisions and do the homework. It is your jurisdiction; it is not mine. We gave them recommendations and suggestions, but it is their jurisdiction.  Let them evaluate where it is that there are programs that can have new and creative ideas, things that can save us money, not necessarily using the word ``cut,'' but in savings. Yes, you may have some cuts that are done, but these are good cuts. These are things that you have spent a lot of time thinking about.  That is really where we want to go. That is what this budget does is it says: Open up your minds. Think differently. Let's not do things the same old way and keep putting the same old programs out there that maybe aren't working.  And you know what? Maybe they are not even working for the people that we give them to. Maybe they are not working for them, because work is dignity.  When we say that someone who is able-bodied and without any dependents should be at work, that is not cruel. Do you know what that is? That is dignity. When people go to work, it is a dignified activity.  I always say, after I ask you what your name is, and we all do it, we say: What do you do? And when someone cannot tell you what they do, they don't feel dignified.  Look, I don't want to be cruel to people who are disabled, people who are having a really tough time and have other circumstances, but we should acknowledge that there is dignity in work; and when we can give people an opportunity to have that dignity, we should be willing to stand up and do that.

As technology continues to evolve, the more we can celebrate the ability we have to save a baby at just 20 weeks after conception is truly remarkable. I remember when I first became a nurse some 40 years ago. I vowed to devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care, whether they were born or unborn. I am still committed to that today. And 40 years later, the science tells us that after 20 weeks of pregnancy, unborn babies are able to feel pain inside the womb.  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act protects those who cannot protect themselves when handed a death sentence.  Madam Speaker, there are currently seven countries in the world that allow elective late abortions, countries such as North Korea and  Why in the world is the United States on a list of countries characterized as human rights abusers?

I do want to ask my colleague to consider this: Are we proud of a country where we are leaving our children and grandchildren in further and further debt?  During our discussion in this Chamber, we have shared our ideas for building a better America, an America that we would be proud to entrust to future generations. While it requires confronting real challenges along the road ahead, it is, undoubtedly, worth the journey.  First, our budget forces the Federal Government to live within its means, just like hardworking Americans and small businesses do on a daily basis.  Second, our budget identifies wasteful spending and finds much-needed savings and reforms for unsustainable mandatory spending. In fact, our committee has put forward the largest reform package for mandatory programs that has been seen in 20 years.  Third, it calls for a robust funding of our military, ensuring the resources that will allow us to be ready and protect our mainland. It also starts the process of restoring our military readiness, which suffered dramatically during the Obama administration.

26,topic-id,585,"Madam Speaker, what if the headline in the morning paper was slightly different? What if we had a disease that had killed 59 people yesterday and sickened over 500 others? Do you think the Nation would demand action?  If we had an outbreak every day that had over 100,000 people a year killed and injured, Congress would be in a frenzy. Yesterday, we found 2 minutes for a moment of silence, and we moved on.  Gun violence is a public health hazard every bit as important as any other disease or outbreak. Ours is the only developed country in the world that cannot protect our families from death and injury from guns on a massive scale.  After years of frustration in Congress and another school shooting in my district, I sat down with my constituents to go through, what are the things that we can do that would make a difference?  We understood that you cannot completely stop evil people. There is not a statute that is foolproof, but our statutes are filled with efforts to try to make things better.  Let's stop dealing with gun violence as a political issue and think about it as the public health epidemic that it is, already claiming over 12,000 lives in the United States this year.  We attacked auto death and safety in a resolute fashion. It didn't happen overnight that we made automobiles safer and our highways less dangerous, but we stayed at it with law enforcement, with engineering, and with research, and we cut the rate of death over half.  We are starting now to deal with massive addiction and overdose as a medical condition that requires treatment, not just law enforcement with harsh punishment.  My report outlined nine areas where we could take action. There are 26 bills in Congress now that deal with these items, and we haven't been able to deal with them meaningfully: no hearings and certainly nothing on the floor of the  There are provisions to keep guns away from the most dangerous users. Even members of the NRA support that. We can improve the mental health system. We can authorize and increase research into gun safety.  There is an outrageous provision in United States law that prevents the Centers for Disease Control to research gun violence that was authored by our late colleague Jay Dickey from Arkansas who, later in life, realized that was a horrific mistake. We ought to be able to understand and find ways to help prevent it.  We can control access to the most dangerous products. We can increase product safety for guns, which are inherently dangerous. We can empower healthcare professionals to deal with families to help prevent gun violence and understand what risks their families face, rather than outrageous provisions that seek to limit what healthcare professionals can do to deal with their patients. We can effectively regulate the sale of firearms. There should be no hidden sales where we do not have background checks.  This is all within our capacity. We can enforce existing laws, and we can mitigate the loss of life in shooting by helping provide more resources for first responders.  This isn't pie in the sky. This will do nothing to take away the rights of Americans who want to target shoot or hunt. What it will do, is start the slow, steady process toward making our families safer and make sure that America is not the only developed country that cannot protect its families from gun violence.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7675-4.txt,99,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 36, PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD",2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since its formation in 1957 with the merging of the Connecticut Federation of Labor and the Connecticut State Industrial Union Council, the Connecticut State AFL-CIO has demonstrated an impressive dedication to the wellbeing of workers across the The organization seeks fair and equal treatment for workers through collective bargaining on their behalf and promoting legislation to create good jobs and provide people with the skills needed for them.  Simply, they strengthen the middle class, allowing tens of thousands of people to own a home, raise their families, and retire with financial security.  Uniting workers and their families toward these common goals, the Connecticut AFL-CIO has fought continuously and ceaselessly for better wages, benefits, and conditions for the working families of the Throughout its six decades, the Connecticut AFL-CIO has facilitated union member access to insurance plans, credit cards, and beneficial mortgage programs.  Always looking for ways to raise the standard of living for our middle-class workers, the Connecticut AFL-CIO was one of the early leaders in the fight to achieve affordable and accessible quality healthcare, pay equity, and parental and medical leave for all employees. The Connecticut AFL-CIO also helps those who have lost their jobs, supporting fair unemployment compensation laws and education and job training programs.

784,topic-id,1388,"Mr.President, we have been here before. We have been here in the wake of Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Orlando, numerous other mass shootings, and now Las  We can all agree that our hearts and prayers, mourning and condolences go out to the families of loved ones who have suffered this senseless, horrific violence. We can also agree that many of the details are unknown about the shooter, and a lot of investigation will be done. We can all agree that Las Vegas was struck by evil; call it pure evil.  We know what it looks like in Connecticut because we saw it firsthand in We lived through the heartbreaking, unspeakable violence of that day, just a few years ago, when evil visited Newtown and caused the death of 26 beautiful human beings, including 20 children. America came together in support of us in Connecticut, and today we should come together in support of the people of  My heart and prayers are with them, but thoughts and prayers are not enough. We know the evil that visited Connecticut also brought forth good in other people--in the first responders, the doctors, and countless members of the community and people of America who united.  I will never forget that day in Newtown when the community came together in Rose of Lima Church for an evening of mourning. I said then that the whole world was watching. Indeed, what the world saw was courage and resilience of truly heroic proportions--some of the good along with the evil.  When I saw those images today in Las Vegas--the sound of that gunfire, the pandemonium, the reports of injuries and deaths--it brought back to me that day in I was not there for the shooting, as I had gone later in the day, but the memories of that day and of the successive days, weeks, and years had been brought back. My heart broke, but my stomach also churned with anger. I was frustrated and furious.  I am now furious because Congress has failed to act. Nothing has changed since Congress has been complicit when we have had numerous opportunities and many reasons to make America safer and adopt commonsense measures that 90 percent of Americans support. So thoughts and prayers are not enough. Hand-wringing and soul-searching is needed, but it is insufficient. What is needed now is action.  I am under no illusions. Nobody needs to tell me where the votes are at this moment. We need to be realistic about what the agenda is in our going forward. We need to be very clear-eyed and realistic, but we also need to recognize that we can win this fight. Between the time that Ronald Reagan had almost been assassinated and the day that the Brady bill had passed, it had been almost 10 years. We need to be in this fight as a marathon, not as a sprint, and that is the determination and resolve that must be brought to this effort.  It was 5 years ago when a man wielding a semiautomatic rifle murdered 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in The cries of grief echoed around this country, and there was a moment when action could have been taken. We need to seize this moment. Then, the vote, shamefully, failed to reach 60 for commonsense measures, like background checks. We needed 60, and we had a majority, and our colleagues in the House of Representatives told us that that measure would have passed there.  Since then, every day in this country an average of 92 Americans die due to gun violence, which is 33,000 Americans every year, and 59 is the death toll as of this moment in Las Day after[[Page S6266]]day, 92 Americans are killed as a result of gun violence, and 60 of them are suicides, but that is no less a death, and it is a preventable death if there are commonsense measures that will stop this carnage.  I would be happy never to speak about this topic, never to complain again about Congress's complicity, but our hearts break, and our stomachs churn with fury. America's should as well. After Newtown, Aurora, Blacksburg, Charleston, Chattanooga, Lafayette, San Bernardino, Orlando, and, now, Las Vegas, these cities have become synonymous with mass shootings--unjustly tarnished. What is needed is national resolve.  For anyone who says that we should only mourn or offer condolences, let me just say, very simply: Let us honor those victims and keep faith with their memories, so that their lives and losses will not be in vain, by taking action that makes America safer. Let us redouble our determination. The bills are ready to go, the agenda is set, and the action is clear. Let us honor their memories through action. If the President believes this carnage was pure evil, let him lead--if not today, tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, Wednesday, when he visits Las If these actions were pure evil, let us all lead by our example, and let us move forward to stop this carnage in the future. We grieve these losses, but we need to recognize that the measures now before Congress are a travesty and a dishonor to those lives that were lost.  One of these proposals is an innocuous-sounding Hearing Protection Act--let me repeat: the Hearing Protection Act--which could come to a vote as early as this week in the House of This measure would gut regulations on gun silencers.  Now, let's be very clear. Silencers are already widely available to hundreds of sportsmen who pay the fee, register, and wait for a short period. This legislation would make it terrifyingly easy to buy a gun silencer. Hunters and recreational shooters deserve to have silencers but only if they comply with those regulations. This measure would pose an unacceptable risk to public safety and make it more difficult for law enforcement, especially in urban areas, to identify gunshots, locate shooters, and protect civilians.  In one interview after another of the victims of last night's shooting, there was a common refrain: They ran, and they escaped because they heard those gunshots. The only supposed reform measure before the Congress right now that has been given a chance of passage is a proposal to make it easier to buy gun silencers. The only thing that led those individuals to escape--or one of the only things--was, in fact, the sound of gunshots. How many lives would have been taken last night if the shooter had had a silencer?  Another proposal is the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would essentially eliminate the States' ability to regulate concealed-carry permits in their States, undermining the laws that States like Connecticut have put in place to keep our residents safe.  In the wake of Newtown, Charleston, Orlando, and, now, Las Vegas, Members of Congress should come together to protect our lives from these senseless killings. It is not about Republicans or It is not about politics. It is not even about policy. It is about public safety, simply. We should not be undermining protection. What a travesty and tragedy and what a dishonor to the memories of those victims in Las Vegas to now be on the verge of weakening rather than strengthening our public safety laws.  Let's join hands across the aisle and across both Houses to stand up to the gun lobby, the NRA, and other special interests and release and break their grip on More than thoughts and prayers are necessary, although they fulfill a vitally important function. Talk must be turned into action. Waiting simply means more deaths, and delay means time. Time is not on our side with there being 92 deaths, on average, every day as a result of gun violence.  Let us join together and combat evil. Certainly, it was there in Las Vegas, but it will visit other communities, as it does every day. Those 92 deaths and mass shootings will continue unless commonsense, sensible measures, like a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, are adopted, as well as there being mandatory background checks for all gun sales. Until this is adopted, America will be more at risk. We must make America safer, and that is an obligation that we share across the aisle and across the two bodies of  Thank you.

234,topic-id,1458,"Mr.President, I am not aware of any Missouri constituents, for whom I work, who wouldn't like to see a tax code that was simpler, fairer, that did more to create jobs, that was better for individuals, and one that they understood. I don't have anybody come up to me and say: What can we do to complicate the Tax Code further, or what can we do to make us less competitive, or how much more of my money would you like to have to do what you think the government ought to do? I don't have anybody say that to me.  We are now at a time when we have the tools available. We have the focus available that will allow us to move in the right direction. For almost a decade now, hard-working families and hard-working individuals have had to deal with a below-average economy and with below-average wage growth in that below-average economy. Surely, we don't want that to be the new normal.  I kept hearing the last 3 or 4 years that 2 percent growth is what we should expect now. The growth since World War II has averaged 3.4 percent for over 70 years. Suddenly, we were told: No, 2 percent is the best we can do.  I understand that, even counting the Great Depression, growth in the entire 20th century was over 3 percent. What do we need to do to get our economy growing in a way that creates better opportunities and better jobs?  Why would it create better jobs? Because you have people who are looking for workers who are more eager to pay and keep a workforce in a growing economy than you do in an economy that is not growing. You have people who understand they can compete better if they have a workforce that is the workforce they want rather than the workforce they just happen to get and that there is competition for that workforce. So our goal here in tax reduction and tax reform should be to help families and individuals keep more of their hard-earned money, to empower people to invest in their own[[Page S6309]]future in ways that we currently are not encouraging or just simply not allowing because we don't let them take enough of their money home from work that they make at work, and to make it easier for families to see a pathway toward success and not to penalize people when they make the right decisions.  The tradition has always been this: If you want more of something, you don't tax it. You don't regulate it. You encourage it.  We need a tax code that encourages more success, that encourages higher take-home pay and better jobs. Most people don't realize that the individual income tax is still the biggest source of Federal money. More than half of all Federal taxes collected come from the income tax.  One of our goals should be how do we get more taxpayers and not how do we make more from the taxpayers we have. Perhaps the greatest voluntary compliance in the history of the world is how Americans have complied with the income tax system.  The more Americans think the system is fair and understandable and everybody else is being treated the same way they are being treated, they are much more likely to comply with that system than a system where they hear: Well, some company made a lot of profit, but because of the complexity of the Tax Code, they paid zero taxes, or this neighbor has figured out that and that neighbor has figured out that, and because of the Tax Code, you work just as hard as they did, but the Federal Government somehow got a lot of your money because you hadn't set up your tax planning in the right way.  Tax planning doesn't need to be that difficult. Right now the Tax Code has seven individual rates. We are proposing three individual rates, which maybe could go to four, but that would still be barely half the number we have, even if it got to four. There are seven individual rates, and there are more than 100 deductions, credits, and exclusions that people use when they fill out their tax form. American people collectively pay billions and billions of dollars just to figure out how much of their money the Federal Government is going to get.  Most people would like to have the certainty of a postcard form that you fill out, but instead they see this system that has gotten increasingly complex, often not indexed for inflation. So you start with something that you think is only going to apply to a few people, and, before you know it, it applies to a whole lot of people.  I think that when the alternative minimum tax was added to the Tax Code, there had been 155 wealthy individuals who hadn't paid any income tax. So the Federal Government decided, and Congress decided, that we are going to put the alternative minimal tax in to be sure those 155 people, who are clearly wealthy people, are going to pay income tax. No matter how much they have gamed the tax system, they are still going to pay an alternative minimum tax. This was just a few years ago.  By 2015, the 155 had gone to 4.4 million people who paid the alternative minimum tax. It is unbelievably successful if you are trying to collect people's money in a way they don't understand. It is not very successful if all you were trying to do was to prevent 155 wealthy people a couple of decades ago from being able to not pay any tax at all. They took a shot at 155 people and wound up hitting 5 million.  That is unacceptable. That is not what the Tax Code is supposed to do. We need to work hard to simplify that. There are 14 pages of instructions that tell you or, more likely, your tax preparer how to comply with the alternative minimum tax guidelines.  I don't have the one page with me, but I was handed the one page of instructions for the Tax Code from 1913. By the way, the estimate was that not only not many people would pay it, but nobody would ever pay it because you didn't pay anything unless you made at least $3,000, which in 1913 was a lot of money. But it was one page of instructions. Now we have 1 page of index to the 100 pages of instructions, and 14 of those pages are just for the alternative minimum tax. When you fill the form out, there are 64 different lines that you use to calculate now how almost 5 million people are impacted by a part of the Tax Code that was designed for 155 people.  We can do a better job. We can do a better job of being sure that hard-working families get to take home more of the money they have earned with that hard work. We can also do a better job with the rest of the Tax Code to make sure we are creating the kind of opportunity for us to compete as a country, for us to compete as a nation, for us to be more fairly aligned with the other countries in the world that we compete with, and to make sure those hard-working families have better jobs with more take-home pay to start with.  If you are working hard for a living--and Americans do; we are a working country--the best of all circumstances is that you have a better job than you used to have and less money comes out of every dollar you make than used to come out of every dollar you make, and that needs to be our goal. Whatever we do on the individual side needs to be focused on that. Whatever we do on the job-creating side needs to be focused on that. If we do that, we will not have the people we work for come in complaining: What have you done? The Tax Code is too simple now. It is too easy to fill out my tax form. I am walking out on Friday with more money than I used to walk away with, and, oh, by the way, they tell me there is a better job about to develop that I can apply for.  That is what we ought to do. I hope we keep focused on that and get this tax bill passed this year.  I think the Senator from Georgia has come to talk about this same topic, along with Senator Barrasso from  I yield the floor.

1107,topic-id,742,"Mr.Speaker, this last week on Sunday, southern Illinois, the State of Illinois, and I believe this Nation mourned with the family and friends of a friend of mine by the name of Tom  About 2 weeks ago, we lost this local hero who spent decades on the front line of law enforcement combating the drug trade.  Tom began his career in Carbondale as just a local police officer with the department while he was in college. Over the years, he became an author, instructor, investigator, an expert witness, and an undercover agent. Even after retirement, he continued to serve the public as an adviser to local police departments that are still fighting the drug trade.  I came to know Tom, the good friend that he is, on November 23, 1988.  Mr.Speaker, you might ask, how in the world would you remember the day that you first met someone?  Well, I can remember that day because it was the day after my youngest daughter was born. Tom then was the head of what was known as the MEG unit--Metropolitan Enforcement Group--a drug task force that had been assigned, and he had been an undercover agent for quite some time.  And my sister actually was the secretary for that unit. So she had brought Tom over to see the new baby. While my wife was out of the room and I was in the room by myself, Tom came in. When he came in, he was introduced to me, and I told him how glad I was to finally meet him. Tom is a very big man, and at the time, he was an undercover agent, so his hair was grown out, his beard was grown out, and he was actually undercover in a motorcycle gang. He was all dressed in black, which he commonly did--actually, always did.  When my wife returned to the room, he is leaning over the top of the bassinet there where our daughter lay, looking at the baby. My wife came in and had this startled look on her face because she didn't see me and my sister in the room, and instantly she kind of had that mother reaction to try to protect a child. All of a sudden my sister jumped up and said: It is okay. This is Tom Tom McNamara is a police officer.  Her first words to Tom, who, as I said, became a very good friend with me and very good friends with her: Well, I want to let you know that I would not run to you in an alley if I am in trouble at night. You would not be the one I would run to.  He said: Then that is good. I am doing my job.  Tom McNamara taught other police officers the dangers and concerns. He served proudly as a police officer and as an undercover agent, but he also studied in great detail the harmfulness of certain drugs.  When I was a State legislator, he came to me in 1997 and said: Mike, I need to talk to you and then-Senator I need to explain to you about a drug that is so awful, that if a mother and a father would use it, it would make them not have any concerns for the safety of their children, because they are so focused on trying to get more of this drug. And they can actually make it in their kitchen. They can make it in their cars.  That was methamphetamines. That was when we first started drafting laws in the State of Illinois, under Tom's guidance, to try to deal with the meth problem that still exists.  Tom was also one of the first leaders that realized that there were these drugs like bath salts and all of these that are being used.  I don't even know how many people Tom McNamara has saved over the years. We will never know, I am sure, let me tell you, because of his ability and his willingness to work and always to stand in the back, not to be recognized, sometimes for his own safety. But, Mr.Speaker, he did it for the betterment of this Nation, and that is why I stand to recognize him today.  I thank his wife, Judy; his daughter, Rachel; his son-in-law, and their children for giving up this man to serve us, and serve us so well, for all the lives that he saved.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgH7758-2.txt,2243,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,4,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

232,topic-id,1361,"Mr.President, today we are considering the nomination of Randal Quarles to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of  Since 1984, Mr.Quarles has revolved between the public and private sectors. He was most recently the director of the Carlyle Group from 2007 to 2013, and then founded Cynosure Group, an investment management company.  I appreciate Mr.Quarles' willingness to serve the public once again, but I don't think he is the person we want in this important role at the Federal  The financial crisis devastated communities in my State and across the country--devastated in terms of lost jobs, foreclosed homes, and evaporated savings. We have made a lot of progress in the 7 years since we passed Wall Street reform. The Vice Chair of Supervision at the Federal Reserve, a position created in Dodd-Frank, is supposed to look out for our financial system and make sure that our financial system is sound.  Mr.Quarles served as Treasury's Under Secretary for Domestic Finance in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. It was his job to coordinate oversight of the financial industry. Many of his statements, however, leading up to the crisis were far too credulous. He seemed to believe whatever the banks were telling him. They were far too credulous when it came to industry claims that we simply need not worry; the economy is in good shape and we don't have to worry about a credit bubble.  In the early 2000s, while at the Treasury Department, Mr.Quarles espoused the following view of the role of regulators in financial markets. It is a long quote, and I will quote him directly:       Markets are always ahead of the regulators, and frankly      that's how it should be. It's analogous to the advice that my      father[[Page S6308]]     provided me that ``if you don't miss at least two or three      planes a year, you're spending too much time in airports.''      If the regulators aren't a little behind the market in a few      areas at any given time, they would be stifling innovation      and evolution. The regulators' task is to promote investor      protection, while ensuring that prudential and supervisory      activities do not stifle efficiency gains. For effective      regulation, the regulators must work with the markets.  I am not sure where to start on picking that apart. More importantly, it is showing that someone who says that shouldn't be in charge of financial regulation at the Federal  He said at his Senate nomination hearing: ``That is probably the most unfortunate use of language that I ever made, and I do not stand behind that statement.'' That is what he said when presented with these words at his confirmation hearing. He made other similarly unfortunate statements in the years leading up to the financial crisis.  In 2006, as Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, he discussed the prospects for an impending financial crisis. This was before things looked really, really bad. He said:       How would our current financial system stand up to this      sort of canonical crisis? On the whole, I would say that the      U.economy is well positioned to weather such a      retrenchment in risk-taking.  This was about a year and a half before the economy began to implode. He was in a high position in the Treasury Department, and he had access to all of the information he might possibly want, and he said that the ``economy is well positioned to weather such a retrenchment.''  In the same speech, on the potential harm posed by increases in mortgage payments for families with exotic mortgages he said:       While that is certainly a large number, it represents only      a small hit to aggregate personal income. Moreover, market      reports indicate that borrowers using such non-traditional      mortgages tend to be upper income individuals that can manage      a sizable increase in their mortgage payment.  He concluded by saying, again, in 2006:       Fundamentally, the economy is strong, the financial sector      is healthy, and our future looks bright. We will surely face      challenges in the future, but we can take comfort in the      knowledge that our economy and financial system have      proven remarkably resilient to all manner of adverse      shocks in the past.  That was a lot of comfort to the millions of Americans afflicted by the financial crisis.  My wife and I live in Cleveland, in ZIP Code 44105. The year after Mr.Quarles made that statement and the economy started to really tank, my ZIP Code had more foreclosures than any other ZIP Code in the United I know what that does to a neighborhood.  I am not confident Mr.Quarles took to heart the costly lessons of the financial crisis. He seems far too ready to relax the rules for Wall Street and those who protect consumers. He is another example that this administration, which said it wants to drain the swamp, instead looks like a retreat for Goldman Sachs executives. The number of people on Wall Street who have influence on our government is just far and away worse than we have ever seen it.  Putting Mr.Quarles--who should know better but apparently doesn't, from his statements--at the Federal Reserve, in charge of financial regulation, is just the wrong thing. In 2015, when asked about Dodd-Frank, he said:       The macro issue is that the government should not be a      player in the financial sector. It should be a referee. And      the practice, and the policy, and the legislation that      resulted from the financial crisis tended to make the      government a player. They put it on the field as opposed to      simply reffing the game.  How could he think that, when he was part of the government when it didn't do its job and didn't do the job that regulators are supposed to do? In response to questions for the record at his nomination hearing, he stated: ``My approach to policy making, and particularly to regulation, has been that the discretion of policy makers, and particularly of regulators, should be as constrained as possible.''  He is really saying: Let Wall Street do what it wants to do; let Wall Street run the financial sector of our economy, and government regulators should sort of step aside.  As vice chair for supervision and as a Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Mr.Quarles will be making decisions about risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, resolution plans, concentration limits, risk committees, stress tests, and other important safeguards put into place after the crisis for the Nation's largest banks. The crisis showed we need strong financial watchdogs, not, as he said, ``constrained'' ones. If confirmed, I am not sure who Mr.Quarles will be working for, taxpayers and working families or Wall  Let me close by reminding my colleagues that, last Congress, the Banking Committee refused to consider President Obama's nominees to the Federal Reserve Mr.Quarles is the first nominee President Trump has chosen. There are currently three other vacancies. The term for Chair of the Federal Reserve expires early next year. Because of that, President Trump will likely fill at least five of the seven Federal Reserve Board seats, which are 14-year terms.  Again, if the first one is someone who is so close to Wall Street, what does that tell you about who is in the White House? What does it tell you about the advisers in the White House? What does it tell you about that executive retreat for Goldman Sachs I talked about in the White House?  If all the nominees to the Federal Reserve are like Mr.Quarles, average Americans may once again pay the price. We can't return to a time when financial watchdogs are asleep on the job.  There seems to be a collective amnesia in this body, in the White House, and in the Banking Committee about what people in our country went through in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, which was, in large part, because of the influence of Wall Street in our government. We can't let that happen. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination of Mr.Quarles to the Federal  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1112,topic-id,175,"Mr.Speaker, the Founding Fathers enshrined the guarantee of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They regarded life as a core promise and one that was to be protected. The Federal Government is responsible for protecting those rights, and currently we are failing at that responsibility.  As I speak in this body, America is one of only seven countries in the world that have legalized late-term elective abortion after 20 weeks. More specifically, it is estimated that approximately 13,000 late-term abortions are carried out in our country each year on healthy babies.  This is simply immoral and, as lawmakers, we have the ability to take commonsense measures to protect the unborn. The bill that we are voting on today, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, is one of those measures.  Mr.Speaker, every human being was given inalienable rights, chief among them being life itself. Governments are supposed to protect those rights. As a lawmaker, I plan to do so by supporting the bill before us today.

372,topic-id,385,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great American, Virginia Kimbrough Newell, who will celebrate her 100th birthday on Saturday, October 7. Newell has spent her entire lifetime in service to others as a civil rights activist, elected official, mentor, and friend.  Newell was born in Advance, North Carolina, to William and Dinah She graduated from historic Atkins High School in Winston-Salem and received a degree in mathematics from Talladega College in Talladega, She received her master's degree from New York University and a doctorate in education from the University of Sarasota in Sarasota,  After receiving her doctorate, Newell returned to her beloved North Carolina and taught mathematics at Washington High School and J.Ligon High School in Newell later joined the faculty at Shaw University in Raleigh as an associate professor of mathematics.  In 1965, Mr.Speaker, Newell joined Winston-Salem State University as a mathematics professor. She taught at that institution for 20 long years and served as chair of the mathematics department. Acknowledging her tremendous contributions to the university, the computer science center bears her name.  A dedicated public servant, Newell served as Winston-Salem city alderman for 16 years, where she focused on the needs of her constituents and advocated for those who were often without a voice. In recognition of her selfless advocacy, the city of Winston-Salem has named a street and walking trail in her honor.  Virginia Kimbrough married George Fisher Newell, a distinguished science professor, a marriage that lasted 46 long years. Two daughters were born to the marriage, my friend, Glenda Newell-Harris, and Virginia She is blessed with six grandchildren: Brittany, Phillip, Mary, Matthew, Mark, and  Newell is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, and is a platinum member of The Links, She is an Alpha Bette, which is a wife of an Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity man, and an Archousa, which is a wife of Sigma Pi Phi She has been a faithful member of First Baptist Church in Winston-Salem for more than 50 years.

920,topic-id,922,"Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak about the vote we will have at 5:30 p.m., but I want to give my condolences to those who have been impacted by the horrific shooting in Las Vegas and to the families and the victims of this horrible incident. I want them to know that our thoughts and prayers are with them as the whole Nation turns to this situation.  My thoughts and prayers also go out to at least one Washington family who was impacted and was at this event. We may find out that there are others. We are thinking and praying deeply for their recovery, and I hope everybody will take the time to say some thoughts and prayers for those who have been impacted by this incident.  Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in opposition to the nomination of Ajit Pai to have a second term as the Chairman of the The reason why we are speaking about this vote that will happen in a short period of time is because we are concerned about the future of innovation, the future of where consumers play in the decision making of how they access content, and the future of our economy.  What I am worried about is that, in the short period of time that Chairman Pai has been at the FCC, instead of the policies that would have enabled consumers, he has taken actions that, I think, will have consumers paying more for less access and with which media concentration will be more enabled and plans to protect net neutrality in an open internet will be reversed.  This, in and of itself, is the biggest issue that I and the economy of Washington State could possibly see with this renomination; that is to say, the State of Washington and the internet and innovation that exists there could be greatly impacted by the rolling back of protections that we have now, which say that you cannot artificially throttle or slow down internet activity and hold consumers hostage to paying more.  The mission of the FCC is to promote the use and deployment of communications in the public interest, and it is the job of the Chairman to make sure that mission is carried out. Undoing the existing net neutrality laws on the books, I do not think, is in the public interest, and it will not promote the access we need. Dismantling this rule that would preserve the diversity of content will negatively impact our marketplace for a long time.  When we think about some of the issues that we have already seen and what we could see in the future, more consumers will have to pay a toll to use the internet. What we will see is that, if you want to get in the fast lane or if you want to have rapid access, you have to pay more.  Today consumers are using mobile apps to preorder coffee, to get access to healthcare information, and to make sure that we protect ourselves from attacks on everything, from our electricity grid to people's homes and security systems. I am very worried that, if the internet's arteries are officially slowed down or clogged, critical information could arrive too late to help protect consumers.  We are living in a world where people are seeing things happen then using their smart phones to collect and share information that can keep all of us safe. So this is another reason why we want to make sure that consumers can get access to and share information and are not slowed down or throttled in any way.  When we think about this and the app economy that exists in Washington State, these are the fastest growing businesses. It is part of a large organization, where, today, 1.7 million Americans' jobs are because of these apps, and nearly 92,000 of them are in the State of They have grown at an annual rate of 30 percent. The average growth rate for all other jobs is 1.6 percent. Why would we confirm someone who has already pledged to roll back the rules of an open internet, which basically will create throttling and slowing down of content that will hurt the app economy and small businesses?  Nobody wants to develop a new application that connects consumers--whether it is in healthcare or protecting people in cyber or education or, for that matter, even the Senate--if they are going to have to pay a toll to get faster access to information or to get faster access to their customers.  Dismantling net neutrality puts our economy in jeopardy. While I know some would say that it is necessary for investment, I would say that instead what we have seen in the last several years, while the open internet rules have been in place, is the type of increased investment in the internet infrastructure that is needed to support its growing importance.  I do not agree with my colleagues who think this reversing the open internet rules is necessary to grow our investments. That's just what the large cable companies tell you they need so that they can build fast and slow lanes and charge consumers more if they want access to those fast lanes.  I encourage my colleagues to vote no on Ajit Pai for a second term as FCC Let's get focused on making sure we protect an open internet.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Moran).

595,topic-id,1038,"Madam President, last week, I rose to talk about the importance of tax reform. I believe this is a policy issue we cannot talk about enough and that we cannot emphasize enough. So, today, I rise to talk about how important the reform is to our small businesses, and in the coming weeks, I will be up here to talk about other important aspects of tax reform.  We are all from different States and other parts of the country, but we all know small businesses are a major economic driver in our country, as 95 percent of businesses in the United States are small businesses, and that number is even higher in my State of West Small businesses employ more than half of West Virginia's workforce. Yet our small businesses face a marginal tax rate as high as 39.6 percent. At the same time, their effective tax rate can vary widely. In fact, a CNBC survey showed that 22 percent of small businesses cannot really say what their effective tax rate really is.  Think about that.  If you are a small business that is a partnership or an LLC, then your profits are going to pass through to you and be taxed at the individual rate. There are currently seven individual tax brackets. Then you have credits and deductions. There is also a self-employment tax, and the list goes on. On top of that, small businesses can have Social Security and Medicare taxes, a Federal unemployment tax, and employment taxes. That is not even taking into account taxes like a State-level income tax or property tax and more. That is why businesses and individuals spend billions of dollars a year to comply with the Tax That is more than 18 hours for every man and woman and child in the United States of If I could give a visual here, that is basically 3 million people working full time on taxes for small businesses at a cost of $195 billion.  The point is, it is complicated. Our Tax Code is too complicated, and that is part of what tax reform is about--simplifying the Tax If Congress can simplify the Tax Code just to cut compliance costs in half, think of how many significant resources that would free up that would be better used to grow the economy, create jobs, raise wages, and expand businesses.  The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 325,000 small businesses across this country, called this tax reform framework a good start, and it has urged us to take swift action. According to a survey by Paychex, 41 percent of small business owners want tax reform to be the very top priority.  Whom will these reforms really help? We are going to have a long discussion on this. This is just part of whom they will help. They will help the small businesses that employ so many people in my home State of West They will help people like Eric Hott, of EH Chocolates & More, from Hampshire Eric has a great story. Eric grew up on a farm in Kirby, His mother was from Hornberg, While growing up, his grandmother was always cooking something. After graduating from high school, Eric moved to Germany to begin a culinary apprenticeship. By 2006, he had a chef apprenticeship at a five-star hotel in He went on to serve at events like the G8 Summit and for guests that included the German Chancellor and his First After running a patisserie in Germany, he moved to Switzerland, where he refined and perfected the art of chocolate-making. That sounds good to me. Then what did he do? He wanted to come home. He returned home to West He went back to Kirby, WV, and started his own small businesses--first EH Chocolates & More and, later, Farm Fresh Both are growing and delicious businesses.  Small businesses employ middle-class Americans who power this and other small businesses across the country. We need more folks like Eric--lots more--who are willing to take the risk, who have a good idea, and who want to stay and work in their own homes in rural America and certainly in our State of West Virginia, which has had a major economic downturn. We need more Eric We need to simplify the Tax Code for small businesses and let them focus on what they do best, which is refining their products, providing their services, and providing jobs for people in their various areas.  As much as any other policy that Congress can advance, tax reform will promote growth and provide job opportunities across this great country. Across the entire country, only two in five distressed communities have seen any job growth during the past 5 years. Fully 50 percent of U.job growth has occurred in just 2 percent of our country's counties.  We need to change that. We need to help small businesses that are major economic drivers in every part of our country. It is no wonder that small businesses have found it difficult to open, let alone succeed in many parts of our country. Because of our outdated Tax Code, real wages for most workers have barely increased for decades. By modernizing our Tax Code, we can create more opportunity and higher wages for We can achieve a simpler system with lower rates that is good for business and workers and, from the description I just put forward, would be a good time saver and resource saver.  The best thing about this in terms of small business is that it would lead to more jobs. Let's create an environment that leads to more investment in our States and continues to grow and build jobs. These are the changes hardworking West Virginians and Americans are hungering for. In order to make West Virginia the best place to live and work, now is the time for tax reform.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to make this a reality. Doing it will benefit so many--everyone in this country.  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.

915,topic-id,1081,"Madam President, I come here today to talk about the nomination of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, but before I begin, I think all of us have incredibly heavy hearts in our homes, in our States, in the country, and in the world, as the horrifying events of Las Vegas really begin to sink in.  I just saw an article come across the news line in my home State of West Virginia with one of the first identifications of the victims. Her name was Denise She is from Martinsburg, She and her husband Tony were at the concert together. They have been married 32 years. They were high school sweethearts and were there vacationing and at the concert. Tony wrote on his Facebook page that his wife died in his arms. So we have lost a mother of two, and soon to be a grandmother of five, to this horrible tragedy. My heart sinks for them and for everyone. I really don't have the words to say to comfort or explain or understand, except that I feel deeply sad and sorry, and I pray for them and their families.  Today, Madam President, I want to talk about the nomination and reappointment of Ajit Pai as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Chairman Pai has been an important partner in my quest to bring rural America and much of my State online. I was very lucky to meet Chairman Pai several years ago. Without question, he has been a champion.  Without question, high-speed internet access has allowed us to connect with one another on a scale we never could have imagined a decade ago. No other technology has become so critical to our daily lives. It is the backbone for our innovation, competition, and economic growth. From starting a business to digital learning and telemedicine, broadband access is critical to the strength of our economy and our communities. Unfortunately, for all the potential opportunities that broadband can offer, not having access to this important service can create insurmountable barriers.  Better connecting States like mine--West Virginia--through improved broadband has become one of my top priorities. Without this, our rural areas risk being left behind. The digital divide exists in this country, and rural Americans are the ones who are on the wrong side of the divide. Small communities and businesses across West Virginia and elsewhere in rural America lack this fundamental infrastructure.  No one understands these issues more than Ajit Chairman Pai grew up in rural He told me that sometimes when he goes home to visit his parents, he cannot get connected in his own hometown. He knows the challenges facing rural communities.[[Page S6245]]  I have had the pleasure of hosting Chairman Pai and his staff multiple times in West Most recently, Chairman Pai came to Wardensville in Hardy County, WV, where we have good connectivity and where we have actually been able to create new businesses and opportunities for a small town such as Following our visit, we traveled just 20, 30 miles over to Hampshire County, where getting high-speed internet has been far more challenging. There, Chairman Pai met Eric Hott of Kirby, WV, who has a small chocolate business. Eric is having trouble following up with orders and attracting new customers because he can't get consistent broadband access.  Last August, I held a roundtable discussion with Chairman Pai in Fayette County, WV, focusing on the digital divide and the impacts on tourism. We visited Adventures on the I even convinced him to join me on a bridge walk across the beautiful New River This outdoor recreation destination is one of West Virginia's most beautiful and premier tourist destinations, but the small businesses there are hampered by the lack of connectivity.  We heard firsthand from business owners who can't grow their business because of poor internet connectivity. It is hard to attract a talented workforce to live and visit in these more rural parts of our A local restaurant owner shared their difficulty in notifying customers of available tables through their online system. They lost business because of this.  During each of the Chairman's visits, we discussed possible solutions to promote greater access and competition. Chairman Pai is a great listener. He listens to what the issues are, and those include reducing barriers to investment, streamlining the regulatory environment, encouraging public-private partnerships, and ensuring accountability on behalf of the taxpayer.  Following his tour across the country, during which he stopped in West Virginia, Chairman Pai proposed a digital empowerment agenda right down the alley of the issues we just talked about--to grant Americans living in communities of all sizes, from urban cores to smaller, rural towns, with these online opportunities. Chairman Pai's agenda highlighted a variety of specific measures the FCC, Congress, and State and local governments could make to simplify broadband deployment.  Broadband access will be the result of partnerships between private, local, State, and Federal agencies and organizations. We need to have this collaboration to eliminate duplicative and outdated programs so that States like mine can efficiently deliver broadband to our rural communities efficiently and cost-effectively.  By listening to communities like ours--and remember, I said Chairman Pai is a great listener--the Chairman has built a plan for achieving widespread broadband access that meets the unique demands of our rural communities.  The FCC plays an imperative role in addressing these issues in large and small States, particularly rural States like mine.  In the 21st-century economy, robust telecommunication networks are increasingly important for today's users and the foundation of future innovations.  Under his leadership at the FCC, he has already taken steps toward modernizing the Commission's role and promoting digital empowerment. Since the beginning of his tenure, the Commission has hit the ground running, enacting a broad strategic vision to close the digital divide, to modernize the Commission's rules, promote innovation, protect consumer and public safety, and improve the Commission's daily operations.  Under Chairman Pai's leadership, the Commission has made significant investments to deliver broadband service to underserved and unserved areas of the country. I am confident that rural America will see more progress with his continued leadership, and today I am very proud to support his renomination to the FCC as he ascends and retakes the chairmanship of a very important part of our communications and telecommunications network.  With that, I yield back.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

411,topic-id,265,"Mr.Chair, I rise today in opposition to the fiscal year 2018 Republican budget resolution, a budget that comes nearly 6 months late and days into the new fiscal year. This Republican budget betrays millions of hardworking middle class families, while showering billionaires with irresponsible tax cuts.  By cutting $211 billion over the next 10 years for student loans and college aid, it makes it harder to send our kids to college. It abandons our Nation's crumbling infrastructure by cutting $245 billion over 10 years for transportation. It turns its back on families putting food on the table with SNAP by cutting $150 billion from the program over the next 10 years. It neglects our grandparents and our seniors with a $487 billion cut to Medicare in the next decade, and it assumes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, leaving over 20 million Americans uninsured.  I offered two amendments during the markup of this budget--one to fully fund programs for our veterans, and another to reject paying for a border wall--both of which were blocked by my Republican colleagues.

110,topic-id,651,"Mr.President, I wish to pay tribute to a Marylander, John Gabriel Smith, whose courage not only broke barriers for himself but also advanced the cause of the betterment of humanity. We celebrate and honor Mr.Smith, known as Gabe, because he was the very first African American to graduate from Gonzaga College Preparatory High School, located just a few blocks from the Capitol Building, with the class of 1954.  Gabe was born in the turbulent times of the early 1940s in Mary's County,[[Page S6355]]MD, where he and his two sisters were introduced to the ugly world of racism. His hard-working parents committed their children to a Catholic education and religious fellowship at Peter Claver, a predominantly African-American church in rural Ridge, As an eighth grader, Gabe decided to serve as an altar boy; little did he know that it would change his life and place him in the annals of American history.  The head pastor of Peter Claver was a humble man by the name of Father Horace McKenna, S.J., a White Jesuit priest who had been serving the segregated and neglected African-American community in Southern Maryland for two decades. Father McKenna would later found So Others Might Eat, SOME, a ministry which continues to feed the hungry here in Washington, One day, Gabe listened intently as Father McKenna described the spiritual journey many men had taken on the way to priesthood. Gabe, who was interested in pursuing this vocation, asked Father McKenna how he could become a priest too. Father McKenna told Gabe that he would, at a minimum, need to learn Unfortunately, there were no schools in Mary's County or the surrounding areas that Gabe could attend which taught Latin, let alone provide the other instruction necessary to launch his vocation, so Father McKenna told him about a school in Washington, where he could learn Latin and all the other requisites. That school was Gonzaga College High  Racial segregation was the barrier that would have prevented Gabe from attending Gonzaga, but that was about to change. Gabe often speaks about the angels who have been in his life, including Father McKenna, football coach Joe Kozik, and Archbishop Patrick O'Boyle, a man who quietly but diligently worked to break the racial divide here in the Nation's Several years before the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 to end segregation, Archbishop O'Boyle ordered the integration of all Catholic schools and churches in the Archdiocese of Thus, in 1951, John Gabriel Smith was one of the first African Americans to enter Gonzaga, one of the Nation's elite prep schools.  Gabe moved in with his sister, who lived around the corner from the school. He had observed and experienced abusive conditions under segregation in Mary's County; thus, he was on guard among his peers at school. Fortunately, during his time at Gonzaga, his classmates welcomed him in the classroom and stood with him in the face of adversity and strife when they walked outside the school's walls.  As a member of the Gonzaga Purple Eagle football team, he encountered yet another angel in his life, a football coach named Joe Kozik, who stood by Gabe, along with his teammates. Whenever the Eagles played an opponent opposed to integrated teams, Coach Kozik and his teammates always stuck together like a family to overcome hate and ignorance.  In June of 1954, the year of the Brown decision to end segregation in public schools across the Nation, Gabe completed his education at Gonzaga College High School as the first African-American graduate. Poised with a thorough education, including a command of Latin, he entered Howard University, where he choose to pursue a different vocation and graduated with a degree in pharmacy. He became a pharmacist and worked for over 40 years, retiring just this past spring with Shopper's Food Warehouse in Fort Washington, MD, where he spent most of his career.

Gerard was known as His wife Kristin and their 2-year-old daughter had welcomed a second baby girl into their family this past  In addition to raising his family and working at a legal recruiting firm, Gerry dedicated his time and energy to making his community a better place. As a member of the Spring Garden Civic Association, he was the go-to guy in his community, in the words of Philadelphia City Council president Darrell Gerry was an avid hockey player, the neighborhood handyman, and the person who would man the grill at block parties and repair bikes for kids in the neighborhood. His neighbors and friends have spoken of his happy, magnetic personality and his willingness to help others.  You can tell how important Gerry was to his family, friends, and community. You can tell what an impact he had on the people he met because thousands of people lined up at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul a few weeks ago to pay their respects to Gerry and to celebrate his life. The people who knew him are keeping his memory alive on his Facebook page, where they shared pictures of Gerry hiking, painting, playing hockey, full of life and surrounded by friends and family.  This is a man who became yet another victim of gun violence last month after he refused to give a pair of robbers his car keys because his 2-year-old daughter was in the back seat. This was a truly senseless act of violence that has shaken his family, friends, and his community. Two suspects in this terrible crime are now in custody, and I hope that proceedings in the justice system in Philadelphia can provide some measure of relief, some measure of comfort, and, we pray, even closure to the Grandzol family. Whatever relief it might provide, justice can't heal every wound. It can't bring Gerry back to Kristin, their daughters, and their family, friends, and neighbors. But we can make sure his memory lives on in the way we treat each other, and I hope we can honor Gerry's life by dedicating ourselves to improving the lives of our neighbors and working together to solve problems.  One thing I hope we can do here on the specific issue of gun violence is to work on legislation and policy that will at least--at least--reduce the likelihood that someone like Gerry will lose his life. It is part of a longer conversation. I won't get into the list of issues we should be working on--some of those I have outlined already--but we can't simply, as we often do, express condolence and pay tribute that is appropriate to those whose lives have been lost and those who may have been injured in Las Vegas and so many other places around the country. We have to do more than that. We can't stop with those expressions--those appropriate and essential expressions of sympathy and solidarity and commendation for the great work of law enforcement and emergency personnel. We have to do more than that.  Today, as we remember Gerry, we offer not only condolences but we offer prayers to his wife Kristin, to their daughters, and to the family and friends of the Spring Garden neighborhood in  Once again, stopping there is not enough. There are plenty of examples of people who have lost their lives in a city like Philadelphia or in cities around the country that may not add up to the 58 deaths, may not add up to 500-plus injured, but when you take just one life--in this case, the life that we highlight today, Gerry's life--it is reason enough to come together to work on new approaches, commonsense approaches to, as I said before, reduce the likelihood. No one is suggesting that we can pass something that will be a magic wand to take away all of these acts of violence, but we shouldn't throw up our hands and say there is absolutely nothing we can do to reduce the likelihood that people will lose their lives due to an act of gun violence. I refuse to accept that as an American, that there is nothing we can do legislatively to reduce that likelihood or even, God willing, to substantially reduce the likelihood.  So when we are thinking about Gerry today, I hope we can commit ourselves to action and debate and maybe even reach consensus on legislation and policy to move forward in the right direction.  Madam President, I yield the floor.

239,topic-id,734,"Mr.President, I want to speak today with regard to a month we set aside--or I should say the equivalent of a month that spans two different months--as National Hispanic Heritage  As many know, the United States is home to more than 56 million people of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, comprising over 17 percent of the Nation's total population. We set aside September 15 to October 15 to mark National Hispanic Heritage This month is a reminder of the vibrant culture and substantial contributions that people of the Hispanic community have made to our Although we have only a 30-day time period as a designation, we recognize the contributions made by Latinos in this country every day, not just between September 15 and October 15.  I have held a number of meetings with Latinos and Latino leaders this past year in Pennsylvania and here in Washington and recently just a couple weeks ago, as well, to discuss issues of concern to Hispanic Americans and The resounding theme I heard from Pennsylvanians is the strong economic drive that Latinos and Hispanic Americans share.  As the second fastest growing minority in the United States, the Hispanic community's economic power continues to grow. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy both in Pennsylvania and across the Latinos are 1.4 times more likely than the general population to become entrepreneurs. In fact, Latinos own some 3.3 million businesses in the United States, accounting for more than 40 percent of all minority-owned businesses. Together, these businesses generate almost $500 billion in economic activity. Overall, the Latino community accounts for a combined $1.3 trillion in economic activity. Their contributions are projected to top $1.7 trillion by 2020--from $1.3 to $1.7 trillion in just a few years.  Last month, I was proud to join many of my Senate colleagues in designating the week beginning September 18 as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions This resolution recognizes the achievements and goals of the 472 Hispanic-serving institutions, known by the acronym These HSIs are throughout the Nation, and they improve their local communities and play a vital role in expanding access to college for students across the country. These HSIs represent 13 percent of nonprofit colleges and universities. Yet they enroll 63 percent of all Latino students. These Hispanic-serving institutions are located in 18 States and Puerto I am proud to be a cosponsor of the resolution which recognizes the important work these institutions play in expanding access to higher education for everyone.  This year, Hispanic Heritage Month has become a month of advocacy and action. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Dream This issue has been on the forefront in recent discussions, not only among the Latino community, the Hispanic-American community but with many of my constituents across the board, and I am sure that is true in every Senate office. Dreamers shared with me the hard work and struggles they have endured to be successful in this country. Ending DACA, in my judgment, is wrong. First of all, it is wrong to break a sacred promise to hundreds of thousands of people living in our country, young people who were promised by their government, if they came forward, they would be protected. Ending DACA would be breaking that sacred promise.  In Pennsylvania alone, estimates say that ending DACA would cost the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania nearly $357 million per year in GDP losses to our State, and that is according to the Center for American Ending DACA would result in the loss of $460.3 billion--not million but billion--from the Nation's GDP over the next decade, again according to the Center for American  So it would be a betrayal to violate this covenant with hundreds of thousands of young people, and it is really a bad move for the economy of my State of Pennsylvania and the economy of our  I was proud to vote for the DREAM Act in both 2007 and 2010, and I hope the Senate will have a clean vote on the Dream Act soon. We should be focused on humane and commonsense solutions that keep our Nation safe as well as allowing it to thrive. Hispanic Americans are a vital part of the fabric of American society.

279,topic-id,1785,"Mr.President, I commend the words and the determination for action that were expressed by the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Like them, and like so many people across the country, I start with condolences and prayers and commendations. I offer condolences to the families--the names and the families we don't know yet--of this most recent tragedy, but we do know they are not only worthy of our expressions of condolence but will be in need of our prayers. Then, I offer commendations, of course, to the first responders and the law enforcement officials who responded as they always do, running toward the danger, running to help. We can't say enough about the work they do.  If we stop at expressing condolences and offering prayers and commending those who take action, like first responders and law enforcement--if we stop there, I don't think that is an adequate response to this tragedy, just like it wasn't an adequate response in connection with the Pulse Night Club or the tragedy in December of 2012 in Newtown, It is nowhere near an adequate response when we consider the enormity of this problem.  I believe we have to take action. I will talk about that in a moment. Action must start with what happens on this floor. It is difficult to take action necessarily if there isn't time for debate, time for collaboration on legislation, and ultimately consideration of legislation on the floor of the Senate and I would hope in the U.House of  The enormity of this tragedy is almost hard to comprehend when we think about it, not just in terms of the number, which at last count was 58 killed and over 500--over 500--injured. Those numbers are almost too large to comprehend; that one person with one weapon or maybe several weapons was able to inflict that kind of carnage in one place at one time. I don't know how long it took, but he wasn't shooting for many hours to kill that many people. He did it in a short timeframe.  When we consider those numbers, I have to ask--I don't know if we went back and compared a similar day or a similar timeframe, comparing the loss of life in the context of war, but I am sure there were plenty of days of conflict where Americans were on foreign soil in a battle, in a war, where we would have lost even less lives on a particular day or a portion of a particular day. The scale of this is almost unimaginable.  Then, we need to consider what has been happening on our streets. Every State, every community has their own numbers. I can point to Just since 2014, thousands of shootings--by one estimate I think over 7,700--but then, of course, the more ominous number is the number of people killed as a result of those shootings. In Pennsylvania, since 2014, some 2,072 people have died as a result of that larger number of shootings.  I think for the Nation, and I think, certainly, undoubtedly for me, maybe the most important or the most seminal day in this debate was in December of 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, The distinguished Senator from Connecticut, who joins us on the floor and started tonight with his remarks, remembers it better than probably any other Member of the Senate, other than his colleague in Connecticut and others who lived through it.  One of the questions I asked myself at the end of that weekend, after watching hours and hours of television coverage and reading a lot about it and then watching a news report on Sunday evening which tracked the pathway of the killer going to one classroom and killing 20 children--6-year-olds, 7-year-olds, first graders--after he had done that, he was on his way to another classroom. So I concluded from that, if he had more time, in addition to the 20 killed in one classroom and the adults who were killed, we would have been reading about potentially hundreds of children killed in one school in even less--a lot less than a day, maybe an hour or two or three, but that didn't happen. He took his own life.  So I began to ask myself not only what should we do in response to this--and I had concluded at that point to support legislation--but a larger question kept coming to mind. If one person, with one weapon or a few weapons and unlimited ammunition--if one person cannot only kill 20 children in Connecticut, I guess almost 50 people in Florida, and now we know from Las Vegas at least 58, and I am sure some who were injured will die--but if one person can do that, we have to ask ourselves, Is there nothing we can do? Because that becomes part of the debate, right?  One side says: Let's take action by way of legislation or take some action that would reduce the likelihood that we have more tragedies like this, more mass shootings, but the response immediately comes back that the other side says: We agree it is tragic, we agree we want to prevent it, we agree we want to reduce the likelihood, but there is nothing we can do legislatively to reduce the likelihood or to prevent it.  I don't think anyone would argue that a law that passes in the aftermath of this Las Vegas tragedy or a law that passes even in the aftermath of Sandy Hook Elementary School--if the law, the proposals, the bills, really, that were voted on in the Senate in 2013, if they had passed, no one can argue with certitude or with scientific precision[[Page S6255]]that if you pass this law, this many lives will be saved. After Newtown and after this tragedy, I come back to the same question: Is there nothing we can do legislatively? We are the most powerful country in the world. We led the world in winning World War II, a war that was not on its way to winning until we got involved, until we were forced to respond because we were attacked. We are the country that has cured disease and built the strongest Republic in the history of the human race; that has the strongest military, without a doubt; that has the strongest economy, without a doubt; that has so much in ways that we can point to of American exceptionalism and strength and achievement--achievements that are unmatched anywhere in the world in almost any part of American life that one can point to. Is that same country completely disabled from taking an action that would reduce the likelihood--and we would hope substantially reduce the likelihood--that we will not have another Las Vegas or another Orlando or another Newtown, and go on and on from there, all of these tragedies in all of these places? Is that really what our answer is going to be?  We take action when we are attacked, to fight back and to prevent it from happening again. We take action when there is an epidemic. We take action when there is a crisis. We take action when there is a natural disaster. We are seeing some of that most recently. We take action as a government. The Congress takes action. The executive takes action. Yet, in this circumstance, what can only be described as an epidemic--that might be an understatement--where we are losing more than 30,000 people a year, are we saying that there is nothing we can do legislatively to reduce that likelihood? I don't think any American, if they think about it, would conclude there is nothing we can do.  So when I considered that in the context of Sandy Hook, I had to ask myself: Are you saying to yourself that you are going to vote no on what became three bills, vote no on them because you believe there is nothing you can do? That is what your vote is going to be? That is going to be your response? As a legislator with the opportunity to cast a vote in a body of 100 people, you are going to say no three times, as it turned out in 2013, to legislation because you believe there is nothing your vote and nothing this legislative body can do?  Well, I decided to vote yes, at least, but even that is not enough. We haven't had votes in years on these issues. Here we are, almost 5 years later--in December it will be 5 years, half a decade--since Newtown, CT, since the massacre at Sandy  I have a page from the Wall Street Journal that was printed within a couple days of that tragedy. It had very small color pictures and very small biographies of those very small people, those 6-year-olds and 7-year-olds. It has been on my desk all of these years, and it is a very yellowed copy of a newspaper article. I often think about what those families have gone through all of these years.  The great recording artist Bruce Springsteen had a song after September 11. The name of the song is ``You're Missing.'' The refrain in that song, of course, is ``You're missing,'' talking about someone, of course, who lost a loved one on 9/11. He says: ``You're missing when I turn out the lights, you're missing when I close my eyes, and you're missing when I see the sun rise.'' The same could be said of those Newtown families, the same could be said of those families in Orlando, and now, unfortunately and tragically, the families in the Las Vegas area--and maybe well beyond Las Vegas--who were there for that concert.  I hope this will be an occasion not just for speeches and expressions of condolence and commendation for those who showed such bravery in this tragedy, or prayers and solidarity, but that this will be a time for action, meaning action in the context of debate and action in the context of legislation.  I think there are a number of steps we can take--I will not outline them all now--a number of commonsense steps we can take that are entirely consistent with the Second Amendment but would reduce the likelihood over time of having more and more of these tragedies or maybe, just maybe, taking action that will reduce the number of deaths. Even that would be substantial progress. I just cannot accept the idea that there is absolutely nothing we can do legislatively to reduce the likelihood--and I would hope substantially reduce the likelihood--of these tragedies so that we can prevent or at least reduce the number of tragedies.  I yield the floor.

1093,topic-id,480,"Mr.Speaker, Chairman Royce has been a strong proponent of this, as has Eliot I want to especially thank Robin Kelly for her leadership on this.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2408, a bipartisan bill that aims to provide a safe education for millions of children, especially girls, who live in the most dangerous and unstable places across the globe.  As a parent and now a grandparent, a former teacher, I know that education physically and mentally empowers our children.  Unfortunately, millions of children receive no education due to the circumstances which are beyond their control. This is particularly true for the growing number of displaced people across the world, as it is exceedingly difficult for children in conflict zones to receive a primary or secondary education. Armed conflicts across the world, particularly in places like Syria and now Burma, have led to the internal displacement of millions of women and children, and forced them to literally flee their own homes.  There are currently 65 million people displaced worldwide, and at least 21 million are refugees. They are out of their own countries. This is the highest number since World War II, and the number has been steadily rising since 2011.  Many of the displaced people are survivors of human rights abuses and violence. Half of these victims are under 18 years of age. They are children and in the most formative years of their lives. If they are not given the opportunity to succeed, they will be subjected to a lifetime of conflict and instability.  Education is a key component to helping lift these vulnerable children out of the depths of poverty. Access to education not only gives children the opportunity to grow and learn, but also offers safety and shelter from violence, extremist ideology, human trafficking networks, and a relentless cycle of abuse.  There is no question that access to education provides stability and consistency to children living in extremely unstable conditions, especially girls.  That is why I introduced H.2408, the Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act, along with Robin Kelly from I again want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their leadership in this area.  This bipartisan legislation will move us in the right direction by making access to primary and secondary education a priority with our State Department and It aims to directly benefit displaced children, specifically girls, and will help to address one of the world's greatest challenges facing refugees across the globe.  This legislation also encourages greater international coordination and leverages existing resources by promoting education for refugees where they are through local schools.  The Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act will ensure that millions of child refugees will have an opportunity to reach their highest potential, even those in the most tumultuous conditions.

1184,topic-id,502,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 548, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  This important bill protects and extends compassion to the most vulnerable among us, the unborn, by prohibiting abortions, with limited exceptions, after the point at which scientific evidence shows that an unborn child can feel pain.  Mr.Speaker, this really should be called Micah's bill in honor of a little boy named Micah Pickering, who was here on the Hill last week with his mom. He was born at 20 weeks old. And we saw, and we see from babies like Micah, that with the right medical care, babies born at 20 weeks can survive and grow into healthy adults.  Micah's mother spoke last week about her experiences: ``When Micah was born, his eyes were still fused shut. His bones were not hardened yet. He couldn't breathe on his own. He was medicated to stay comfortable from pain. We were told not to touch his skin, as his skin was so sensitive it could hurt him and tear the skin. I was there to see his first set of hiccups, his first sneezes, and his first drop of milk placed on his lips. His first smile, his first laugh. He was alive. He was fighting. He wanted to live.''  Today, Mr.Speaker, Micah is a healthy 5-year-old boy.  Babies like Micah at 20 weeks have well developed brains and central nervous systems, developed enough so that medical evidence has increasingly confirmed these babies feel pain, and not only pain, but intense and possibly excruciating pain.  Research also indicates that, after 20 weeks, an unborn baby's responses to painful stimuli are similar to adult responses, to the extent that when surgeons, Mr.Speaker, are performing in-utero surgery, corrective procedures on these unborn children, surgeons have seen babies flinch, jerk, and recoil from those sharp objects and incisions.  In response to this, Mr.Speaker, surgeons routinely now administer anesthesia to unborn children in the womb before performing surgery. This anesthesia has been associated with a significant increase in babies' stress hormone levels during medical procedures.  Mr.Speaker, late-term abortions, usually performed by inducing labor after the fetus has been injected with a lethal pharmacological agent or by the horrific practice of dismemberment, causing babies intense pain, should be illegal, and that is what this bill ensures.  I believe, Mr.Speaker, that this bill also takes important steps to protect women, providing exceptions for those cases of rape, and incest, and the life of the mother.  H.36 also provides women with a cause of action, allowing them to sue abortionists who don't provide protection for aborted babies who are born alive.  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act protects the sanctity of life by ensuring protection from pain for the most vulnerable among us.  Mr.Speaker, this is a moral obligation of this House and of our government. Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow for consideration of H.36.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

But I would note, Mr.Speaker, that there has been no mention, no discussion on the other side of the aisle about the pain that these babies feel, and that when you are in a situation like the ones that have been described, what is happening is those babies are being subjected to really, oftentimes, a horrific procedure. The question is, because a baby is found to have some chromosomal anomaly, to have some very severe handicap, whether or not they deserve to be subjected to the pain we now know they feel.                              {time}  1315  In fact, Mr.Speaker, we have seen work done by Northwestern University that demonstrates that the pain that these young preemies feel may, in fact, be even worse than the pain that older babies feel, because the pain inhibitors develop later in life than the pain receptors do.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to ignore the challenges and the issues involved here with respect to the pain that these babies feel. I would also note, Mr.Speaker, that the CBO, in a very unusual step, has assessed that this bill itself would save 2,750 lives annually. That is something that the CBO doesn't often do, but it is very important for us to recognize.

In particular, the standard of care, Mr.Speaker, for babies who are born prematurely, as well as for babies who are patients in vitro, is to provide anesthesia. And that standard of care is based upon evidence that these babies have pain receptors, that these babies react to pain, and that they feel pain.  Mr.Speaker, I think the notion that there is no scientific evidence for this is flat wrong.

1233,topic-id,361,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his work on this issue and for introducing this important bill. It is undeniable that we have a much better understanding today of life inside the womb than we did at the time of the passage of Roe v.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle express a commitment to science in all cases except where it matters most, in those cases that involve the preservation of human life. They don't want to talk about babies. They don't want to talk about the horrific procedures that we are dealing with today, and we have to. It is our obligation to.  Mr.Speaker, our country has banned partial-birth abortion in a decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court, and I would just urge my colleagues to look at the decision in that opinion, Gonzales v. Carhart, the decision written by Justice Kennedy: talking in specific, quoting a nurse, talking about the reaction of a 26-week-old baby who was a victim of partial-birth abortion, what their physical reaction is, the mother of little babies reading that, and the description of what happens to a baby when they are killed--watching their hands expand and then contract, as any mother of a newborn infant has watched many times.  It is truly horrific, and I think, as a society, Mr.Speaker, we have to be willing to face the exact nature of what it is we are talking about. We have an obligation as elected Representatives, Mr.Speaker, to protect the lives of these unborn babies. This legislation would do that.  We have a moral obligation, and it is our job. It is in the interest of the States to make sure, Mr.Speaker, that we do everything possible to protect life.  In this case, Mr.Speaker, we are talking about a bill that would protect babies at moments when we know they can feel pain in the womb.

305,topic-id,407,"Mr.Speaker, a few minutes ago, I stood on the east steps of this ornate building, and I now rise in the hall of this august body to call for action on an issue that has languished for far too long. Specifically, Congress needs to pass commonsense reform of our laws regarding firearms.  I applaud our concerns for broader background checks, but broader background checks must be as effective as they are efficient. It is true that our current technology allows us to be efficient enough for background checks to be completed within 3 days, and over 90 percent of them are.  But what happens to that less than 10 percent? And why aren't they completed within that timeframe? Well, Mr.Speaker, we do not have a perfect world. Our public servants are not perfect and the consuming public is not either. Public servants occasionally make mistakes, and some consumers intentionally make misrepresentations.  No matter how good our technology is, sometimes the process requires more than 3 days to ferret out dishonest and ill-intended purchases. We need to close the gaping loopholes in our gun laws. We need to close the internet sale/gun show loophole that allows gun purchases to evade restrictions in place when purchasing a weapon through a licensed dealer.  We need to close the loophole that allows individuals on the terrorist watch list to purchase firearms. We need to close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to purchase guns. We need to close loopholes that allow semiautomatic weapons to be effectively turned into illegal automatic weapons.  The so-called bump stocks that allow the retrofitting of semiautomatic firearms to make them fully automatic should not be legal.  The Las Vegas shooter had several of these devices that enabled the firing of hundreds of rounds per minute. The purchasing of fully automatic weapons has been significantly restricted in this country since the 1930s, because weapons of war should have no place in our civil society. Give us a vote to close this loophole.  We need to close the Charleston loophole that allows purchases of firearms without the completion of a background check. My Background Check Completion Act will do just that and prevent another tragedy like the Emanuel AME Church shooting that took the lives of nine worshippers more than 2 years ago. Give us a vote to close this loophole.  Mr.Speaker, Congress needs to pass commonsense reforms of our laws regarding firearms. Give us a vote.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgH7757.txt,208,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 36, PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD",2017,4,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
200,topic-id,684,"Mr.Speaker, last week we honored and welcomed back Steve[[Page H7755]]Scalise to this Chamber, victim of a horrible shooting aimed at him because he was a It could have been any one of us.  Today the Democrats spoke on the steps of the Capitol about the need for reasonable gun law reform, and with us was Gabby Giffords, who was shot in 2011 because she was a Congressperson doing her job.  Congressman John Lewis had said that you can't go to a movie theater, you can't go to a concert, and you can't go to school and feel safe. You can't be a public official and feel safe.  What happened in Las Vegas where 58 people were murdered and over 500 injured calls on the United States Congress to take action to protect the American people.                              {time}  1015  This is the time to act for reasonable, commonsense gun reform laws. Former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia Fischer, who, in 1996, after the greatest mass shooting in Australian history, led an effort to reform the Australian laws, sent a missive to President Trump suggesting this is the time for him to act and to do something very important for American society. He said: It can be done.  After those killings in Australia, they passed laws that made automatic and semiautomatic weapons illegal. They had a buyback program that bought back over 600,000.  After the 1996 effort, which was difficult but successful, Australia has not had a killing of over five people. Prior to 1996, they had 15 or 16 shootings of that nature.  Everyone recognizes Australia's success. We need to do something besides just having continued moments of silence.  Yesterday, on a bill on this floor about the unborn taking precedence over the rights of women, quite a few Republicans came to the floor and talked about pain to the unborn and loss of their potential for life. But none have talked about the pain of the 500 who were injured and the 58 lives that were lost.  We could pass laws to eliminate bump stocks that, apparently, this murderer used to make his weapon into, effectively, an automatic weapon, where you can shoot hundreds of bullets at a time, which he did. Bump stocks should be illegal. Senator Dianne Feinstein had a bill to make them illegal in 2013, and she has one again.  We need better background checks and to make sure the mentally ill don't get guns. Unfortunately, in this Congress, in February, we passed a law that President Trump signed with passion and a flare that eliminated a rule that said that the Social Security Administration would send the names of people who couldn't manage their own financial affairs to a bureau to see to it that they were on a list so they couldn't buy guns.  If you can't successfully manage your own financial affairs, should you have a gun?  I would submit not. But that bill was passed on a partisan vote and signed by the President, making it easier for people to get guns when the Social Security Administration has found they cannot manage their own affairs.  The same for the no-fly, no-buy list. If you are considered too much of a security threat to fly on an airplane, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun. The arguments we heard against that were about due process.  Has anybody brought a bill to give the people on the no-fly list due process? Has it come to the floor?  It won't. It makes sense to have a no-fly list. They also should be the people that can't buy guns.  We shouldn't have semiautomatic weapons. Automatic weapons are illegal. The bump stocks make regular weapons automatic weapons.  The CDC is prohibited by law from doing a study to see if there is a connection between gun violence and mental health or our country's health. That law should be repealed. We shouldn't fear the CDC study.  High-capacity magazines also shouldn't be permitted, and law enforcement should be protected from armor-piercing bullets.  I hope that we can act to save American lives.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgH7754-3.txt,,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,4,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is important, it is also embarrassing somewhat to us, because I listen to the other side, and the first thing that the chairman does over here is he shows a New York Times ad. And because of The New York Times ad at the time of Roe v. Wade, he suggests that we should turn over Roe v. Wade because it is antiquated.  Well, in 1791, the Second Amendment was adopted, and we had pistols, and we had guns that you could shoot one bullet at a time; and yesterday, we had a man in Las Vegas with guns who could shoot ``da da da da da da da da da'' and kill 59 people and wound 500.  If you get me an ad from 1791, those weapons were not in that ad, but do they talk about changing the Second Amendment, do they talk about protecting Americans from that type of violence? They come here and talk about protecting the unborn, forgetting about the rights of women guaranteed them by Roe v. Wade, the law of the land, which is the law of the land that says viability comes at 24 weeks.  They talk about what they say are medical experts and a substantial body of medical evidence. What they don't tell you is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are against this bill, and there is no medical group or medical society in this country that is for this bill, but they know more about medicine and about pain for the unborn than do the doctors and the scientists.  They bring this to us, an unconstitutional bill, an unconstitutional bill that the CBO estimates will cost us from $65 million to $335 million over 10 years. Their concern about the budget goes out the window.  The truth of the matter is this goes back to the Rules Committee debate on this bill.

It comes straight to the floor because it is politically popular, more politically popular this week than having a bill to allow for silencers for weapons, which was going to be the bill du jour for this week, but it was pulled.

The alternative minimum tax is eliminated. That is the only thing that made clear that President Trump paid any taxes in the only tax return we know about. If it weren't for that, he wouldn't have paid anything. We are talking multimillion- and billion-dollar tax cuts for the richest that create deficits in the future, but that is okay when it is giving money to those who already have it.  Franklin Roosevelt was right. You judge a society not by what it does for those who have an abundance, but you judge it by what it does for those who have the least.

409,topic-id,425,"Mr.Chair, I want to thank the chairwoman for yielding time to me, and I particularly want to congratulate her on doing something that is going to be pretty remarkable today. She is bringing a budget that actually balances in 10 years.  My good friends on the other side will bring us three budgets, none of which come into balance in 10 years. In that, to be fair, they follow the tradition that President Obama set, who never ever brought us a budget that balanced and left us with a national debt roughly twice the size of the one he had when he came into office. If we don't do what Chairwoman Black suggests here, we are going to be in exactly that same position.  I particularly want to congratulate the chairwoman for having the courage to take on the tough issue of entitlement and mandatory spending reform. She has $200 billion of it. It sounds like a lot of money, but it is out of $30 trillion over 10 years. This is something we can do--frankly, we should do more of--and that is the way to actually move toward balance.  I also want to congratulate the chairwoman for actually working with other committee chairmen to help them identify the cuts so they are real. They are not just fictional things in an imaginary document.  Finally, I particularly want to commend her for a wise investment in national security. That is a tough decision to make, but we have all seen the ravages left by sequester and by continuing resolutions that are the number one enemies of the United States military. We have actually, under the last administration, inflicted more damage on the military than any enemy could do on any battlefield anyplace in the world. Our chairwoman and our committee stops that, reverses that, and begins to invest.  Mr.Chair, I just want to end by pointing out the long-term solution here to our problems really is entitlement reform. We have to get serious about mandatory spending. It is two-thirds of the budget now. Without changing the direction we are going, it will be 81 percent a decade from now. It is simply not sustainable.  It is nice to talk about this discretionary program or that discretionary program. The fundamental problem that we face is mandatory spending. The chairwoman addresses it in her budget. We can come back and build on what she does next year and continue to go after the area that really unbalances the budget.  Mr.Chair, I urge the passage of the budget.

449,topic-id,315,"Mr.Chairman, ugly is ugly.  This is an ugly budget, and it exists primarily to be a vehicle for tax cuts for the already fortunate, the top 1 or 2 percent in America, at the expense of everybody else. It will hemorrhage red ink for as far as the eye can see.  That is not a theory. That is what happened in the previous massive tax cuts, both under Ronald Reagan and George  Let me give you one example of the ruinous aspects of this budget, and it has to do with Federal employees.  This budget cuts Federal employee compensation and benefits by another $163 billion over the next 10 years, $32 billion of which is included in reconciliation and instructions which I sought to strike with an amendment submitted to the Rules Committee that was not allowed.  The Republican cuts include higher retirement contributions; elimination of the FERS supplement, which law enforcement retirees heavily benefit[[Page H7788]]from; lower annuities by changing the retirement calculation and reduced healthcare benefits; a 10 percent reduction in the Federal workforce at nonsecurity agencies, even though nearly all of the workforce increases, since 2001, occurred in security-related agencies.  The Federal workforce provides vital services to our It includes those who patrol and secure our borders, protect us from terrorists, take care of our veterans, help run our airports, counter cybersecurity attacks, find cures for deadly diseases, and keep our food supply safe. Veterans make up 31 percent of those Federal employees.  Federal employee pay and benefits are not the cause of this country's deficit and debt. The Federal workforce has already contributed nearly $200 billion toward reducing the country's deficit in the form of pay freezes, pay raises insufficient to keep pace with inflation, furloughs, and increased retirement contributions.  We should honor and revere the service of our Federal workforce, not denigrate it with the attacks included in this ugly budget.

254,topic-id,498,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of 178, the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his excellent work in this area.  This legislation would increase protections for elder abuse victims, which is very important, as a vast majority of cases of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older adults in the United States often go unreported and unaddressed.  Each year, nearly $3 billion is taken from older adults due to financial abuse and exploitation, and this is happening across all racial, social, economic, gender, and geographic lines.  This important measure increases protections for victims by, first, ensuring support for Federal cases involving elder abuse. This support will include the requirement that the Attorney General designate at least one assistant United States attorney to serve as an elder justice coordinator in every judicial district to prosecute, train, assist with, and conduct public outreach on elder abuse.  Additionally, this measure would also require that the Executive Office for United States Attorneys operate an elder abuse resource group and a working group to advise the Justice Department on elder abuse issues.  Secondly, this measure would require the establishment of best practices for local, State, and Federal data collection to focus on elder abuse, including, for example, the total number of Federal investigations of elder abuse and locations where cases are filed.  Findings under this legislation include the fact that older adults who are abused are three times more likely to die earlier than older adults of the same age who are not abused, and that up to half of all older adults with dementia will experience abuse.  For these reasons, a third component of this measure that I find extremely important and valuable is the enhanced victim assistance to elder abuse survivors. This measure would require that an annual report be submitted to Congress on the funding under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 for victims of crimes who are elders.  And finally, this measure adds a new definition of ``telemarketing and email marketing'' under the telemarketing statute to protect victims of such scams, which typically involve elders.  We must do everything possible to support victims of elder abuse and prevent the abuse from occurring in the first place. And so for these several reasons, I am very pleased to support the bill with the chairman of the committee.  Mr.Speaker, Members of the House, the elder abuse problem has devastating consequences to the victims as well as their loved ones, and it is an affront to America's older adults. It involves the exploitation of some of our most vulnerable citizens.  This measure includes a multipronged approach to prevent elder abuse and exploitation, protect the victims of elder abuse and exploitation from further harm, and bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice. Accordingly, I am pleased to urge my colleagues to support this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I want to begin my remarks today by extending my condolences to the family and friends of the 59 individuals killed in the shooting in Las Vegas, and I express my best hopes for the recovery of the more than 500 persons who were injured.  This Congress has a responsibility to find a way to prevent tragedies like this, as well as the daily incidents of gun violence in our communities, but instead of considering legislation to prevent gun violence, the House is spending today pushing a 20-week abortion ban that will disproportionately hurt women and families who face some of the most medically complex situations imaginable.  So it is with great pleasure that I oppose H.36, because it is a dangerous and far-reaching attack on a woman's constitutional right to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.  Roe v. Wade's basic holding is that a woman has a constitutional right to have an abortion prior to the fetus' viability, which is generally considered by the experts to be around 24 weeks from fertilization. By banning previability abortions, H.36 is a direct challenge to  Another serious flaw, in my view, of H.36 is that its narrow rape exception completely misconstrues the difficult challenges that survivors of sexual assault face and the very real reasons why a rape or incest may go unreported. So by requiring that a rape or incest survivor provide documentation to corroborate her statement that she was raped, the bill's sponsors seem to be saying that maybe women cannot be trusted to tell the truth about sexual assault, and they certainly cannot be trusted to make their own private healthcare decisions.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous and mean-spirited legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

14,topic-id,815,"Mr.President, I rise today to honor Lou Amabili, a true Delawarean, a fantastic, dedicated, and tireless volunteer, a gentleman who dedicated his life and service to others.  Mr.Louis Amabili, the son of Italian immigrants, rose from volunteering at his local volunteer fire company to become one of the most important and trusted voices in the American fire service. Lou passed away last Thursday, September 28.  Lou was a giant in the fire service community, and his decades of dedicated service are a testament to how much he cared about his calling and his neighbors. Lou was a legend in the Delaware firefighting community, especially in my small hometown of Hockessin, Lou proudly served the Hockessin Fire Company for 70 years, holding every position one could possibly hold--chief engineer, first and second assistant chief, along with vice president, president, president emeritus, and director.  Lou was a humble, down-to-earth, passionate, and caring gentleman. He rarely sought the limelight, even as he was often thrust into it. He could walk into any event, whether a national convention or just a local meeting, and know an individual's name, making them feel as if they were the most important person in the room.  Lou embodied the term ``public servant,'' which so many of us aspire to, yet he quietly and with dignity achieved this for decades. He heard his calling to serve his community, and he embraced it with dedication and a quiet passion.  There was no greater ally of firefighters in Delaware or across the country than His continued service of seven-plus decades set the highest standard of dedication to the volunteer fire service.  I first had the honor of meeting Lou around 2000 when I was county council president. Over my decade of service in New Castle County government, Lou was a frequent source of powerful advice, encouragement, insight, and occasional correction. I always looked forward to seeing him, whether at a county meeting, a State meeting, or at a national organization meeting. I was always certain I would get honest, direct, and constructive feedback from Lou about how things were going at home and how things were going nationally for America's firefighters.  Lou's nationally recognized service is long and impressive. He first gained national recognition in the fire service when President Richard Nixon appointed him to serve on the National Commission for Fire Prevention and Control in 1970--the Commission that produced the landmark report, ``America Burning.''  A graduate of Conrad High School and of the University of Delaware with a degree in chemistry, Lou was appointed the first director of the Delaware State Fire School in 1964 and served in that capacity for more than three decades through 1996. Upon his retirement, then-Governor Tom Carper, my senior Senator, signed a resolution naming the Delaware State Fire School the Louis Amabili Fire Training  From 1973 to 1980, Lou served as president of the International Society of Fire Service From 1978 to 1986, he served as a charter member of the National Fire Academy Board of Lou also served on the NFPA board of directors for 6 years in the 1980s and was chairman of the Fire Department Instructors Conference in 1979 and 1980.  Widely respected by his colleagues, the president of Congressional Fire Services Institute, William Jenaway, said:       Throughout his entire career, Lou was fully committed to      the health and safety of the men and women who have served in      the fire service. He was always willing and eager to share      his knowledge with both aspiring and veteran firefighters and      cared deeply about preserving the fire service's rich      heritage. It was an honor to serve with him for many years on      the CFSI Board of I valued his friendship as did      my fellow board members. . . . His contributions to our      organization and to the nation's fire service will preserve      his legacy as a legendary leader for many years to come.  While the fire service and the safety of his fellow firefighters was his passion, his family was his love. Lou's wife of nearly 60 years, Carmella, was his constant companion as he traveled extensively to national conventions, local meetings, or speaking engagements. Lou's daughter Janice; his son Louis Junior and his wife Bridget; his grandson Louis Amabili III and his wife Lacie; and Lou's great-grandchildren, Lyza and Silas, will be forever proud of his legacy of service to Hockessin, to Delaware, and to our  Lou was an inspiration to generations of volunteers, first responders, and firefighters, not just in his home company in our small town of Hockessin but to all the firefighters of Delaware and our country.

The GBU-53/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment H (SDB II) is      a 250-lb class precision-guided air-to-ground munition used      to defeat moving or mobile targets through adverse weather      from standoff range. SDB II has deployable wings and fins and      uses Inertial Navigation System/Global Positioning System      (INS/GPS) guidance, network-enabled datalink, (Link-16 and      UHF) and a multi-mode seeker to autonomously search, acquire,      track, and defeat targets from a standoff range. SDB II      employs a multi-effects warhead for maximum lethality against      armored and soft targets. Sensitive areas include operating      manuals and maintenance technical orders containing      performance information, operating and test procedures, and      other information related to support operations and repair.      The GBU-53/B SDB II hardware, including guidance, multi-mode      seeker, and datalink, is The software is            a. SDB II Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) are telemetry test      vehicles used for land or sea range based testing of the SDB      II weapons system. The GTV have common flight characteristics      of an SDB H but with an inert warhead. In place of the multi-     effects warhead is a Flight Termination, Tracking, and      Telemetry (FTTT) subassembly that mirrors the multi-effects      warhead's size and mass properties, but provides safety      flight termination, free flight tracking and telemetry, and      transmission of encrypted data from the vehicle to the      ground. The SDB II GTV can have either inert or live fuses.

SDB II Captive Carry Reliability Test (CCRT) vehicles      are SDB II variants primarily used for captive flight      reliability testing. The CCRT has common characteristics of      an SDB II but with an inert warhead and fuze. The CCRT does      not have an FTTT subassembly in place of the warhead; it      instead uses ballast to mimic the warhead's mass properties.      The CCRT is a flight capable representative of the SDB II      and, although not its primary objective, could be dropped as      a test round on ranges not requiring telemetry, digital      tracking, or a Flight Termination System (FTS).

9,topic-id,1614,"Mr.President, yesterday I mentioned how our colleagues across the aisle and, of course, some groups outside of Capitol Hill have predictably started attacking tax reform, actually a plan that doesn't even yet exist in legislative language. With the fall season now upon us, they have decided to shoot arrows at a straw man.  One would think, given their effusive support for tax reform in the past, our Democratic friends would at least wait to review the legislation before they pounce on it. I had hoped that they would work with us to come up with a bipartisan plan, but I guess I am not entirely surprised. That has never stopped them before from pillorying smart policy when it served a political end.  Yes, they are already piling on, spreading misinformation, and assuming the worst because that is the easy and politically expedient thing to do. The problem is that many of the criticisms of our framework have been misleading and counterproductive. Worse, some Members seem more content to misconstrue a plan than to understand it and give it a fair hearing.  Allow me to clarify the record for just a moment. What is most striking is that the new framework unveiled by the so-called Big 6 shares many of the core features of previous plans that were widely embraced by Democrats--not only that, but many of the folks who are now critical of the new plan came out in support of these provisions as recently as this year. The senior Senator from Oregon is typical in this regard. In response to our framework, he said that ``this is a far-right Republican scheme to endow future generations of the mega wealthy and leave what amounts to crumbs for the middle-class behind.'' That is kind of a breathtaking allegation. Those are indeed strong statements, but the American people are smart. The American people realize that the plan our colleague from Oregon is criticizing is similar to the one he sponsored and promoted in 2011.  Let's get the facts straight. The Senator from Oregon had previously sponsored a plan in 2011 with our former colleague, Senator Coats of Indiana, called the Wyden-Coats plan. Here on the left is the Big 6 framework that he described.  Let me read that again. He said that ``this is a far-right Republican scheme to endow future generations of the mega wealthy and leave what amounts to crumbs for the middle-class behind.''  Well, here is the framework he was criticizing by the language I just provided, and here is his plan in 2011. Each of these plans--the Wyden-Coats plan from 2011 and the one we are considering now--is based on three individual tax rates. Both the plan the Senator from Oregon once supported and the one we are now discussing, the framework, would collapse seven tax brackets in the current system down to three, vastly simplifying the Tax Code and the burden of complying with that Tax Code by ordinary Each plan would also eliminate the alternative minimum tax. It vastly increases the standard deduction. The Wyden-Coats plan would have tripled it. The Big 6 framework, which he criticized, doubles the standard deduction, making it so that a married couple who earn $24,000 or less would be essentially in a zero tax bracket.  So my question is, What has changed, other than the political party of the President in office? These changes to our Tax Code used to be noncontroversial, and certainly not partisan.  The Big 6 plan isn't just similar to the Wyden one, though. It also shares key features with the so-called Simpson-Bowles plan from 2010, which not long ago was embraced by a number of Democrats, including the current minority whip, the Senator from  Here is a comparison of the so-called Big 6 framework and the Simpson-Bowles plan. As you can see, there are a lot of similarities: seven brackets collapsed into three, eliminating the alternative minimum tax, and eliminating a number of itemized deductions or so-called base broadeners. It enhances the child tax credit, and it lowers the corporate rate.  These proposals were once a no-brainer for Republicans and Democrats alike. So why the change in tune? Our Democratic colleagues used to think these reforms were long overdue. They were right then, and they are wrong now.  None other than the Senate minority leader, our colleague from New York, has said: ``To preserve our international competitiveness, it is imperative that we seek to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent.'' That was the Senator from New York in 2012. He said: ``This will boost growth and encourage more companies to reinvest in the United States.''  He was absolutely correct in 2012. He is entirely wrong now to change his view and suggest that this is somehow a wrong way to approach getting the economy growing again and encouraging businesses that have earned money overseas to bring that money back home and invest it in businesses and jobs and pay for American workers here at home.  We do need to change incentives, and we do need to spur growth. That is why the new framework we are considering will create a new tax structure for small businesses, allowing them to better compete.  Once upon a time, none of this was particularly partisan, and many of our colleagues across the aisle got the picture. Our colleagues from Ohio, Minnesota, and Missouri have all said in recent years that we should lower the corporate tax rate, not because we love corporations but because we recognize that provides incentives for them to stay here and invest in jobs and businesses in America rather than overseas. But it also makes it more likely that hard-working Americans will be able to find a job and that the jobs they hold will actually pay better wages. Thanks to our reduction in individual tax rates, they will actually have more take-home pay. As some have pointed out, this literally would raise their standard of living and make it possible for them to provide for their children's education, maybe buy a reliable car so that they can go back and forth to their job every day, maybe buy a home, or perhaps save for their retirement.  There is nothing partisan about wanting an updated and more competitive tax code that will incentivize businesses to keep jobs on American soil. That is what the so-called reduction in the corporate rate will do.  Right now, we have the highest corporate rate in the world, so many businesses have simply picked up their roots here in America and have moved overseas to countries that have lower tax rates because they simply can't rationalize to their shareholders, to whom they have a fiduciary duty, paying higher taxes and remaining in the United So they take it overseas.  Even for those who stay behind--because of our extraordinarily high tax rate and the fact they literally would have to pay double taxes for income earned abroad and brought back to the United States--they pay the tax rate in the country where the money is earned, bring it back to the United States, and have to pay twice. So they pay 35 percent on top of whatever they have to pay in the countries where the money is earned.  Is it any wonder, for example, that IBM--I read this last weekend--actually has more jobs in India than it does in the United States? Let me say that again. IBM, the global computer company, has more jobs in India today than it does in the United I have no doubt that has to do with certain incentives the country will pay to companies to invest and to build their business in their country, and, no doubt, it has to do with access to skilled labor. That certainly has to be a part of it, but there can be no doubt that our Tax Code is simply encouraging companies like IBM to shift more of their work overseas. Even if they wanted to bring the money they have earned overseas back to the United States, they would have to pay twice. So what do they do? They simply invest in their workforce, they simply invest in their business in another country, much to our detriment.  If something is broken, which our Tax Code is, it needs to be fixed, not[[Page S6271]]avoided. Our Democratic colleagues need to once again acknowledge this, as so many of them did when it came to our outdated Tax Code, as I pointed out. There is no reason why tax reform can't be bipartisan, and if our colleagues just returned to some of their statements, which I have highlighted here--if they returned to those policies in a bipartisan fashion and worked with us, we could change our Tax Code for the better. We could make it simpler. We could make sure individuals have lower tax rates so they could have more take-home pay from the wages they earn and, in the process, improve their standard of living for themselves and their families. Finally, we could become more competitive in a global economy where the highest tax rate in the world does not serve American interests well. It doesn't serve the interests of American businesses well, and it doesn't serve the interests of American workers or taxpayers either.  We can do this. All it takes is political will. All it takes is approaching this in a fashion that benefits all Americans on a nonpartisan basis. I hope our colleagues will listen.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Flake). The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

161,topic-id,592,"Mr.President, I would like to take a few moments to congratulate Heath Tarbert, who was confirmed by the Senate last Wednesday and will soon be serving as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Markets and Development,[[Page S6256]]and also to talk about reform legislation that relates to his new area of responsibility. I was pleased to support Mr.Tarbert's nomination, along with the vast majority of my Senate colleagues. He has held a number of important positions in all three branches of the Federal Government, including his service as a special counsel to the Senate Banking Committee during the negotiations leading to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; an associate counsel to the President of the United States during the global financial crisis; and a law clerk for the Supreme Court of the United He is an experienced lawyer and financial expert who will be a valuable asset to the Treasury While his new position may not be well known to many outside of the Beltway, it is vitally important to safeguarding our national security interests, as Chairman Crapo of the Senate Banking Committee attested to when Mr.Tarbert was voted out of committee in near-unanimous fashion in I have no doubt of Mr.Tarbert's qualifications to take on this key role, and given that only one Member voted against his nomination, it is clear that there is a bipartisan consensus on that point.  With that being said, I look forward to working closely with him on some important reforms that are desperately needed to protect our national security and modernize the way we screen foreign investment deals for those risks. Specifically I am referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, better known as As you may know, Mr.Tarbert will now be charged with overseeing the vetting of hundreds of proposed investments annually. I am confident that Mr.Tarbert will make effective use of the tools and authorities that CFIUS has. Unfortunately, those current tools and authorities are not adequate, in light of the changing national security landscape. There are clear gaps in the CFIUS process, which nations such as China are exploiting on a daily basis. The reason for this is simple: CFIUS was not designed to stop investment-driven technology transfers, and unfortunately, many such transactions are occurring today that are carefully designed to sidestep CFIUSs' limited jurisdiction.  The need to close these gaps has garnered support from Republicans and Democrats alike, something that is seemingly rare in Washington these days. In fact, there is a bipartisan effort coming together right now to introduce legislation that would modernize the CFIUS process for the first time in a decade. Such commonsense reforms should be made to heighten scrutiny on certain types of investments, especially from countries such as China that pose a potential threat to U.national security interests. At a minimum, we should expand the types of transactions that fall under CFIUS jurisdiction, including joint ventures and minority-position investments, as well as certain real estate transactions in close proximity to military bases and other sensitive national security facilities.  My legislation, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, or FIRRMA, will do just that, and I intend to file it in the next few weeks. It will address the aforementioned gaps in the current CFIUS process and will help protect our national security. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and support these commonsense reforms for the sake of our long-term national security.

223,topic-id,1891,"Mr.President, beginning today, the Senate Budget Committee will take the next step in our effort to enact pro-growth tax reform, this time by marking up a budget resolution.  The committee's work follows the release last week of our unified framework--the tax blueprint on how to create jobs and how to put more money back in the pockets of the hard-working Americans who earn it.  Even though the framework is just 1 week old, there are some who are imagining the worst-case scenario. Rumors are spreading like wildfire. Last week, the Tax Policy Center fanned the flames when it published a report analyzing the plan--which, I want to emphasize, hasn't been written yet. Let me say that again. The Tax Policy Center published a report criticizing a plan which hasn't been written yet.  This alleged or so-called nonpartisan think tank has looked into its crystal ball and now claims to be able to see the future, and it said the future doesn't look very good. The tax plan, it says, will be a resounding flop. Well, give me a break. I, for one, am sick and tired of this sort of pessimism parading as expertise--people talking about things they know nothing about and claiming to be the experts. It is pretty common here, in Washington, DC, you might have noticed.  It is not helpful to assume the worst prematurely and to condemn this important exercise before we are even starting, and it is irresponsible to masquerade biased, partisan analysis as somehow objective.  As the Wall Street Journal wrote a couple of days ago, in response to the Tax Policy Center's economists, they made at least two baseless claims: first, that our proposal would ``reduce federal revenues by $2.4 trillion over the first ten years and $3.2 trillion over the subsequent decade''; second, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would ``receive about 50 percent of the total tax benefit.''  These statistics were pretty quotable and indeed raged like a prairie fire across the news media in our country, especially when the media is predisposed to believe the worst, without any question or semblance of skepticism. After all, the Tax Policy Center's report made for easy headlines, reciting the same tired refrains we have all heard before that are all too predictable; that, somehow, our tax plan is only designed to help the rich.  Apparently, the temptation was just too great to resist, even though the report didn't have a real author since no self-respecting economist wanted his or her name attached to it. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, however, last week's tax blueprint was just that--a starting place, a plan, a framework, and nothing more. It excluded many important data points which would be important to a real analysis.  For example, the income ranges for the three consolidated tax brackets, those weren't in the blueprint. The value of the expanded child tax credit and when it would be phased out, that wasn't in the blueprint either, and you would need to know that information in order to make a reasoned, logical analysis. The blueprint also doesn't mention tax rates for small businesses and what deductions will be eliminated as part of the base broadening.[[Page S6299]]  As we all know, an army of lobbyists, lawyers, and other folks have, since 1986, larded the Tax Code with a wide variety of deductions, credits, and other special preferences. What we need to do is clear out some of that thicket so we can lower the rates for everybody, so everybody gets a tax cut, and I mean everybody.  It is not going to be easy because we can imagine that army of lobbyists descending upon Capitol Hill trying to protect the special deals they were able to carve out of the Tax Code since 1986, but we have to do it.  None of these facts that would be important in order to conduct a reasoned and objective analysis was included in the framework, but all of them would have great potential to greatly move the final numbers. These, and many other details, are essential for any honest fiscal assessment of changes in our Tax  When will we begin to see some of those numbers? We need to pass the budget resolution out of the Budget Committee this week--which we will. Then, after Columbus Day, we will come back and have a debate and a vote-arama to pass the budget resolution, which will equip us with the technical tools we need in order to pass a reconciliation bill.  Then the real work is going to be occurring in the Finance Committee on this side of the Capitol, where we will take the chairman's mark--the original bill which Senator Hatch will introduce at the committee--which will fill in a lot of these details. I predict that will be sometime around the third or maybe fourth week of this month.  Then we are going to have an amendment process. The real question in my mind is, Will our Democratic colleagues participate and make this a bipartisan bill? I hope they will.  I also want to mention two other related points that deserve mention but which were left out of the Tax Policy's report. One is, the committees in Congress will actually have the ability to come up with the details I mentioned. That will happen in the Ways and Means Committee in the House and in the Finance Committee in the There will be, as there should be, discussion, deliberation, and compromise as the normal legislative process works out.  There have been many around Capitol Hill who have said we don't have enough ``regular order.'' What that means is, we need to conduct the normal legislative process and have the committees actually do what they are designed to do--which is to have hearings and vote on amendments and pass the bill out so it is available to be heard on the floor of the Then the Senate has a chance to amend it, vote on it, and debate it.  The second point I want to make is, any analysis of tax reform must consider what will be the impact on economic growth that will result from it. As the Journal stated, if the rate of GDP growth speeds up from the Obama administration's pace of 2 percent a year to 3 percent, incomes would rise and revenues would increase to the Treasury by some $2.5 trillion. That is what is most often underlooked, including by some of the people who score these bills.  If we are successful in passing pro-growth tax reform and tax cuts and we can get this sleeping giant of an economy awake and roaring again just to get it to 3 percent--which is below the average growth of the economy over the last three decades--just at 3 percent, it would put $2.5 trillion more in the That would be great because it would help us not only pay our bills, it would help us pay down the deficit and the debt.  Obviously, these are important factors to acknowledge. The best way to accomplish meaningful tax reform is to lower rates and simplify provisions across the board, to give Americans more take-home pay and have to spend less time hiring somebody just to complete their tax return. We can't simply throw up our hands, do nothing, and accept the status quo because American workers and job creators can't afford the status quo.  I am optimistic about the framework that has been released and look forward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee in the days and weeks ahead. What we have now is a useful starting point, and we need to fill in the blanks--and we will--so then we can have a debate based on the facts, not based on somebody's wild, fevered imagination about what the tax bill might look like.  One last point on that. We have the highest tax rate in the world for corporations and businesses. This used to be something that even the President of the United States, Barack Obama, back in 2011 acknowledged and said we need to reduce that in order to be competitive globally. We know too many of our jobs are moving overseas.  I mentioned yesterday that IBM, one of the largest businesses in the world, has more employees in India than they have in the United Now, there are probably varied reasons for that, including our Tax Some of it is access to highly trained workers, lower costs of operation, and the like, but our Tax Code is a self-inflicted economic wound for our country, and the people who pay the price are the people whose wages are stagnant or people who are looking for a job and can't find one. We need to put more money back in their pocket, let them keep more of what they earn, and get this economy growing again.                        Protect Our Children Act  Finally, just yesterday, the House passed a bill I introduced with Senators Blumenthal, Klobuchar, and Heller called the PROTECT Our Children This bill helps to stop the exploitation of children across the country and over the internet by reauthorizing the Internet Crimes Against Children, or ICAC, Task Force  The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force is a national network of 61 coordinated entities that represent 3,500 Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies that investigate and prosecute child predators. They develop victim support programs, provide training and technical assistance, and advance forensic methods.  They also help facilitate community education to make parents more aware of this threat against all of our children so we can prevent internet crimes against children before they even happen. This is an issue I have cared about for a long time, starting with my service as attorney general of I saw firsthand how vulnerable children can quickly become victimized at the hands of some truly despicable individuals. I also learned about the resources it takes to stop and prosecute these predators. Like the Presiding Officer, who also served as attorney general, we know that not all of our jurisdictions have access to the same sort of expertise and resources so it is important to have this resource in order to help them investigate and prosecute these crimes.  Back in 2000, when I started it in Texas, we called it the Internet It is kind of a quaint title these days. Now I think they call it the Cyber Crime Unit, but we call it the Internet Bureau to fight internet crimes like child pornography. Tragically, in this day and age, the internet provides a safe harbor for too many people who want to use it for their own nefarious purposes. It can be a difficult arena for our law enforcement to navigate, but this bill ensures that they will have the resources to fight cyber crimes and keep our communities safe by reauthorizing programs until 2022.  I am happy the House has now acted, and I am thankful for the work of my colleagues from Connecticut, Minnesota, and Nevada for joining me in this effort. I look forward to working expeditiously to ensure that we repass this legislation in the Senate as soon as possible.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

593,topic-id,359,"Mr.President, not too long ago--I believe this was 2011--a President came to a joint session of Congress and before the American people, he said what needed to be said about our Tax He was pretty blunt. He said that our Tax Code is ``rigged.'' He said: ``It makes no sense, and it has to change.'' Of course, you can imagine, that was met with bipartisan applause in the House Chamber and across the country.  The same President called on Democrats and Republicans to ``simplify the system, get rid of the loopholes, and . . . lower the corporate tax rate''--one that, I might add, ranks among the highest in the industrialized world.  That President, like the rest of us, knows that our business tax rate is a self-inflicted economic wound because businesses figure out, How can I move money offshore and my headquarters offshore, and if I earn money overseas, how can I avoid bringing that back to the United States for better wages and more jobs and to build the business? That is all because of our self-destructive Tax  But the President's name--and I gave it away by saying the year the speech was given. The President's name might surprise you, given the nature of the current debate in It was Barack Obama who said that, and the straight talk came from his 2011 State of the Union address.  Let's fast forward a few years. We have a new President from a different party beating the same drum. President Trump has called our Tax Code a relic and a colossal barrier standing in the way of America's economic comeback. He is right, of course, but so was President  Tax reform doesn't have to be partisan. In fact, it shouldn't be because the ramifications are much more important than just the politics and the scorekeeping of the day. The job creators in my State of Texas are the ones who really understand what is at stake because they are living it. They are the ones who are getting slammed by our current system.

912,topic-id,1210,"Mr.President, today we mourn the loss of at least 50 lives in Las Vegas, the victims of senseless violence at an outdoor concert near the Mandalay Resort and The lives of fellow Americans were taken in a barbaric manner that defies all justification, excuse, or even explanation. That these events have become almost commonplace in modern society makes them no less shocking or morally reprehensible.  The date and location--a country music festival on a Sunday afternoon--make the act seem doubly cruel. Thousands of innocent spectators were there from around the country enjoying themselves, with security being the furthest thing from their minds, until the shots rang out.  As news reports have now indicated, the event is one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.history. It and other forms of violence continue to tear apart the fabric of our country, and the scars left among the victims' families and loved ones will be painful and permanent.  My prayers go out to all those in Nevada who have not slept since yesterday and who are still grappling with the aftermath of the shooting, the families tending to loved ones in hospitals, as well as the first responders and law[[Page S6243]]enforcement officers who ran toward, not away from, the gunfire and who are now nursing various wounds. Here in Washington, we will continue to monitor the situation. We will continue to keep the fallen in our prayers in the days ahead.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, turning to the legislative business at hand, the last time Congress enacted tax reform was 1986. Back then, I was a State district judge in San Antonio, TX, the Spurs had a bad losing streak, and gasoline was 89 cents a gallon.  A lot has changed since 1986. We have seen parties in Congress win the majority, lose it, and win again. We have seen six Presidents come and go, bringing us to this moment, this year, with the President committed to providing Americans with real tax relief and the promise of a resurgent economy. After countless meetings, hearings, and conversations amongst Members who represent varying and diverse constituents, Republicans in the House and the Senate and the administration have joined together to unveil a unified framework for tax reform.  In the more than 30 years since our Tax Code has become overhauled, it has become the punch line in a bad joke. No one will defend it. Everyone knows it needs to be fixed. Over time, the code has become more complex and is now riddled with deductions, credits, and loopholes advocated by an army of lobbyists and special interests, so much so that the majority of Americans now pay somebody else to prepare their taxes because it is too complex for them to figure it out on their own, but with renewed focus and determination, we are committed to taking this framework and using it to enact real reforms to simplify a Tax Code that has grown so complex over the years, but that is not the main reason.  The main reason we need tax reform is that the Tax Code has become the enemy of a growing, prosperous economy; the enemy of more take-home pay, and the enemy of America's competitiveness in a global economy. It is self-inflicted harm, and we can and must do better.  Our first priority should be to reduce taxes for all American families, not one socioeconomic class or another--everyone. With a simpler, fairer, and more competitive Tax Code, we can raise living standards so people who earn the money can make decisions on how best to spend it themselves--on their children's education, on their home, on a car they need in order to get reliable transportation to get to and from work, or just maybe putting a little bit of money away for retirement.  I think about the newly graduated teacher in Houston's public schools who is worried about stagnant wages, the entrepreneur in Austin with a great business idea who needs investors to succeed, or a single parent in San Antonio who is living paycheck-to-paycheck. Ultimately, this is about empowering all citizens to pursue the American dream. This is about reducing government's big bite out of our wages each month and about small businesses spending more time growing and creating jobs.  By coming to the aid of hard-working American and Texas families, we will reawaken the sleeping giant that is our economy by reincentivizing investment and job creation.  I know these are lofty goals. If it were easy, we would have done it more recently than since 1986. I know some of our colleagues across the aisle and some in the public are already questioning this framework. Some have wasted no time lobbing accusations, but they don't even bother to do their homework first. They are engaging in the same kind of class warfare many have come to love to wage here in Washington, DC, but those tactics are deeply cynical and deeply untrue.  Here is their lie. They say our tax plan cuts taxes for the wealthy and hurts the poor, even though the actual plan hasn't been written yet. Some claim they already know what the bill says, and they don't. That is entirely predictable in this political environment and wholly false. Let me tell you why.  First, we will cut taxes for all American families without shifting the burden from higher income households to lower or middle-income households. To accomplish this, the framework creates a large zero tax bracket by doubling the standard deduction. The first $12,000 of income for an individual and $24,000 for a couple would be tax-free.  Let me say it again. If you are a couple who makes $24,000 or less, you will pay zero Federal income tax, which is effectively a zero tax bracket. Additionally, the proposed individual rates are collapsed into three, at 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. So instead of seven tax brackets, which we have now for individuals, we will have four, including the zero tax bracket. This framework also enhances the child tax credit. It repeals the death tax that has hurt small businesses and their families; it has broken up family farms and ranches. And it repeals the special interest tax breaks that primarily benefit the wealthy.  The other refrain some critics have already started making is the claim that our tax plan gives big tax cuts to job creators. As I said, in addition to closing the special interest loopholes, nearly everyone will see some sort of benefit, and job creators will take that benefit and invest in their businesses. They will hire more people, and they will improve wages and growth in the economy, from which we will all benefit. So why would our Democratic colleagues oppose that?  Our unified framework is a template that will be used by the tax-writing committees to put the nuts and bolts together for tax reform. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I look forward to working with Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, as well as colleagues in the House--Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, Speaker Ryan, and others--on these ideas. I even look forward to working with our Democratic colleagues if they will join us.  I yield the floor.

Lastly, if you cannot treat someone with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.  Lieutenant General Silveria is a role model.

459,topic-id,358,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman, my friend and colleague from Kentucky, for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, the Republican budget proposal is just cruel. It isn't just cruel; it will set our country backwards. It is worse than cruel.  It puts more than $5 trillion in cuts on the backs of working and middle class At the same time, it doles out billions of dollars in tax breaks to wealthy individuals, while leaving everyday Americans emptyhanded.  Are you a senior who relies on Medicare or Medicaid for important healthcare needs?  Too bad, says the Republican budget. Your care will simply be cut.  Are you a student looking to get a good education and launch your career?  Tough luck, says the Republican budget. Pell grants are on the chopping block, if Republicans have their way.  Are you struggling to recover after a natural disaster?  Forget about it, says the Republican budget. Grants from FEMA and other programs that help rebuild our Nation will be eliminated.  The facts are clear: this Republican budget does nothing to invest in America, the American people, or our future. It cuts funds for our crumbling infrastructure, rather than rebuilding our schools and roads and putting millions back to work. It slashes investment in green energy technology, rather than preparing a new generation of Americans to lead us into the economy of tomorrow.  Worst of all, it ramps up funding for endless wars overseas while gutting programs that help the brave veterans who served their country so well.  Eighty years ago, then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt spoke of a national nightmare when he saw a third of our Nation ``ill-housed, ill-clad, and ill-nourished.''                              {time}  1545  When you look at this budget, it is not hard to see why FDR's words haunt us to this day, because this budget would take us back to that terrible time when dreams were dashed, futures were uncertain, and hope was all but lost, put back to a time when people were hurting.

After fertility treatment, they were thrilled when his wife finally became pregnant with identical twins. Sadly, their twins were diagnosed with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, a deadly complication.  At week 21, Phil and his wife learned the devastating and frightening news that not only would both twins die, but that without an abortion, his wife was at serious risk of suffering a ruptured uterus.  Their options were limited. Their doctor could not perform an abortion because he was affiliated with a Catholic hospital, and Phil's wife was unable to fly due to her high-risk pregnancy. Instead, they drove from their home in Missouri to Kansas to terminate the pregnancy by induced labor and delivery.  Phil and his wife were devastated. After the twins' deaths, Phil participated in a baptism and grieved their loss.  Phil wants lawmakers to know: ``Decisions about abortion need to be made[[Page H7718]]with the families and with the best medical information available.'' As he rightly puts it: ``There is no one-size-fits-all situation for all pregnancies.''

519,topic-id,462,"Mr.Chairman, Republicans have chosen to lavish huge tax breaks on large multinationals and the top wealthiest few in our country instead of growing our economy by investing in all Investing in our workforce, in our physical infrastructure, in entrepreneurship, that is the way to really grow the economy; not these retread Republican tax policies that offer all the benefits to the top and hope something will eventually trickle down to everyone else, that only grow the national debt, as has been shown time and time again.  Our Republicans today call their budget a vision for our country, and what a grim vision it is for anyone who does not count themselves among the top 1 percent. Republicans would only widen income inequality with massive tax breaks for the few, while slashing trillions from initiatives that give more Americans the chance to get ahead, while, at the same time, strengthening our overall economic future.  For seniors, this is a budget that breaks Trump's promise not to cut Medicare to the tune of about half a trillion dollars in cuts, and it would slash an additional $1 trillion for Medicaid, upon which so many seniors rely.  For students and families that are struggling to get a college education, the ticket into the middle class, and into economic competitiveness, this budget will make it harder to climb the economic ladder with major cuts to Pell grants and other student assistance programs, and it will limit our investment in education and job training for American workers that are already out there trying to upgrade their skills.  What does the Republican budget do with all the money they save from cutting the middle class and working people, seniors, and those who are trying to get ahead? Well, it stuffs the pockets of those at the top and the large multinationals.  What President Trump and his Republican cohorts say their plan is, it isn't. You know, only last week, Trump said this about his tax plan: ``I don't benefit. I don't benefit. In fact, very, very strongly, as you see, I think there is very little benefit for people of wealth.''  Well, the analysis of the one tax return that leaked out suggests that President Trump will benefit to the tune of more than $1 billion. Eighty percent of the tax breaks in this proposal go to the top 1 percent. That is people who are making more than $730,000 a year while one in four Americans could actually see a tax increase.  That is why you can understand that they say they can't guarantee that taxes won't go up for many people in the middle class. And overall, this is a budget that is dripping in red ink.

As a surgeon and a scientist, I know that unborn children feel pain at 20 weeks, at the very latest at 20 weeks.  Scientific studies have found that a baby's first sensory receptors for pain are developed in the first 7 weeks. By 20 weeks, an unborn baby is so developed that they can hear music and respond to sounds, but, most importantly, a substantial body of medical evidence shows that he or she can feel and respond to pain.  Let there be no mistake: late-term abortion practices are gruesome and painful. These babies are dismembered limb from limb, yet the United States is one of only seven nations in the world that allows for elective late-term abortions. We are joining nations like North Korea and China that allow for elective late-term abortions. It is shocking to the conscience.  By passing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and banning late-term abortions after 20 weeks, we stand up to protect the innocent and the defenseless.  The Psalm says: ``Children are a gift from the Lord.'' If we here today do not protect this gift, who will? If we do not shield unborn Americans from a death so painful and unimaginable, who will?

42,topic-id,831,"Mr.President, there are a lot of issues roiling our Nation these days. I want to talk about an issue that may not get all the headlines, but that has seen dramatic and troubling changes this year: our Nation's higher education policy.  Over the last several weeks, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has continued her assault on students and their families.  Previously we had seen her rescind reforms that would improve customer service for students and hold student loan servicers accountable for their treatment of borrowers; rescind a policy prohibiting debt collectors from charging borrowers 16 percent fees to bring their loans out of default; halt the processing of borrower defense loan discharge applications from students defrauded by for-profit colleges and throwing out rules intended to help students get the discharges to which they are entitled to under law; rewrite the gainful employment rule, which is meant to protect students from programs for-profit colleges that saddle students with too much debt compared to their income; propose eliminating public service loan forgiveness, which helps students afford to serve their communities, States, and country while repaying their student loans; propose dumping $38 billion in additional student loan interest on needy students by eliminating subsidized undergraduate loans; and propose freezing the maximum Pell grant award so that their award covers even less of what it costs a student to attend college.  That is just the beginning.  Several weeks ago, I joined Senators Brown, Murray, and Warren in calling on Secretary DeVos to appoint a credible, well-qualified, independent chief enforcement officer to lead the Department of Education's enforcement unit.[[Page S6350]]  The unit was created after the collapse of Corinthian to improve oversight of higher education institutions and enforcement of Federal laws.  Robert Kaye, a respected investigator and consumer expert from the Federal Trade Commission, was selected to be the first chief. Kaye left the post in  Secretary DeVos allowed this critical position to remain vacant for more than 4 months until earlier last month, when she finally announced the appointment of Julian Schmoke,  At first glance, Schmoke meets none of the requirements for the job that my colleagues and I set out in our letter.  As chief enforcement officer, Schmoke will be charged with ensuring that institutions of higher education are following Federal laws and regulations.  This will mean paying special attention to an area that poses the most risk to students and has demonstrated systemic abuse: for-profit colleges.  These are the colleges that enroll 9 percent of all postsecondary students in America, but take in 17 percent of all Federal student aid and account for 33 percent of all Federal student loan defaults.  Beyond the infamous Corinthian and ITT Tech examples, there are countless examples of for-profit colleges defrauding students, whether it be Ashford, Westwood, or  Last year, DeVry agreed to pay the Federal Trade Commission $100 million for defrauding students and agreed to a separate settlement with the Department of  Guess who Schmoke previously worked for? You guessed it, DeVry  In fact, there are reports that DeVry is still under investigation by the very unit Schmoke has been appointed to lead. How is that for the fox guarding the henhouse?  If that wasn't enough, there is no discernable evidence on Schmoke's resume of any experience conducting or overseeing investigations.  Shortly after his appointment, I joined Senators Brown, Warren, Blumenthal, and Whitehouse in writing to Schmoke raising these concerns and asking him to meet with us. We are still waiting.  As Betsy DeVos orchestrates a corporate takeover of the Department of Education by for-profit interests, State attorneys general and other Federal agencies are even more important in providing aggressive oversight to protect students and taxpayers.  Betsy DeVos is doing what she can to disrupt that, too.  On September 1, the Department of Education provided notice to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that it was terminating its existing data-sharing agreement with the  The Department took exception ``to the CFPB unilaterally expanding its oversight role . . .'' into areas that the Department viewed as within its jurisdiction.  The CFPB has been a leader in protecting student borrowers harmed by Federal loan servicers like Navient and predatory lending practices by institutions like Corinthian and ITT  This political stunt makes clear that Secretary DeVos would rather initiate a turf war than work with other Federal agencies to fulfill the Federal Government's collective oversight responsibilities.  In announcing Schmoke as the new chief enforcement officer, Secretary DeVos said, ``Protecting students has always been my top priority.''  Well, Madam Secretary, your actions just don't back up that statement.  Nearly every time you have had the opportunity to stand up for students, their families, and taxpayers, you have turned your back on them.  Commonsense protections for students and taxpayers shouldn't be a partisan issue.  Secretary DeVos, I urge you to abandon this assault on students and instead work with us to strengthen America's system of higher education, to deal honestly with wrongdoing by for-profit colleges, and to increase opportunities for all                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-05-pt1-PgS6349-4.txt,326,ELDER ABUSE PREVENTION AND PROSECUTION ACT,2017,5,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,topic-id,720,"Mr.President, over 2 weeks ago, Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands were devastated by Hurricane This was less than a month after the islands felt the impacts of another powerful storm, Hurricane Hurricane Maria has left a wake of destruction across the islands. In Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, too many Americans remain without power, clean drinking water, or a method of communicating with their relatives and first responders.  Last week, I met with leaders in the Puerto Rican community in Chicago to discuss local efforts to provide aid. This week, I met with a delegation from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to discuss relief efforts and what we can do at the Federal level to help them rebuild. The stories they shared about friends and family in Puerto Rico were heartbreaking. These people, our fellow American citizens, are facing a life and death situation. Sadly, the lives of at least 16 people have been claimed.  The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, and aid cannot wait. The 3.5 million people who live on the island of Puerto Rico are our fellow U.citizens, and it is our duty to provide aid to them in their time of need.  Yesterday, Congress received a supplemental aid request from the administration to provide much needed disaster relief to our fellow Now, Congress must come together to help these Americans rebuild homes and businesses, restore critical infrastructure, and access life-sustaining supplies.  Providing emergency disaster assistance to people in need is not a local issue. It is an American issue.  Just as I expect my colleagues to come to the aid of the State of Illinois when we are faced with a natural disaster and just as Congress came to the aid of Hurricane Harvey victims a few short weeks ago, the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands expect us to rally behind them as they work to respond to Hurricane  I urge my colleagues to quickly pass a clean aid package that will help all Americans whose lives have been impacted by these natural disasters. Any supplemental appropriations bill that includes aid for States impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma must also include aid for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and western States that have been devastated by wildfires.  I was heartened to hear that the Illinois National Guard has deployed teams to provide telecommunication assistance, food, water, tents, and cots to Puerto I was also glad to see that individual assistance is now available for all 78 of the municipalities on the island, ensuring all individuals in Puerto Rico can receive assistance from the Federal  The Federal response to this disaster has taken far too long, and we must do more to help our fellow American citizens during this humanitarian crisis.  In Congress, our top priority should be making sure the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have the funding they need to rebuild and recover. We cannot delay providing this much needed funding any longer.  It has been tragic to see thousands of shipping containers held at ports, which have been full of critical, life-sustaining supplies that are not reaching those most in need. There continue to be reports of families in Puerto Rico who are stranded and isolated. We must prioritize quickly distributing supplies to reach every individual in the days, weeks, and months to come. The U.citizens who live in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are at risk of running out of food, water, and fuel. It would be unconscionable for us to abandon them in their time of need.  Our thoughts are with the many people who have lost their loved ones, their homes, and other property. I want to recognize the hard work of the volunteers, local officials, and Federal employees that have come forward in this time of need and pitched in at every level.  We can and should do more to help the people of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands rebuild and recover. I have no doubt that the people of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands will be able to clean up and rebuild, and they will be stronger for it. The entire Nation must come together as an American family to give them the aid and support they need at every step along the way.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-05-pt1-PgS6349-3.txt,326,ELDER ABUSE PREVENTION AND PROSECUTION ACT,2017,5,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 5 years ago, President Obama, at my urging, issued an Executive order that changed their lives. It was called It gave them a chance to come forward and register with the government, submit themselves to a criminal background check, get fingerprinted, pay a $500 fee, have their background looked at in detail, and gave them a chance to stay in the United States for 2 years at a time, and in that 2-year period not be subjected to deportation and be able to work.  Four weeks ago, President Trump announced that the DACA Program was going to be rescinded. Many of these young people don't know what their future will be from this point forward. A number of them came out to the steps of the Capitol this afternoon to talk about their lives. Two in particular I wanted to mention.  Nathali Bertran from Columbus, OH, is a student who graduated from college after great sacrifice and has gone on to become an engineer. She is currently working in the Columbus area for a global automotive company. She has a bright future if she is allowed to stay in the United She doesn't know the answer to that because we haven't come up with a replacement for DACA, which was rescinded by President  Jesus Perez is from Tulsa, He had given up on a college education and a future, and then DACA came along, and he decided he wanted to be a doctor. He is on his way. He has finished community college. He is now about to complete his studies at Oklahoma State, and he wants to go to medical school. He works as a transporter and a surgical orderly in a hospital to make enough money to stay in school. His future is completely in doubt because of the uncertainty around what is going to happen to those who were protected by  I have said many times that these young people were brought here by their parents. They didn't make the decision. I don't want to look negatively on their parents. If I were given a choice of skirting the law or even breaking the law to save my child's life or to give them security and safety, I know what I would do. I also know what these parents did. But the kids themselves were not in on that decision process.  Now, all they are asking for is a chance to be a part of the only country they have ever known. They got up in the classroom every day at school and pledged allegiance to the only flag they ever knew, and most of them can sing only one national anthem, the anthem of the country they believe is their own, the United That is an important part of this conversation.  If we believe in fairness and justice in America--and I think we do--we want to be fair and just to these young people. If they have not done something in their lives that is dangerous, such as commit a crime, for example, that is serious, they ought to be given a chance. If they are willing to go to school or to work or to enlist in our military, why wouldn't we welcome them in so that they can be a part of our future, as they should be. The alternative, in many cases, is to ship them back to a country they cannot remember or never really knew, to a language they don't speak. That is not the right outcome.  I want to thank Lindsey Graham of South He is my Republican cosponsor of the Dream Senator Graham has been a stalwart. He and I may disagree on an issue every other day, but on this issue, we agree. We agree that America should step forward and do the right thing for these young people.  I hope these lobbyists--I will use that term--who are Dreamers, who are roaming the Halls of Congress, will[[Page S6316]]make the same impression on my colleagues that they made on me--that their special lives and their special future will make this Nation a better Nation in the years to come.

278,topic-id,1547,"Mr.President, let me thank my colleague from He sponsored a filibuster on this issue, I believe it was last year. I participated in it, as did many Members of our caucus.  Both he and Senator Blumenthal bring a special perspective to this issue of gun violence, representing the State of Connecticut and the families who lost their first graders. I believe they were first graders who were shot down, 20 of them killed in their classrooms.  I remember, when I heard that story on how those children died and their teachers died, I thought to myself: This must be the moment that will motivate America to finally do something if innocent, first grade children can be shot down in their classrooms in this fashion.  The honest answer is that we have spoken a lot about the issue, but we have done little or nothing to change the circumstances that led to their death.  If that were the only case, it would be bad enough, but the Orlando nightclub--I believe 49 were killed there. Some crazed person went there and killed innocent people gathered at that nightclub.  As Senator Murphy has said, when you go through the litany, it is an endless litany of victims of gun violence--and last night in Las Vegas, NV, the worst gun crime in the modern history of the United States of America, the worst.  Estimates now, which I saw as I came to the floor, are that 58 have died and over 500 were seriously injured. I don't know what the ultimate numbers will be, but those numbers, in and of themselves, are incredible.  Last night, we witnessed what was the worst mass shooting to date in the This gunman, supposedly, at 10 p.m. last night in Las Vegas local time, began firing from a room on the 32nd floor of a hotel into a crowd of people gathered for a country music festival. He supposedly was holed up in his hotel room with at least 10 guns and obviously fired hundreds of rounds of ammunition.  As I mentioned, 58 people have been reported to have died, and over 515 injured. Those are staggering and horrifying numbers.  There are literally hundreds of families tonight and communities who have been changed forever by this horrendous crime. Our prayers, obviously, naturally, go out to them in this moment of loss and uncertainty.  During and after the shooting--as we expect but should never take for granted--law enforcement, first responders, acted like the heroes that they are, working to stop the shooter, securing the scene, helping the victims, saving lives. We are grateful to these first responders, who so often are called to run to the sound of gunfire to keep us safe, not to run away.  It is unthinkable that this type of shooting tragedy could happen in the United States of America, but I am sorry to say it is becoming a regular occurrence. This was the worst, but yesterday, October 1, was also the 2-year anniversary of the mass shooting in Roseburg, OR, when a gunman killed eight students and a professor at a community college.  Also, this past weekend, at least 33 people were shot in the city of At least four died. The relentless toll of gun violence never seems to stop.  The American Medical Association has declared that gun violence is a public health crisis in On an average day, 300 Americans are shot. On an average day, 300 Americans are shot. About one-third of them will die from that gunshot.  Mass shootings, as Senator Murphy said earlier, have become a daily occurrence. If our critics would say ``Please, don't exploit the event of a mass shooting by speaking on the floor,'' as Senator Murphy has made clear, then we wouldn't be able to speak any day of the year because they are so common.  We can't let this become the new American normal. We can't just shrug our shoulders when we see over 30,000 Americans shot and killed year after year after year. We can't sit back and do nothing while hundreds of our fellow Americans are shot in one night simply because they went out to hear a music concert.  Just this last week, I was at a concert in Nashville, TN, at the Ryman, the site of the Grand Ole Opry; 2,000 people gathered there. They were mainly folks from the Midwest, many of them retired, who love country music, I am sure, as the people in Las Vegas did. When I heard about what happened in Las Vegas, I thought: Well, what if someone had walked into that theater and opened fire? It could have, sadly, happened there.  What are we going to do about it? Certainly, there will be outrage at the death. There will be grief over the loss. But then what? That is what Senator Murphy challenges us to think about.  We serve in the U.We are not just casual observers of this violence. We are supposed to pass laws to make America safer. What will we do because of what happened in Las Vegas last night? That is the question that brings me to the floor this evening. If we have a responsibility to keep our families and America safe, what are we prepared to do?  For the gun deaths in Chicago, there are some things that I would do instantly. Background checks--I don't believe we should be able to walk into a gun show and buy a firearm or more than one, incidentally, and take them out of the back door without somebody asking: Who are you? Do you have a criminal record? Would you be disqualified from buying these same guns at a licensed gun dealer?  Currently, the law is riddled with loopholes, and those loopholes lead to death, death on the streets of  We also have these purchases being made by straw purchasers. In other words, the girlfriend, who has no criminal record, who walks into the gun[[Page S6254]]shop in the suburbs of Chicago and buys the gun for her boyfriend outside in the car, who is going to use it that night to shoot up a rival gang member or some other criminal activity. Those are two very obvious things I would push for instantly: Close the gun show loophole; make sure we do something about straw purchasers so that the penalties are serious enough that they will never do it again.  There is more. This morning, I was on a radio show in Chicago, one of the most famous ones, I guess. I listened to a fellow named Steve Cochran celebrating his 1,000th show on the air. This was the topic we talked about.  Steve asked me: Well, what can we do? I said: Steve, we have to rely on people who honor the Second Amendment and believe it is an important part of our Constitution to stand up and lead. I am talking about members of my family who are hunters and sportsmen. I have been out hunting myself. We have to have people who are concerned about guns for self-defense stand up and say: We have to draw a reasonable line. There is no reasonable line under the Second Amendment that would allow what happened in Las Vegas last night.  To think that someone could injure over 500 people and kill 58--what kind of weaponry did he use? We will know. We will find out the details, but it certainly goes beyond any reasonable weaponry needed for self-defense, sport, or hunting purposes.  Can we not at least appeal to those who honor the Second Amendment to join us in drawing a reasonable line so combat and military-style weapons that can lead to such carnage are not considered to be normal or acceptable? Decades ago we did when it came to machineguns. Decades ago we said this is a weapon no one should have, period, except for the military and perhaps law enforcement. Can we return to that conversation? We are going to need the leadership from people who believe in the Second Amendment to make it happen.  We have seen Democrats and Republicans join together to pass meaningful laws to deal with public health crises like opioid addiction. We have to do the same for this public health crisis.  I am sorry to report that a recent nominee for Surgeon General of the United States was almost denied that opportunity because he was bold enough to say that gun violence is a public health crisis. It certainly is.  There is no single law or policy that will prevent every tragic shooting, just as there is no single law or policy that will end heroin overdoses, but let's start working together to do something.  We can't stop the shootings that have already happened in Las Vegas, Chicago, Roseburg, OR, and across the We failed to respond in time for those victims and their families. But if we work together, we can stop shootings in the future. That is something we should all strive to do.  We must do all we can to spare families the unimaginable pain so many in Las Vegas are feeling today in the aftermath of this horrible tragedy. I hope we will.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

908,topic-id,315,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to voice my concern regarding the nomination of Ajit Pai to serve as a Commissioner of the Federal Communications  Many of my colleagues are planning to speak about the threat Mr.Pai poses to a free and open Internet, but what brings me to the floor is a different looming threat to the public interest: the proposed Sinclair Broadcast Group merger with Tribune Media If approved, the Sinclair-Tribune merger would create the Nation's largest television broadcast company in history, reaching over 70 percent of households nationwide. There is reason for concern.  Mr.Pai's track record at the FCC has shown that he will not hesitate to put the needs of industry ahead of the best interests of consumers. Under his leadership as Chairman, the FCC acted to reinstate an outdated loophole known as the UHF discount that would make it easier for companies to get around rules limiting national media ownership. These rules are essential in maintaining the trust Americans have placed in their local broadcasters and ensuring consumers benefit from programming representing diverse viewpoints.  What was Mr.Pai's motivation for putting this loophole back in place? I will just say this: The loophole was reinstated in April, and Sinclair announced its acquisition of Tribune in  My concerns about the merger are not solely grounded in Sinclair's practice of mandating its stations distribute its self-produced conservative content, as troubling as that is. Rather it is that no single company should be[[Page S6242]]able to decide what 72 percent of the country's news looks like. The Sinclair-Tribune merger undermines competition and threatens local broadcasting as a trusted and diverse voice for its viewers in Illinois and across the country.  Because of Mr.Pai's deregulatory campaign and repeated failure to put the best needs of the consumer first, I will oppose his nomination to serve a second term as a Commissioner for the Federal Communications  ",CREC-2017-10-02-pt1-PgS6237-9.txt,326,GOING FORWARD AS AMERICANS,2017,2,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

968,topic-id,808,"Mr.President, sometimes, when I am asked to describe my politics, I say, ``I believe in the Gospel of Saints Paul''--Paul the Apostle, Paul Douglas, Paul Simon, and Paul  Paul the Apostle was, of course, one of the most important figures in the history of the early Christian Paul Douglas, Paul Simon, and Paul Wellstone were Members of this Senate and champions of human rights and human dignity.  This Friday, another champion of human rights and human dignity--Timuel Black--will honored by Citizen Action Illinois with its ninth annual Pauls Award, named for Paul Simon and Paul  I am lucky enough to have been friends with both Pauls--Simon and I am sure that they would have approved heartily of the decision to honor Black with an award bearing their names.  Timuel Black is a decorated World War II veteran, an educator, author, labor leader, civil rights activist, and historian--and a bender of the moral arc of the universe. He is a visionary and--for me and so many others--a personal hero.  Timuel Black was born in 1918, in Birmingham, AL--the son of a sharecropper and the grandson of slaves.  He was 8 months old when his family moved to Chicago--the first wave of the great migration of African Americans from the Deep South to the They settled in a part of town called the Black Belt, now known as  He attended DuSable High School, a legendary all-Black public high school, where his classmates included Nat King Cole and John Johnson, who would go on to found Jet and Ebony magazines.  On his 23rd birthday, Japan bombed U.Navy ships at Pearl  He served 2 years in a segregated U.He participated in the Battle of the Bulge, the invasion of Normandy and the liberation of Paris, and he earned four battle stars.  He thought he had seen the worst of World War II--then he witnessed what had happened at Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp.  The horrors that he witnessed at that death camp changed his life.  For a time, he was filled with despair. Then he resolved to spend the rest of his life doing whatever he could to advance the causes of human rights and human dignity.  He returned to Chicago and earned an undergraduate degree from Roosevelt University and a master's degree from the University of  He helped establish the Congress of Racial He also helped found a labor union that helped me work my way through college: the United Packinghouse Workers of  He began his professional career as a social worker, but he quickly discovered that his real love was ``teaching young men and women about the world they live in and how to be responsible citizens of that world.''  He spent more than 40 years as a teacher, including positions at DuSable and other Chicago public schools, as well as Roosevelt University, Columbia College Chicago and schools in the City Colleges of Chicago system.  Timuel Black was watching television in December 1955 when he saw ``this good-looking man in Montgomery, Alabama.'' He was so moved that he boarded a plane to meet him.  A year later, Tim Black convinced that young man to come to Chicago--the first time Martin Luther King would speak in the city.  In 1963, Black helped organize the Freedom Trains that carried thousands of Chicagoans to hear King and[[Page S6285]]others speak at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, He was there when King delivered his immortal ``I Have a Dream'' speech.

In 1983, Tim Black provided influential support to help elect another of his DuSable High School classmates, Harold Washington, the first African-American mayor of  Some years later, a young community organizer who had just returned to Chicago with a Harvard law degree asked Professor Black to teach him about organizing people so they could create a better life for themselves and their children.  Over the years, Professor Black and that young organizer became good friends.

Politics is what we do, politics is what we create, by what we work for, by what we hope for and what we dare to imagine.  Timuel Black has witnessed injustice and inhumanity, but he has never stopped working to believe in a better world, and he has never stopped working to make that world a reality.

1100,topic-id,1191,"Mr.President, today I reintroduced the Adjunct Faculty Loan Fairness Act, a bill that would enable faculty working less than full-time to participate in the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness  Contingent faculty members are like full-time instructors. They have advanced degrees. They teach classes and spend many hours outside the classroom preparing for class. They hold office hours, grade papers, and give feedback to students. They provide advice and write letters of recommendation. Students rely on them. Since most adjuncts have advanced degrees and, as the 63 percent of graduate degree recipients who borrow have an average of almost $59,000 in student loans, they are among the 44 million Americans with student debt.[[Page S6362]]  The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is meant to encourage graduates to go into public service by offering student loan forgiveness for eligible Federal loans after ten years of full-time work in government or the non-profit sector. Public service fields like nursing, military service, and public health qualify. And many education jobs qualify, including full-time work at public universities and part-time work at community colleges in high-needs subject areas or areas of shortage. But other faculty members, those who work part-time, are not eligible for loan forgiveness because the law requires an annual average of 30 hours per week to qualify for the program. For adjunct faculty working on a contingent basis--many of whom may only teach one or two classes while holding down other part-time jobs to make ends meet--this requirement can be difficult or impossible to meet, even when they are putting in more than 30 hours of work each week.  The number of faculty hours given for each class is calculated differently at different schools. Some schools give one hour per hour in the classroom while others actually take into consideration the time required outside the classroom. So, even as these faculty members are working hard to provide quality instruction for their students, often without the option of moving into a tenured, full-time position, their public service is not recognized by the current Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.  The Adjunct Faculty Loan Fairness Act of 2017 would solve this by amending the Higher Education Act to expand the definition of a ``public service job'' to include a part-time faculty member who teaches at least one course at an eligible institution of higher education. They would still have to meet all the other requirements to qualify for the public service loan forgiveness program, including making 120 on-time payments while employed at a qualifying institution, and they could not be employed full-time elsewhere at the same time. I believe it corrects a major flaw in the current system and rewards individuals for their contribution to public service rather than penalize them for the number of hours they work.  This bill would benefit someone like Brittany, an adjunct professor in southern Brittany finished her graduate degree in 2013 and still has over $70,000 in student loan debt today. This debt has prevented her from attending law school, her longtime dream, and makes it challenging to put money aside for her retirement. This debt is also putting her children's future at risk--Brittany will still be paying off her own loans when it is time for her now four-month old child to attend college. This bill would ensure that Brittany, and thousands like her, could secure their family's financial future by earning credit towards the Public Service Loan Forgiveness for loan payments made while teaching, regardless of the fact that she isn't full-time faculty.  Unfortunately, for all their contributions to their colleges and the students they work with, adjunct faculty like Brittany often don't have the same employment benefits or job security as their colleagues. The number of classes they teach every semester varies. To make ends meet, these professors often end up teaching classes at more than one school in the same semester, getting paid about $3,000 per class and making an average annual income that hovers around minimum wage. This also means that, in some parts of the country, they spend as much time commuting as they do teaching.  Nationally, over half of all higher education faculty work on a contingent basis. In the past, these were a minority of professors who were hired to teach an occasional class because they could bring experience to the classroom in a specific field or industry. Over time, as university budgets have tightened and it has gotten more expensive to hire full-time, tenure track professors, higher education institutions have increasingly relied on adjuncts.  From 1991 to 2015, the number of part-time faculty in the U.increased two and a half times from 291,000 to over 743,000. At the same time, the percentage of professors holding tenure and tenure-track positions has been steadily decreasing from 45 percent of all instructors in 1975 to only 29 percent in 2015. The number of full-time instructors, tenured and non-tenured, now makes up less than half of all professors on U.campuses. Today, a majority of the 1.5 million faculty employees at public and non-profit colleges and universities in the United States work on a part-time, contingent basis.  Illinois colleges rely heavily on adjuncts. In 2015, 52 percent of all faculty at all Title IV degree-granting institutions in the state--more than 31,700 faculty employees--worked on a part-time basis. This is a 32.4 percent increase in part-time faculty in Illinois compared to a 7 percent increase in full-time faculty since 2002.  This bill does not fix the growing reliance by our higher education system on part-time professors who are underpaid and undervalued. But it would ensure that members of the contingent faculty workforce are no longer unfairly excluded from the loan forgiveness program for public servants. I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Al Franken from Minnesota, for joining me in this effort. I hope my other colleagues will join us to ensure this program benefits faculty members who provide our students with a quality education.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                1927       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

How[[Page H7654]]many more times are we going to have to turn on our televisions or our phones or get a text message to talk about some other mass shooting in America?  We have got to do something to stop this now.  There is no reason that someone like the killer should have automatic weapons or semiautomatic weapons.  I believe people have legitimate reasons to have guns, but not legitimate reasons to have automatic weapons to mow down so many innocent people. And it will happen again and again and again, because we refuse to do anything to have sensible gun control in this country.  My heart goes out to the families, but thoughts and prayers are not enough. A moment of silence in the House is not enough. We need to do something now to have sensible gun control laws; otherwise, these words ring hollow.  This country is hurting, and guns are doing it, guns in the hands of wrong people.  Again, guns for hunters, guns to keep people safe, I am not opposed to that, but I certainly am opposed to automatic weapons. Nobody needs automatic weapons.

She desperately wanted to have a child but felt guilt, shame, and isolation after being raped.  She ultimately decided to continue the pregnancy. She believed it would help her grieve and grasp onto something positive after such a traumatic experience.

Ultimately, she decided to end the pregnancy.  Thankfully, Erica was able to help this patient through the most difficult time in her life. I want to share her words: ``As a physician, it is my job to guide the patient through the risks, benefits, and alternatives of all options available to her. It is not my job to place judgment on patients that only serve to punish women who are already suffering, and it certainly is not the job of the legislature to interfere with the patient-physician relationship.''

1073,topic-id,288,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  H.36 would prohibit the performance or attempted performance of an abortion after 20 weeks, and harshly punishes physicians who violate the law. This bill has narrow exemptions for the life of a mother (rape and incest) but there are no exemptions in the bill for conditions where the fetus has conditions or diagnoses that are incompatible with life.  We have spent the entirety of this Congress defending women's reproductive rights and fighting against plans that would eliminate funding and access to the health care providers of a woman's choosing. This bill is yet another attack on a woman's right to decide what is best for her and her body. A woman, not a politician, must be able to make health decisions that are best for her own circumstances.  H.36 ignores that every pregnancy is different and compromises a woman's right to the health care she is legally entitled to. It punishes women who are already in difficult situations. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that neither a state nor the federal government can ban safe and legal abortion services pre-viability.  I support a woman's legal right to opt for or against an abortion. The decision is private. It's a matter of faith and it's a matter of conscience, and our Constitution recognizes this.  What I do not support is a bill that takes away a woman's Constitutional right. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is a shameful attempt to impose a radical political agenda on women. It strips away their individual liberties and puts their health at serious risk. This bill is wrong, this bill is dangerous, and this House should reject it.

Thousands and thousands of people, including Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz and the Governor, are compromised with the well-being of the Puerto Rican people. I saw firefighters and emergency workers at the Philadelphia airport trying to reach Puerto Rico to help their brothers and sisters. This has moved me and I understand the Puerto Rican people have a very big heart and immense solidarity.

Yesterday, I released a 10-point plan following my assessment, and I offer this as a solution to provide an immediate emergency relief package for the humanitarian crisis we are witnessing in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin  It is my hope that we, as Members of Congress, will work together to find solutions quickly, as the lives of U.citizens and the efforts to rebuild have remained encumbered.  Madam Speaker, I call for an immediate $20 billion emergency relief package for Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Congress needs to act on a humanitarian emergency relief package for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands no later than this week. They cannot wait another week.  It is estimated that Puerto Rico will need $85 billion for their recovery efforts. At a minimum, Congress need to enact a $20 billion emergency relief package for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin  Also, I call for a hearing on Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands recovery efforts. A congressional task force for coordinated relief efforts must be put in place. The delayed response in Puerto Rico was egregious.  I join my colleagues in calling for a hearing on Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands recovery efforts and for a full assessment on how to mitigate delayed reactions in the future and a strategic plan on a long-term recovery effort not only for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, but for the entire Caribbean region that, unfortunately, stands on the pathway of natural disasters, including hurricane season.  As my colleagues have stated, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force resulted in a comprehensive plan[[Page H7678]]developed by Federal and local stakeholders, which then helped aid the recovery efforts in U.and elsewhere. A similar plan is needed for all of the areas affected during this hurricane season.  We must also create a permanent waiver of the Jones Act for diesel and fuel. The latest 10-day waiver by the Trump administration is not nearly enough. The Jones Act needs to be waived for at least a year so that response and rebuilding efforts are not encumbered. I also call for a permanent waiver for diesel and fuel.  I also call for immediate deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.

198,topic-id,1163,"Mr.President, yesterday I introduced the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act of 2017.  First, I would like to thank Senators Blumenthal, Murphy, Schumer, Durbin, Leahy, Cortez Masto, Van Hollen, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Markey, Casey, Reed, Hassan, Merkley, Carper, Cardin, Coons, Franken, Harris, Booker, Whitehouse, Hirono, Sanders, Warren, Cantwell, McCaskill, Nelson, Murray, Udall, Kaine, Warner, Bennet, Schatz, Wyden, Brown, Duckworth, Menendez, and Baldwin for cosponsoring this legislation. Their support for this bill is deeply appreciated.  Just days ago, in Las Vegas, NV, we experienced the worst mass shooting--in terms of the number of victims--in our Nation's history.  There are now at least 58 dead and nearly 500 wounded as a result of that attack. The grief and pain of so many victims and their loved ones is overwhelming and all too familiar to gun violence victims and survivors all across  What makes this mass shooting particularly devastating is that the shooting was done by a single gunman. Within minutes, the gunman exacted devastating firepower on hundreds of people, terrorizing concertgoers and an entire community.  How was this possible?  While facts are still being uncovered, we know that this particular gunman had amassed a vast arsenal. He had at least 23 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his hotel room among which were 12 semiautomatic rifles enhanced with ``bump-stock'' devices.  These bump-stock devices are typically used to turn semiautomatic rifles into functional machine guns, capable of shooting hundreds of bullets per minute.  A semiautomatic rifle's rate of fire is usually 45 to 60 rounds per minute. With a bump-stock device attached, these semiautomatic weapons can fire up to 700 rounds per minute. Bump-stock devices are readily accessible. They can be purchased online or at a store by anyone for merely $100.  Anyone who has seen YouTube video clips of semiautomatic rifles outfitted with these devices knows just how devastating they are.  The number of bullets that can be sprayed into a crowd within minutes is staggering.  Because they are so dangerous, automatic machine-gun-like weapons have been categorically banned in America since 1986 under the National Firearms  This law was a direct response to the Prohibition Era's mobster crimes during which machine guns were used to kill their victims at a deadly rate.  One seminal event during this period was the Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929.  That tragic day was marked by the murder of seven men in a garage on the North Side of The massacre was the culmination of a feud between an Irish American gang and another gang led by Al Organized crime was rampant during that era, and fully automatic weapons were the weapons of choice for gangsters. Indeed, the men who committed the Valentine's Day Massacre used Thompson submachine guns, known as ``Tommy guns,'' to mow down their victims.  The Valentine's Day Massacre, which remains in infamy, clearly demonstrated that elected leaders must do something about this violence and get these fully automatic guns out of the hands of killers.  As a result, the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934. When originally passed, it heavily regulated machine guns, imposing a tax on the making and transferring of machine guns and other lethal weapons. It also imposed a special occupational tax on those engaged in the business of importing, manufacturing, and dealing in firearms regulated under the National Firearms  It also required the registration of all machine guns and other guns regulated under the National Firearms Act with the Treasury  Later, in 1986, the National Firearms Act was amended to ban all future automatic weapons from private possession, except for those legally owned and registered as of May 19, 1986.  Therefore, today, automatic weapons are generally banned for civilian use--and rightfully so. They are absolutely lethal weapons of war and have no business being in our homes, our schools, our businesses, and our streets.  Notwithstanding this outright ban, there is a loophole in the law that allows bump-stock devices to configure legal semiautomatic weapons so that they can function like a fully automatic weapon. This loophole must be closed.  If automatic weapons are banned, these devices should be banned. There is no functional difference between automatic weapons and a bump-stock enhanced semiautomatic weapon. Such devices are simply not needed to hunt[[Page S6352]]or to use in a private home for self-defense.  Like we saw in Las Vegas, these bump-stock devices allow those with a motive to kill to use fully legal firearms to wreak havoc and kill large numbers of people within minutes.  The bill I have introduced is straightforward. It closes the loophole that allows civilians to purchase and use devices that convert semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. Specifically, it bans the sale, transfer, importation, manufacturing, or possession of bump fire devices, trigger cranks, or anything that accelerates a semiautomatic rifle's rate of fire.  The bill further provides an exception to this ban, by allowing for the lawful possession of these devices by law enforcement and the government.  Those who violate the ban would be subject to the same penalty available to those who illegally possess a machine gun under current law.  Closing this loophole should not be a partisan issue. Anyone who has seen footage from the shooting in Las Vegas should recognize that weapons that are altered to emulate automatic gunfire should not be permitted in our communities.  In my view, this bill is a modest proposal. It was one that was included in the Assault Weapons Ban legislation that I proposed 4 years ago, which we failed to pass in 2013.  Tragically, had that legislation been enacted in 2013, it could have perhaps saved lives in Las  Indeed, when the police dispatcher was first contacted in Las Vegas at 10:09 PM local time, it took 11 minutes until the last shots were fired and the suspect was neutralized.  Think of that for a moment. If automatic gunfire had been impossible for the gunman, less shots would have sprayed through Las Vegas that night, and less people may have died. That is extraordinarily sobering.  I recall standing here on this floor nearly 4 years ago, urging my colleagues to adopt the assault weapons ban, pleading that it could possibly save lives.  That was on the heels of one of the darkest days in American history, when 20 beautiful children and 6 educators had their lives taken at Sandy Hook Elementary It is an absolute travesty that Congress refused to act back then.  It is my strongest belief that when our Nation is faced with dire situations--like sickness, or job stagnation, or human trafficking--it is our job, our solemn oath as lawmakers, to try to solve these problems.

There are more than 50 dead and more than 500 wounded.  It should shock every American that one individual, with easy access to weapons and ammunition, can inflict such devastation.  Sadly, it was only a little more than a year ago that we also experienced what had then been the worst mass shooting in our Nation's history. That was when 49 people who were enjoying an evening of dancing with friends and loved ones were massacred in  Just 6 months before that, 14 people were killed and more than 20 injured in San  Two years ago, on October 1, 2015, an assistant professor and eight students were murdered at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg,  In 2013, 12 people were fatally shot at the Navy Yard, less than 2 miles from where I stand today.  On December 14, 2012, 20 children had their lives taken at Sandy Hook Elementary  These massacres have not and will not stop unless we do something. I believe we must acknowledge that these shootings are possible because of our Nation's weak gun laws.[[Page S6258]]  Our laws permit criminal and domestic abusers to easily obtain weapons at gunshows and on the internet without a basic background check.  We know background checks work. States that require background checks on private handgun sales see fewer women killed by their partners and fewer law enforcement officers killed with handguns.  It is time we expand background checks to cover sales at gunshows and on the  We are still learning about what happened in Las Vegas, but we do know that the shooter had more than 10 rifles in his hotel room and that he may have used an assault weapon.  Today in the United States, military-style assault weapons may be sold legally to civilians. Assault weapons are not needed for either hunting or self-defense.  They are weapons of war designed to kill large numbers of people in close quarters.  This is not sustainable--and the public agrees. Just last year, a poll showed that 57 percent of Americans favor a ban on assault weapons.  In fact, from 1994 and 2004, we had laws that prohibited anyone from getting an assault weapon. I believed then and I believe now that those laws made all of us safer.  Unfortunately, right when the positive effects of those laws were taking effect, they were allowed to expire. Now, time and again, we have felt the costs of our inaction.  It is time that we finally take steps to ensure that other communities do not experience the pain that Sandy Hook, Washington, San Bernardino, Roseburg, Orlando, and now Las Vegas have gone through.  I hope my colleagues will join me in remembering the victims of this attack and will support legislation to prevent any of us from once again having to rise to remember what will be another worst mass shooting in our Nation's history.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-02-pt1-PgS6257.txt,1332,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,2,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
797,topic-id,300,"Mr.President, today the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish for ``decisive contributions'' to the observation of gravitational waves. This landmark discovery marks a giant leap forward in human knowledge, and I salute these Americans on their honor.  Over 100 years ago, Albert Einstein predicted that massive objects and energy could distort space-time. In order to detect these ``ripples'' in the fabric of space and time, known as gravitational waves, scientists worked over many years to develop the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, or  On September 14, 2015, scientists working at LIGO detected a ``chirp''--a ripple in space-time. What was observed because of LIGO was the result of two massive black holes merging together over 1.3 billion light years away. This breakthrough discovery means that we now have an entirely new way of observing the universe.  This achievement would not have been possible without the leadership of Weiss, Thorne, and Barish, along with the countless scientists who helped with the project, including the National Science  Two of the distinguished recipients hail from my home Thorne and Barish are professors at the California Institute of Technology, and I am proud of the role that Cal Tech played in making this discovery possible. I also recognize Weiss, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, for his achievement.  On behalf of all Californians, I commend these physicists on a well-deserved honor and for all that they have done to push our knowledge of the universe forward. Let us hope that this discovery will continue to expand the horizon of human knowledge and lead to new efforts in humanity's never-ending quest for enlightenment.  Again, I congratulate these three distinguished Americans and their families on this remarkable discovery and prestigious award.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgS6285-2.txt,1332,"TRIBUTE TO RAINER WEISS, KIP S.

457,topic-id,393,"Mr.Chairman, I would first like to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for her leadership during this budget process. She has done an amazing job of showing wisdom and patience and negotiating this all through this process. My sincere thanks are given to the gentlewoman.  This budget is a critical step in getting our economy growing and our national debt under control. Not only does it balance in 10 years and put our country on the path to fiscal stability, it also lays the groundwork for tax reform.  With this budget, we are demonstrating that it is possible to have fiscal discipline and keep our promises to the American people. We can no longer continue to kick the can down the road on our mandatory spending crisis. We are leaving behind more and more debt for our children and grandchildren, and it is morally wrong.  We must put politics aside and have tough conversations to ensure that we can keep the promises that we have made to Americans and to future generations.  This budget does not solve our mandatory spending crisis overnight, but it begins that process by achieving a $203 billion savings in mandatory spending.  By passing this budget, we will also kick-start tax reform. I have said time and time again that America should be the best place in the world to do business, yet we have a Tax Code that tells our businesses that they should take their jobs and their profits overseas.  Every American benefits from lower taxes and growing the economy. The tax reform framework we released last week will do just that. Americans will get to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, companies will have the freedom to reinvest in their businesses and workers, and more people can move to the American Dream.[[Page H7789]]  Before we can make these changes, we must pass the budget. The reconciliation instructions in the budget will set us on a path to comprehensive tax reform in both the House and the  This is not just a conversation about dollars and cents.

547,topic-id,664,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I want to start by saying that I appreciate the opportunity to have this discussion today because it is an important one. I know that the gentleman from Virginia and I both want to address the challenges facing our Nation and our fellow  We agree that the status quo is insufficient to meet the needs of the future, and we share a passion for protecting the vulnerable, breaking the cycles of poverty, and lifting Americans up.  But I must oppose this budget because it will not accomplish those things. This budget raises taxes by $4 trillion, increases spending by $1.4 trillion, and it never balances.  It proposes more Washington-mandated answers to problems that States and communities are better equipped to solve. It makes no effort to control Federal deficits and debt, and it will leave our country bankrupt.  I want to be clear what this means. This budget will double down on generational theft--spending more and more money that we don't have today and leaving our children and grandchildren to foot the bill tomorrow.  In contrast, the Republican budget confronts our Nation's fiscal challenges head on by requiring mandatory spending reductions of at least $203 billion and balancing within 10 years.  While this budget measures success on how much the Federal Government spends, the Republican House budget proposes to measure success by outcomes. If we have learned nothing from decades of spending on Federal welfare programs, it is that more money cannot resolve the complex issues underlying systemic poverty.  We must change our approach, and this starts with changing how we measure results.  This budget also fails to address a critical piece of the upward mobility agenda: reforming our broken Tax Instead, it calls for tax increases that would stifle economic growth that the country so desperately needs.  America should be the most competitive place in the world to do business, but everything in our Tax Code today tells companies to take their jobs and their investments overseas and to leave them there.  Higher taxes on job creators and small businesses is the exact opposite of what we need to bring workers back into the labor force and get our economy growing again. Now is the time for comprehensive tax reform that unleashes the entrepreneurial spirit of America, increases business and personal investment, and promotes job creation. By failing to move the ball forward on tax reform, this budget leaves the American workers and families behind.  Lastly, Mr.Chairman, I want to note what this proposal does make cuts in, and that is in our national defense. In a time when we face increasingly complex and evolving international threats from places like North Korea, Russia, and Iran, this budget would cut overall[[Page H7830]]defense spending and compromise the readiness and safety of our servicemembers and our national freedoms.  The first job of the Federal Government is to provide for our national security. We need to reinvest in our military to deter global threats and protect our homeland. That is why the Republican budget fulfills Congress' commitment to ensure robust funding for our country's national defense.  Mr.Chairman, we will have a lot of conversations today about priorities, because that is what budgets are: clear illustrations of our priorities.  We want to leave our Nation better for our children and grandchildren. We all want every person, regardless of their socioeconomic status or ZIP Code, to have the opportunity to realize the American  I oppose this budget proposal because it will not help us achieve these goals. It avoids the tough questions and substitutes more spending for better results.  It does nothing to promote vibrant economic growth, and it doubles down on bad ideas that stifle ingenuity and the spirit of entrepreneurism that we need. We have a responsibility to secure our Nation's fiscal future and improve the lives of our citizens, but this budget is not the way forward.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

555,topic-id,466,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I certainly understand our colleagues' desire to fight poverty. I would like to share a little bit of my experience and what we have done to fight poverty at the local level.  For generations now, we have continued to throw more and more money towards eliminating poverty, with fewer and fewer results.  Yes, we have succeeded in alleviating the effects of poverty, but we have made very little progress in actually lifting people out of poverty. Instead of giving people a hand up, we are giving them a handout and essentially telling them life can't get any better than where they are. That is morally wrong, and I think that we can do better.  The key to solving poverty isn't just simply throwing more money at the problem. It is to try something different and find innovative ways to fix our welfare entitlement system, improve our education system, and return the dignity of work to our fellow citizens.  The proposed amendment does none of these things. It simply perpetuates the cycle of generational poverty that has been passed down from parent to child.  I saw the same situation in my hometown of West Point, In fact, it is what motivated me to enter public service and run for mayor.  We had a community that was dying. Folks were trapped in generational poverty and had been stripped of the dignity of work.  Instead of continuing the current system, we made changes. We worked to get the government out of the way and allow the job creators to innovate and grow their businesses to hire more workers. We invested in our infrastructure and we were able to create over 15,000 advanced manufacturing jobs.  For the first time in a generation, we saw more people moving into the middle class than moving into poverty.  We made changes to our education system, working to break through the generational cycle of poverty and prepare today's students to work in a 21st century workforce.  With all of these changes, we saw our community come back to life. People had jobs and opportunity. They took advantage of it. They had the advanced manufacturing sector spring back to life, and we saw a revitalization of not only our community, but of our people.  These lessons are from the folks in the Third They sent me here to push those same type of ideas here in  The Republican budget puts us on a path to this type of reform, and I believe my colleagues and I share the desire to fight poverty in this country.

918,topic-id,1123,"Madam President, I rise today to recognize two Nebraskans who are retiring after long careers of service to the American people: the Honorable Lyle Strom and the Honorable William Both of these judges have spent years upholding the rule of law, and their professionalism has established a strong reputation for their respective courts. They are true role models for current and aspiring lawyers and judges, and their exceptional work should be acknowledged.  Lyle Elmer Strom was born on January 6, 1925, in Omaha, His mother was a schoolteacher. His father worked as an oil trader. Judge Strom has said that he didn't much care for school while he was growing up. Instead, he found himself causing more trouble than good, especially when he played football on top of the nearby grain silo with some friends.  In 1943, after being rejected by the Navy because of weak eyesight, Strom enlisted in the Merchant Marines as a radio signal operator. During his time in the Naval Reserve, he was inspired to become a lawyer after being impressed by his fellow Merchant Marines who had obtained college and professional degrees.  After serving his country in the military, Strom graduated from Creighton University with a B.in 1950. That same year, he married the love of his life, his wife Together, they had seven children. In 1953, Strom graduated from Creighton University's School of Law, finishing at the top of his class. He soon joined the prestigious firm of Fitzgerald, Schorr, Barmettler, &  Strom started his career believing he would be a business type of lawyer. Shortly after joining the firm, however, Bob Hamer brought Strom into his litigation group because he was smart and a hard-working professional. By 1958, Strom led the litigation practice for the firm.  Over his years of private practice, Lyle Strom became a well-known, well-liked litigator in Nebraska, especially in In 1985, after 32 years of law practice and with encouragement from Congressman Hal Daub, President Ronald Reagan appointed Strom to the U.District Court for the District of He served as chief judge of the court from 1987 until 1994 and in 1995 took senior status, allowing him the ability to continue sitting as a judge on cases over the past 22 years.  Judge Strom has always been dedicated to the craft of practicing law. He served as the president of the Omaha Bar Association from 1980 to 1981 and as president of the Nebraska State Bar Association from 1989 to 1990.  One of his biggest joys has come in the form of mentoring aspiring lawyers and young people--something he has done throughout his career. In his first decade as a lawyer, he worked as a professor at Creighton In his fifth, after becoming a Federal judge with a full caseload, Judge Strom served as the Creighton Law School internship program director and clinical professor of law.  Strom has also dedicated decades of service to the Boy Scouts of America and was the founder of the Inns of Court organization in Nebraska and has been closely involved with the Nebraska Mock Trial  During his 64 years of practice, Judge Strom has been a model for dedication to the rule of law. His hard work and mentoring to both aspiring lawyers and young people across Omaha have made him a staple in our communities.  He has also had an eye for talent. In 1973, while still working as a litigation lawyer, Strom hired a new lawyer to the firm--William This began a great professional relationship between two of the top lawyers in  Born in Lincoln in 1947, Bill Riley obtained both his B.and his juris doctorate from the University of Nebraska, graduating from the law school in 1972. While in school, Riley served as the editor and chief of the Nebraska Law Review, and he graduated at the top of his class.  From 1972 to 1973, Riley clerked for the Honorable Donald Lay with the U.Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, a court he would later serve on 30 years later.[[Page S6247]]  It was Judge Lay who told Riley that the best tutelage he could receive as a trial attorney would be at the firm of Fitzgerald, Schorr, Barmettler, & Brennan, the firm where a legendary attorney, Lyle Strom, had led the Litigation Department since 1958. It was great advice. After Strom became a judge, it was Riley who took his place as chair of the firm's litigation department.  In 2001, Riley's professionalism caught the eye of both Nebraska Senators and the President of the United States, George The new President nominated him to the U.Court of Appeals for the Eighth Riley was confirmed unanimously in September of 2001, becoming one of President Bush's first circuit court appointments. He became chief judge for the Eighth Circuit in 2010.  During his tenure, Riley was intimately involved in the governance and policy-setting for the entire U.Federal court system. He served on the Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, an organization presided over by the Chief Justice of the Supreme  Riley also served as strategic planning coordinator for the Judicial Conference, helping enact greater cyber security measures throughout the Federal court system.  Judge Riley has served our country well over the last 16 years, and on June 30, 2017, after 45 years of practicing law, Judge Riley took senior status on the Eighth He said that now he is going to have time to relax with his wife Norma, their three children, and their nine grandchildren.  Riley has served his local legal community by teaching trial practice at both Creighton University School of Law and the University of Nebraska College of He is a decorated Boy Scout leader and served as a founding member of the Robert Spire American Inn of Court legal mentoring program.  Before his appointment to the court, Riley served as president of the Omaha Bar Association from 2000 to 2001.  Both of these judges deserve our respect for how they approach the justice system and the law. Both are role models that I hope future lawyers and judges follow.

125,topic-id,743,"Mr.President, last week I filed an amicus brief calling on the U.Supreme Court to hear and then overturn the ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Sanchez-I am proud to have been supported in this effort by all 15 sheriffs in my home State of Arizona, as well as the Western States Sheriffs Association and the National Sheriffs'  I should mention that this is not a partisan issue we are talking about. We have sheriffs representing both parties in Every sheriff in Arizona has supported this amicus--all 15.  This decision by the Ninth Circuit is just another example of a ruling that is well outside of the judicial mainstream. Unfortunately, in this case, their ruling dramatically undercuts effective border enforcement, and it creates a dangerous situation for law enforcement and the public. In this case, the Ninth Circuit ruled that it violates the rights of prisoners for marshals and other sheriffs or other courtroom personnel to employ commonplace, thoughtfully crafted courtroom safety policies in which prisoners appear before a judge, fitted with appropriate restraints. This is a significant change from common practice, and it conflicts with two other courts of appeals.  More troubling, the decision has prompted public safety concerns for Arizona and throughout the First, law enforcement will have no choice but to increase the number of officers needed to maintain the safety of individuals inside courtrooms. This means that more U.marshals and sheriffs will be spending their days in courthouses instead of pursuing violent fugitives or preventing street crime. Even with these increased numbers, law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the high threshold they are now forced to attain in order to get permission to fit dangerous prisoners with restraints.  By putting these restraints on law enforcement rather than prisoners, this ruling limits the ability of sheriffs and U.marshals to ensure the safety of the judges, jurors, lawyers, prisoners, victims, and members of the public inside these courthouses around the country.  This decision also dramatically undercuts the ability of the Federal courts to process illegal immigration border crossing cases as part of Operation Streamline, the very successful border enforcement program that has worked so well in some parts of By establishing a zero tolerance approach to illegal border crossings, Operation Streamline has made a dramatic difference in the number of illegal border crossings in communities like Tucson and  This year, the Operation Streamline Program averaged around 45 individuals per hearing. Even with these high caseloads, the program could remain efficient, thanks in part to traditional courtroom safety procedures. They could take 40 prisoners at a time and process them if they were allowed to use the current courtroom practices. These old policies allow law enforcement to bring up to 75 individuals into the courtroom at once, but under the Ninth Circuit's decision to relax courtroom safety protocols, law enforcement officers are now forced to limit groups of prisoners before the court to no more than a handful at a time. This makes it increasingly impractical for judges to hear cases due to the amount of time required for law enforcement to move small numbers of prisoners in and out of the courtroom. There simply aren't the hours in a day.  I take the independence of the courts very seriously. That is why, when every sheriff in my State comes to me and says that there is a court ruling that is endangering their deputies and the public, I am going to urge that the decision be overturned by the proper authority.  This makes a difference in Arizona for another reason as well. We have a lot of older courthouses. Some of them are historic courthouses. These buildings simply aren't built for today's needs in terms of access for prisoners and the public within these courthouses. Sometimes they have to go in the same doorways and in the same hallways. If law enforcement and courtroom security personnel are not allowed to have standards in terms of prisoner restraint, then you endanger[[Page S6282]]the safety of individuals visiting the courthouse and others. You are simply unable to process the number of cases that we have in Arizona, particularly near the border with regard to immigration cases.  I hope that the High Court, the Supreme Court, will grant cert here and examine this ruling. It really makes a difference in a State like  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.

331,topic-id,923,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss how we allow religious believers to participate in public life.  From the founding of our country, religious believers have played a central role in our government. The Declaration of Independence was signed by a Presbyterian minister, John Witherspoon, and Charles Carroll, the cousin of our first Catholic bishop.  The importance of religious participation was in the air the Founders breathed, and the benefits religious believers of all backgrounds contributed to the common good was understood by the Framers of the That is why they made it clear in article VI of the Constitution that no public officers could be subject to a ``religious test.'' This new country wouldn't be a country for Anglicans or for Congregationalists or for Quakers; it would be a country for all Americans and all faiths--all of those who are committed to the Constitution and the common good.  Unfortunately, the religious test clause is no longer just the subject of history lessons. During this Congress, there have been a number of cases where my friends in the minority have seemed to ask nominees about their substantive religious beliefs. I find this particularly troublesome because, as a Mormon, I am a member of a faith that, while it is growing rapidly, still counts fewer adherents than many other religions. It is religious liberty, espoused in constitutional provisions like article VI and the First Amendment, that has allowed my faith, despite a very difficult history, to flourish in the United States, and it is religious liberty that is threatened when we seem to evaluate the fitness of nominees for higher office on religious orthodoxy.  The most recent example of this was the recent Judiciary Committee nomination hearing of Professor Amy Coney Barrett of the Notre Dame Law During the hearing, she was asked repeatedly about her Catholic faith and faced what bordered on ridicule when she repeatedly stated that she would perform her judicial duties without interference from the doctrines of the Catholic faith. It was stated by one questioner: ``The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern.'' What does that statement mean in this context, if not to question Professor Barrett's judicial fitness based on her religious beliefs?  Liberal groups have been relentless in their opposition to Professor Barrett, mischaracterizing her record to paint her as some kind of fringe ideologue waiting to take orders from the Pope or others in clergy on how to decide cases. Just last week, the New York Times ran a 1500-word story on where Professor Barrett worships. As it turns out, apart from her parish church, Professor Barrett has been part of an ecumenical charismatic community.  I should note that charismatic Christianity is gaining a lot of ground among Latinos in the United States and throughout Latin It is a vibrant and very diverse religious tradition.  According to the Times, Professor Barrett should have disclosed her participation in this charismatic community to the Senate Judiciary  Professor Barrett's former professor and colleague, Professor Cathy Kaveny of Boston College, went so far as to ask: ``[Nominees] have to disclose everything from the Elks Lodge to the alumni associations we belong to. Why didn't she disclose this?'' Well, I am no law professor, but I can tell you why: because in the United States of America, it doesn't matter where you worship when you are being considered for Federal office, and that is as it should be.  The Judiciary Committee does not require disclosure of religious affiliation, and I trust my colleagues would join me in strenuously objecting if it did.  It is ironic that a Notre Dame professor is a target of this kind of animus. Notre Dame, of course, has long been at the forefront of fighting prejudice in this country.  Early in its years, Notre Dame helped rid America of the scourge of slavery. Many artists have rendered Notre Dame professor, Father William Corby, giving the Irish Brigade general absolution during the Battle of  The school then faced down the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. At a time when a large number of White men in Indiana were members of the Klan, Notre Dame students made it clear that the Klan's brand of nativist, anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic hate was not welcomed in South  Four decades later, Notre Dame's president, Father Ted Hesburgh, received a call about a rally at Soldier Field being organized by Martin Luther Hesburgh was told that Mayor Daley and Cardinal Cody had declined invitations to appear at the civil rights rally, and the organizers wondered if he would be willing to appear. In response, Hesburgh drove to Chicago, locked hands with King, and sang ``We Shall Overcome.''  Whether it is slavery, nativism, or Jim Crow, Notre Dame has stood up to it and has triumphed. In that same tradition, I am confident that Professor Barrett is up to that task. What is remarkable is that I need to say this in 2017.  It bears repeating that a Roman Catholic can be a faithful steward of the law. So can an So can a So can a Of course, so can an atheist.  We in the Senate give the President advice and consent on judicial nominations. We therefore should examine their jurisprudential views and their qualifications. We must not examine their relationships with the  I sincerely hope this body will step back from this dangerous ledge and evaluate Professor Barrett based on her impeccable qualifications, not where she attends church.

1101,topic-id,570,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the Border Security and Deferred Action Recipient Relief Act, which I am introducing.  This bill offers solutions to the serious problems facing us with regard to border security, while at the same time addressing the needs for a legislative solution for those issues faced by the children who were brought here through no fault of their own.  With respect to the border, this bill provides $1.6 billion in funding for border security measures that the President requested and the House has already approved in a bipartisan vote. As an Arizonan, I am more than familiar with the steps we need to take to increase border security. We have a better situation on the border than we have had in a while, but there are still measures that need to be taken.  In addition to the appropriate barriers that will aid in preventing illegal crossings, we need access roads that actually get to the border. If there is one issue I hear from property owners, ranchers, Border Patrol agents, and others near the border, it is that they need better access. We have had an issue with regard to roads that are used by the Border Control that are paid for by the county. It is a situation that needs to be resolved, and it will benefit all of us who travel near the border. This bill addresses that. The road issue was also raised by the I requested a study on behalf of my constituents,[[Page S6363]]along with my colleagues, to see what we could do with the roads and access situation. GAO came back with recommendations, and this would implement some of the recommendations.  The bill also aids law enforcement by ensuring the swift deportation of individuals determined to be members of violent gangs and drug cartels.  I would also like to thank Congresswoman Barbara Comstock for her leadership on this issue by sponsoring the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, which passed the  With respect to the children brought here through no fault of their own, this bill takes a measure that has already earned bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, the Recognizing America's Children Act, which provides a solution for the DACA kids. These young immigrants were brought here as children and simply know no other country. For all intents and purposes, these young people consider themselves If we can protect these DACA recipients and provide solutions to better secure our borders at the same time, that is a win-win.  The President and Congress both want to improve border security. We both want to respond to the threat of dangerous gangs and drug cartels. We both want to arrive at a legislative solution for the rescission of the DACA Program that benefits those who want to contribute to their communities and to the American dream. This bill is the best way to thread the needle and deliver what the President has asked for, what the Congress wants, and what my constituents in Arizona deserve. These issues are far too important for us to delay.

936,topic-id,516,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to share some information about the Unified Tax Reform Framework that was released last week by Republicans in the House of Representatives.[[Page H7682]]  I think it is important that, with all of the sad news coming out this week in the country, particularly in Puerto Rico and Las Vegas, we do share with the American people some information that will be so important to them long term and will help our economy get a good jump start.  Incidentally, last quarter, our economy grew at 3.1 percent, but very few people have heard about that, and it is important that we point that out.  Mr.Speaker, the material provided by the Ways and Means Committee is extraordinarily valuable, and I also would encourage people to go on the Ways and Means' website and on my website and on individual websites of Members to gain more information about this framework.  First, it lowers the rates for individuals and families. The framework shrinks the current seven tax brackets into three: 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. And actually, Mr.Speaker, many more Americans will pay no taxes as a result of the tax reform, because we are going to double the standard deduction and enhance the child tax credit.                              {time}  1100  The framework roughly doubles the standard deduction so that typical middle class families will keep more of their paycheck. It also significantly increases the child tax credit. It eliminates loopholes for the wealthy and protects bedrock provisions for the middle class. It repeals the death tax and alternative minimum tax.  Mr.Speaker, dying should not be a taxable event. It is important that we not tax people, particularly farmers and small businesses, at the death of a businessowner or farmowner.  It creates a new lower tax rate structure for small businesses. It will help to create jobs and promote competitiveness by lowering the corporate tax rate. So that Americans can compete on a level playing field, the framework reduces the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, below the 22.5 percent average of the industrialized world.  It will boost the economy by allowing for expensing of capital investments. The framework allows, for at least 5 years, businesses to immediately write off or expense the cost of new investments, giving a much-needed lift to the economy.  It moves to an American model for competitiveness. The framework ends the perverse incentives to offshore jobs and keep foreign profits overseas. It levels the playing field for American companies and workers by allowing the profits achieved overseas to come back by imposing a one-time low tax rate on wealth that is already accumulated overseas so there is no tax incentive to keep the money offshore.  Mr.Speaker, we need to get our economy booming again to create jobs and to make our country much greater than it is today. I endorse this framework put out by the Ways and Means Committee and look forward to the work that is going to be done by the committee as it refines the framework and brings forth a bill for us to vote on.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7681-3.txt,1791,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to this substitute amendment.  As chair of the Education and the Workforce Committee, my priority this Congress is to ensure that our policies promote a climate of job creation through economic growth, a sound fiscal policy, and a global economic competitiveness.  Our budget helps achieve all of these priorities by laying the foundation for a robust and comprehensive simplification of our burdensome Tax The Democrat substitute not only fails to do so but would decimate America's workforce.

The top U.tax rate for individuals has been as high as 90 percent and as low as 28 percent. At the same time, income tax revenue has remained fairly steady, despite these sharp rate swings. It turns out that the biggest driver of Federal revenue is not higher tax rates but economic growth.  In fact, a sizeable majority of economists point out that a broad base and low rates are key in a tax system that fosters economic growth and competitiveness. Legislators on both sides of the aisle agree on this basic principle, and history has shown it to be true.  Instead of raising taxes, we should, instead, embrace the policies contained in this budget resolution that encourages economic growth, like reducing regulatory burdens, welfare reform, and comprehensive tax reform for all individuals, not just a select few.

Born in 1917, she was the daughter of sharecroppers and the youngest of 20 siblings. By the age of six, she was helping her family in the cotton fields.  Fannie Lou Hamer was a woman of courage. She used her voice to raise awareness about the plight of African Americans in the Mississippi She was a woman of strength who was able to channel the injustices committed against her into activism.  Working for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Hamer helped African Americans register to vote and worked to end segregation.  After attempting to register to vote herself in August 1962, Hamer lost her job and was kicked out of her home. The following year, she and fellow activists returning from a training workshop were unjustly jailed and severely beaten. While the beating left permanent damage, the officers were later acquitted by an all-white jury.  Hamer was also a trailblazing political activist. She helped to found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the National Women's Political She almost derailed the re-election of President Lyndon Johnson and changed the Democratic Party's delegate selection process. In 1968, she would become the first African American to serve as an official delegate at a national-party convention since Reconstruction and the first woman ever from  Although unsuccessful in her bids for elected office, Hamer remained committed to voting rights and antipoverty efforts. She filed a lawsuit to push forward desegregation efforts in local schools, led the cotton pickers resistance movement and helped to bring a Head Start program to her community.  Fannie Lou Hamer's contributions to the American Civil Rights movement and our nation are undeniable. As then UN Ambassador Andrew Young eulogized at her funeral, ``None of us would be where we are now had she not been there then.''

As our brothers and sisters on the island suffered, our President sank putts and hit drives.  As the gross inadequacy of his administration's response was revealed to a worldwide audience, the leader of the free world patted himself on the back. ``We have done a great job with an almost impossible situation,'' Trump tweeted.  Mr.Speaker, Donald Trump has it backwards. He is not doing a great job despite an impossible situation; the Puerto Rican people are.  Yesterday, on a belated visit to the island, Trump could have apologized.

Instead, he offered only blame and condescension. ``I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico,'' he says, ``but you are throwing our budget out of whack,'' said  I am sorry, Mr.Speaker, but our President is dead wrong. He is the one who is throwing our budget out of whack with his tax cuts for the rich.

He is the one who is throwing our country out of whack with attacks on immigrants and people of color and the disabled and veterans and Gold Star parents, and on and on, and now, most recently, on the courageous leaders of Puerto Rico and the people of Puerto Such poor leadership, he says, of the ability of the mayor of San Juan and others in Puerto  Mr.Speaker, I am not sure Donald Trump understands the meaning of the word ``leadership,'' especially in the wake of a natural disaster. Real leadership is about having the courage to do what is right and the compassion to do what is necessary to help others. It is about self-sacrifice, not self-promotion. It is about putting our country first and your own ego second.  Instead, yesterday we were treated to the bizarre spectacle of the President of the United States throwing rolls of paper towels into a crowd.  Despite the millions in Puerto Rico wanting for electricity or basic necessities, he called his administration's response ``unbelievable'' and ``incredible.''  Donald Trump even had the gall to congratulate Puerto Rico on not losing hundreds of lives like in a real catastrophe like Hurricane Frankly, it is hard to recall a more callous statement from an American leader in my lifetime.  Mr.Speaker, the outrageously poor response to the devastation in Puerto Rico is the best illustration yet that President Trump only cares about people who look like him or vote for him or make the kind of money that he makes.

157,topic-id,1730,"Mr.Speaker, earlier this week, the Chamber took up H.36, a bill dealing with pain-capable unborn children; and a bill that, in its result, would cause the United States to join the vast bulk of nations in the world wherein the termination of lives of children who are not only capable of feeling pain, but under what we understand to be the best science may, in fact, feel more pain because of the density of the nerve tissue, as they are in this roughly fifth month of development.  I guess four times in the brief time that I have been in this building, we have seen the Chamber erupt into applause, oftentimes over partisan-perceived victories.  The first time the Chamber erupted into applause is when my colleagues across the aisle were giddy with joy when a bill that would have ensured that the Department of Defense didn't spend money to perform transgender procedures on soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines failed in the form of an amendment. Another had to do with healthcare. Another had to do with the return of Majority Whip Steve That was indeed a bipartisan eruption in applause.  Then there was an eruption from this side of the Chamber when H.36 passed, as there was a recognition that late-term abortion is barbaric and counter to the ideas put forth to the world when, in the Declaration of Independence, it was written that we hold certain truths to be self-evident, and among those was life.  Too many people have failed to grasp the nature of what late-term abortion is, yet to grapple with the problem will require to understand what exactly that problem is.  So to look at the other six nations in the world that allow the termination of life after 5 months, we see nations like Vietnam, North Korea, China, and the United  Then to listen to the doctors who have performed these procedures describe in what was literally excruciating detail how the procedure is performed, that an instrument is inserted into the uterus, and probing is done until something is found, and the instrument is latched on, and then there is pulling, and out comes an arm or a leg or a piece of a head or a torso. Then, in fact, that unborn child, who science tells us can feel pain, dies by virtue of bleeding to death inside its very host. That is the nature of these procedures.  Estimates tell us that if the United States joined the fast bulk of the nations on the planet in outlawing late-term abortions, somewhere between 14,000 and 20,000 children every year wouldn't experience an unspeakable demise of literally being ripped from their host limb by limb and bleeding to death, all whilst, in the best estimates of scientists, feeling the pain of that death.  To put that in terms of Virginia's Fifth District, that is the population of Cumberland County twice every year, roughly.  So there was applause from the Members who saw that the United States would join the ranks of the civilized nations in the world who put appropriate value on life, Mr.Speaker, and disappointment from some on the other side of the aisle, other than a few brave individuals to be distinguished by departing from the herd and recognizing the value and sanctity of life thereto, and immediate news stories about how H.36 was dead on arrival in the United States  Mr.Speaker, it is my sincere hope that the American people will not let that be the case.  I often speak of the history of the Fifth District of Virginia that gave us great Americans like Booker Washington and Barbara Johns, Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, James Madison, James Monroe, and Patrick  As I thought about how to best address the need for action in the other Chamber, Mr.Speaker, I determined that there were no better words than those delivered by Patrick Henry from Virginia, slightly amended, on March 23, 1775, in John's Cathedral as he addressed the second Virginia Assembly in Richmond,  So with all credit to the author, whom I paraphrase, I would read: Mr.Speaker, no man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism and abilities of the very worthy people who have served and do serve in this                              {time}  1215  But different people often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be a thought disrespectful to those Senators if entertaining, as I do, opinions of a character very opposite of many of theirs, I shall speak forth of my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony.  The question before the Senate is one of an awful consequence to this country. For my part, I consider it nothing less than a question of life or death, and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject, ought to be the freedom of debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to our creator and country.  Should I keep back my opinions at such times through a fear of giving offense or political loss? I should consider myself guilty of treason and of cowardice, an act of disloyalty towards the majesty of our creator, who I revere above all earthly kings.  Mr.Speaker, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against painful truth and listen to the song of the siren until she transforms us into beasts. Is this the role of wise people engaged in a great and arduous struggle for life? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience, of history. I have no way of judging the future but by the past.  In judging the past, I wish to know for what has been the conduct of the abortion industry for the last 44 years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen are pleased to solace themselves.  The Senate, is that insidious smile which our petition has been received lately? Trust it not, sir. It will prove a snare at your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with the promise[[Page H7885]]of later action. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with these nearly 60 million lives lost in this country alone, which cover our waters and darken our lands. Is taking an unborn life a work of love and reconciliation? Is subjecting to pain a 5-month-old child as no other nation save six on the Earth allowed to happen? Let us not deceive ourselves. These are the implements of death and destruction.  I ask what means this perpetual delay of voting? What is its purpose? What is the force of inaction? Can gentlemen assign another possible motive for it than to ensure that it never occurs?  Destruction? No, sir, destruction. They are set to send and perpetuate this loss of life, and have so long supported this loss of life, and now an opportunity presents itself to vote, and what do we have to oppose inaction? Mr.Speaker, we have our voices. Shall we try again and again? Shall we bring this bill back next year? We have been trying that for 40 years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject?  We have held this subject in every light of which it is capable. It has all been, to this date, in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and supplication? What terms shall we find that have not already been exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, Mr.Speaker, deceive ourselves.  We have done everything that we could do to avert this death that has claimed nearly 60 million lives and 14 to 20 million unborn lives after the age of 5 months in utero every single year. We have petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we have prostrated ourselves and have implored its inner position to arrest the tyrannical hands of the abortion industry and its champions in Washington, and our petitions have been slighted. Our remonstrations produce additional death and insult. Our supplications have been disregarded, and we have been spurned with contempt from the floor of the Chamber of the opposing body. In vain these things we may indulge the fond hope of life and justice.  If we support life, if we mean to preserve and violate this fundamental right for which we have been so long arguing, if we mean not basely to abandon this noble struggle which we have been so long engaged in, in which we have pledged ourselves to never abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, we must hope the American people demand the Senate hold a vote. We must hope the American people demand the Senate hold a vote.  An appeal to democracy and to the Lord of hosts is all that is left to us. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a promise of later action. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with the nearly 60 million lives ended.  We can be heard in numbers across the fruited plain. A vote should be held for or against life. Let us have it. Let us have it. In this vein, sir, to extenuate the matter, gentlemen may cry: Later; later; next year. But there is no later. The killing has continued for over 40 years. The next gale that sweeps to the North will bring to our ears cries of the yet born. The House has voted. Why is the Senate idle? What is it that they wish? What would they have? Is political victory so dear or a title so sweet as to be purchased at the price of human life? Forbid it, Almighty  Mr.Speaker, I know not what course others may take, but as for me, my hope is that there is a vote. My hope is that we stand for life.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-05-pt1-PgH7884-2.txt,1737,PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT,2017,5,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

893,topic-id,2262,"Much has been said recently about the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and specifically how in this land of the free we have the prerogative to do as we choose in matters that manifest themselves, as communication that we can speak freely even when that speech is objectionable to some.  And many people who have been fortunate enough to be amongst the 1 in 1,300 high school football seniors to take the field on a Sunday at an NFL stadium have availed themselves of this right that was given to them by people greater than themselves, perhaps who shed their very lifeblood that they might make a decision not to stand for the anthem that embodies the gratitude for that sacrifice.  Brian Tracy once said: ``Develop an attitude of gratitude and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step towards achieving something bigger and better. . . .''  More recently, an individual said: ``If you were successful somebody along[[Page H7667]]the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive.''  Later in that speech, President Obama said, ``So if you have a business, you didn't build that,'' someone did it for you. And he was roundly excoriated, but at some level he acknowledged the sacrifice of so many that compels me to stand here today to ask that when the national anthem of the United States of America is played, that you demonstrate some semblance of gratitude for the sacrifice that has been given by untold millions before you that allows you the prerogative not to stand.  And so should you choose not to stand, I support that right. I believe that right is fundamental to what makes us Americans, but I implore you to learn the history of our Nation that allows you the right not to stand, for, to be certain, there are places in the world, North Korea, where choosing not to stand when the anthem is played might lead to a horrible demise.  Gilbert Chesterton once said: ``One sees great things from the valley; only small things from the peak.'' And the French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville said: ``The greatness of America lies not in her being more enlightened than any other Nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.''  And so when a slaveowner named Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he talked about how all people were created equal, despite his inherent flaw or flaws, and when the preamble to the Constitution was hammered out, the Founders suggested that we should strive not to be a perfect union but a more perfect union by acknowledging that, in fact, where there are humans in charge, we will never achieve perfection.  Tonight, I ask your indulgence, if you tuned in at home completely by accident, for a moment to learn about how lucky we are, regardless of the circumstance of our birth, compared to our peers across the globe, to have the opportunity to live in this, the greatest Nation in the history of mankind, and how standing for an anthem that honors an imperfect nation that continually strives for perfection is not only the right thing to do, it is the only thing to do if you understand the scope of the sacrifice of those who came before us.  Imperfect people like Thomas Jefferson gave us near perfect documents. And so tonight, as my vehicle to discuss why we should stand for our anthem, I will choose the district that I am honored to have the opportunity to serve, Virginia's Fifth I will say, in all humility, that while I am ordinary, the district is great; that the Fifth District of Virginia is, in my humble opinion, without hyperbole, the greatest congressional district in the country. And I will give you ten reasons why I hope the next time the anthem is played you will stand and think with reverence upon those who made sacrifices that gave us the opportunity to live in the greatest land humanity has ever seen.  In 1743, born in the Fifth District of Virginia was this very man, Thomas An imperfect man who had a thirst for knowledge and said, ``I cannot live without books,'' and continually sought to understand what might be perfected as it related to government amongst men, and in the Declaration created a document which was the first message that a fledging nation held out to the world to say: This is who we are.  And he said, in that document, that all people were created equal; a concept that this Nation did not arrive at in reality by virtue of slavery and things like the failure to grant women suffrage for some 150 years, nearly, later.  However, a charge to work towards a more perfect union, that was contained in the document, the Constitution, overseen by James Madison also of the Fifth District of  And so while we were imperfect, we were given the greatest and most noble of goals, and that is to strive to be more perfect.  So the vision of Jefferson outlined in the Declaration and expanded upon James Madison in the Constitution, and later articulated in this town, Washington, D.C., by King when he said that we should judge individuals based not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character, it was borne in the hearts and minds of imperfect people from the Fifth District of Virginia who gave us near perfect documents.  In 1819, another of Mr.Jefferson's visions came to fruition with the foundation of the University of Virginia, a leading public research university and the source of incredible scholarship on things like human rights and individual liberty and natural law and the freedoms that individuals are bestowed by virtue of the Nation in which we live, again, in the Fifth District of  Fast forward to 1865, the end of the bloodiest era in our Nation's history internally, a conflict as we moved towards a more perfect union, in which if you count disease and dysentery and starvation, along with combat deaths, over a million Americans gave their lives as we worked to become a more perfect union. And we know but a small fraction of a percentage of those people's names.  And we know that Abraham Lincoln took a bullet by someone who was not willing to accept that progress meant acknowledging that Jefferson's words were true, as they were later manifest by King, once again, 53 years ago in August in this city.  Fast forward to 1933 and the 21st Amendment repealing prohibition, Franklin County, Virginia, dubbed the wettest county in And as we watched as jobs left the Fifth District of Virginia and opportunity seemingly left with them, we saw a wellspring of opportunity and economic development in the form, ironically, of wineries and distilleries and breweries. So when Burlington and Broyhill and Bassett and Lane and Dan River Mills left, distilleries and breweries and wineries crept in. It started in Franklin County,  Fast forward to 1944, Bedford, Virginia, June 6. The Allied invasion at Normandy, D-day. The Town of Bedford lost more of her sons per capita than any other town in the United States--19 in one day, more than decimating an entire graduating class and removing the best and brightest from that small Virginia locality.  Notably, three other young men from Bedford died later in the Normandy campaign, bringing the total Bedford KIA during Normandy to 22. And ironically, these men died serving in the Blue-Gray 29th Infantry Division, so named because it honored the fact that it brought soldiers from both sides of the Mason-Dixon line together to fight and bleed and die to free foreign women and men whom they had never met.  Fast forward to 1951, Prince Edward County, Virginia, the hamlet of Barbara Johns, a high school student, had an uncle who was a scholar, who discussed with her and her family over the dinner table the ideas expanded upon by Jefferson and the Declaration, and suggested that, indeed, all people were created equal. And this manifests itself through Barbara Johns in action. This teenage girl looked at the school that she attended, the Moton High School, and looked across the county to the all-White new high school and understood that if all people were, indeed, created equal, as her uncle had suggested as was written by Jefferson, then it was unfair that court cases like Plessy v. Ferguson that any law that said that separate but equal was anything close to a possible theoretical reality must be struck down.  Now, I have passed by other residents of the Fifth District of Patrick Henry, for example. John Marshall, for example. But back to Henry stood before the American Revolution and said: ``I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.'' And from the back of the room someone shouted: And Patrick Henry responded, ``If this be treason, make the most of it,'' acknowledging that to do something great that he believed in he might need to die.  Barbara Johns did that very same thing on April 23, 1951, when she led a walkout of Moton High School demanding an end to separate but equal segregation in Virginia, thus sparking the civil rights movement in Virginia that also can look to its forbearers and see Booker Washington, a civil rights leader amongst the last generation of[[Page H7668]]African-American leaders born into slavery. His vision began to culminate when Johns led the student walkout in Prince Edward County that led to desegregation at the very risk of her life.  Now, I like to liken Johns to Patrick Henry, both of whom are heroes of mine, as two people who were willing to stand up and do what they thought was right regardless of the fact that it, quite literally, might cost them their lives. They might die. But I tell people when I speak to them, the difference between Patrick Henry and Barbara Johns is Patrick Henry was a 37-year-old attorney trained to speak in front of people, and Barbara Johns was a teenage girl, and this happened in America as we worked to become a more perfect union.  Fast forward to Pittsylvania County, where Deborah Coles, another hero of mine, was born one of eight children to a tobacco sharecropper. Growing up in a Virginia where racism was far too evident and common, Deborah Coles bucked the odds, learned a work ethic from her mother and father, became the first in her family to attend college, attending Virginia State University, and later going on into public education where she was and is an educator and an administrator in the small town where I went to high school and where she had undoubtedly touched the lives of innumerable thousands of students over the decades--finding ways to say yes, finding means to encourage thought, finding ways to stimulate young minds. And she did this despite the ridiculous challenges faced by her forbearers, and she did it here as we worked to become a more perfect union in  Fast forward to the 21st century. Servicemembers, not unlike their brethren from Bedford who fell on June 6 at D-day, just a handful of the sacrifice from the Fifth District of VA, 1-435th of our  Humayun Khan, a graduate of the aforementioned University of Virginia, who, at risk to himself, moved his soldiers away and sought to determine whether or not a vehicle approaching the point where he was working was a threat, and ultimately, in protecting those with whom he served, gave his life wearing the uniform of a nation to which his parents had immigrated.                              {time}  2130  Sergeant Andrew Crabtree, a Special Forces soldier who served multiple tours defending America in the global war on terror and recently passed to the next life from a cancer deemed to have been service-related.  And Seaman Dakota Rigsby, the son of working class folks from Fluvanna County, Virginia, in the Fifth District, who tragically perished while wearing the uniform of this Nation, defending that which is worth defending, aboard the USS  Then, moving to today, and reason number 10, although, to be fair, Booker Washington, Patrick Henry, and John Marshall could make this 13 if I counted them separately, and that is the families of Pastor Hassan and Abdumawla, Christians from the Republic of Sudan, who, after about 9 months of work on our part and about 18 months of imprisonment on the part of the two gentlemen I named, have now moved to Buckingham County, Virginia, where they have an opportunity to experience a land where they are free to stand or sit when the anthem is played, where they are free to worship or not worship as they feel compelled, and where no dream is too big.  I would wager that, having lived in a foreign land and not having been amongst those 1 in 25 or 26, roughly, fortunate enough to have been born here in this imperfect land perpetually seeking to be a more perfect Union, I would wager that, when our national anthem is played, these newest residents of Virginia's Fifth Congressional District will choose to stand. I hope, when you think of the sacrifices made by millions who came before us, that you will, too.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-02-pt1-PgH7666.txt,1737,PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT,2017,2,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

143,topic-id,669,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for bringing the attention of the House to this important matter.  This summer, we had catastrophic wildfires in We burned 1.2 million acres. That is the equivalent of the size of the State of I have seen this destruction firsthand. I visited with incident commanders and firefighters on five separate wildfires this summer.  In Lincoln County, the air quality was so unhealthy that teachers provided masks to the kids in school so they could breathe.  In August, I had Secretary Zinke and Secretary Perdue come to Montana and tour the Lolo Peak fire, one of the most expensive fires that was fought this summer.  I have worked to bring relief to In July, emergency relief for farmers and ranchers was provided by opening up the C.Russell recreation area to grazing. We had hungry cows left from pasture being consumed and grass available. It was a commonsense solution to put those two together.  Also in July, we successfully urged FEMA Director Brock Long to reconsider their denial of one of our fires and declare Montana eligible for emergency funds. For these two things, I am thankful.  So the negative impact has been severe. And while there has been some relief, including welcome rain and snow, we can't rely on that. Again, this summer, over a million acres burned in Montana alone; we lost two firefighters; livelihoods were threatened; wildlife habitats were destroyed; smoke hung in the air; and ash rained down on our homes and our cars.  Air quality reached dangerous levels in our communities. In fact, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Montana donated 150 air filters to our schools so our children could breathe.  I have also seen firsthand the positive results of managed forests. Just 2 weeks ago, I toured a BLM forest near Miles City, Montana, and showed the effect of treating and managing forests. A fire burned in 2015 through a forest through the crowns, and when it reached a forest that had been managed, the fire quickly dropped into the undergrowth, burned through the grass, but none of the trees were lost.  In the untreated forest, there is just dead trees that won't recover in our lifetime. In the treated area, all of the trees survived. In fact, when an overgrown forest is thinned, more surface water came back, there is better habitat for wildlife, and we just have a better result.  I saw that also on the Roaring Lion fire, which occurred in the Bitterroot Valley in 2016, where, there, private property owners had managed their private property. When the fire on public land reached there, it was quickly extinguished and hundreds of homes were saved.  So the benefits of properly managed forests are clear. We have healthier forests. There is more wildlife, more hunting, more recreational opportunities, more good-paying jobs, and wildfires are less severe.  One of the biggest problems we have is litigation. We need more collaborative projects, but litigation is one of the greatest problems. Parties come to the table in good faith, they work collaboratively only to be overturned by court action by radical environmental extremists.  The Stonewall Vegetation Project in Lincoln, Montana, is a good example. Here, the Forest Service worked together with local landowners over a 8-year period to develop a collaborative forest management project. Once it was approved a year ago, the lawyers swooped in, arguing the project would disrupt lynx habitat. The judge overturned the decision. Fires raged this summer. Now there is no more habitat for lynx, and all that carbon has been released into atmosphere.  Benefits of forest management are clear. As I have mentioned, healthier forests, more wildlife, more hunting, jobs, and less severe fires. It is time to act. We can't control the weather, but we can control how we manage our forests. It is time to reform our forest management by passing Bruce Westerman's Resilient Federal Forests Act, and we also must put commonsense guardrails on the Endangered Species Act to reduce frivolous lawsuits.

782,topic-id,442,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the horrific mass murders last night. My heart is obviously with the victims and their families, and I thank all of our brave first responders who acted so quickly.  These senseless mass shootings must end. We cannot allow this to be the new normal, where tragedy after tragedy happens, and we do absolutely nothing to address it. It is not good enough to just send thoughts and prayers and extend our condolences when people are losing their lives to gun violence every day.  We still have to learn the details about what happened, but what we do know is this: This violence, this mass murder, is one of the worst massacres we have ever seen in this country. It is yet another reminder of Congress' failure to act to protect Americans from gun violence. It is another disturbing and painful example of how Congress is too weak and too cowardly to stand up to the gun industry.  The news reports are saying that the gun was shooting in rapid-fire bursts, a military-style weapon specifically designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time, a weapon of war.  We have to pass laws that protect the American people from this kind of horrific violence. It should not be legal for a civilian on American soil to own and use a weapon of war like an assault weapon. Our military is highly trained to use such weapons. It should not be easy for any person to buy a suppressor--known by many people as a silencer--to attach to their guns, which makes it harder for police to do their jobs and catch violent criminals.  The people of Nevada voted in November to require background checks on all weapons, but the politicians in that State are refusing to implement the will of the people. The violence in Las Vegas is only the latest tragedy like this. Mass shootings get all the news, but every single day in my home State, gun violence on a much smaller scale is destroying more and more lives.  We really need to act. We must take gun violence as seriously as we take the threat of terrorism, wherever it is happening.  We will get to the facts and the bottom of this. And when we do, let's honor the lives of those we have lost by doing something about it, doing everything we can to make sure this never happens again.  I yield the floor.

294,topic-id,1202,"Mr.Speaker, when someone with the service of my friend from Louisiana, Mr.Higgins, pays tribute, you know it is somebody worthy, because my friend from Louisiana served with distinction in the United States Army, wearing the uniform of this country. He served as a law enforcement officer. He knows about serving, protecting others, and a willingness to lay down his life for others.  It has been deeply touching to have seen accounts of what is going on in Las To understand what I have seen in my years as a prosecutor, judge, and chief justice, when everyone is running away from the sound of a gun, first responders and law officers are running into harm's way to help and protect others.  It was Jesus who said, ``Greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''  Those who wear the uniform, as my friend has, of law officer and in the military, they know what that means. My 4 years in Active Duty in the Army, we were not in combat, but Jesus was right.  There were so many there in Las Vegas that put their own lives on the line for the sake of the lives of others.  There are others that couldn't wait to rush to a microphone to demand: Gun control, gun control.  I am waiting for them to rush to the mic and scream: Knife control, knife control.  Or after a van is used as the weapon: Van control, van control.  What is clear is we need to look at the real causation, whether it is machetes being used to torture and kill 800,000 precious humans in Africa, whether it is knives, whether it is ammonium nitrate. People with evil in their hearts are going to find a way to wreak havoc.  We know that without a gun being used, the biggest--worst tragedy and loss of life attack was on 9/11 in 2001. I don't believe there was a gun used in the whole process, yet it was a worse loss of American life than at Pearl  You have got to look at what is in the heart, what's causing it. If they are going to use knives, if they are going to use planes, if they are going to use vehicles, yeah, we need to protect ourselves, but we need to look at what is in the heart.  I know the sheriff said the shooter may have been radicalized. We don't know yet. We know there was a trip to the Philippines  I am very proud to have met out in the jungles of the southern Philippines with some of our special forces. Some of the best America has to offer, and they were out in the jungles teaching the Filipino soldiers, the best that the Philippines had, how to go after the radicalized Islamists in the southern  But we don't know if this man with evil in his heart had been radicalized.[[Page H7839]]Others say there were no indications. But one thing was certain, he looked down on that crowd of people enjoying life, enjoying their families, enjoying their loved ones, and all he could see was worthless people that needed to be eliminated.  Why did he have that in his heart? Where do people get those ideas?  I mean, we argue and disagree here on the House floor. When I was a judge, I watched argument. At times it seemed like they wanted to come to blows, but it was part of a civil process in a bastion where we come and we disagree and we don't use physical violence, but we are still supposed to have respect for each other and each other's position.  To hear some comedian say, ``Just do something,'' would have been viewed by those who gave us the documents that have allowed us to be the greatest Nation--I think greater than Solomon's Israel, more assets per person, the only country in the history that I'm aware of where the number one health problem for the Nation's poor is obesity, and it is a serious issue.  But how did we get here?  Obviously, for the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, it was easier for them because they weren't looking in the eyes of people.  It was easier for this guy 32 floors up because he was not looking at the eyes of these people, his people he wanted to kill that he didn't think were worth allowing to live, despite the love they were sharing with each other and the joy.  Where do people get those ideas that somebody is that worthless? Is it from hearing people with whom someone disagrees is deplorable, that they simply cannot be made worthy of living?  Here is a statement from this October 2 article. Some CBS executive said she was not even sympathetic for the victims of the shooting at a country music festival. She said: ``I am actually not even sympathetic because country music fans often are Republican gun toters.''                              {time}  2145  Scott Pelley has questioned whether the shooting was ``foreseeable, predictable and, to some degree, self-inflicted.''  But for someone who appears to know right from wrong, not suffering from mental disease or defect, to inflict that kind of death on people who are just innocent, just having a good time, there has to be so much evil and hate in his heart.  So we have a Supreme Court that has been saying for years: You have got to get prayer out of schools. Never mind the fact that prayer got this country started, that prayer and worship and honoring God have been behind the greatest developments in this country's history that got us to this place, to this plateau, as a nation.  Although some would argue we have hit the height of freedom, some surveys don't have us anywhere near the top of being one of the freest countries in the world anymore.  It is continuing to be, after tragedies, after people with evil in their heart do evil things, that more cry out: We need to lose more freedom. We need to lose more freedom.  That is not the answer. Let's look at what is in people's hearts and what would be good to have in their hearts.  I know where we came from, but even I was surprised when my pastor, David Dykes, and I and his wife, Cindy, my wife, Kathy, we were going through the State I had not done a tour of the State Department before because it is mostly boring, but we came to a glass case that had a document in it, and it said it was a duplicate.  We know that many of our most important documents, including the Declaration of Independence, were made in duplicate, so I don't know if this was one that was actually signed or it was a duplicate. It appeared to be of the era.  I said to Dykes: Did you know the Treaty of Paris began like that?  I didn't know. I study history most every day.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

295,topic-id,958,"Mr.Speaker, I did know that rule.  But this was the Treaty of Paris, 1783, and John Adams was there. But this is where we were negotiating with England, the most powerful country in the world, imploring them to recognize this little upstart country of 13 States as an independent country, independent and free of the shackles that were there as Colonies by  Here they have got the biggest navy. They have an impressive military, most powerful nation, and we are asking them to swear on a document that we in the United States have the right to be free and independent.  So as I contemplated that, well, these first words that are in much bigger letters than the rest of the document, began to make sense.  What would you have asked somebody swear under, at the beginning of our Nation, asking the most powerful nation in the world to swear that they recognize, something important enough they would not want to break that oath, even with the anger and the despising attitude that many in England had at that time?  Well, the words they chose for those big, tall letters, were these, and this is a copy of the copy. ``In the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity.''  Well, some say we were started with the Declaration of Independence, recognizing that we are free and, of right, ought to be free because we are endowed by our Creator with these unalienable rights.  And then we have this document where England swears in the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity that they recognize our independence. That came after the Great Awakening, in the 1700s, where pulpits were on fire with the glory of God and the recognition of what God had given us and of the importance of the  No, everybody wasn't a Christian back then, but of the signers of the Declaration, you had over a third of them were--may have been over half were actually ordained Christian ministers.  There were secularists that supported the end of slavery, but the churches drove that. The churches provided the Underground Railroad, most often, to try to help Africans to be free  It was an ordained Christian minister who went on to help bring about the full meaning of the Constitution, that this should mean what it said, an ordained Christian minister named Martin Luther King,  So, Mr.Speaker, Abraham Lincoln, he started life early as, bragging to his law partner, he was an infidel. Going from that, as Steve Mansfield discusses, I believe the book is entitled ``Lincoln's Struggle With God.'' By the time he became President, he knew there was a And just like Benjamin Franklin said: ``I have lived, sir, a long time. The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth--God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been assured, sir, in the sacred writings that, `except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.'''  He said: ``I firmly believe this. I also firmly believe that without His concurring aid, we shall succeed in our political building no better than the builders of Babel.''  So this man, kind of homely looking--I thought Daniel Day-Lewis captured his essence so well. When I met Doris Kearns Goodwin over at the Library of Congress, I said: You've got to tell me, you do such fabulous research--and, yes, she is a more liberal Democrat, I know, but she does fabulous research. And in her book, ``Team of Rivals,'' she has well documented he didn't have a pleasant voice, kind of high, raspy. Daniel Day-Lewis nailed it.  But Lincoln came to know what Ben Franklin testified to in 1787 at the Constitutional He lost a son. He and his wife lost a son in 1861. There are indications he totally blamed himself because he thought he hadn't done quickly enough what God meant for him to do: end slavery. I don't know if that is true or not.  But in March of 1863, this was Abraham Lincoln's declaration, and I will finish with this, Mr.Abraham Lincoln's words were: ``But we have forgotten We have forgotten the[[Page H7840]]gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all the blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.''  Lincoln goes on and says: ``Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us. It behooves us then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness''--Abraham  Mr.Speaker, I believe this was not the act of God punishing Americans for being country music fans or being conservatives. This was not the act of God punishing Americans for turning away. This was from a man with evil in his heart in a country where God has been driven out of the schoolhouse, driven out of government buildings by a majority of Supreme Court Justices who have no clue how far from the original intent of the Constitution they have wandered.  It is the result of years of teaching people that there are those among our what we deem innocent in society who just should not be allowed to live. That is not the teaching of It is not the teaching in the Bible, and it is not what this country grew so great believing.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgH7838-2.txt,1801,PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT,2017,4,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She spent countless hours in VA facilities ensuring veterans, young and old, got the care they so desperately needed and deserved.

TITLE III--ENHANCED VICTIM ASSISTANCE TO ELDER ABUSE SURVIVORS     301. SENSE OF THE       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:       (1) The vast majority of cases of abuse, neglect, and      exploitation of older adults in the United States go      unidentified and unreported.       (2) Not less than $2,900,000,000 is taken from older adults      each year due to financial abuse and exploitation.       (3) Elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation have no      boundaries and cross all racial, social, class, gender, and      geographic lines.       (4) Older adults who are abused are 3 times more likely to      die earlier than older adults of the same age who are not      abused.       (5) Up to half of all older adults with dementia will      experience abuse.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that--       (1) elder abuse involves the exploitation of potentially      vulnerable individuals with devastating physical, mental,      emotional, and financial consequences to the victims and      their loved ones;       (2) to combat this affront to America's older adults, we      must do everything possible to both support victims of elder      abuse and prevent the abuse from occurring in the first      place; and       (3) the Senate supports a multipronged approach to prevent      elder abuse and exploitation, protect the victims of elder      abuse and exploitation from further harm, and bring the      perpetrators of such crimes to justice.     302.       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date on      which the collection of statistical data under section      202(a)(1) begins and once each year thereafter, the Director      of the Office for Victims of Crime shall submit a report to      the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the      Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives      that addresses, to the extent data are available, the nature,      extent, and amount of funding under the Victims of Crime Act      of 1984 (42 U.S.10601 et seq.) for victims of crime who      are elders.[[Page H7711]]       (b) Contents.--The report required under subsection (a)      shall include--       (1) an analysis of victims' assistance, victims'      compensation, and discretionary grants under which elder      abuse victims (including elder victims of financial abuse,      financial exploitation, and fraud) received assistance; and       (2) recommendations for improving services for victims of      elder abuse.

253,topic-id,308,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, 178, the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, takes several steps to protect American seniors from financial exploitation and physical abuse. This legislation promotes the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators who prey upon seniors, enhances data collection, and provides resources for robust elder abuse prevention programs.  Some estimate that approximately 1 in 10 senior citizens are abused annually, but only 1 in 23 cases of elder abuse are reported to authorities each year. At least $2.9 billion is taken from older adults each year due to financial abuse and exploitation.  The abuse of these vulnerable victims causes devastating physical, mental, emotional, and financial consequences to the victims and their loved ones, and we must combat this injustice.  This bill requires each U.Attorney's Office to appoint an elder justice coordinator and requires the FBI to provide specialized training to agents relating to the investigation of elder abuse crimes. It mandates that both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission designate an elder justice coordinator.  It strengthens criminal laws to ensure that offenders who seek to exploit seniors through fraudulent email marketing are appropriately punished, and it enhances data collection on crimes against senior citizens so we can one day understand the full scope of this problem.  I believe it was Mahatma Gandhi who said: ``A nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members.'' We must ensure that appropriate measures are taken to protect our senior citizens, and that is precisely what this bill aims to do.  This bill passed the Senate unanimously, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in similar fashion.  I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the committee, for his work on this important legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I am pleased today that we are voting to reauthorize the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to[[Page H7707]]end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, or the PROTECT  The PROTECT Act authorizes local law enforcement task forces to combat crimes against children online. These internet crimes against children, or ICAC, task forces have been absolutely crucial in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of internet crimes against children. The program was developed in response to the increasing number of children and teenagers using the internet, the proliferation of child sexual abuse images available electronically, and heightened online activity by predators seeking unsupervised contact with potential underage victims.  Since the ICAC program's inception in 1998, more than 589,000 law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and other professionals have been trained on techniques to investigate and prosecute ICAC-related cases. More than 709,000 complaints of alleged child sexual victimization have been reviewed resulting in the arrest of more than 73,000 individuals. There are now 61 coordinated task forces representing over 4,500 Federal, State, and local law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies.  The need for these ICAC task forces has never been greater. The use of the internet by children is only increasing, and so are the crimes committed against them. Law enforcement officers are encountering new types of crimes such as sextortion, that create new complexities in their investigations.

997,topic-id,390,"Madam Speaker, since the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, medical knowledge regarding the development of unborn babies and their capacities at various stages of growth has advanced dramatically.  To give you a sense of how much technology has advanced, the issue of The New York Times announcing the Roe v. Wade decision, in 1973, contained ads for the latest in technology, including a computer the size of a file cabinet that you could rent for $3,000 a month that only had a fraction, thousandths, of the memory of a modern cellphone, and a basic AM radio that was as big as your hand.  At the time, there was nothing like the stunningly detailed images of unborn children that are so commonly celebrated on social media today.  Close to 45 years later, in the age of ultrasound pictures, the same newspaper reported on the latest research on the pain experienced by unborn children, focusing on that of Sunny Anand, an Oxford-trained neonatal pediatrician who held an appointment at Harvard Medical  As Anand has testified regarding abortions: ``If the fetus is beyond 20 weeks of gestation, I would assume that there will be pain caused to the fetus. And I believe it will be severe and excruciating pain.''  Congress has the power, and the responsibility, to acknowledge these developments in our understanding of the ability of unborn children to feel pain by prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks' pregnancy postfertilization, the point at which scientific evidence shows the unborn can experience great suffering. The bill before us does just that, and, in doing so, it saves lives.  In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is so confident that this bill would save lives that it took the rare step of estimating the number of lives that would be saved if this bill is enacted. The CBO conservatively estimates that this bill would[[Page H7716]]save over 2,000 lives each year, giving America the gift of thousands more children with all the wondrous human gifts they will bring to the world in so many amazing forms for generations to come.  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Judiciary Committee member Trent Franks for introducing this vital legislation.

Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock), my friend and colleague.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Gosar of the Western Caucus for arranging this Special Order tonight and especially for his exemplary leadership as chairman of the Western  The wildfire crisis facing our forests across the West comes down to a very simple adage. Excess timber comes out of the forest one way or the other. It is either carried out or it burns out, but it comes out.  When we carried out our excess timber, we had healthy resilient forests and we had thriving, prosperous communities. Excess timber sales from Federal lands not only generated revenues for our mountain communities, but created thousands of job.  But in the 1970s, we adopted laws like the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act that have resulted in endlessly time-consuming and cost-prohibitive restrictions and requirements that have made the scientific management of our forests virtually impossible.  Timber sales from our Federal lands has dropped 80 percent in the intervening years, with a concomitant increase in forest fires. In California alone, the number of saw mills has[[Page H7738]]dropped from 149 in 1981 to just 27 today.  Timber that once had room to grow healthy and strong now fights for its life against other trees trying to occupy the same ground.  Average tree density in the Sierra Nevada is three to four times the density that the land can actually support. In this weakened condition, trees lose their natural defenses to drought and disease and pestilence, and they ultimately succumb to catastrophic wildfire.  Three years ago, an estimated 25 million trees in the Sierra fell victim to these stressors. Two years ago, that number doubled to 50 million trees. Last year, more than 100 million dead trees are now waiting to burn in the  Well, after 45 years of experience with these environmental laws--all passed with the promise that they would improve our forest environment--I think we are entitled to ask: How's the forest environment doing?  All around us the answer is damning. These laws have not only failed to improve our forest environment, but they are literally killing our forests.  The same politicians responsible for these failed laws have recently conjured up two new excuses. One is climate change. The other is that we are putting out too many fires.  Putting out too many fires?  That invites an important question: Exactly which fires did they propose that we allow to burn?  Perhaps the King fire that almost wiped out the towns of Georgetown and Foresthill on its way to Lake Tahoe in 2014?  Or perhaps the Detwiler fire this year that almost wiped out the town of Mariposa on its way to the Yosemite Valley?  Or any one of the more than 1,000 fires in the Sierra that CAL FIRE has put out this year, any one of which could have grown into a megafire but for the vigilance and competence of our fire agencies?  Which of these fires would they allow to burn into a conflagration?  True, controlled burns play an important role in clearing out underbrush, but as firefighters bitterly complained to me at the command center at the Detwiler fire this year, these same laws make it virtually impossible to get permits to do the controlled burns.  The other reason that we hear is climate change. Well, let's put that to the smell test. Throughout our vast forests, it is often very easy to visually identify the property lines between well-managed private forests and the neglected Federal lands.  Now, I have seen it myself on aerial inspections. The private managed forests are green, healthy, and thriving. The neglected Federal forests are densely overcrowded and often scarred by fire because we can't even salvage the fire-killed timber while it still has value. You can literally tell from the condition of the forest where the property line is. How clever of our climate to know exactly what is the boundary line between private and government lands.  And if carbon dioxide is the problem, doesn't it make sense to mill fully grown trees to sequester the carbon and replace them with young, growing trees that absorb much higher levels of carbon?  But, again, these same laws prevent this.  This is not complicated. Our forests are catastrophically overgrown. Drought is a catalyst. It is not the cause. In overgrown forests, much snow evaporates in dense canopies and cannot reach the ground. The transpiration volume in an overgrown forest is a big problem in a normal rain year; in a drought, it becomes lethal.  Pestilence is a catalyst; it is not a cause. Healthy trees can naturally resist bark beetles; stressed trees cannot.                              {time}  1930  A properly managed forest matches the tree density to the ability of the land to support it, but we cannot properly manage our forests because of the laws now in place.  Mr.Westerman's Resilient Federal Forests Act and other measures will restore proper scientific management of our national forests, but we are running out of time to enact them, because we are running out of forests to save.  Mr.Speaker, I again thank the gentleman for yielding today, I thank him for his leadership, and I thank him for arranging this hour tonight.

154,topic-id,1224,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his excellent leadership. He is very modest.  Listen, folks, I made a comment. Around here in Washington, D.C., we talk about the Democrats being the opposition and the Senate being the problem. Well, as you know, this is a very bipartisan bill. He is very modest.  Let's go back through what H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act, actually does.  It allows for the streamlined review of projects up to 30,000 acres if the management strategy is put forward by collaborative stakeholders. Imagine that, something so simple.  It also requires litigants opposing active management projects to propose an alternative proposal as opposed to just saying ``no.'' ``No'' isn't a solution. It is what you are for.  It removes incentives for extreme special interest groups to file frivolous lawsuits--boy, once again, coming to the table with a solution.  It empowers local stakeholders and decisionmakers. So often we overlook the people on the ground, on Main Street, who have to live with the consequences for bad policy decisions.  It also empowers Tribal communities to be part of the solution and to help reduce the risk of wildfire. We see this time and again, that the Native Tribes that are in charge of their forests have pristine management practices.  H.2936 also maintains current protections for our environmentally sensitive areas, including wilderness and roadless areas. What a concession.  We need to be clear about larger risk areas and get to these in a more timely manner that we really want to handle.  This bill is good for forest-dependent species as it allows for improvements to their habitat.  This bill adopts a forward-thinking, active management strategy that combats dangerous wildfires before they get started, which includes reforms that would end the practice of fire borrowing.  I want to thank the gentleman for his excellent piece of legislation. It is time that it moves forward.  Once again, it is not the House that is the problem, but our colleagues across the street. Once again, talk is cheap; actions speak. Americans need help.  The fact that these disasters are quite natural might lead one to think they are inevitable, but according to forestry officials and experts, it is our stunted Federal forestry management and underfunded and misallocated Forest Service accounts that are to blame.                              {time}  2000  Our system is broken. These fires start naturally and decimate our natural ecosystems, but the ultimate cause at the level of their severity and recurrence is manmade.  The facts about the relationship between management and wildfires speak for themselves. Forest Service data indicates that active forest management reduces wildfire intensity, while improving forest health. In spite of this, only 1 to 2 percent of high risk areas are actively treated and subject to forest management.  The United States Forest Service expends too many resources fighting fires after they break out to work to prevent them in any significant way before they start. By performing routine thinning, culling hazardous fuels on the forest floors, and conducting controlled burns, they could accomplish exactly that, but such a course of action would require ample resources and wise allocation. As you could guess, my professional diagnosis is that both of those are in short supply.  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle are able to hear what I say next. If you care about carbon emissions, you should care deeply about this issue, no matter where you live in the country, no matter where you live.  NASA data shows that one wildfire can emit more carbon in a few days than total vehicle emissions in a State for the whole year. To put it in perspective, controlled burning releases roughly 10 percent as much, and is only one part of an overall active management strategy.  So the correct choice in this situation is obvious: we spend a little more on the front end so that we can save ourselves much of the economic, environmental, and familial displacement costs on the back end. These costs are year after year, and they are catastrophic when they are left untreated.  Treatment is the right course of action, but it requires a little bit of planning, due diligence, and yes, action on our part. I know Congress is a big fan of the word, but when you look at the track record, Congress isn't a big fan of actually acting.  In response to this dire situation, Members of Congress from across the country will be sharing their thoughts and experiences within their home They will be discussing this during the year, and this past year of terrible wildfires. These are stories that need to be recounted.  They will also be speaking about the solutions that we have come together[[Page H7742]]with, for forestry officials and stakeholders across the country. Tackling this problem has become a collaborative and holistic national policy effort, and the policy proposals we have produced are reflective of this fact. They are also bipartisan.  But, Mr.Speaker, we can't let this just be a rhetorical exercise. We are united in demanding Congress do something. This Chamber has the knowledge and aptitude to deliver policy solutions. Now we need the political will to turn that knowledge into congressional action. Only then will huge portions of the country finally see some relief from these disasters.  When your home is on fire, it is straightforward, it is a nonpartisan issue. You call the fire department, and after the problem is dealt with, you make sure that you eliminate what caused the fire so that you don't see it again.  Mr.Speaker, our Nation was on fire this year, and I demand that we, as this Chamber, unite in the same spirit of decisive problem solving as we do for our natural disasters. Let's put these fires out, and then let's stop the brunt for next year's fires before they start.  In my four terms as a Congressman from Arizona, I have had to witness the largest catastrophic fire in Arizona history, and also the most catastrophic life-taking, the Yarnell fire. The first was the Wild Well fire in northeast Arizona, and the second was the Yarnell fire that is now in the movie theaters that took the lives of 19 firefighters. That is a travesty.  This is something that gives when it is managed right. The people back home know the right answer. Let's give them the tools, the working power, and the policy that allows them, instead of being victims, to be stalwart solutions for a policy that gives back.  As the gentleman from Arkansas said, as Teddy Roosevelt said: Leave our natural resources better than we found them.  Mr.Speaker, the speakers tonight shared their stories. We want America to hear those loud and clear. These are natural disasters no different than hurricanes, but these, in one case, are different. They are manmade.  Let's bring this commonsense policy that Mr.Westerman has put forward. He is a true advocate and smart in regards to those reforms; that is why we want to make sure that H.2936 gets moved through this Chamber, and then put the onus back on the Senate, so that we actually reward the people for good policy and making sure that the victims are turned upside down and made stalwart solution makers.

      Whereas nearly 54 years have passed since the tragic      assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963;       Whereas the President John Kennedy Assassination Records      Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.2107 note; Public Law 102-     526) (referred to in this preamble as the ``Records      Collection Act''), directed all Federal agencies to transmit      to the National Archives and Records Administration all      records in their custody related to the assassination of      President Kennedy;       Whereas former President and ninth Director of Central      Intelligence George H.Bush declared in his signing      statement for the Records Collection Act that ``[b]ecause of      legitimate historical interest in this tragic event, all      documents about the assassination should now be disclosed'';       Whereas the Records Collection Act established the      Assassination Records Review Board to ensure that Federal      agencies complied with the law;       Whereas the Records Collection Act established a deadline      25 years after enactment for the full public disclosure of      all assassination records whose disclosure was postponed or      that were subject to redaction;       Whereas the 25-year deadline for the full public disclosure      of all remaining assassination records is October 26, 2017;       Whereas the Assassination Records Review Board uncovered      records that were withheld from the staff of the President's      Commission on the Assassination of President John Kennedy,      the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and other      Government entities;       Whereas the former Chairman of the Assassination Records      Review Board has publicly commented that records held by the      National Archives and Records Administration should be made      public;       Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration      holds approximately 3,100 fully redacted records and      approximately 31,000 partially redacted records concerning      the assassination of President Kennedy;       Whereas Congress declared in the Records Collection Act      that all Government records related to the assassination      should be preserved for historical and governmental purposes      and eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully      informed about the history surrounding the assassination;       Whereas Congress declared in the Records Collection Act      that legislation was necessary because the implementation of      the Freedom of Information Act (section 552 of title 5,      United States Code) by the executive branch prevented the      timely public disclosure of records relating to the      assassination of President Kennedy;       Whereas public opinion surveys suggest that a large      majority of the American public supports the full release of      all remaining assassination records;       Whereas Congress recently reaffirmed its commitment to      transparency, accountability, and the public disclosure of      Government records by enacting the FOIA Improvement Act of      2016 (Public Law 114-185; 130 538), which codifies a      presumption of openness;       Whereas there is legitimate interest from the academic      community, historical researchers, and the general public in      having access to withheld records for research purposes and      general knowledge; and       Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration      was formed to preserve and document Government and historical      records and to increase public access to those documents:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate urges the President of the United      States to--       (1) allow for the full public release of all remaining      records pertaining to the assassination of President John      Kennedy that are held by the National Archives and Records      Administration;

DIRECT       (a) Means-tested Direct Spending.--       (1) For means-tested direct spending, the average rate of      growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year      period preceding fiscal year 2018 is 6.8 percent.       (2) For means-tested direct spending, the estimated average      rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 11-     year period beginning with fiscal year 2017 is 4.3 percent      under current law.       (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent      resolution for means-tested direct spending:       (A) The People's Budget adopts former President Obama's      Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to expand eligibility,      including for childless workers. Continues enhanced credits      originally implemented under the American Recovery and      Reinvestment Act to target those most in need. This includes      extending the Child and Dependent Care Credit and the      American Opportunity Tax Credit through 2027.       (B) The People's Budget includes former President Obama's      proposal to boost the Child Tax Credit maximum deduction to      $3,000. It makes key expansions permanent to protect 50      million Americans who would otherwise be at jeopardy for      losing part or all of their EITC and       (C) The People's Budget creates a debt free college that      provides Federal matching program to support state efforts to      expand investment in higher education, bring down[[Page H7821]]     costs for students, and increase aid to students to help them      cover the total cost of college attendance without taking on      debt. The program would encourage innovation by states and      colleges to improve efficiency and enable speedy and less-     cos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ly degree completion. By treating higher education as a      public good worth investing in, we can once again make higher      education accessible to all.       (D) The People's Budget allows students to refinance their      student loans at low rates and allows private borrowers to      shift to more affordable government loans. Allowing student      borrowers to reduce the value of their debt will free up      income for purchases and will create a job-creating ripple      effect throughout the entire economy.       (E) The People's Budget restores cuts made to the      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and      permanently adopts the enhanced levels established in the      American Recovery and Reinvestment The vast majority of      SNAP recipients are households with children, seniors and      individuals with disabilities, but recent cuts lowered      average benefits by $216 in 2014. Providing families with      basic food security through SNAP is one of the most effective      ways the Federal Government can stimulate the economy.       (F) The People's Budget provides an additional $10.8      billion for child nutrition programs including program      expansion and improvements for summer meals; essential      improvements and expansion funding for preschool nutrition      including increases in meal reimbursements to fulfill the new      meal pattern, an additional meal or snack for children in      long-term care, and expanded program eligibility; and      investments in school meals and school kitchens.       (G) The People's Budget replaces the 40 percent excise tax      with a public option to allow the Secretary of Health and      Human Services to offer a public insurance option within the      health insurance marketplaces. This ensures choice,      competition, and stability in coverage. The Congressional      Budget Office (CBO) estimates the premium costs for Americans      under the public option will be 7 to 8 percent lower than      costs in private exchange plans. The repeal of the excise tax      costs $132 billion while savings from the public option are      $176 billion.       (H) The People's Budget continues funding for the entire      CHIP program until 2020.       (I) The People's Budget protects States programs by fully      retaining maintenance of effort requirements and eliminating      any States ability to arbitrarily implement enrollment caps.      Without action, Federal funding for CHIP will expire      jeopardizing the health care coverage of more than 10 million      children and pregnant women.       (J) The People's Budget permits the Secretary of Health and      Human Services (HHS) to negotiate prescription drug prices      with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Giving HHS the ability to      negotiate prices, as the Department of Veterans Affairs      currently does, will save Medicare $429 billion and will      reduce costs for seniors.       (b) Nonmeans-tested Direct Spending.--       (1) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the average rate      of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year      period preceding fiscal year 2018 is 4.8 percent.       (2) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the estimated      average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during      the 11-year period beginning with fiscal year 2017 is 5.6      percent under current law.       (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent      resolution for nonmeans-tested direct spending:       (A) The People's Budget allows those who have lost a job      through no fault of their own to claim up to 99 weeks of      unemployment benefits in high-unemployment states for up to      two years.       (B) The People's Budget also adopts former President      Obama's reforms to improve solvencies and incentivize job      training.       (C) The People's Budget improves the Affordable Care Act by      repealing the excise tax on high-priced health plans.      Proponents of the provision hoped that this tax would slow      the rate of growth of health costs, while raising revenue.      However, in an effort to avoid the tax, employers who      traditionally offer excellent benefits have started offering      less generous plans. This is an ineffective tool to bend the      cost curve. Since the tax is attached to premiums instead of      coverage it has the potential to hit plans it wasn't intended      to impact.       (D) The People's Budget establishes a representative      democracy that truly reflects the diversity and values of our      nation by providing funding for the public financing of      campaigns. This gives a voice to small donors that have been      drowned out by dark money. Public financing keeps politicians      accountable to the voters that elect them instead of to      special interest money. In the era of the devastating      Citizens United decision, big money has taken the reins of      our election process. It is now more important than ever to      provide candidates with effective alternatives to finance      their campaigns.       (E) The People's Budget uses the Experimental Price Index      for the Elderly (CPI-E) to calculate Cost of Living      Adjustments (COLA) for Federal retirement programs other than      Social Affected programs include civil service      retirement, military retirement, Supplemental Security      Income, veteran's pensions and compensations. CPI-E is the      most sensible and accurate measure of the real costs that      seniors face in retirement, current underpricing of costs      amount to cutting benefits for those on fixed incomes.       (G) The People's Budget makes a down payment of $1.9      trillion to help close the nation's infrastructure deficit      while protecting against climate change and creating millions      of living wage jobs. The budget also helps boost private      financing for critical state and local projects by creating a      public-private infrastructure bank. The American Society of      Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that the United States will      need to invest upwards of $2 trillion above current levels      over the next decade just to make required repairs to roads,      bridges, water, and energy systems.

528,topic-id,877,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, I rise to offer this amendment to replace the reckless Republican budget that is being considered before this  Instead of a doomsday budget that presents a future where everything is bleak and opportunity is nonexistent, the Progressive Caucus is offering a budget that can prove that the future can be bright and prosperous.  The Republican budget sacrifices everything from public education to Social Security to Medicare and It does this for one reason and one reason only: to give the wealthiest few and the corporations more tax breaks and increase their standing and concentration of power and wealth in this country more than it is already.  It has been said over and over that the budget that we are presenting we feel does deal with the values of this country. It deals very directly with something that is important to this Nation, and that is the American people, the greatest resource that we have as a nation, and we see it day in and day out.  This budget invests in the American people. It invests in jobs, it invests in solid education, and it invests in the greater good.  This budget is not narrow, tilted to a few: the wealthiest and the corporations in this country. It deals with the totality of who the American people are: those who are struggling and need opportunity, those who are elderly and need the continued support of this Nation through Medicare and Social Security, those who are poor who need Medicaid and a good education system so their opportunity will be better in the future.  Our budget speaks to the values of the American people. Our budget speaks to the needs of the American people. Our budget speaks to a future that returns the values, to the American people, of opportunity, of hope, and of chance.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  The Acting The gentleman from California is recognized for 15 minutes.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.  Mr.Chairman, even though I disagree heartily with the budgets advanced by[[Page H7822]]the Progressive Caucus, they do us an invaluable service in the budget debate by bringing into sharp relief the two very different visions of governance advanced by the two parties.  The Progressive budget is a sincere and bold document. Unfortunately, it is also wrong. It would hike taxes by $10.1 trillion over the next 10 years relative to the Republican budget.  Now, think of every trillion dollars that we throw around here as $8,000 from an average family, because that is what it comes to. So $10.1 trillion in new taxes ultimately translates as $81,000 from an average family over the next decade taken either as direct taxes or as tax-driven price increases or as lower wages or as lower earnings as businesses pass on their burdens to consumers or employers or investors. Remember, investors are largely your 401(k) or your pension plan.  It also runs up $2.6 trillion more in debt than the Republican budget over the next 10 years. That means another $21,000 of debt added to that family's obligations that they will have to pay as future taxes just as surely as if it appeared on their credit card statement this month. And they have got to pay that back before they pay back their credit card statement. The IRS can get very insistent that they do.  And don't believe for a moment that only the rich will pay these taxes. It turns out that the so-called rich people aren't rich and they aren't even people. Many are struggling small businesses filing under subchapter S, small businesses that create two-thirds of the jobs in our economy.  We are told: ``Don't worry. We are using that money to create wealth and jobs.'' Well, the problem is government does not create jobs because it cannot create wealth. Government cannot inject a dollar into the economy until it has first taken that dollar out of the same economy.  As Bastiat warned, we see the job that government creates when it puts the dollar back in the economy. What we don't see as clearly is the job that is lost when government first takes that dollar out of the economy. We see those lost jobs as stagnating wages and workers giving up and leaving the job market, or as it is also known, the Obama economy.  Here is what government can do and what the Progressive and Democratic budgets propose. It can transfer jobs from the private sector to the public sector by taxing one and expanding the other. It can transfer jobs from one sector of the private market to another by taxing one and subsidizing the other. That is precisely the difference between Apple Computer and It is the difference between FedEx and the post office. It is the difference between the Reagan recovery and the Obama recovery.  Reagan, like Coolidge and Kennedy before him, reduced the tax and regulatory burdens on the economy and produced one of the longest economic expansions in our country's history. It truly felt like morning again in That is the Republican approach, and it works.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

544,topic-id,726,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In the debate on the Republican budget and how it contrasts with the Congressional Progressive Caucus budget, we heard a lot about needing to control mandatory spending, that that was the real issue here, runaway mandatory spending.  Make no mistake, when my Republican colleagues talk about cutting mandatory spending, they mean they want to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for the trillion-dollar tax scam and creative numbers that are part of their budget for the wealthy and for the corporations in  The other issue that we heard a lot about is that, by making these major cuts for the wealthiest and the rich, that somehow their net gain and their profit and their break on taxes is going to trickle down to the rest of us. Well, we have seen that movie before in this country. That trickle-down theory doesn't work. The money doesn't trickle down, and the American people won't be fooled about that again.  Our budget invests $2 trillion in infrastructure and jobs immediately. Our budget takes bold action to fight climate change, and our budget delivers on the promise for our children, their inheritance of this country, the inheritance of the children that everybody is worried about a deficit. We are worried about their future as well.  Our budget delivers on the promise of childcare for all, pre-K for all, and a robust public education system to provide all kids with an opportunity to succeed in this  Our budget is about the future, our budget is about emphasizing the values that make this country special and great, and our budget is a contrast. It offers a contrast about what this country can be if it invests in its people.  The road that we have been on for far too long in which we have disinvested in people, shifted wealth and burden onto the middle class and the working class in this country, that time has ended. Our budget represents that end.  Mr.Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the people's budget, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, have my friends on the left learned absolutely nothing over these past 8 years? If massive government spending, higher and higher[[Page H7826]]taxes, and deeper and deeper debt produced economic growth, the Obama years should have been the golden age of our economy. Instead, we suffered prolonged stagnation. We averaged 1.5 percent annual growth, only half the average economic growth that our Nation has enjoyed in the postwar era. The Progressive and Democratic budgets promise more of the same.  We choose a different path, the Reagan path that produced an average of 3.5 percent growth year after year, higher wages, better jobs. Not just a Republican policy, John Kennedy did the same thing. He reminded us that a rising tide lifts all boats. These are the policies that create prosperity.  The government cannot create jobs because it cannot create wealth, but what it can do is create the conditions where jobs multiply and prosper or where they stagnate and disappear. That it can do very well. We have very consistent experience with the policies that create these conditions.  If you increase the burdens on the economy as the Democrats again propose, the economy contracts. If you lighten the burdens on the economy, it grows and prospers. No nation has ever taxed and spent its way to prosperity, but many nations have taxed and spent their way to economic ruin and bankruptcy.  We know what works and we know what doesn't work because we have tried both paths many times before. The House Budget Committee's budget follows principles that have, time and again, consistently and rapidly produced economic expansion and prosperity.  The House Democrats' budget and the Progressive budget before us now double down on policies that have impoverished and bankrupted nations wherever they have been employed down through history.  That is the choice before us today. Let us choose wisely. Our future depends on it.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

537,topic-id,439,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for giving me an opportunity to address the Progressive Caucus, their budget. I think the budget is unacceptable. It is something the American people ought to pay attention to because the day may come in which a budget similar to the Progressive Budget passes this floor.  The first thing to look at is we are increasing maybe by an average of about a little under--well, around $1 trillion increase in taxes over the next 10 years. So you are taking a lot more money away from And despite this huge increase in taxes, you are looking at about a $70 billion cut in defense.  I suggest that the public and the people who are supporting the Progressive Caucus take some time talking to their people in the current military, talk about the planes that can't fly, talk about the shortage of parts, and ask: How is it possible you could take this much more money from the American people and still feel we have to have significant cuts in our military budget?  But then you look at what we have to spend more on: a 4 percent raise for Federal workers. Look, we wish everybody had a raise, but, really, at a time when we are approaching $20 trillion in debt, is it a priority to give Federal workers a raise?  We put more and more people dependent on government; a large expansion of the program providing free college to people. At a time when, quite frankly, many people who already have college degrees can't get jobs, we are expanding that program. And, of course, by making it free, people will respect it less. And not only will they respect it less, but by making it free, many people will go to college who perhaps otherwise don't feel it is for them.  They won't make adjustments to the food stamp program, which is a problem.  We greatly extend the time that you are on unemployment, and this is kind of bizarre because it is a time when our employment is near historic lows. But despite the fact that until now we haven't had such unemployment for a long period of time, we want to extend unemployment, thereby encouraging more people to stay on unemployment.                              {time}  1830  I would like to thank my friends from the Congressional Progressive Caucus for allowing students to refinance their student loans, which shows something or another that there is a heart there, a little bit anyway.

I don't know what to tell people, except to say that help may be on the way soon. Of course, that is not good enough.  I have no explanation for why it is not already there. It certainly is not the fault of the brave men and women who work for FEMA and the Armed I spent a lot of time with them in Puerto Rico while I was there, and they are working hard. They are tired. They are facing the difficult task of finding and feeding people.  From what I saw in Puerto Rico this last weekend, what I am hearing from my constituents, and what I am hearing from my family and friends, we need to seriously ramp up the use of full capacity and capabilities of the U.Government, including the U.military, to rescue people.  They don't need paper towels tossed at them like T-shirts at a sports arena. They need helicopters, bridges, cell towers, and generators. This is why I was, frankly, horrified by our President's performance yesterday on the island.  He said that Puerto Rico was making his budget out of whack, as if the monetary cost of saving lives is what we should be focusing on, or that an agenda that cuts taxes is really as important as saving people's lives in danger.  From the beginning, he has focused on the cost of saving Puerto Ricans, not the moral duty to save them. He has essentially said that Puerto Ricans are sitting around looking for handouts and not helping themselves, which is not at all what I saw in Puerto Rico this past weekend, Mr. Yesterday, the President said we should all feel proud because only 16 people have been listed as officially killed by Hurricane Maria in Puerto  Really? We should feel proud?  He said that a real tragedy like Hurricane Katrina killed many more people. Thousands, he said.  So I guess he is saying: Hey, only 16. Why the big fuss?  That number doubled overnight, by the way. Everyone understands that it will go up further still when contact is made with all parts of the island.  I look at it a little differently. To me, it is almost like Hurricane Maria posed a test to the United States of America and to our The hurricane said: I am going to take 34 souls. That is 34 too many, but that is what I am going to take. Now I am leaving it up to you, America, Mr.President, and you the people in Congress to tell me what you will do to prevent that number from going any higher. Are you getting medicine to the sick? Are you evacuating the aunt with cancer or the cousin on dialysis? Are you providing safe drinking water and flights to safety?  Mr.Speaker, I don't think today's body count is the right metric to look at, but, rather, we should be challenging ourselves to make sure it doesn't go higher.  The most serious event in Puerto Rico's modern history may not qualify as a significant disaster to our President, but let us not sit back and allow the body count to change the President's mind. We just can't wait that long.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgH7756.txt,478,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,4,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1148,topic-id,1008,"Madam Speaker, I just returned from Puerto Rico, and to start my remarks, I would like to say a few words in Spanish, the language of Puerto Rico, and then I will switch back to  I will provide a translation to the desk.  (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)  My beloved Puerto Rico, you are not alone. We hear your cries for help and the full strength of the American government and military is finally coming to help.  It has been slow and no one has been as frustrated as I am that the response did not happen with the urgency and priority that Puerto Ricans--and every human being who is suffering--deserve.  I tell my colleagues what I saw and what you told me while I was there. I will work with them immediately, and make sure that this Congress treats Puerto Rico fairly and generously.  And I am not alone. The other Puerto Ricans and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus are working with the leadership of the House to put together an aid package.  Cities and towns, Mayors and Governors from across the country are making their communities available to you so that you have a safe place to be while the rescue and recovery and rebuilding continues.  And standing with the Mayor of Chicago just yesterday, he said he wants the City of Chicago to be a place where any and all Puerto Ricans who need a safe place can come and we will help you resettle.  You are not alone.  Mi amado Puerto Rico, no estas solo.  Oimos tus peticiones de ayuda, y la fuerza del gobierno y milicia estadounidense finalmente vienen a ayudar.  Ha sido despacio, y comparto tu frustracion sobre una respuesta que no se dio con la urgencia y prioridad que los Puertorriquenos--y cualquier ser humano que esta sufriendo--se merecen.  Les digo a mis colegas lo que he visto, y lo que me has dicho cuando estuve ahi. Trabajare con ellos inmediatamente para asegurar que este Congreso trate a Puerto Rico justa y generosamente.  Y no soy el unico. Otros Puertorriquenos, y el Caucus Hispano estan trabajando con el liderazgo de la Camara para conformar un programa de ayuda.  Ciudades y pueblos, alcaldes y gobernadores a traves del pais, estan abriendote las puertas de sus comunidades para que tengas un lugar seguro mientras el rescate, la recuperacion y la reconstruccion continuan.  Y ayer, presente con el alcalde de Chicago, el me dijo que quiere que la ciudad de Chicago sea un lugar en el cual todo Puertorriqueno que necesite un lugar seguro pueda llegar y reestablecerse.  Madam Speaker, I flew to Puerto Rico on Friday to see what was happening on the ground with my own eyes. Madam Speaker, it was worse than I imagined, and it broke my heart to see my beloved island so destroyed and so scared for its future and feeling so alone and isolated.  There were dead animals all over the place, and people were so desperate for food and water. Anyone who is sick or elderly is finding it hard or impossible to get medicine and medical care.  Things are improving day by day, and the number of helicopters flying missions of mercy to the interior of the island is increasing. But almost everyone has no electrical power. Almost everyone has little or no food and trouble finding it. Almost everyone has no water, and some are seeking water from unreliable or possibly contaminated sources.  At the same time, I also saw an amazing unity and toughness, a can-do spirit that my fellow Puerto Ricans have the ability to make a way where there is no way, to improvise, and, most importantly, to work together.  Any divisions of party or class that are right on the surface on a typical day in Puerto Rico, this faction versus that faction, all of that was blown away. The only status issue that matters for Puerto Ricans right now is the status of the SOS, save our souls. We need help, and plenty of it, now.  Yesterday, I spoke at a press conference in Chicago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel and leaders from Chicago, including Fire Commissioner Santiago and the head of Chicago's Office of Emergency Management and Control, a brigadier general in our National  The mayor announced that 22 Chicago firefighters, on their own dime, are going to Puerto Rico to help with the rescue and recovery efforts, including bringing equipment that may help communications to remote parts of the island.  The mayor also announced that, in Chicago, we want to be for Puerto Rico what Houston was for New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina--a place of refuge where we will help you get settled, get your kids into school, get you the medical care you need, and make you feel welcome.  One thing I learned in Puerto Rico this weekend is that, in Chicago and in the rest of the U.S., we need to start thinking about evacuation in addition to rebuilding and recovery.  I have welcomed my own family into my home, and people I know across the country are welcoming relatives escaping Puerto Rico and the Virgin But we need to wrap up our commitment beyond the family-to-family informal relationships and look systematically at how we organize ourselves to meet the great need of our fellow citizens on the island in the  Rebuilding Puerto Rico--making her a strong and self-sufficient island nation of industrious and hardworking people again--will take years and require a long-term commitment from this Congress and this country so that the well-being of our fellow man on the island can be met.  So, Madam Speaker, let's roll up our sleeves and get to work. Once again, Chicago is there to welcome you, to enroll your kids in school, to get you medical attention, and to make sure you have a safe place until the recovery and rebuilding has been accomplished.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois will provide a translation of his remarks to the Clerk.[[Page H7677]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7676.txt,478,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
992,topic-id,3431,"Mr.Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 548, I call up[[Page H7713]]the bill (H.36) to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect pain-capable unborn children, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                                H.36       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Pain-Capable Unborn Child      Protection Act''.     2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF                    CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY FOR       Congress finds and declares the following:       (1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the      unborn child's entire body and nerves link these receptors to      the brain's thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than      20 weeks after fertilization.       (2) By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts      to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli      that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult      human, for example, by recoiling.       (3) In the unborn child, application of such painful      stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress      hormones known as the stress response.       (4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with      long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered      pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and      learning disabilities later in life.       (5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal      anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a      decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when      painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia. In the      United States, surgery of this type is being performed by 20      weeks after fertilization and earlier in specialized units      affiliated with children's hospitals.       (6) The position, asserted by some physicians, that the      unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point      later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization      predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to      experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires      nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex.      However, recent medical research and analysis, especially      since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that      a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain.       (7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born      missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with      hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.       (8) In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or ablation      of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while      stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.       (9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for      pain processing in early development differ from those of      adults, using different neural elements available at specific      times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to      fulfill the role of pain processing.       (10) The position, asserted by some commentators, that the      unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that      precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent      with the documented reaction of unborn children to painful      stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who have      found it necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia      to prevent the unborn child from engaging in vigorous      movement in reaction to invasive surgery.       (11) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence      that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least      by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.       (12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a      compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of      unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical      evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.       (13) The compelling governmental interest in protecting the      lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial      medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling      pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the      compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of      unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither      governmental interest is intended to replace the other.       (14) Congress has authority to extend protection to pain-     capable unborn children under the Supreme Court's Commerce      Clause precedents and under the Constitution's grants of      powers to Congress under the Equal Protection, Due Process,      and Enforcement Clauses of the Fourteenth     3.

In making such a      determination, the physician shall make such inquiries of the      pregnant woman and perform or cause to be performed such      medical examinations and tests as a reasonably prudent      physician, knowledgeable about the case and the medical      conditions involved, would consider necessary to make an      accurate determination of post-fertilization age.       ``(2) Prohibition on performance of certain abortions.--       ``(A) Generally for unborn children 20 weeks or older.--     Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the abortion shall      not be performed or attempted, if the probable post-     fertilization age, as determined under paragraph (1), of the      unborn child is 20 weeks or greater.       ``(B) Exceptions.--Subparagraph (A) does not apply if--       ``(i) in reasonable medical judgment, the abortion is      necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman whose life is      endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or      physical injury, including a life-endangering physical      condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, but      not including psychological or emotional conditions;       ``(ii) the pregnancy is the result of rape against an adult      woman, and at least 48 hours prior to the abortion--       ``(I) she has obtained counseling for the rape; or       ``(II) she has obtained medical treatment for the rape or      an injury related to the rape;

994,topic-id,328,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, also known as Micah's  This bill prohibits most elective abortions at 20 weeks after fertilization and thereafter. That is the beginning of the fifth month of pregnancy. That is the point in a pregnancy when a substantial body of medical evidence shows that a baby in the womb can feel pain.  H.36 is humane legislation for innocent babies and for mothers. It includes exceptions for the life of the mother and exceptions in the case of rape and incest. Additionally, this bill imposes criminal liability only on the medical professional performing that abortion, not on the mother.  Mr.Speaker, there is broad consensus within the medical community babies at 5 months in the womb are not only able to feel pain, they can hear music. They can even respond to human voices.  America is one of only seven countries in the world that still allows elective late-term abortions, joining North Korea and  Today, we understand so much more about a baby's development during a pregnancy. Voluntarily terminating the life of an innocent baby when we know that baby can feel pain can no longer be acceptable, and a majority of Americans agree.  Hearts and minds are changing. How many of us have marveled at the vivid sonogram images of a soon-to-be-born son, niece, or grandchild? How many of us have been amazed and so very grateful that babies born early, as early as 20 weeks, have a very real chance of survival?                              {time}  1600  Mr.Speaker, this bill reflects today's medical understanding about a baby's ability to feel pain. Micah's Law reflects those changing hearts and minds of Micah's Law reflects the higher aspirations of this Nation, a truly moral nation, to foster a culture of life.

1024,topic-id,607,"Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy).  Mr.Madam Speaker, last week I had the pleasure of meeting a young boy named Micah He was cute and shy and, you know, as young boys often are, he would give me a high five, play around and run to where everybody had to catch him.  Now, he gave me this bracelet. You see, it says: ``Miracles for Micah.'' And you know what? He is a miracle. He is strong. He was born prematurely at only 20 weeks. He spent the first 128 days of his life in a neonatal intensive care unit.  Though he could fit in the palm of your hand, his parents couldn't hold him at first. His skin was so sensitive, the slightest touch would cause little Micah intensive pain. It didn't matter where he was. If he was in that intensive care unit, or if he was still waiting for that expected date to be born, he could feel, and he wanted to live.  The fact is that children at 20 weeks feel pain. Science increasingly shows it. The European Journal of Anesthesiology describes how it is critical to administer anesthesia during fetal surgery procedures.  You know, a standard text on human development, Patten's Foundations of Embryology, shows how the basics of the nervous system are formed by week 4.  Ronald Brusseau, of Boston's Children's Hospital, wrote that by week 18, children have developed sensory receptors for pain.  Two independent studies in 2006 used brain scans and showed unborn children respond to pain. These children have noses, eyes, and ears. You can hear their heartbeats and feel them move. They are human.  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act--I like to call it Micah's Law--is called what it is because children like Micah feel pain. Those children are strong, just like Micah is strong, and those children should be protected.  Now, I have to admit, Madam Speaker, across the aisle I do hear some beautiful speeches filled with compassion for the voiceless, the defenseless, and the marginalized. They are trying to speak for those who can't speak for themselves.  But what about Micah? What about the thousands of others like him, the same age he was born? What about the millions who were never given a chance?  Look into Micah's face--I think we all should--and tell me he isn't human. Look at him when he was born and tell me that child doesn't have a right to live.  We should care for the voiceless, for those whose cries of pain are never heard. We should care for the defenseless, for those who will only be saved if we act to protect them.  We should care for the marginalized, for those who have their very humanity denied, even as their noses, eyes, ears, and heartbeats, every movement are visible testaments of their lives.  These children need love. Their mothers need love. Let's end the pain. These children are suffering, so let's end the pain. These children want to live, so let's end their pain.  Micah is a beautiful kid, and there are millions of Micahs who will never smile; Micahs who will never walk; Micahs who will never scrape their knees and get into trouble; Micahs who will never learn to read; Micahs who will never fall in love and have children of their own; Micahs who will never have the chance to tell their mother and father: ``I love you.''  We will never know those Our lives are poorer because their lives were cut short. But there are more. Instead of pain--instead of pain--we should fill them with love.                              {time}  1645  ",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7712.txt,1E+14,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wade was upheld in the 1970s. We have made extraordinary medical advances. Today, we know with great certainty that babies in the womb, starting at the fifth month of pregnancy, do indeed feel pain.  It is extraordinarily heartbreaking when an unborn baby is diagnosed with a severe and life-threatening abnormality, still that baby deserves a right to life and right to dignity.  My sister was born with no esophagus and given little hope to live. By the grace of God and a miracle, within just weeks of her birth, a new technology, a new treatment came forward. Today, she is the proud mother of my two nieces.  Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. It is a just bill. It is a moral bill to do what we are called to do, not just as Americans but as human beings: to protect lives of the most innocent.

628,topic-id,1278,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my dear friend and colleague, Mr.Trent Franks, who is certainly a champion of our time in standing up for life, for our national defense, and has a heart so big that comes through in everything he does. And certainly, tonight, I think we see the gentleman's heart for unborn children, certainly at the beginning of 6 months of age, who deserve to live.  The gentleman's bill, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, also known as Micah's Law, will do that, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it tomorrow.  But tonight, Mr.Speaker, I want to share with you a heartwarming story that puts a face to what we are talking about. It is one thing to say 20 weeks old, a baby, unborn baby, but it is another thing to look at the picture of Micah Pickering--and his picture is up there, as well as up front.  Micah Pickering was born at 20 weeks' gestation. He was born at the age of which we are talking about that you are trying to say we should not allow for abortions at this stage because they can live, and Micah is a living example of that.  You know, I want to share a little bit about what his mother shared about his story, with Micah, her son. His mother's name is Danielle, and she recalled that when Micah was born, he cried twice immediately, and that was music to her ears and contrary to the worst case scenarios for which Micah's parents were bracing.  This is what Danielle talked about during those first few moments. She said: ``The second I was able to meet Micah changed my life. He was so small. I didn't know what to expect. Would he look normal? Could I bond with this baby? Those questions were a mess in my head as I was wheeled into his room 2 hours after his birth. The sight I saw was a perfectly formed[[Page H7656]]baby.'' At 20 weeks, at the beginning of 6 months, she says he was a perfectly formed baby.  ``Lots of tubes and monitors all set up to be an artificial womb to this baby born too soon. My husband and I stood there just staring at this beautiful little boy who we were told we couldn't hold, as the skin was so sensitive it would hurt him. We were told we could press lightly on the skin, so we each put our hand near him.  ``He''--the baby, Micah--``reached up and held our fingers. This was the strongest grasp I would ever feel. I never knew how strong a baby was until that moment. He had a powerful grip on our hands and now''--has a powerful grip on--``our hearts.''  This little miracle baby spent 4 months in intensive care. He underwent heart surgery 2 weeks after birth, weighing a little over a pound. He was on a ventilator for a while. He was on morphine to ease the pain, and this was the size of the diaper that he wore.                              {time}  1945  Isn't that incredible?  But he wore a diaper that size, and this little preemie, when he was born, he was the size of an M&M package. It is hard to believe that a baby could be that small and live, but that is about the size of a baby at this age, 20 weeks old, the beginning of 6 months, and he lived. His name is Now he is a healthy, energetic kindergarten student.  Micah's story is beautiful. It is a miracle. And we thank God for Micah's fighting spirit, for his parents' unwavering love for their son, and for the team of doctors, nurses, surgeons, and medical professionals who tended to Micah during those first few months.  But the point about Micah is he puts a face on this that, from the moment of conception to the birth of a child, the growth and development of the baby is miraculous. With advances in medical science, we can better understand what is happening at each stage of development.  When these little babies are just 4 weeks old, the basics of their nervous system are developed. By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, and that is the age of the gentleman's bill, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling.  We know that by the 20th week, the beginning of the sixth month, unborn babies, children the same age as Micah when he was born, respond to painful stimuli by flinching and jerking, just like you and I would if we were burned or hurt in some way.  Micah's parents were told that they could not hold their little son, that it would be too painful for the newborn. But babies at this stage are actually hyperresponsive to pain since the neurological features that inhibit or regulate pain sensations do not develop until much later in pregnancy.  Certainly, these babies should not undergo this pain and, certainly, not have to have their life snuffed out through abortion. When a mother and her unborn baby undergo a surgical procedure, doctors give fetal pain medication, or fetal anesthesia to the baby so that he or she does not feel the procedure. This is common practice. It is common sense.  The legislation before the House tomorrow will ensure that unborn children are not subjected to the excruciating pain of being euthanized in the womb. And this is where I wish the story could end, that all children be given a fighting chance like But that is not the case for too many children whose lives are taken from them before they can take their first breath.  Late-term abortion procedures, abortions performed on babies 20 weeks and later in pregnancies, are graphic, detestable, and, tragically, allowed in this country.  In a dissent opinion that Representative Smith just shared, and I want to share it again, Justice Kennedy offered the insight into this grizzly practice. He said: ``The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or born child would: it bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb.''  Aborted, unborn babies endure unspeakable pain in the most horrific manner possible. Knowing that innocent 20-week babies acutely experience pain and endure inhuman dismemberment or poisoning should be enough to pierce each of our hearts and prick our sensibilities.  Micah's Law, the legislation that would protect the lives of unborn children halfway through pregnancy because of their ability to feel pain, is our call to action.  In closing, Mr.Speaker, I would like to leave you with the words of Micah's mom as she watched her tiny infant grow into the child he is today, and it speaks to the potential of every one of these children that we hope from now on will have a chance to live like She said: ``He still had his eyes fused shut. You could see his chest vibrate from the ventilators. It was heartbreaking. Here was a boy who we would see get to take his first sneeze, his first smile. We would get to see the hiccups from the outside. We would watch his eyes slowly unfuse. We would watch his hair grow in and we would watch his body develop. It was indescribably the most joyful time of our life.''  So as we anticipate tomorrow's historic vote, I ask my colleagues to lend their support for Micah and thousands of children just like him who want to live, who want to experience life, and who have so much to give.

Twenty weeks post-fertilization is an incredible milestone in pregnancy for moms and their unborn babies. Children at this stage in development have fingers and toes, and they have well-developed neurological structures that can feel pain. In fact, babies at this age are hypersensitive, feeling pain more acutely than you and me.  Preemies, children born at the beginning of the sixth month, just like Micah, can survive outside the womb. These babies are the future doctors, nurses, scientists, teachers, law enforcement officers in our country.  H.36 protects this next generation of America's children. Our country is unified in protecting life at 20 weeks. Six in ten Americans support the pain-capable legislation, and 20 States have passed similar legislation.

226,topic-id,2311,"Madam President, last week I joined with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the National Economic Council, our Senate majority leader, the Speaker of the House, and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in releasing a unified framework for tax reform.  This is a big step in the ongoing effort to overhaul our Nation's miserable Tax I have been in the Senate awhile, and I can only remember a few times when the White House and the House and Senate leadership were in agreement on an issue as complicated as tax reform so the current state of affairs is pretty remarkable. Still, as we made clear in the framework document, this is only a step; it is not a final product.  The House and the Senate tax-writing committees will be tasked with putting together legislation that is aimed at meeting the goals and principles that are outlined in the framework. Therefore, as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, my top goal at the moment is to produce a comprehensive tax reform bill that can get at least 14 votes in the committee because, without that, there likely will not be any tax reform. Yet, before we can get to that point, we have to pass the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution.  Make no mistake, the budget resolution is critical to our tax reform efforts. If we are going to move a tax reform vehicle in the current environment, we need a resolution in place with a workable reconciliation instruction that will allow us to produce a bill of sufficient size and scope to give middle-class taxpayers a pay raise, grow our economy, and create more American jobs.  As we all know, the Budget Committee will begin marking up its resolution later today, and it will include the type of instruction we need in order to produce a bill that will fix our broken tax system, boost economic growth, and give a pay raise to middle-class  I am grateful for the leadership of Chairman Enzi and all of our colleagues on the Budget Committee for their work in crafting the resolution, and I urge everyone who supports tax reform, whether he is in Congress or elsewhere, to support the budget resolution.  Once again, that is the next big step in this process, and it is an absolutely essential step. Once that is done, the Finance Committee will be able to move forward on crafting and marking up a tax reform bill.  Some have said tax reform is a do-or-die moment for the I wholeheartedly believe that to be true, not just because we might lose an election or that our poll numbers might go down, it is that Republicans have promised, for some time now, that we will deliver meaningful, comprehensive tax reform that will spur economic growth, increase wages and well-paying jobs, and simplify our existing system. We need to deliver on that promise and not just because we will suffer politically if we do not. We need to deliver because the cost of doing nothing--the cost of maintaining the status quo for the foreseeable future--will be too much for the American people and our economy to bear.  The last major overhaul of our Tax Code was 31 years ago, and in many respects, our current tax system was built for the economy of 1986 and is ill-suited for the needs of today. In the last 31 years, we have seen a dramatic increase in international trade and expanded globalization. We have seen the fall of the Soviet Union and the collapse of most centrally run economies, and of course we have seen the development and rapid expansion of the internet, which has, in many respects, remade the entire world several times over.  America no longer has a competitive Tax Instead, we have a Byzantine system with exceptionally high rates and an array of overlapping and often less-than-effective deductions, exclusions, and credits. This is not just a parade of horribles trotted out by Republicans, these problems have been acknowledged by a number of prominent Democrats, like Presidents Clinton and Obama, not to mention our current Senate minority leader and the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator  We all know the system is not working. Still, in many respects, we have politics as usual around here when we talk about tax reform. While both parties have supported reforms in the recent past, including a number of reforms that are included in the framework, we are already hearing the same, tired arguments that come up every time Republicans want to talk about tax reform.  According to the opponents of reform, our ``plan'' will cut taxes on the superrich. Our ``plan'' will raise taxes on the poor. Our ``plan'' will harm the middle class. Our ``plan'' is a giveaway to greedy corporations. These are some pretty odd claims given that as of right now, no completed ``plan'' exists. We have a framework, and we are not calling it that simply for PR reasons. We have some basic principles and targets that the leaders have agreed upon, but as the framework makes clear, the Finance and Ways and Means Committees have been tasked with filling in the details and writing legislation.  Here are just some of the details that are not included in the framework:  Income thresholds for individual tax brackets. The framework includes rate targets for three brackets, but the breakdown of those brackets is still to be determined.  The size of the enhanced Child Tax The framework anticipates an increase, but it does not specify an amount.[[Page S6302]]  The existence and rate of the highest bracket. Our document leaves room for the creation of a fourth bracket at the high end, but it does not include any rate target.  Safeguards to prevent abuse of the separate passthrough rates.  These are just some of the key details that need to be filled in.  My point is, no one can make any definitive statements or make any credible estimates about the fiscal impact of the plan until the committees do more work. Still, that has not stopped people from trying.  Last week, the left-leaning Tax Policy Center released an unattributed ``analysis'' of the framework that appeared to confirm a number of blanket claims that critics have made about our ``plan.'' As we all know, left-leaning pundits, liberal media outlets, and many of our friends on the other side seem to love the TPC, apparently because the TPC is willing to provide estimates and analysis about tax plans without waiting for all of the boring details.  We all remember well when the TPC wrote Mitt Romney's tax plan for him and claimed that he wanted to raise taxes on the middle class to finance a tax cut for the top 1 percent. Their analysis of the Romney plan--a plan that was not yet in existence beyond a broad set of principles--became the gospel for our friends on the other side, and their estimates were repeated time and again; never mind the fact that they did not have nearly enough evidence to support their assertions.  The TPC appears to be on the same track with regard to the unified framework. I guess they think they can get away with it again. Maybe they can. I don't know. The TPC's document from last week included a relatively precise estimate of lost revenue that they claim would result from the framework. It also estimated how much of the tax benefit of the framework would go to the top 1 percent of earners, again with a fair amount of precision. How they got to these results is, certainly, to me, a mystery.  There is simply no way for the TPC or anyone to deliver these kinds of specific estimates with the information that is provided in the framework. To get their estimates, they filled in blanks with numbers from other proposals, added a pile of exceptionally pessimistic and biased economic assumptions, and came up with a tax plan that, for all intents and purposes, is their own. Just because they say this analysis was performed on the unified framework and was not just a plan they made up themselves does not suddenly make their estimates credible.  Still, I expect to hear a lot about the TPC's ``analysis'' in the coming weeks. Some will treat their estimates as fact, and I expect we will see them cited in a few campaign commercials before too long. Breaking from any notion of professional accountability, the TPC's ``analysis'' was, according to the TPC's report, authored by the TPC's staff. Evidently, no one in an organization that describes itself as ``nonpartisan'' wanted to put their name on a document that would be used in such a partisan manner, but let's be clear. We cannot separate this kind of speculative ``analysis'' from the way it is being used by our friends on the other side. It has become fodder for more of the same partisan attacks.  In going forward, I hope the TPC and other think tanks will acknowledge the still undefined features of the framework, including the commitment to maintaining the current progressivity of the Tax Code, which will require adjustments in order to achieve. I think groups like the TPC can be helpful if they avoid the partisan criticisms and focus on shedding light and providing accurate assessments of various proposals. Everyone who has an interest in these issues should wait and let the tax-writing committees do their work.  In the Finance Committee, we are going to write a committee bill. Any Member who is sincerely interested in working with us will get a chance to contribute, whether he is a Republican or We are going to have a markup during which the bill will be debated and amended in the light of the day. Thereafter, I expect that we will have a fair and open amendment process on the floor. Despite some odd claims to the contrary, the Joint Committee on Taxation will score the bill.  At the end of the day, people will be free to disagree with the final bill and to vote against it, but no one will be able to credibly claim that the legislation was written behind closed doors or that the American people did not get a chance to see what was in the bill and read accurate accounts of its fiscal and economic impacts.  I want to work with anyone who is willing to come to the table in good faith. I think the framework puts forward a number of general proposals that both parties can support. There is fertile ground for bipartisanship here if my Democratic colleagues are willing to set aside some of the unreasonable preconditions that they have put on their involvement in tax reform. The last time I checked, both Republicans and Democrats supported tax relief for low- and middle-income families. The last time I checked, reducing our uncompetitive corporate tax rate was a bipartisan objective. The last time I checked, both Republican and Democratic voters were in need of higher wages, more jobs, and a more competitive economy.  This is going to be a difficult process, whether it is bipartisan or partisan. There is a long list of sacred cows in our Tax Code, each of them with a constituency that will fight to keep them in place. We are going to have to eliminate a number of tax deductions and credits if we are going to be fiscally responsible, including a number of provisions that are, under the current system, pretty popular in certain segments of the country. The framework specifies two deductions that should stay in place because they benefit many in the middle class and they are designed to achieve important policy goals. Everything else is currently on the table, including items that I have personally championed in the past.  We have already seen stories about how Republicans are already divided on the fate of the State and local tax deduction. Make no mistake--that is a pretty popular deduction, particularly among Democrats, but it has some Republican supporters as well. I would remind my colleagues who are adamant about preserving the State and local tax deduction that the benefits of that particular provision skew heavily toward higher income earners, especially those living in high-tax cities and So if our main goal is to help the middle class, I would hope that there won't be many Senators who will fall on their swords in order to keep this particular deduction in place.  Still, nothing is set in stone, and most items are currently still up for negotiation. The State and local tax deduction is, like virtually every other tax provision, currently on the table, and we may very well have to pare it back one way or the other. We need to see how the numbers work out before we can speak definitively on this or any other tax policy item.  Before I conclude, let me just say that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. There is currently more momentum in favor of tax reform than at any other time in the past three decades. All of us should be willing to take advantage of this opportunity. All of us should be able to give in order to get a final bill done that will make sense and will get us back on track. I am hopeful that we can have a bipartisan effort here, but whether we do or don't, I intend to see that we get tax reform done and that we get it done in the best interest of our country, the best interest of our people, and above all, the best interest of the middle class.

Today, I wish to pay tribute to Elder Hales as we remember a life well-lived.  Elder Hales was born on August 4, 1932, to Rulon and Vera He grew up on Long Island in a diverse neighborhood, which allowed him to become familiar with a variety of different cultures. Although raised on the east coast, Elder Hales always maintained strong western roots. He would speak fondly of the summers he spent in Utah bailing hay, riding horses, tending sheep, and herding cattle in the mountain pastures. Although Elder Hales would later become an accomplished businessman, he was no stranger to manual labor, and he credited his early days working on the farm as the source of his strong work ethic.  During his teenage years, Elder Hales distinguished himself as a student and excelled as a pitcher for his high school baseball team.  After enrolling at the University of Utah, he returned home to New York for the summer and met Mary It was love at first sight. They married a year later in the Salt Lake Temple on June 10, 1953.  Following his graduation from college, Elder Hales joined the U.Air Force, where he served as a fighter pilot. His squadron's motto was ``Return With Honor.'' In his own words, ``The motto was a constant reminder to us of our determination to return to home base with honor after we had expended all of our efforts to successfully complete every aspect of our mission.''  ``Return With Honor'' would become the credo by which Elder Hales lived his life, expending every effort as a faith leader, father, and friend to better himself, bless others, and build the Kingdom of  Yesterday afternoon, after decades of dedicated service as a minister of Jesus Christ, he completed his mortal mission and returned with honor to our heavenly home. The challenge he leaves behind is for all of us to do the same.  To the very end, Elder Hales was a model of selfless service. Even in his later years, beset by illness and old age, he continued to carry out the responsibilities of his apostolic office without hesitation and without complaint. Elder Hales decided when he was still a young man that he would never let anything get in the way of his church service.  Following his career in the Air Force, Elder Hales enrolled at Harvard Business School, where he was called to serve as Elders Quorum president, one of the most demanding leadership positions in the LDS Because of his heavy course load, Elder Hales could have easily declined the calling, but he gladly accepted it. His wife Mary guided him in making this decision. When Elder Hales said he might fail his classes if he agreed to serve as the Elders Quorum president, Mary said:       Bob, I would rather have an active priesthood holder than a      man who holds a master's degree from We'll do both.  With Mary's unwavering support, Elder Hales served successfully as an Elders Quorum president in addition to earning his He would later go on to work as a high-level executive at multiple national corporations.  From this formative experience, Bob and Mary learned that God would provide for them as long as they put the gospel first. That is why Elder Hales did not hesitate to leave his business career behind when he was called to serve as a mission president and later as an apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Elder Hales provided a model of servant-leadership for all of us to follow. He was a true disciple of Jesus Christ, putting the welfare of others before self and the Kingdom of God above all. He was gracious and loving, thoughtful and kind. In all things, Elder Hales exemplified humanity and humility, which was the hallmark of his life.  While millions of us grieve his passing, we take peace and comfort in knowing that his service continues on the other side.  I knew him very well, played golf with him, thought he was one of the great men in my life. I am going to pay tribute to him and his family here today in front of the whole United States Senate and the country. He was one of the most worthwhile people I ever met. We are going to miss him.                 Reform of Criminal Intent Requirements  Mr.President, with the time I have remaining, I wish to address an issue that remains critically important as well--overcriminalization and the need to reform criminal intent requirements in our Federal criminal code.  Like many of my colleagues, I believe Congress has criminalized far too much conduct and has mandated overly harsh penalties for too many crimes. A number of my colleagues have sought to address these problems by cutting prison sentences, altering statutory minimums, or releasing prisoners early for good behavior. But as we seek to reform the criminal justice system, we must be careful not to overlook one of the major roots of the problem: the lack of adequate criminal intent requirements in Federal statutes.  ``Mens rea'' is a Latin phrase meaning guilty mind. One of the time-honored, fundamental features of our criminal law is that for a person to be found guilty of a crime, he or she must have committed the act with criminal intent or mens rea. In the English common law, this principle was summarized in the idea that the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty. Mens rea requirements protect individuals who commit an illegal act without knowing that their action was wrong or unlawful.  To give an example, a person who mistakenly retrieves the wrong coat from a coatroom does not become a thief merely because he took something that wasn't his but looked like his. Only if he knows that the coat belongs to someone else does he commit a criminal act.  Unfortunately, many of our current criminal laws and regulations contain inadequate mens rea requirements, and some contain no mens rea requirement at all. This leaves individuals--innocent individuals--subject and vulnerable to prosecution for conduct they believed to be lawful at the time.  In recent years, as Congress and Federal agencies have criminalized more behavior, they have often been vague about mens rea requirements or even silent about mens rea altogether.  In a 2014 Tennessee Law Review article, Michael Cottone investigated how many Federal criminal statutes there are in the U.code. Mr.Cottone explained that ``tellingly, no exact count of the number of federal statutes that impose criminal sanctions has ever been given.'' Most scholars agree that there are approximately 5,000 Federal statutes that impose criminal sanctions, but those criminal statutes do not include the nearly 300,000 Federal regulations that also carry criminal penalties.  With so many criminal laws on the books, it is far too easy for Americans to break Federal laws unwittingly, with no understanding whatsoever that their behavior happens to be illegal. For example, did you know it is a Federal crime to write a check for an amount of less than $1 or that it is a Federal crime to allow a pet to make a noise that frightens wildlife on Federal land? Even more incredibly, did you know it is a Federal crime to keep a pet on a leash that exceeds 6 feet in length on Federal land?  These are only a few examples of unlawful activities that reasonable people could not reasonably be expected to know. What is worse, many of these unlawful activities are punishable by time in prison. This is not only ridiculous, but it is immoral. The lack of adequate mens rea requirements in our Federal criminal code subjects innocent people to unjustified punishment.  To address this issue, I reintroduced the Mens Rea Reform Act of 2017. Today I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society for highlighting the need for mens rea reform[[Page S6239]]and for supporting my efforts to protect innocent people. They are not the only ones. Anybody who looks at this has to say: Are we going to send people to jail when they didn't know what they were doing was wrong? It makes anybody stop and think: Is that right? Should we do that? Is that fair?  Likewise, I wish to thank Senators Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and David Perdue for joining me as cosponsors on this bill. Our bill sets a default intent requirement of willfulness for all Federal criminal offenses that lack an intent requirement. Additionally, the bill defines willfulness to mean that a person acted with knowledge that his or her conduct was unlawful.  Naturally, our bill does not apply to any offenses that Congress clearly intended to be strict liability offenses. Our proposal has garnered widespread support from a variety of organizations, including the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Koch Industries, the Federal Defenders, the U.Chamber of Commerce, and the Heritage Foundation--just to name a few.  Importantly, our bill does not remove any crimes from the books, nor does it override any existing mens rea standards written in statute. Moreover, it does not limit Congress's authority to create new criminal offenses, including strict liability offenses.  Mens rea really is a simple issue. Individuals should not be threatened with prison time for accidentally committing a crime or for engaging in an activity they did not know was wrong. If Congress wants to criminalize an activity and does not want to include any sort of criminal intent requirement, Congress should have to specify in statute that it is creating a strict liability offense.  I believe this simple legislative solution will go a long way in reducing harsh sentences for morally innocent offenders. It will also push back against the overcriminalization of innocent behavior. As I have said many times, any consideration of criminal justice reform or sentencing reform is incomplete without reforms to mens rea requirements.                      Foreign Judicial Proceedings  Mr.President, on a final note, I wish to express my concern about a provision in U.law that allows foreign litigants to come into U.courts and gain access to documents and other evidence for use in foreign judicial proceedings.  Under current provision, 28 U.S.1782, an American citizen can be subjected to invasive requests by a foreign entity even when the citizen has no ability under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction to obtain similar information from the foreign entity itself. This gives foreign entities an unfair advantage over their U.counterparts.  Equally problematic, U.persons may be compelled under Federal law to turn over business information or trade secrets for use in Federal judicial proceedings without any guarantee that such information will be adequately protected in the foreign jurisdiction. This places U.businesses at risk and, again, creates an unfair playing field.  Such unfairness and lack of reciprocity is deeply concerning. Our laws should not disadvantage our own citizens and companies. Rather, we should ensure a level playing field.  In the coming weeks, I will be introducing legislation to do just that. These are important bills, and these are important ideas. I appreciate having this time to be able to express them for the country at large.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

122,topic-id,760,"Mr.President, I am really proud to come to the floor today to join my fellow Senator from New Mexico, Tom Udall, to recognize the life and service of the longest serving Senator from our incredible State of New Mexico, Senator Pete  Senator Domenici dedicated his entire life to the State and to the people he loved. He served our State in the Senate for 36 years. His decades of service to New Mexico left a lasting impact that will continue to be felt in every corner of our State for many years to come. Many in New Mexico called him Saint Pete because of how relentlessly he fought on the Appropriations and Budget Committees to secure resources for the people of New We can still see the fruits of his labors at our State's National Labs, at our military installations, at our colleges and universities, and in water systems and community centers all over our That is because, while he worked on the forefront of major policy debates here in the Senate, Pete Domenici always put the interests of New Mexico above all else.  Like myself, Senator Domenici's first public service experience came on Albuquerque's City Council, then called the City And, at least in my experience, I know that working at that local level was an invaluable way to learn how to hear from diverse viewpoints and stakeholders and find ways to build consensus and get the results for your constituents that you hope to achieve. I have tried to bring that approach with me into the Senate, and I know that Senator Domenici was, in part, so successful because of the skills he learned there.  I am grateful for the example Senator Domenici set for all of us here in this body on how to advance important and complex policy goals in Washington with civility for our colleagues. Republicans and Democrats alike who worked with him on issues like the budget, energy, national defense, nuclear deterrence, and mental health parity still point to his dedication to bipartisan cooperation and compromise.  Although they didn't always see eye to eye, Senator Domenici, a Republican, and Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat, who served New Mexico alongside him for the vast majority of his time in the Senate, always made a point of improving the lives of New Mexicans by working together. It set a great example for people like me to watch how the two of them worked together. Their spirit of cooperation across party lines is still present in our State's congressional delegation, and I believe Senator Domenici's focus on putting policy results above party politics still resonates today.  One of the greatest examples of this was Senator Domenici's work alongside two progressive Democratic lions of the Senate--Paul Wellstone and Ted Kennedy--to pass mental health parity legislation. Senators Domenici and Wellstone didn't agree on many issues, but they found they both had close, personal experience with and a passion for mental health parity. Both Senators had close family members who had experienced the great challenges of finding a way to pay for mental health treatment. Insurance companies were not required to cover mental health and addiction treatment in those days in the same way they covered treatment for so many other illnesses and diseases. Because of that, most insurance companies simply didn't cover these essential services at all.  Starting in the mid-1990s, Senators Domenici and Wellstone worked together with mental health advocates to advance legislation to finally change that.  After Senator Wellstone was killed in a tragic plane crash, Senator Domenici kept up the fight for 6 more years with a new partner in Senator The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was finally passed in October of 2008, only a few months before Senator Domenici's retirement from the  That is the type of bipartisanship, legacy, and statesmanship on behalf of the American people that I hope we will all remember for a long, long time to come. We should all try better to keep that spirit alive in the Senate today.  I join all New Mexicans and all Americans in mourning the passing of Senator Pete Our thoughts, our deepest condolences, and our prayers are with his wife Nancy and all of his family and loved ones at this time of great loss, for their family and for the I am certain that Senator Domenici's legacy will not be forgotten in New Mexico and will not be forgotten in the U.

1102,topic-id,2793,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss and bring awareness to the obligation that we have to never forget what is happening to way too many Native American women in this country.  For too long, the disproportionate incidents of violence against Native American women have gone unnoticed, unreported, or underreported, and it is time to address this issue head-on. That is what I intend to do today and in the remaining days of my time in the Senate, until we actually get a bill passed.  There is no official database or requirement for information collection regarding the number of missing and murdered Native women. In most cases, the only records of them are records that have been provided to us by the families and friends of the victims. It is critical that Congress push the U.Department of Justice and the FBI to work with Tribal communities to come up with culturally appropriate protocols for responding to cases of missing and murdered Native women.  I would like to take this time to honor Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, whose story has been told on the news in North Dakota and nationally and who has been on the forefront of my mind since introducing this bill.  On August 19, Savanna, a 22-year-old member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who was 8 months pregnant, went upstairs to her neighbor's apartment in Fargo, ND, after being invited to try on a dress for alterations. While she was there, what awaited her in that apartment were truly horrific acts of violence. Although Savanna's baby daughter survived and is now safe with her father and grandparents, that was the last time anyone who loved Savanna saw her alive.  After 8 days of searching for Savanna by the family and the community, her body was finally found by chance by kayakers in a nearby river. Her body was wrapped in plastic and duct taped. Her death was an incredible tragedy and, unfortunately, one that happens way too often to Native women.  While the news of Savanna's death was heard around the world, thousands of indigenous women are murdered and disappear each year, with many of those cases being ignored or forgotten.  Over my decades in public service, I have worked with Tribal communities on issues that involve violence against Native women. In response to those talks and to this latest tragedy, today I am introducing legislation that would help tackle the barriers to bringing justice for missing and murdered Native women across the country.  My bill, which is named after Savanna, would work to improve Tribal access to Federal databases for missing persons. It would promote interjurisdictional collaboration by establishing protocols for responding to cases of missing and murdered Native Americans, and it would require the collection of data related to missing and murdered Native women.  Native women are an inherently vulnerable population whose voices are still not heard by most people in power. Across rural North Dakota, women living on reservations face unique challenges when dealing with violence. Lack of access to emergency services, lack of access to law enforcement officers, lack of access to an AMBER Alert system, and confidential victim services that are not provided--these all act as barriers to women getting the help that they desperately need.  Unfortunately, there is no official database or mandated database collection on the total number of missing and murdered Native women in our country. This has added to not knowing what the actual magnitude of this epidemic really is and has resulted in several Tribal members sending me stories and handwritten lists of the names of missing and murdered women that people have gathered just from their collective memory.  I would like to share some of the stories that I have been so honored to receive from family members. Telling these stories--and giving me the ability to tell these stories--is not easy because every time you tell the story, you relive the story. These tragedies still hurt deeply. Even years after the murder, they still absolutely relive that experience. I know they have given me these stories to tell for one simple reason: because they pray and they hope and they dream that giving me these stories may change the outcome for some other family.  I am going to start by talking about these wonderful women--these beautiful women. Up at the far right-hand corner with her beautiful baby is Stella Marie Trottier-Stella Marie was born and grew up in Belcourt, ND, and was a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of She spent many years traveling the world with her husband, who served in the U.Air Force, and their three children. The family lived in Florida, Germany, Japan, and Everywhere they went, Stella quickly made friends and proudly shared her Chippewa culture. She was loved and adored by all who met her for living an adventurous and fearless life.  In July 2009, Stella and her family moved back to Belcourt, ND, and she started to attend Turtle Mountain Community On September 16, 2010, Stella and her cousin were at the local bar when she decided to stay behind with other people they knew. According to witnesses, Stella left with another couple to continue the evening out.  Stella's body was later found in a male Tribal member's pickup in an open field on the reservation. It wasn't until 13 days later that the family was officially notified by law enforcement of Stella's death.  Throughout the investigation, there were a lot of rumors and misinformation, which made it difficult to find the murderer or the murderers. People who were with Stella the night of her death said that they were never questioned, and information provided was never followed up on. No one has ever been charged or convicted for this murder, and the last hours of Stella's life remain unknown.  Stella was an incredible woman who was loved by all who knew her. Her family, her children, and her Tribe deserve justice.  Monica Wickre is pictured here with those beautiful earrings and the red[[Page S6364]]shirt. Monica was a 42-year-old mother of three who was born and raised in Belcourt on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa reservation and lived near Aberdeen,  After a night out with friends on April 7, 1993, Monica never returned home. Her relatives grew concerned when they had not heard from or seen Monica for several days. Eventually, the family filed a missing persons report and started to talk to friends and neighbors. The detective assigned to the case worked closely with the community and the family and assured them he was working diligently on this case.  In June of that year, a canoeist found Monica's badly decomposed body in the James River outside Throughout the next several years, new detectives were assigned to the case, each having to basically start over and work with limited notes, interviews, and evidence from the previous investigators. A couple of times, the police told the family that they had a suspect or were close to arresting someone for Monica's murder, but there was never enough information to charge the suspect. This has resulted in nearly 25 years of heartache for Monica's family and her friends.  Monica's family wants justice for their daughter, sister, and mother, and they all want closure. Although the case is no longer active, the family continues to bring awareness about Monica's case in the hope that someone will come forward with information that will, in fact, help solve it.  Monica Lisa Two Eagle is the woman with the dark hair in the floral print shirt. She was a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and one of 14 children. She was kind, caring, and athletic. In the winter of 1979, Phil Two Eagle saw his sister Mona Lisa, who was in her early twenties, leave the siblings' house and get into a red-and-white pickup with a couple of men. Mona Lisa never returned.  In the following days, the family and local law enforcement searched for her on horseback. Taking it upon themselves, they searched for her on horseback. About 2 weeks after she went missing, Mona Lisa's father and brother found her frozen in a pasture near their home. She had been beaten, possibly raped, and left alone in a blizzard. Rumors ran wild that family and law enforcement tried to solve the crime, but, even to this day, no one was ever convicted or even charged. The two men who were last seen with Mona Lisa all those years ago are still running free, while the family lives every day with the lack of justice.  Lakota Rae Renville, the woman in the black-and-white photo, is the last victim I want to talk about. I want to thank her family, who are here today and who have honored me and trusted me with her memory. I want to help them understand how grateful I am, but I also want them to know that sharing her story will help raise awareness about the crimes of missing and murdered indigenous people.  Lakota was a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota Bands of North and South Dakota, who, despite being shy and reserved, had a solid group of friends who supported her and even helped her excel in school. After graduation, Lakota spent time taking care of her family, especially her nieces and nephews.  In 2005 Lakota met a man online and unexpectedly relocated to Missouri, unbeknownst to her family. With most details still unknown 12 years later, the family is left with more questions than answers. What they do know is that she was forced into sex trafficking and manipulated against her will.  In October of 2005, Lakota's family was called and told that her body was found badly beaten, wrapped in carpet padding and a blanket in an open gravel pit in Local investigators brought in and subsequently let go dozens of suspects and, to this day, have not brought her murderer to justice.  Lakota was never given a chance to become a mother or pursue that bright future that surely lay ahead of her. She was robbed of a life she had yet to experience, a life that was certain to be filled with love from her family and deep appreciation from her family.  These are not isolated cases. This goes on every day in  I want to make a point of how discouraging it, so many times, when you see events unfolding where it may be that a young girl goes missing in a Caribbean island and the world is turned upside down looking for her or when we hear a story of someone who comes from maybe a more affluent and wealthy family who goes missing and we turn over every stone to find them. Yet that is not the story for very many indigenous women.  When you look at the importance of what we do today, probably the most important thing we can do is to tell these stories, and from telling these stories we have an opportunity to really change. We can't ignore that frequently for Native people, they are not wrong to believe that they are the forgotten people of this country. Way too often, the first Americans become the last  Under the Savanna's Act, the Attorney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, must consult with the Tribes on how to improve Tribal access to Federal criminal information databases, such as the National Crime Information Center and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons We need to ensure that Tribal law enforcement has up-to-date information on missing Native women and better communication--in fact, essential--with Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and Tribal law enforcement agencies so cases like the ones you have heard of today don't go unnoticed or uninvestigated.  Jurisdictional issues are a huge barrier in Indian Country to responding to and prosecuting crimes committed on Tribal lands. Standardized protocols must be established in order to give a quicker response to Native women going missing. The complexity of jurisdiction on Tribal lands can slow down an investigation, but it is not an excuse. It can waste crucial time at the beginning of an investigation or a case, but it is not an excuse. If we do not act rapidly, we know we lose precious time to prevent homicides and to bring a woman safely home and help apprehend the perpetrators.  In one case study alone done by the National Institute of Justice, 97 percent of Native women experience violence by a non-Native perpetrator. This number emphasizes what I have long said, that historical trauma is a major factor of violence against Native women, and perpetrators feel that Tribal lands give them a free pass from the law. This can no longer be tolerated, and jurisdictional issues must be addressed. It cannot be the excuse for inaction.  Although we don't know the total number of missing and murdered Native women, it is clear, from all of the stories and from the statistics that we do have, that the rates at which Native American women experience violence is intrinsically related to the likelihood of their going missing, being murdered, and forced into sex trafficking.  Here are just some of the statistics collected by the National Institute of Justice, the Government Accountability Office, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding violence against Native women. In 2016, 5,712 cases of missing Native women were reported to the National Crime Information Center, and 125 of those cases were in my State of Dakota alone. On some reservations, Native women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average. I want to repeat that. On some reservations, Native women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average.  American Indians and Alaskan Natives are two times more likely to experience rape or sexual assault compared to all other races.  In 2010, we found that the U.attorneys declined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of violent crime that occurred in Indian Homicide is the third leading cause of death among American Indians and Alaskan Native women between 10 and 24 years old.  These high rates of violence, including domestic violence, sex assault, and human trafficking, must stop. We must work together to combat domestic violence and human trafficking in Indian  Just last week, the Indian Affairs Committee held a hearing to discuss the lack of services provided for Indian Country regarding the horrific acts of violence and human trafficking of Native women. Just yesterday, while questioning one of the officials at the Department of the Interior about the need to do training in human trafficking at our casinos, he simply said:[[Page S6365]]I thought you were going to ask me about Indian gaming. I quickly said: I am asking you about Indian gaming because all of this works together.  If we do not work together in every institution of the Federal Government, in every institution of the State government, and in every institution of Tribal government, we will never make progress in providing the security that we have in this building, and the security that we enjoy as White women will never be realized for women living on the reservation in Indian We cannot let this continue.  There are countless more stories like Savanna's, Stella's, Mona Lisa's, Monica's, and Lakota's that we will never know. It is time for Congress to recognize this epidemic and take action to prevent these stories and find out just how many stories there really are. It is time to give voice to these voiceless women. It is time to bring their perpetrators to justice and give a voice to the families who are struggling even today--sometimes decades later--to understand how this can happen in They seem to be second-class citizens.  I think that is what we know. I am working with very many of my colleagues on the other side. This isn't a partisan issue.  I have been joined by my wonderful colleague from the great State of I think the first time we ever met, this was the topic of conversation: What is the security for Indian children, security for Indian women, and Alaskan Native women? We knew because both of us have traveled extensively in our States and spent a lot of time in the indigenous populations.  When family members ask us why this is happening, we frequently don't have an answer.  I know that in my State jurisdictional issues provide some barriers to actually getting this done, but that is an excuse. We need to do better.  With that, I want to yield the floor to my wonderful colleague from the great State of Alaska, who once again is joining me and leading her side of the aisle to bring attention to these issues.

271,topic-id,717,"Mr.Speaker, we all awoke yesterday to a grim but familiar ritual. As we looked at our phones, we saw that dozens of people had been slaughtered in Las Vegas by a madman with a gun.  For the victims, the survivors, and their families, this is a nightmare come true, and my heart goes out to them and to the first responders and to the many people who rushed to help in that hellish situation. But now what?  The question can't be escaped, and it hits particularly hard those of us who live in the shadow of Sandy Hook, years ago, where 20 babies were killed, and we thought that that would be enough to cause this Congress to act--to act for sanity, to act for commonsense, to act for life. But it wasn't. And neither was Orlando, neither was San Bernardino, and now neither, I fear, will be the horrendous massacre in Las  Let's be clear that no other tragedy that we face, not terrorists flying into buildings, not hurricanes which render entire islands without power and without hope, cause us to say: This is not a time to address this problem.  We ask ourselves: What can we do better? What can we learn? How can we stop this? Except on this issue. Orlando--Congress does nothing; Sandy Hook, 20 dead children--Congress does nothing; now Las  What is happening right now is that conversations are happening in offices to figure out what the decent interval of time is between the deaths in Las Vegas and when we can introduce a bill that will make it easier for people to buy silencers. Not even the near fatal attack on one of our own, my friend Stephen Scalise, was enough to cause us to seriously consider what we might do to staunch the flow of blood that characterizes this country, and this country alone.  Let's be clear. Let's be very clear about what we can do and what we don't want to do.  First of all, to all those who are listening to this and saying, ``They just want to take away my guns,'' no, we do not. I and those of us who stand for gun safety respect the Second Many of us enjoy hunting. Many of us enjoy target practice. Many of us believe that perhaps you are safer if you can defend yourself. We have no interest in taking away anybody's guns.  We have interest in at least two things that have the virtue of being supported by the vast majority of Americans: universal background checks, the simple idea that, if you are going to exercise your Second Amendment rights and buy a weapon, we should check to see if you are violent, if you are a terrorist, if you are likely to do harm with that deadly weapon. That is a simple idea that has about 90 percent support in this country, and yet it will not be brought to this floor in what is known as the House of  Do we represent or do we not?  There are other ideas. There has to be some limit on the firepower and the nature of the lethal technology that Americans can get access to. We saw in Las Vegas what very powerful weapons, perhaps modified to turn them into military-style weapons, can do to people and their bodies. I think most Americans would agree that there is some line--some line--between the weapons that we should have access to as a result of our Second Amendment rights and to do what we need to do and those weapons that can wreak the kind of havoc that we saw in Las  Last year, after the shooting at the Pulse nightclub, I decided in desperation that I would not participate in any more moments of silence in this Chamber, that prayers and sympathy are fine, but this room can fix this problem. But this room and the people in it refuse to do so, even though we call ourselves Representatives, and we will not bring forward ideas that our constituents would support.  So today, in our despair, we must remember that our great struggles--suffrage, civil rights, healthcare--took decades for us to achieve. We can break the cycle of violence, but we have to act. We have no other choice.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7682.txt,1913,PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,topic-id,1051,"Mr.President, I would like to start by thanking Senator Murkowski for her leadership as chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, on which I also serve, in addressing some of the long-term needs of Puerto                               Healthcare  Mr.President, the American people are relieved that the latest version of TrumpCare went down in defeat last week. We won this battle because millions of people made their voices heard, but the danger remains. We cannot grow complacent.  The President and his allies in Congress are hoping that in our relief, we will move on and pay attention to other things. With this President, I have to say, and this administration, there is always a fresh outrage to contend with. After his latest failure, the President has turned to sabotage and neglect to accomplish his goal of denying millions of people access to healthcare under the Affordable Care  The danger is real. The President's continued threats to eliminate cost-sharing reduction payments that help reduce out-of-pocket costs for consumers under the ACA, for example, are already destabilizing health insurance in Hawaii and across the country.  This year, HMSA and Kaiser--two of Hawaii's largest providers of health insurance--proposed large rate increases for customers on the exchange in response to the uncertainty posed by the President's threats to eliminate the cost-sharing payments. These companies have been told to submit two rate proposals, one if cost-sharing remains in place and the other if these cost-sharing provisions are eliminated.  If the President eliminates cost-sharing payments, Hawaii residents could see an 8-percent increase in their premiums on the individual markets. This translates into millions of dollars more that Hawaii residents will need to pay. This is irresponsible, unacceptable, and completely within the President's power to prevent.  Unfortunately, the President isn't the only member of his administration intent on sabotaging the Affordable Care The Secretary of Health and Human Services resigned in disgrace last week, but the work he set in motion at the Department to make it more difficult for people to sign up for insurance continues apace.  The administration has already shortened the open enrollment period from 90 days to 45 days and proposed massive cuts for advertising and call centers during this shortened window. To make matters worse, they are taking healthcare.gov down for so-called maintenance at peak times on the weekends so people have even less time to sign up for coverage.  The sabotage doesn't end there. The administration is also calling for a 40-percent cut in funding for navigators who help vulnerable communities find and secure coverage. In the past, organizations in Hawaii like We Are Oceania and the Legal Aid Society have received navigator grants to help enroll low-income Hawaii residents, COFA citizens, individuals with disabilities, and other underserved communities in programs under the  Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Josie Howard, We Are Oceania's program director. Josie and her team navigate a multitude of language and cultural barriers to help COFA citizens who have been unfairly disqualified from Medicaid to enroll in the exchange. President Trump's determination to sabotage the ACA undermines the hard work Josie and organizations like We Are Oceania are doing to expand healthcare access to underserved communities.  We need to keep fighting back against the President's sabotage campaign, but we can also work together in Congress to improve our Nation's healthcare system and renew programs that millions of people depend on every year in our country.  On Saturday, Congress allowed funding for the Community Health Center Fund--CHCF--to lapse without being renewed. CHCs across the country will be forced to lay off staff, reduce hours of operations, scale back investments, or even close, denying healthcare coverage or services to millions of people in need all across the country.  Through the ACA, the CHCF provided increased funding for community health centers across the country to modernize facilities, hire new staff, and expand services in underrepresented communities. If Congress does not renew the program, community health centers will face a 70-percent cut in their Federal funding, and this will have a devastating impact for community health centers in Hawaii, like Malama I Ke Ola in Wailuku on  Thanks to the CHCF funding and the ACA's Medicaid expansion, Malama I Ke Ola has been able to expand the services it provides to Maui residents and improve outcomes for thousands of people--particularly in the area of women's health.  In the years following the passage and implementation of the ACA, Malama I Ke Ola has worked to expand OB-GYN services at the clinic. With increased funding, the clinic has purchased new, high-definition ultrasound machines, hired new physicians, and upgraded its prenatal care facilities. The center recently signed a new contract with the University of Hawaii to provide overnight fetal medical services at the clinic instead of having to refer patients to large public hospitals on Keeping these patients on Maui not only reduces overall healthcare spending but also allows patients to stay close to home and their families.  If Congress does not renew CHCF funding, this program--and hundreds of[[Page S6277]]others across the State and country--will be at risk.  Congressional inaction has also threatened the future of the Children's Health Insurance Program--or CHIP--which provides health insurance to 9 million low-income children and mothers across the country and 27,000 in We should act as soon as possible to pass a bipartisan reauthorization that Senators Hatch and Wyden negotiated in the Senate Finance  It seems as though every day the President tweets something new and outrageous to distract us from the true issues facing our country, whether it is the Mueller investigation or his decision to rescind DACA and place hundreds of thousands of DACA Dreamers at risk for deportation. This is a tactic the President has used to great effect during our many debates on healthcare. The President hopes we will be paying more attention to his attacks on NFL players or demeaning comments about the mayor of San Juan instead of his dangerous proposals to take healthcare away from millions of people in our country. We have to keep paying attention and keep our eyes on the ball. We have to keep speaking up and fighting back.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

24,topic-id,406,"Mr.President, 75 years ago, on October 13, 1942, the men of the 164th Infantry Regiment, North Dakota Army National Guard, landed on Guadalcanal to make history as the first U.Army unit to offensively engage the enemy in either theatre during World War  The soldiers, supplies, and the rifles they carried were welcomed by the beleaguered First Marine Division that had been fighting on the island since The prize was the strategic airfield captured by the marines and coveted by both Allies and the enemy as a key location to champion air and naval superiority in that area of the South  On Guadalcanal for only 12 days, the trained but untested soldiers were thrust into the second battle for Henderson Field on the night of October 24. The 3rd Battalion trudged up muddy slopes to fight shoulder to shoulder with Chesty Puller's marines as waves of Japanese threatened the thin line protecting the airfield. The next day, having proved its mettle, the 164th Infantry remained in charge of that line as the marines moved to an adjacent location. The Japanese attacked the 164th sector on the night of October 26, incorrectly believing the new Army troops could not hold the line. The 164th held firm at the location that became known as the Battle of Coffin Corner, earning the respect of the marines in the form of a Navy Presidential Unit  The lineage of the 164th Infantry Regiment carries significant history as North Dakota National Guard infantrymen were called to serve in the Spanish American War, the Philippine Insurrection, Mexican Border Incident, World War I, World War II, and the Korean war. The regiment ceased to exist in 1955, its companies reorganized to engineer units, but the esprit de corps of the combat soldiers has remained intact.  On the 75th anniversary, to the day, of the regiment's landing at Guadalcanal, the 164th Infantry Association will hold its last annual reunion, ending a tradition that began in 1945. On Saturday, October 14, the 164th Association will host a public event to recognize the service and heritage of the unit that was so important to the history of the North Dakota Army National Guard, the State of North Dakota, and the United States of Eight veterans of Guadalcanal will attend this event, ages 94 to 98, and they will represent all members of the regiment, living or remembered, as this important chapter of North Dakota military history ends.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-05-pt1-PgS6356-2.txt,2079,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017,5,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
610,topic-id,1055,"Madam President, I rise today to talk about what is really a ``once in a generation'' opportunity, and that is the opportunity we have right now to reform our outmoded and complex Tax Code and also, most importantly, to provide tax relief for our Nation's families, farmers, and small businesses.  Our Tax Code has not been updated since 1986. When you think about all that has changed over the last 30 years, you know that modern advances in technology have drastically revolutionized the way business is conducted. Today, the creation of the internet, substantially increased automation, and instant communications have created dramatic changes and in many ways have brought us closer in terms of communication and have interconnected our global economy in ways we never could have foreseen back in the 1980s, when we last reformed our Tax  So it is past time--not time but past time--to modernize our outdated Tax Code to the 21st century. We must do so in order to ensure that American businesses can compete on the global stage, while providing tax relief to hard-working middle-class families who have been struggling to get and stay ahead over the last decade.  The recently released tax blueprint proposes sweeping tax reforms that will benefit working families and small businesses throughout the country while promoting job creation, economic growth, and global competitiveness. This country was built on hard work by individuals and families who strive each and every day to make ends meet to provide for their loved ones and to plan for retirement. The current Tax Code is complex and has many loopholes that do nothing to help our hard-working families keep more of their own hard-earned money. Our tax framework will help individuals and families in my home State and across this country to get ahead by generating new jobs through sustained economic growth while lowering the overall tax burden and putting more money back in the taxpayers' pockets.  We do this in a number of ways: by doubling the standard deduction, by eliminating taxes on the first $12,000 earned by an individual and $24,000 earned by a married couple, effectively establishing a zero-percent tax rate as the bottom bracket--the bottom tax rate. That means that nearly 81 percent of North Dakotans who claim the standard deduction could see a significant increase in their take-home pay. That is true of other States across the country as well. Further, we are consolidating and lowering the tax rates across the board while simplifying the Tax Code to make it fairer for everybody.  At nearly 70,000 pages long, it is no wonder that Americans currently spend 6 billion hours a year complying with the Tax In fact, 94 percent of taxpayers choose either to pay someone else or to use software to prepare their taxes because of the complexity of our Tax Our goal for tax reform is to allow the vast majority of Americans to file their tax returns on a single page--a simple calculation, something they can do themselves. We want to reduce the cost and stress that many Americans feel during tax season.  Further, our tax framework aims to create greater opportunities for small business owners, farmers, and others to help grow our economy and be more competitive than ever before. While we focus on a business friendly State in North Dakota--we have a very business friendly climate--the Federal tax continues to place an undue burden on the nearly 71,000 small businesses that operate in our State, which is more than 95 percent of all of the employers in the Again, this is something that applies across the The driver of our economy, the backbone of our economy is small business. They are the job generators. They are the job creators. We have to do more to help them do what they do, which is to create jobs and to grow our economy.  The same applies to our family farmers. My State alone has more than 30,000 family farms and ranches. Their marginal tax rate can reach as high as almost 45 percent, nearly twice the average rate of the rest of the industrialized world. That creates real challenges. This tax framework follows the example we have set in our State by restoring economic opportunity, by lowering the tax burden, and by enacting a pro-growth tax code.  Economists in general agree that high corporate taxes reduce wages to workers, raise costs to consumers, and reduce returns on retirement savings. That affects all of us. Maintaining high tax rates does nothing to improve the fairness of our system. It only punishes everyday citizens and reduces economic opportunities for all  For far too long, our Tax Code has incentivized American companies to send jobs and investment overseas, instead of keeping them here at home--keeping that investment, keeping those jobs here at home. Consequently, large multinational corporations now hold approximately $2.6 trillion overseas. That is money that could be repatriated back to the United States for investment in American jobs here at home. Our framework would end the loopholes and the incentives that keep foreign profits offshore by moving to a territorial tax system and encouraging repatriation of these offshore funds, bringing that investment back to This is about getting the American economy going again and creating jobs and opportunity here at home rather than overseas.  It is vital that we advance a comprehensive tax reform that simplifies the IRS code and simplifies rates. Putting more money in the pockets of working individuals and families and empowering private investment will drive domestic job creation and increase wages through higher demand for labor and lower business costs. All the while we can ensure stable government revenues through a broader tax[[Page S6341]]base, a growing economy, and a more efficient tax system. That means that we will continue to be able to fund our priorities as we work to get our debt and deficit under control.  Ensuring U.competitiveness in the global marketplace and providing tax relief to middle-class families will benefit both current and future generations. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to get tax reform done for the people of my State of North Dakota, for their respective States, and for Americans across this entire country.

766,topic-id,323,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of much-needed legislation that would simply fix a 2014 rule by financial regulators and allow municipal bonds to be considered as level 2B liquid assets, at a minimum, for purposes of calculating total high-quality liquid assets, or HQLAs, under the liquidity coverage ratio. The Municipal Finance Support Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation that passed unanimously out of committee, showing its clear need.  Municipal securities are frequently issued by the transportation, housing, and healthcare authorities of State and local governments to raise funds to pay for projects ranging from bridges and schools to hospitals and recreational facilities. Excluding municipal securities from treatment as HQLAs will result in higher borrowing costs for State and local governments during times of economic stress.  Furthermore, there is no reason why high-quality liquid bonds issued by the United States and municipalities should receive a lower standing than foreign sovereign debt with equivalent or, frankly, even lesser credit quality and market liquidity.  Finally, disincentivizing financial institutions from holding investment-grade municipal securities could cause banks to retreat from the $3.8 trillion market, thereby forcing State and local governments to scale back pending projects on roads, schools, and other infrastructure projects financed with the bonds. Classifying investment-grade municipal securities as HQLAs will ensure low-cost infrastructure financing remains available for State and local governments.  Although the Federal Reserve has issued an amended rule allowing municipal bonds to count as HQLAs for some banks, neither the OCC nor the FDIC have acted to follow the Fed's lead in amending their HQLA definitions to include these municipal securities. Their inaction creates a split regulatory system in which the treatment of municipal securities for the purpose of measuring the liquidity of the bank's holdings depends entirely upon who the regulator is.

235,topic-id,1928,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from I make the point that I have enjoyed the last 19 years serving with him in the Congress of the United He was elected 2 years before me to the House of I came a little bit later, but I preceded him in the Senate in 2004. He has been great to work with.  The Show Me State of Missouri is an awful lot like my State of They are proud of their country. They are proud to be They are proud of the chance to have an opportunity to make an honest living and want to be a part of a country that continues to grow and have prosperity for the future.  We had a hearing in the Finance Committee yesterday where there was an interesting study I had not seen before. It had been done by a Harvard student, who I assume was correct. Ninety percent of the people born in the 1940s ended up making more than their parents did when they went to work. But only about 40 percent of the people born in the 1980s will end up making more than their parents did, meaning that as we have gone along the way since World War II, we have taken more and more away from the opportunity in the earning level and more money has gone to different places, like taxation.  Personally, I think the Finance Committee and the leadership of the Big 6, so to speak, have done us a great favor to open the debate on tax reform in Unlike some of the debates we have had recently, this debate is open-ended. We are starting with a framework, not an absolute dictate but a framework. We are talking about an opportunity we have to see if we can lower the burden of taxes on the American people, while incentivizing the American people to work more, to make more, and to earn more.  There are two ways to increase revenue to the government. First, you can increase the rate of taxation. But then you are not necessarily taking in any more money. You might incentivize somebody to go somewhere else. The other way is to improve the opportunity to make money and the atmosphere in which people make money so they invest their time and effort and they grow their revenue, which grows the revenue of the United States of  The proposal in the framework before us has any number of outlines and any number of targets. The four things I want to focus on are these. One is the middle class. I have gotten tired of hearing this reference to dividing us as Americans by class. We are all Regardless of our station in life, we are all important. The code ought[[Page S6310]]to be important to every single person who is an American and, if they can come to this country, to improve their life, raise their children, and live a good life.  I am not into a class society. I am into an opportunity society. If you take a look at this proposal, for those people you put in the middle class today, it proposes lower rates, less brackets, and more opportunity to gain wealth in the future through work, through investment, and through earnings.  Second, this framework encourages job creation. I know that people are always demonizing the rich. Most people who are rich are people providing people who aren't rich with jobs. I don't think it is bad to provide people with jobs. I think it is good to provide them with jobs. We need a Tax Code that incentivizes the creation of jobs.  The focus on the passthrough rate, which is talked about by the Big 6, may lower the passthrough rate to 25 percent. It is a job-creating proposal that works.  I have run a sub-S corporation. I have been a partner in limited partnerships. I have known people who have had sole proprietorships. I have known people who have had independent operations. They all pay their taxes at the regular, ordinary tax rate on the individual. They don't pay at the corporate rate. They pay at what is called the passthrough rate, where the profits at the end of the year of the partnership or the LLC or the sub-S corporation flow in a K-1 to the individual and are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate; whereas, corporations in C-corps, or stock-held companies, pay a top rate of 35 percent.  That rate is being proposed to go to 25 percent conceptually. If that goes to 20 percent and the 25 percent rate is applied to passthroughs, we will have a good environment in which companies can form investments, form new companies, make investments of those companies, build opportunity, and, in turn, build jobs. So it motivates America to create more jobs. With jobs come income. With income comes money. With money comes investment. At the end of that comes profit, which ends up being taxed, which is revenue to our country, and it increases.  We also need to recognize that we are not as competitive as we used to be, in large measure because of the code we have, not because we are not competitive people. America is the most competitive environment in the world in which to do business. Americans by themselves were explorers to get here. Americans by themselves are investors and inventors. Americans by themselves are risk-takers. We want to improve in every competitive opportunity we have, but the current code we have suppresses competitiveness.  This proposal by the Big 6 takes us to a territorial tax system. We are one of the few countries in the world that taxes the old-fashioned way. The territorial system is the way in which most of the world competes, and we are the biggest competitor within the rest of the world. It is time we put an end to a company making a dollar in Delhi, India, on a product they made there and sold there, pays the Indian tax, and then brings it back into America and has to pay the differential on the American tax as well. It is time we did what the territorial tax does, which is to tax the money where it is earned; therefore, you will never have to do repatriation again, and you will never have to talk about offshore tax havens again because the Tax Code will not induce those things to happen. Instead, people will pay the tax where it is earned, bring the money back here to hire people, invest, build new products, and then take them overseas and sell them. There is nothing more important than going to the territorial tax system. I am excited about this.  Have you ever thought about this?  If you were the president of a major American corporation and it was coming to the end of the year and you were getting ready to have your stockholders' meeting for the year and you were looking at ways to show how the stock could grow and how, next year, you were going to improve the profits of the company and, in turn, the net of the company and, in turn, the dividends to the stockholders--right now, if you have a home office in America, that is your principal office, and you are taxed at 35 percent in If you have a competitive company that is in Ireland and it is taxed at 12\1/2\, it just might cross your mind: If I move my headquarters from America to Ireland, I could take my stockholders and put 18 percent or 20 percent--or whatever the differential is--on the bottom line for them. When your Tax Code causes people to think about things like that, you are predicting a future for a country that is not as bright, as rich, or as important as it should be.  Lastly, everybody thinks I am a city slicker because I am from Atlanta, but I did grow up working on a farm in Fitzgerald, GA, and Ocilla, I love farmers and I love farms. I know one of the proposals of the Big 6 is to do away with the remainder of the estate tax that is still with us. A few years ago, we exempted all estates at $5 million or less from the estate tax. Now it is $5.49 million because the index has been used on inflation. The tax rate used to be 55 percent, and it is now 40. Yet, in my State of Georgia, with the effective application of the income tax, the tax is about 46 percent. So, for round figures and argumentative figures, for someone who dies in our State, after the first $5 million, he pays a tax closer to 50 percent.  A lot of people say that is rich people taking a benefit of the Tax I don't call being dead in order to collect a tax benefit a good idea. I do not think that that is a benefit to me at all because the estate tax is on somebody's estate who passes away, who pays that tax for the people who would inherit the assets. Those are normally the children or the spouses or maybe the employees with whom they work in their companies.  Have you ever thought about this?  If somebody were taxing you at 50 percent or close thereto and you file your first estate tax return after you are dead, then if this were the value of your estate, you would be telling the government: OK, you get this half, while my children, my wife, my family get the other half. A year later, when you go back to the well--or a generation later--those kids who inherited the business will have to go back and pay taxes, and a quarter of it will be gone. So, in two generations, you took an asset that was worth a lot and reduced it to 25 percent of what it was worth. You are incentivizing people to liquidate something that was paying taxes on an ongoing basis and pay a onetime exit in terms of an estate tax. That is backward thinking.  What we should do is take those things people have worked for and striven for and tried their best to build and have an incentive for them to take that and leave it to their heirs and leave that company in a tax-paying mode or that farm in a tax-paying mode so America benefits and they benefit as well. Just because you are not taxing something does not mean you are not taking advantage of your company or the benefit of that item. By abolishing the estate tax, you will actually put more money, over time, in the Treasury of the United States of America in taxes than you ever will by taxing the one-time 50 percent.  So as we enter this debate--and I have been joined on the floor by a number of my colleagues who, I know, want to talk--let's talk about what benefits the American people, what incentivizes innovation and competition, what puts more money in the pockets of middle-class Americans today but also creates more people in the middle and upper classes in the future, not because we gave them anything except an opportunity, a fair place to compete, and that competitive drive that only people in the United States of America have, possess, and will always use to the benefit of our country.

503,topic-id,349,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Yarmuth), our ranking member, for yielding and also for his tremendous leadership.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this deeply flawed Republican budget resolution.  When we considered this resolution in July, Democrats offered 28 amendments. The amendments that we offered were meant to help set a course away from the disastrous path that the Republican majority and the Trump administration are steering us down.  We offered amendments on a broad range of issues important to our communities and our families. These included protecting our communities from the effects of climate change; preserving healthcare; investing in public health, research, and diplomacy; and investing in our Nation's workforce and infrastructure. Not surprisingly, not a single one of those made it through.  Instead, we have the resolution: a love letter to millionaires, billionaires, and corporations, and nothing but a manifesto of contempt for America's working families.  Mr.Chairman, the resolution we will be asked to vote on is based on the same faulty assumptions as the bill that came through committee. These include assuming that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act happened, which it did not, and an unrealistic economic growth of 3 percent.  The Republican budget resolution does little but hurt millions of American families in order to fast-track tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations.  In addition, after all the Republican talk of deficit reduction, this cruel budget resolution massively increases the Federal debt by over $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years and $3.2 trillion in the 10 years after.  Where does putting the interests of corporations and the wealthiest ahead of working families get us?  Well, we have seen where this ends.  Earlier this summer, the Republican-dominated Kansas Legislature was forced to roll back its 2012 tax cuts. In fact, a recent Brookings Institution analysis found that the tax cuts resulted in an ``anemic level of revenues,[[Page H7799]]which led to ballooning shortfalls, causing significant cutbacks in vital programs such as Medicaid, education, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, court funding, and infrastructure.

We know who wins under this budget resolution. It paves the way for a Republican tax proposal that gives a huge tax cut to the wealthiest in our country.  Consider this: 80 percent of the Republican tax cut goes to the top 1 percent by 2027; the average tax cut for the top 1 percent would be $207,000; for millionaires, the tax cut would provide $230,000 a year; and 42 million middle class households would face a tax increase, including those people earning between $50,000 and $150,000.

Let's be very clear about what those two different visions are.  The Republican budget says we should invest millions of dollars into tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and the largest corporations.  Our budget, the Progressive Caucus budget, says we want to invest in people. We believe in working families across this country who are working hard, want to have a decent life, and want to build a better future. I choose investing in the people. That is what this budget does. It invests in education, in jobs, infrastructure, research, and science, and diplomacy.  Let me just focus for a minute on education as the gateway to opportunity. The People's Budget commits $1 trillion to help families afford childcare, provides universal access to pre-K, and upholds our Nation's commitment to our public schools, which are the bedrocks of our communities nationwide, through adequate funding and supporting educators with resources that they need to reach every student.

694,topic-id,1119,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. It was wonderful to see the gentleman out in Seattle exploring our maritime sector.  We are very proud of the maritime industry. And in the State of Washington, and in my district, the Seventh Congressional District of Washington State, sometimes people know about us for Boeing airplanes, but they really should know us for our national deepwater port and all of the maritime that we have there.  Obviously, Mr.Speaker, since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last month, residents have been without power. Many of them have not had access to relief supplies, including food and water. Many have lost their lives. It has been heartbreaking to watch. We all stand united in pushing this administration to do everything possible to ensure that the people of Puerto Rico have access to relief supplies and that the administration is doing everything it can to assist and rebuild.  These are American citizens, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to help after this devastating hurricane.  The reason I am here today is to join my colleague, the gentleman from California, because in the wake of Hurricane Maria, we did see a false narrative spreading through the media and social channels about the Jones It caused us to reflect on the fact that perhaps not everybody knows the history of the Jones Not everybody understands exactly what it does and how it supports so strongly American jobs that benefit so many of us.  There are people who thought that perhaps the Jones Act was to blame for the fact that supplies were not making it out of the docks and into Puerto Rico, and so I am very grateful to the gentleman from California, and Republican colleague across the aisle, Representative Hunter, for holding an informal hearing on this very topic and inviting in shipbuilders, shipping companies, as well as the maritime labor industry to tell us a little bit about what was happening in Puerto  And so this is an opportunity, really, for us to talk about what the Jones Act means, because when you are talking about Make It In America, when you are talking about better wages, better jobs, and a better deal for the American public, then the Jones Act, in many ways, is the epitome of exactly that.  The Jones Act has been in effect for nearly 100 years and inspired by cabotage laws that were in place since the first session of Congress in 1789. The law requires that when goods are shipped via water between two points in the United States, they must be shipped on U.S.-made vessels that are owned and operated by  This is where the critical industry comes in. In terms of Puerto Rico, the Jones Act is not the reason that the distribution of relief supplies has been slow to move in Puerto In fact, reports are that thousands of containers containing fuel, emergency housing, food, water, and other essentials are trapped at the Port of San[[Page H7733]]To date, at least 11,300 containers with millions of pounds of relief supplies have been delivered.  To put this in perspective, just one such state-of-the-art container ship arrived in Puerto Rico just 3 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall, carrying more than 35 million pounds of cargo, the equivalent of about 1,900 cargo planes. You can see here on the chart that the Jones Act current capacity is 22,000 TEUs with a maximum carrying capacity of 1.079 billion pounds.  So just imagine that the additional surge capacity, as of now, is 5,430 TEUs with a max carrying capacity of 258 million pounds. So the issue has not been that ships are not delivering. Our American ships are delivering supplies. But unfortunately, because of the infrastructure, the lack of infrastructure, the destruction to the roads, and the issues around refrigeration across the island--unfortunately, warehouses have been destroyed--there is nowhere to store those products, and there is no refrigeration.  So what we are seeing is the capacity at the docks continuing to increase. So over the next 2 weeks alone, Jones Act vessels will deliver more than 9,000 containers to Puerto Rico, including at least 3,300 FEMA loads full of relief cargo.  So despite these volumes, the residents of Puerto Rico are suffering, not because ships aren't being able to deliver there, but because of the lack of infrastructure that I mentioned, lack of refrigeration, all of those things.  So currently, the point that is very important, I think, for everybody to understand is that American flagships have the capacity to meet Puerto Rico's relief cargo needs, and the emphasis needs to be on moving cargo from the Port of San Juan into the island, and focusing on rebuilding the infrastructure that has suffered because of this devastating hurricane.  Mr.Speaker, some have called for an outright repeal of the Jones Act despite these facts. Why should Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle support the Jones Act? Because it is incredibly important to our country's economy and to the maritime industry, which supports nearly 500,000 jobs and is responsible for over $92 billion in gross economic output each year.  So in my home State of Washington, which ranks sixth in the country for Jones Act jobs, this law supports over 16,000 jobs and helps generate approximately $1.1 billion in labor income. More than 19 million tons of cargo originate from my home State of Washington every year, and the State imports more than 28 million tons annually. Without these jobs, our economy would suffer tremendously.  In my district, Washington's Seventh Congressional District, the Jones Act directly supports nearly 2,000 jobs, indirectly supports more than 6,500-related jobs. And to be clear, everywhere in the country where we have Jones Act jobs, they are better jobs, better wages, and a better future for our Americans across the country.  Shipyard jobs pay incredibly well. They earn workers about 45 percent more than the national average for private sector jobs. And this is an area, as we saw in the hearing that was had, this is an area where business and maritime labor, our merchant marines, are proud to work together to make sure that we provide for the national security of our country through the Jones Act, and also that we provide these deep investments in good-paying union jobs.  Mr.Speaker, there is no doubt that we have to invest in Puerto Rico by providing comprehensive relief, including water and food and housing and medical care, and we have to do everything we can to rebuild the infrastructure. But at the same time, we must make sure that we continue bipartisan support for this bedrock maritime law.

Nationally we represent over 200,000 family farmers and      ranchers and fishers. Here in Ohio we tout 2500 of those      members. Four of them are here with me today, Marge and Mardy      Townsend from Astabula County, and of course Congresswoman            The Farmers Union organization works through grassroots      driven policy to improve the well-being and quality of life      for family farmers, ranchers, fishers and rural communities.

I remember vividly when the Secretary of Agriculture, Earl      Butz declared the United States would plant ``fence row to      fence row'' and we would export our nation to prosperity and      feed the world along the way. That 70's expansion lasted only      a few years because American farmers soon produced massive      surpluses, interest rates, inflation ad input costs      skyrocketed, prices plummeted and competing countries      developed their own farming techniques. The farm cries of the      80's began and lasted for the next 25 years. Farm program      payments accounted for 50% of farm income. The mantra was      that profit came in ``economies of scale'', and we must ``get      big or get out''. Many family farmers and ranchers did      exactly that, some by choice, many by the force of the bank.       Trade agreement seeds were planted and gathered momentum in      the 80's.       NAFTA was the poster child. Assurances were given that no      jobs would be lost, in fact, many more would be created; and      the economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada would      explode for he benefit of the people in all 3 countries.      President Clinton signed on to the agreement ensuring us this      would be the economic model for the world.       Now, 25 years later we know the rosey assumptions and      predictions did not play out in reality like they did on      paper. American workers lost their manufacturing jobs to low      wage Mexican workers who were also decimated product quality      eroded, unions were decimated, family farmers either quit or      were forced out of business, the middle class began to shrink      and the trade deficit began to climb.       Agriculture, however, through it all was championed because      the United States consistently enjoyed trade surpluses      primarily form corn and soy exports. Unfortunately though,      family farmers, ranchers, and consumers did not benefit from      With the exception of the boom year 2008-2013, which      were due to the Renewable Fuel Standard, not NAFTA, close      inspection reveals vertically integrated multi-national      companies reaped the profits while farmers in all 3 countries      saw margins decline to the point of non-profitability; and      all the while our trade deficits soared. Additionally, trade      deals opened the door to consolidation and mega-mergers which      led to less competition, non-competitive markets, higher      costs, fewer choices and reduced research and development. An      example of the latter is herbicide weed resistance.       For decades Country of Origin Labelling, ``COOL'' has been      the signature issue the Farmers We pushed for its      passage with great vigor because it benefits producers and      95% of consumers support it. Simply, it requires beef pork      and poultry to be labeled with the country from which these      products came. Kaptur has been indefatigable promoting      this issue. In fact, she is more steadfast supporting and      promoting COOL than any congressperson in D.and we are      grateful for her efforts.

960,topic-id,233,"Mr.Speaker, today, most actions in Congress are viewed through a partisan lens, but the 21st Century AIRR Act is a bill with significant support from both Republicans and Democrats, as well as a number of groups representing a wide array of political ideologies.  Modernizing air traffic control has historically been a bipartisan issue. In fact, 20 years ago, then-President Clinton said: ``The FAA's 20-year effort to modernize its air traffic control technology simply has not been able to keep pace with either the emergence of new technology or the growth and demand for air travel. . . . We can continue on the current course and continue to experience crowded airports, flight delays, and even higher passenger frustration. But if we act now to improve our infrastructure, we can ensure that air travel in the 21st century is the safest, most cost-effective, most efficient in the world.''  These words are still true today.  Because we have failed to act decisively, the FAA is struggling to give Americans the 21st century air traffic control system they deserve. We have the opportunity to change that with the AIRR  Many former top administration officials from both parties support reform as well as a broad coalition of stakeholders.  Air traffic control reform hasn't been a partisan issue, and it shouldn't become one now.

15,topic-id,1133,"Mr.President, I want to talk a little bit about Social Security and, specifically, about the windfall elimination provision and the government pension offset. Now, I know that sounds real technical, but, basically, here is the problem.  We have a lot of Americans who have paid into Social Security who are now getting screwed by Social They are not getting their money back. All of us want to do everything we can to maintain the stability and sanctity of the Social Security system, and I think all of us believe that we all ought to get the Social Security payments that we are entitled to. That is all this issue is about. Let me explain.  For many middle-class Americans, receiving Social Security at retirement is sort of like a welcoming light at the end of the tunnel. They have worked hard, they have retired, and now they are entitled to some of the money back that they paid into the Social Security system. I am talking, of course, about the hard-working women and the hard-working men who have seen a chunk of their monthly earnings go into the Social Security system throughout their entire careers--10, 15, 20, and sometimes 30 and 40 years. These same Americans have not seen a pay raise or an increase in their median household income for a long time. The median household income in America today, as the Presiding Officer knows, is pretty much the same as it was in 1999.  I guess whom I am talking about are ordinary people. You can call it the middle class, if you would like, or working families. They were the ones who were hit the hardest by the great recession of 2008. They have been struggling throughout their lives to participate in the great wealth of this They are entitled to participate in the great wealth of this Nation, and they should not have to keep on struggling to get money for retirement from the Social Security system when they have already paid into the Social Security system.  The principle behind Social Security is pretty simple. Throughout your working life, you pay some money and your employer pays some money. When you are done working, or when you retire, according to a formula, you get your money back through a Social Security check. It is simple in theory. You put money in, and when you hit the retirement age, you get some of it back, except that for 1.7 million Americans, that is not the case. That is not how the system works for them. That includes about 38,000 hard-working folks in my home State of Louisiana, but there are a lot more in other States as well. I am talking about millions of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and a lot of other folks who earn modest pensions in service to their communities who face little or no access to Social  Here is what I am talking about. I am talking about a teacher who paid into the Social Security system. I am talking about teachers or firefighters or policemen who paid into their own retirement systems. So they are rocking along. They are, basically, paying into two retirement systems--Social Security and the private retirement system. They are doing the right thing in getting up every day, going to work, obeying the law, and trying to save money for retirement. It is deferred gratification. They are ready to retire, but because they were prudent enough to invest in a private retirement system, they do not get their Social Security check even though they have already paid into it. Additionally, a worker can pass away before reaching retirement age not even knowing that his spouse and children will not have full access to his Social Security survivors' benefits. That is just not right.  Until 2005, there was not even a legal requirement for human resources to notify workers that switching careers would affect their eligibility for Social Security or Social Security survivors' benefits. Many of these 1.7 million Americans who are getting screwed tried to do the right thing. They paid into a private retirement system, and they paid into Social Security only to find out later that they can get their money from the private retirement system but that they cannot get their money from Social They are being punished for being prudent. Many of them retire with no idea that that is the law. By then, of course, it is too late.  In June of this year, one in six Americans collected Social Security benefits, and I am happy for every one of them because, to collect, they had to pay in. That is about 61 million By 2031, when the last of the baby boomers hits retirement age, that number is going to increase to about 75 million These are going to be our seniors. They are our seniors, and they are our seniors to be. They are battling against the rising costs of housing, healthcare, automobiles, taxes, and fees. Many of them have had their private retirement accounts or home values wrecked by the great recession. Yet these Americans press on.  When we talk about tax reform--and we are going to be talking a lot about tax reform here over the next few weeks--we need to make clear that we are talking about reforms that will help these middle-class They are the people who get up every day, go to work, obey the law, and try to do the right thing by their kids and teach their kids morals and try to save a little money for retirement.  Let me be blunt. I would like to eliminate the windfall elimination provision and the government pension offset in the Social Security office. I think it would be a vital step in ensuring that our middle-class seniors can enjoy continued economic security after their retirements. Not only would it help the economy, but it is the right thing to do.  I sum up. We can provide economic relief immediately to some of those middle-class retirees about whom I have been talking by eliminating the windfall elimination provision and the government pension offset of the Social Security system. It will not cost much money. It will have a small effect on the cost of Social Security, at about 0.13 percent--not 13 percent but 0.13 percent. It is a little over one-tenth of 1 percent.  After taking care of this simple fix, which is more than about money--it is about fairness--we can turn our eyes to out-of-control Washington spending to ensure that Social Security remains a reliable source of retirement income for Americans in the long term.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

467,topic-id,328,"Mr.Chairman, in a nutshell, here is the Republican and the President's case. They want you to believe that if you cut corporate taxes, if you cut taxes on the investor class, that this is going to raise wages. That is the President's argument.  Here is what I don't understand. If you want to raise wages, why not just raise wages? Why not just give the tax credits to working families?  The President's Wall Street bankers have a different theory that only gets credence in the beltway. This is not about economics. This is about common sense. Think about it. You don't have to be a Ph.economist to know that the better way to raise wages is not to cut taxes for corporations, but to actually give the tax relief to people making under $75,000.  You don't have to be a Ph.economist to know that if you cut taxes for shareholders and corporate CEOs, they are probably going to invest it overseas. If you cut the taxes or give the tax relief to people making 50 grand in Michigan or Ohio, they are going to spend it and create jobs in the United  This is just common sense. You don't have to be a Ph.economist to know that if you really want to create jobs, invest in technical training for the million skills gap we have, instead of putting hopes on corporate CEOs who already have record profits, that somehow they are going to create more jobs.  Mr.Chair, it used to be that there were serious thinkers on the Republican side, people like Jack I disagreed with him, but at least he had innovative ideas of enterprise zones and how to really create jobs. But for the past 20 years, the Republican party has been devoid of ideas.  It is a mantra: tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts.  Oh, we are changing into a digital economy. How do we solve it? Tax cuts.

Independent analysis shows that the Republican plan would actually raise taxes on many middle class families, giving billionaires, the top 1 percent, the biggest breaks. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that middle class families could actually pay an increase of $1,290 a year.

225,topic-id,2090,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about a subject that has been on our minds in recent weeks and months and, in fact, years; that is, healthcare--one of the most complex and confusing but important topics that we have to consider.  Before I get into the bulk of what I want to address, I want to make the point once again that as we are debating healthcare and debating who pays, how much they pay, whether it is the ACA or Medicare or Medicaid or private insurance or private pay, we also[[Page S6300]]have to begin a serious discussion about the underlying cost of healthcare.  Regardless of who is paying, it is going to break us. If healthcare continues to grow in cost as it has over the last 20 years, it is going to eat the Federal budget, family budgets, individual budgets, and it is going to be something we absolutely have to address. Usually around here we don't address something until it is a crisis.  I would argue, as we are approaching 20 percent of GDP, with $1 out of every $5 in the country being committed to healthcare costs--more than twice as much as most other countries in the world, far more than any other country in the world--we have to address this issue.  Arguing about who pays is not going to solve the problem. That is important because in the interim, that is what is going to protect our citizens' coverage and what is going to protect our citizens from a healthcare disaster, a healthcare crisis.  I want to preface my remarks with--I think this is something we all need to be thinking about--how do we move beyond the discussion we are having now, not that it is unimportant, but we also need to move beyond the discussion and start talking about the underlying cost and why is it that Americans are paying virtually twice as much as anyone in the world for healthcare per capita--or as a percent of GDP or however you want to calculate it--without noticeably better results? In fact, most worldwide studies indicate the results of our healthcare system are not as good as those in many other countries.  It would be one thing if we were paying a lot of money and getting absolutely superior care across the board in our country, but that is not the case. In measurements such as infant mortality, longevity--standard basic healthcare indicators--we are not doing very well. Yet we are paying twice as much. There is something wrong with that, and we have to address it.  I want to talk about the Affordable Care I want to start with the point that it is the law of the land. It is the law of the land.  I am rising today in sadness but also in anger because there is a lot of talk about the Affordable Care Act collapsing, imploding. It is not collapsing. It is being mugged. It is being stabbed in the back. It is being sabotaged deliberately and consciously by the actions of the administration.  I want to emphasize that this isn't about ideology. It is not about politics. It is not about who wins and who loses or which party is up or who voted or who didn't. This is about people. It is about people in It is about people, many of whom got care for the first time under the Affordable Care Act; lobstermen, small farmers, small businesspeople, individuals finally had a shot at reasonably priced healthcare.  It is not perfect by any means. I would never argue that. In fact, I have been working on proposals since the day I got here on how to improve it, how to fix some of the problems, how to make it better, how to have the effects be less intense on some parts of our economy. It is the law of the land. The impacts of what we do here or don't do here fall on real people--real people, in my case, in my home State of  The Affordable Care Act is not collapsing; it is being sabotaged. Here is a partial list.  In January, during the period of the last open enrollment, one of the first acts of the new administration was to cut the advertising on television, advising people that they had this healthcare option. Cut the ads, that is 1. That was in  Then they announced they were going to minimize the enforcement of the personal mandate. If you tell somebody you are not going to enforce something, that is an invitation to not abide by it, to not pay any attention to it. People can argue about whether that is desirable, but that is the law. To announce that administratively you are not going to enforce it, again, what does that do? It reduces the number of people who are going to get healthcare. That, in turn, undermines the individual market, and that, in turn, makes it less financially viable. That is a deliberate act that will undermine the viability of this law.  In April, there began a series of what turned into seven different threats from various people in the administration to not make the legally mandated CSR payments--the cost-sharing reduction payments--which are not bailouts to insurance companies but which were designed as part of the law to hold the rates down and to hold the deductibles down for those people buying coverage under the Affordable Care Continuously threatening the reduction or the elimination of these payments has created an uncertainty in the marketplace that is now coming home to roost.  Just last week, Anthem announced they are leaving the Maine marketplace. They cited a number of reasons, but one of the chief reasons was the uncertainty created by whether these payments are going to be made.  Recently, the HELP committee had a series of hearings on this subject. They had a bipartisan group of They had a bipartisan group of insurance commissioners, health experts from across the country. I was at all but one of those hearings. I believe I am right in saying it was unanimous that we must ensure the continuation of the CSR payments in order to stabilize the market and reduce premiums projected to increase this coming year.  The number nationally is estimated to be about 20 percent--a 20-percent increase attributable to the failure to ensure that the CSR payments will be made because an insurance company, if they are setting rates, has to factor into their rates the risk of these payments not being made. The testimony is--it depends somewhat on the State, but roughly a 20-percent increase is attributable to just this fact.  If we could pass legislation here--unfortunately, we missed the deadline, but we may be able to work on that because the deadline was just last week. But if we could simply ensure those payments are made, that in itself would lower rates by 20 percent next year on a silver plan.  By the way, if those CSRs aren't made and the rates go up, ironically, that means the mandatory payments of subsidies to individuals under the Affordable Care Act will also go up. So it will cost the Treasury money--additional money not accounted for, roughly $200 billion over the next 10 years.  What else has gone on? In May, there was another one from the head of the Office of Management and The administration has not decided whether to pay the That is a big red signal to the insurance companies: You can't count on this, so you better raise rates. In May, the budget was released. In the budget, there were drastic cuts in the call centers for the Affordable Care Act, in the in-person assistance, and in marketing. And just for good measure, they announced they were cutting the enrollment period in half, from 3 months to 6 weeks. What possible reason can there be to do that, except that you want fewer people to sign up? That is called sabotage--reducing from 3 months to 6 weeks.  Then, all along, the Health and Human Services Department has been monkeying around with the website, taking down explanatory material about the Affordable Care Act, taking down material indicating why this would be a good deal for people and, instead, putting up critical material.  On August 31, the administration announced reductions in outreach of 90 percent and cuts in assistance to people trying to navigate this system by 40 percent. This is complicated material. Any of us who have signed up for insurance--we all have the Affordable Care Most people don't know that. But we had to go on the website and choose a policy for ourselves. It is hard, it is complicated, and to take away the people who are in the communities helping people work through these various decisions and weigh the different policies, the deductibles, and how to compare them is the same as taking away the coverage. It is an act of sabotage.  The most recent one I just learned about this morning. This is amazing. The Affordable Care Act is based on a website, healthcare.gov. We all know it had terrible problems when it started. There is no excuse for that. I was critical of it at the time. Those were problems that were not intentional.  Now intentional problems are being created. This is the one that really gets me. I just learned this morning that every Sunday during the bobtail enrollment period, the 6-week enrollment period, the website is going to be closed[[Page S6301]]for 12 hours for maintenance. Isn't that amazing? For 12 hours on the one day of the week when many working people are going to have an opportunity to try to understand this system and enroll, they are going to be down from midnight Saturday night until noon on Sunday, the middle of the day on  I want to go back to the beginning. This isn't about ideology. This is about seeing that the laws are faithfully executed. That is why they call it the administration. The administration is supposed to administer the laws, not unadminister them.  We are talking about people. Why does anyone want to have fewer people with insurance? I am at a loss to understand the motivation. I can understand if you don't like the If you don't like the ACA, let's work together and find ways to improve it and change it, but figure out how to keep people with health insurance.  The uninsured rate in America has fallen 50 percent because of the Affordable Care That is an enormous achievement. It is one that should be celebrated, not sabotaged. That is what is so puzzling to me about this: fewer people with coverage and higher costs to the  We can do better than this. These are all things the administration in good faith can say: OK, we don't like the ACA, but we are going to move beyond the politics of this and try to help people get the coverage they desperately need.  This is about real people's lives. This is about lifting the threat, the cloud of a healthcare disaster, both physically and financially, from families across We are talking about millions of families--not tens of thousands but millions of families. I don't get why we are deliberately trying to undermine and sabotage something that is so meaningful to so many people. As one can tell, it makes me angry. Mostly, it makes me sad because I know people in Maine who have benefited, who have gotten coverage, who did not have it before and who will not have it if this is taken away--people who need those navigators to help them, people who need to be able to use the website on a Sunday morning, people who need to have rates that are lower because the CSRs have been funded, and we are not continuously raising the uncertainty of that piece of this law.  We can do better. This is about the health of our people. I cannot think of anything more important. We can have different ways of getting there, but right now we have a law that is in place, and until we change it--and we should change it; we should fix it--we should administer it straight up, straightforwardly, as it was written and as it was intended. This is too important for politics, and it is too important for ideology. This is all about people and their health.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

619,topic-id,1393,"Mr.President, I would like to begin by talking about the recent tragedy in Las Vegas, the largest mass shooting in U.history, with at least 59 dead and more than 500 injured, including one Minnesotan who was injured and another who lost his life. So I join my colleagues in mourning for the victims and their families. They are and should be our focus at this time, as well as making sure those who were hurt get the best medical care this country can give.  As we look ahead, these events underscore the urgency to continue fighting for funding to better treat mental illness but also for sensible gun safety legislation, and I joined with some of my colleagues the day after the tragedy in Las Vegas to call for those changes. No one policy will prevent every tragedy, but we need to come together on commonsense legislation to save lives.  One place we discussed this week where we could come together--because we have in the past--is on background checks. My colleagues Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey, who are two A-rated NRA Senators, have already demonstrated that we can find bipartisan agreement on something as straightforward as background checks. I was very pleased they came together on this legislation, but the fact remains, the Senate's failure to pass that bipartisan compromise was disheartening--one of my more disheartening days in the Senate because I began my day that day with the families of the Sandy Hook tragedy, with the parents who had lost their little kids, with the parents who had come to this building to advocate for a bill, the background check bill, that they knew wouldn't have saved their child's life, but they knew it would have saved others. What we have seen with expanded background checks is they reduce suicides and they reduce domestic homicides by a fairly large number.  Our constituents agree that we should be able to find some agreement here, as the numbers have consistently shown that Americans across the political spectrum, including gun owners, support proposals to require background checks by wide margins. I have[[Page S6346]]a State, like the Presiding Officer's, where there are a lot of hunters. It is a proud tradition in Minnesota so I look at all these proposals and I say to myself: Does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand? For many of the ones I have looked at, the answer is clearly no, including the background check bill.  When I talk to law enforcement in my State, they stress the need to have effective background checks to stop felons, people with severe mental illnesses, and others prohibited under current law from accessing guns. These efforts do not have to infringe in any way on Americans' lawful right to own guns.  Another sensible measure is Senator Feinstein's legislation to close a loophole that allows bump stop devices to convert semiautomatic firearms into weapons that work like fully automatic guns. Law enforcement officers have now recovered 12 of these devices from the Las Vegas shooter's room. I am a cosponsor of that bill, and I am encouraged that some of my Republican colleagues have agreed to look at this.  I hope we can find a path forward in the weeks ahead, not only with regard to this particular focus, the bump stock device legislation, but also on some of the other bills like the background check bill.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, I am here for another purpose today; that is, that we must get to work on other important business in the We need to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program and come together on bipartisan fixes to the Affordable Care No parent should ever have to worry whether their child will have healthcare, but funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, expired over this weekend. CHIP is one of the great bipartisan success stories. Both parties have come together to support a program that provides healthcare to millions of children.  In Minnesota, these funds support coverage for 125,000 children. I heard from the children's hospitals and clinics of Minnesota just last week about many of the families who count on this program. While States like mine are finding ways to make Federal funding last a bit longer, since ours has already expired, every single day Congress doesn't act puts coverage of millions of children at risk.  There is already bipartisan work underway to keep this program going. Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden have introduced a bipartisan bill to extend CHIP for 5 years. In 2015, the last time we renewed this program, it passed the Senate with 92 votes--92 out of 100 votes. We should demonstrate that same bipartisan spirit again. The children in America are counting on us. We must act before it is too late or States like mine may be forced to make difficult choices about insurance coverage for some of our more vulnerable constituents.  CHIP is one part of our healthcare system that is working. We should be doing everything in our power to protect it. So let's come together and pass this long-term reauthorization of  Mr.President, CHIP is not the only area where we should be able to come together on healthcare. The American people want us to work together on bipartisan fixes to the Affordable Care As I said the day it passed, it was a beginning and not an end. Any major piece of legislation like that needs improvements and changes. Let's work together on the bipartisan bills and ideas that have been put forward. Just like my friend Senator McCain said, we could do better working together--Republicans and  Senator Alexander and Senator Murray have been holding hearings and discussions on commonsense solutions to bring down insurance costs over the past month. We had Governors here, and there were actually more Republican Governors in the room than Democratic Governors, as they embraced these suggested changes which include reinsurance. I note Senator Collins and Senator Nelson, a Republican and a Democrat, have a bill together that would do something on that front.  I look at what has been done in Alaska--I see my colleague, Senator Murkowski here--and what has been done in Minnesota when it comes to reinsurance, and we have seen some of the rates go down, not to where we need them to go, but there has been a decrease in the amount of rates. We would like to see that on a national basis, and that is why I am such a strong supporter of Senator Alexander and Senator Murray's work.  Mr.President, finally, we need to be doing something on the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. People such as Kim from Plymouth, MN, is struggling to afford her insulin because it has gone up three times. She keeps the injector with a few drops of insulin from day-to-day so she can get by. That is why I think we should have Medicare Part D negotiations. I have a bill that now has 33 cosponsors that lifts the ban that makes it illegal for 41 million seniors to negotiate the prices of drugs. Seniors can be a pretty stubborn and very vocal group. Why don't we let them unleash their power and allow Medicaid to negotiate prices?  Senator Grassley and I have a bill to stop pay for delay, where major pharmaceutical companies are paying off generics to keep their products off the market. I have a bill with Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy, and Senator Lee--the four of us lead the bill--the CREATES Act, which makes it easier to get more generic competition in the market. We also--McCain and I, and Senator Lee and I--have bills that allow for safe drugs to come in from other countries to again create more competition to bring the price down. When the prices of four of the top best selling drugs in America have gone up over 100 percent, I don't think we can just sit here and do nothing anymore.  I bring up these efforts because, for the most part, they are bipartisan--the work of Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, the bills that have been introduced to do something on prescription drugs. Let's get moving on that and let's reauthorize The last time it passed the Senate with 92 votes.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

1133,topic-id,653,"Madam Speaker, I am truly blessed to represent a district in southern California that is the home of so many historic feats.  Today, I would like to tell you about one of those feats that turned 50 years old today. October 3, 1967, is a date I will never forget, but it is probably a date I will never remember either because I was 9 months old.  On that date, a B-52 flew down the runway of Edwards Air Force Base with a small, white airplane tucked underneath her wing. A major who had thousands of hours in different platforms was the pilot of that airplane. He had been on several different programs and had been a test pilot for many years and was a graduate of the United States Air Force Test Pilot He was the pilot of that small, white aircraft.  The plan was simple on paper. It was to accelerate to 100,000 feet and achieve a Mach of 6.50. As the pilots at Edwards Air Force Base will also tell you, it is a profession that they go about, and they do this in a very professional manner. The terms were 100,000 feet and 6.50, the ending was 102,100 feet and 6.72--a new airspeed record.                              {time}  1015  The interesting thing about this is that the air speed record had been set on November 18, 1966, by the same pilot and broken just 10 months later. That flight has now stood for 50 years.  If that pilot was here today, he would say that it is a travesty that that air speed record has stood for 50 years. In fact, I was standing with him on the 30th anniversary and he said just those same words: Why are we stuck where we were in the sixties? Why haven't we continued to push forward?  I believe he was right and I believe he would be right today. I hope that I am not standing here on the 60th anniversary talking about the same issue.  The great men of that era did some phenomenal things. They pushed the limits. They knew that the sky was no limit and that it was actually just a boundary that we needed to push forward.  There were 12 pilots in the X-15 program. I grew up with many of them or their kids. There was General Rushworth, Neil Armstrong, Bob White, Joe Walker, Bill Dana, Joe Engle, Scott Crossfield, John McKay, Milton Thompson, and Forrest Mike Adams lost his life in the X-15 program in November 1967--the only one to lose his life in that program.  The pilot of the October 3, 1967, flight was my father, Pete He flew the aircraft 16 times, setting the air speed record several times, breaking it, and then achieving 4,520 miles an hour on October 3, 1967, which still stands today.  I think the lesson is that we have got to keep pushing. Technology is not out there for no reason. It is out there for us to grab and continue to achieve. Those records are made to be broken. We must continue to push in aerospace and in every endeavor we encounter. That is what America does and that is what we do for all of mankind.  I think this record was a great achievement, and I can tell you one quick story. I knew of this record when I was a small kid because my father pulled that Machmeter out of the X-15 after he set the record. That Machmeter sat on our television for every year of my life, until he was on his death bed. He said: I want that Machmeter to go to the Which is exactly where we sent it.  This was something that was an achievement by many engineers, pilots, mothership pilots, and chase pilots, but it is something that is now 50 years old, and we need to continue to push.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7677.txt,2228,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

229,topic-id,3710,"Madam President, I would recommend to this body something that is obvious to all of us. Our economy is stuck. We are in a bad spot of just treading water. Over the last 11 years, our gross domestic product--that is how much our economy is growing--has been 1.9 percent, and 1.9 percent is a tiny change.  Just to give you a perspective, over the last 100 years, there has not been a single decade when we have not had a year without at least 3 percent growth, until the last decade. Literally, our economy, is typically growing; that is, more jobs are being added, people are making more money, there is more happening, and we are selling more internationally. In America, over the last 100 years, it has just slowly grown and grown and grown until the last 10 years, and, then, it has flattened out. We are stuck.  Now, when I was younger, we had a record player in the house. Now, for all of you under 40, I would explain that a record player is kind of like a CD player, only it was larger and made of vinyl. But if I say that, then, all the under-20 crowd will say: What is a CD player?  Let me just say this. The big black pieces of vinyl that played music at my house occasionally would get stuck. The record needle would land in the same groove and play the same part of the song over and over. It was my job, as the youngest one in the house, to go over to the record and bump it and get it out of that. Our economy needs that.  We need to be able to get over to our economy, which is stuck in the same groove at 1.9 percent in this incredibly low-growth rate, and give it a bump. Now, that bump can come in a lot of ways: increasing international trade would be a great help, engaging more internationally, keeping our regulations common sense and as nonintrusive as possible so that small businesses and medium-sized businesses aren't panicked all the time of what the Federal Government is going to do to them with a new regulation. Just keep them common sense and simple.  How about making sure that there are fewer Federal forms and that the Federal forms that people have to fill out not only are simple to do but they don't duplicate over multiple different agencies. It would be good if people who worked in small, medium, and large businesses spent more time selling products than they did filling out a form for some Federal bureaucracy that is never going to read that form anyway.  The obvious way to be able to bump the record needle in our economy right now is tax reform. It is not the main thing that is going to do everything, but it is a pretty big element. If we can get tax reform done, it actually gives our economy a little bit of a boost. Now, I have folks that will say: How does that make a difference? When you do tax reform, why does that actually increase economic activity?  Well, quite frankly, people around the country and in my State of Oklahoma are struggling to be able to save money because their wages aren't growing at the same speed that everything else is going up in price. So people need to be able to save more money and to be able to have more money to be able to spend.  Also, we need to create more jobs and we need to get companies going again and actually developing more jobs. If people can actually get a job, if people can make more money at that job, and if people actually have more take-home pay, they spend a little more, they save a little more, and the company expands a little more. If each[[Page S6304]]place does that a little bit, it dramatically increases our economy around the country, and we know it because we feel it.  Making the Tax Code simpler for every person in every business means people don't have to pay as much to have their taxes done. Maybe you can do your own taxes because it would be simple enough to do it, and it wouldn't cost so much. Accountants who work for businesses could go back to working for their businesses to see how they can make their businesses more efficient rather than spending all of their time just on tax policy.  I think we should follow the lead of the President on this. The President made a very clear statement. He said: Let's help our companies compete, but to do that we have to also knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success. For example, the President said:       Over the years, a parade of lobbyists have rigged the tax      code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those      with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up      paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of      the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no      sense, and it has to change.       So tonight, I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to      simplify the system. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the      playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax      rate for the first time in 25 years.  Did I fail to mention that the President who said that is President Obama? President Obama did, right down the hallway, in 2011, in his State of the Union address. That is what he said we should do: simplify the system, lower the corporate tax rate, and be able to deal with all of the loopholes that are in the system.  This shouldn't be a partisan issue. Everyone sees this, Republicans and Democrats alike.  So my focus is this. How do we actually get this done and not make it into a partisan food fight here but actually do what is right for the American people and help bump the economy to be able to help get us going again?  In my State--whether you live in Valliant, Gotebo, Healton, Sayre, Muskogee, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, or Lawton--this matters because everyone unfortunately pays taxes. Everyone knows it is a necessary thing, but we want to have it as simple as possible and to have it as low as possible, and we want to make sure it is as fair as possible.  So the framework has been presented this past week. It is a simple framework for how we deal with tax policy. It talks about consolidating our rates. We have seven rates now. We would drop that down to four rates. There would be a 0-percent rate, a 12-percent, a 25-percent, and a 35-percent rate.  Now, some folks have asked me about the 0-percent rate, because a lot of Americans say one simple thing: Every American is an American, and every American should pay a little bit in taxes. I would agree, by the way. But every American is paying some taxes. For those folks at the lowest end of the scale, I would propose dropping the rate to zero for them on income taxes, but they are paying their fair share in property tax, in gas tax, and in sales tax. They are helping their local fire department and their local police department. They are paying for the roads that are federally subsidized, based on their gas tax. They are paying taxes, but if they are not at a rate and at an income high enough to be able to survive at that rate, then let's drop theirs to 0 percent for income tax. They will keep some of the other taxes so they can still contribute to society and still be a part of this great  Dropping those rates down to the lowest bracket being 0 percent for income tax, then 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent is a pretty standard rate. Quite frankly, this is something that was proposed in the Simpson-Bowles proposal before, which was a bipartisan proposal, for it to be able to come out, on how we can reform the system.  Eliminating the alternative minimum tax--do you want to talk about a complicated tax code? Basically, we have two Tax We have the standard Tax Code, and then we have the alternative minimum tax. Everyone who does their taxes has to do them twice to be able to evaluate which one of the codes they actually fit into. Now, if are using an electronic system, you lose track of it because the electronic system on the computer is doing that for you. But the AMT dramatically increases the complexity of the code. We should do away with that.  If we want to be able to protect the folks who are in the lowest bracket, then let's double what is the standard deduction. Right now the standard deduction is about $12,000. Let's double that to about $24,000. That $24,000 amount for families would mean that the first $24,000 of income that you would make as a family would fall into that 0-percent bracket. So you are paying zero income tax to the Federal Government until you make more than $24,000. That protects a lot of families in the lowest end of the bracket to make sure they are not falling into this.  Quite frankly, in Oklahoma, most Oklahomans just use the standard deduction. They don't itemize. Doubling the standard deduction would mean that for a lot of those specialized deductions that everyone else gets, it actually flattens that out. It makes it fair. The 1 thing I hear from people when they fill out their taxes is not only that they filled them out and turned them in, but they say: I have no idea whether I did them right. It was so complicated, and I don't know if it is right. Then, the second thing they say, though, right behind that, is this: Why is it that, when I read through the hundred pages of instructions on the 1040 form, every deduction seems to be for someone else?  So let's increase the standard deduction so everybody gets a flatter, simpler, and fairer system, and let's keep the biggest of the deductions that most Americans use, like the charitable deduction or the mortgage interest deduction. If there are any two deductions that most people use, it is those two. So let's protect those two in the system.  As for reducing the corporate tax rate, I have folks say that it only benefits the biggest businesses. I always smile and say: Those are actually people who employ people. If you reduce the corporate rate, that means they are more competitive internationally and that means they are not having to move their corporate headquarters overseas.  For years, as a nation we have used the carrot-and-stick approach on trying to keep businesses here in the United States; that is, if they go overseas, beat them with a stick and try to punish them for trying to move. Why don't we use the carrot approach? Why don't we find out why they are moving overseas and fix that? Many of these companies are moving overseas because of the very high corporate tax rate here in the United Let's fix that. Over the decades, many of our competing nations have done that. We should fix that. That increases the number of jobs, that increases economic activity, and that keeps American jobs in  We should deal with the child tax credit and continue to be able to protect that for families.  We can deal with how we do expensing. Now, if you don't run a business, that doesn't matter much to you. But if you are the one who owns the small business, you understand how expensing works. If you have a cost to your business this year and if you can't write it off in this year, you have to expand that out, and you know that slows you down.  Here are the basics. If you are running a small business and you need to buy a new pickup for your business, if it takes you years to be able to depreciate that out, you are slower to do it. But if you know you can depreciate it out this year in your business, you are more likely to buy that. So that business buys a new truck this year. Well, that not only benefits that business in having new equipment, but it also benefits the Ford dealership down the street that actually sold them the truck, and it benefits all of the people in the area who helped supply that vehicle. So it trickles down through the rest of the economy.  There are ways to be able to accomplish all of these things and to be able to be as simple as we possibly can be.  There has been a lot of conversation about worldwide taxation as well. People seem to get confused on that area because most people don't live in that world. Here are the basics of it: Right now, if you are an American company and you are selling things overseas and[[Page S6305]]doing business overseas, when you make a profit overseas and you try to bring that money back, you get taxed overseas at their tax rate, which you should, in that country you are making the product and selling it, but you get taxed again when you bring it back to the United We are the only country that does it that way.  If we will just simplify the system, it will actually encourage companies to be able to stay in America and then do business all over the world rather than moving their company out of It is a simple way to be able to do it, and it is a way that we can do and should do. You will hear the term ``repatriation,'' and that is really what it is about. It is Americans being able to move their money from overseas accounts back to the United States and get that money moving.  There was a lot of conversation about the stimulus plan back in 2009 trying to get almost a trillion dollars of government money--that is money from you and me--and to be able to move that around in a stimulus package. Let me give you the figure. Right now, it is estimated that American companies have about $2.5 trillion of private money parked overseas that they are not going to bring back to our economy because of the high cost of the tax coming back. If we were able to change that system, $2.5 trillion of private money would move from overseas back into the United What effect would that have on our economy? I would stipulate that it would be a pretty dramatic effect that it would have on our economy.  We can fix this. We can resolve this. This shouldn't be as hard as we are making it, and it can be a bipartisan approach to be able to address some basic things--taking care of our families, making sure we are watching out for those who are in poverty, simplifying the code, making sure deductions aren't for a few but that they are spread out across the way that we handle it, protecting things like charitable giving and the mortgage interest deduction and things that most Americans use. These are the parameters we are trying to be able to work through over the next couple of weeks.  Hopefully in the coming months, as we work through all the details in the committee process with amendments and coming to the floor and being able fight our way through the process, we will be able to actually get to a decision that will help us long term as a nation. This is something that can and should be resolved. It is one of the issues I have to raise to this body again.  This body has had a hard time actually moving on the biggest issues we face as a nation because the rules of this body prohibit us from debating them. The rules haven't changed over the past multiple decades, but the way we operate has. The American people are ticked about it, and rightfully so. The Senators in this body are frustrated with it. May I remind us that the rules of the Senate are set by the Senate? So if we are frustrated with the rules, we should address them.  Many of you have heard me speak about this in the past.  There are three basic rule changes that I think will change dramatically how business gets done in the The biggest one is the filibuster rule. We have two filibusters for every single bill that comes up. There is one at the beginning. You have to get 60 votes to start debate; you have to get 60 votes to stop debate; then the bill passes with 51. That needs to change. We should take away the first 60 votes at the beginning. We should be able to get onto a bill. Regardless of whether it is Republicans or Democrats in the majority, the majority party should be able to bring up a bill and debate it without being stopped. Let's bring up any issue and actually debate it. Let's not inhibit debate in this body. If we can't find agreement, keep the 60 votes at the end of it so we can keep the debate going until it gets resolved, but we should be able to debate the issues.  The second big issue is that we have to deal with nominations in an appropriate time period. Currently, my Democratic colleagues are forcing the long periods of time in debate for every single nominee who comes up. I had folks say that is what Republicans did in the past. That is actually not true. This is the first time it has happened like this.  This week, we are going to move four nominees for the President in 1 week--four. Under the current structure, it will take 11 years for President Trump to get his staff. Let me give you a barometer of where things have been in the past. As of yesterday, President Trump had 153 confirmations. At this same point, President Obama had 337 total. President Bush had 358 total at this same point. President Trump is not getting his nominees heard, and they are being slow-walked through the process.  We have to fix that. A simple way to fix it is to allow only 2, 4, or 8 hours of debate, not this protracted 30 hours of debate per nominee. It is already a resolved issue. Everybody knows it. These individuals have already gone through committee. They were already voted on in committee. By the time they get to the floor, it is resolved. The 30 hours of debate time is purely delay tactics. We should be able to resolve that within 2, 4, or 8 hours total.  Here is a radical idea: If we want to get the Senate going again, we can agree to a rule change that would allow for what is called dual-tracking. We would do nominations in the morning and legislation in the afternoon. Right now, we can only do one thing at a time in the Senate, so while we are waiting on a nomination vote, everything waits until that is done. It slows down the process. Why can't we do nominations in the morning and legislation in the afternoon?  There are basic rule changes that will help that are not partisan issues. They are designed to get the Senate moving regardless of who is in the majority. We have to resolve this long term. If we don't, the American people will continue to be frustrated, and we as Senators will continue to be frustrated.                    Detention of Andrew Brunson  Madam President, this weekend is an anniversary I don't like bringing up. One year ago this weekend, a gentleman named Andrew Brunson was detained in He has been a pastor in Turkey for more than 20 years, and he is a U.citizen. He has faithfully served the people of Turkey for two decades. A year ago this weekend, he was picked up by local authorities and was detained for months and months without charges. He was just swept up and held.  Things are changing rapidly in Turkey right now. Turkey is not the same NATO ally and friend of the United States that they have been. The leadership of Turkey is radically changing the nature of that very open democracy and is shutting it down to become more and more of an authoritarian government. American citizens who do business there, who do mission work there, who have friends and family there, need to be aware that Americans are being swept up and detained without charges and held. In the case of Brunson, he has been held for a year. I have to warn fellow Americans that Turkey is not necessarily a safe place to do business in and travel to anymore.  Right now, Turkey has the authority to release He is an American citizen and a pastor. They have the ability to do that.  Recently, the Appropriations Committee passed an amendment in an appropriations bill giving additional authorities to our State Department to take action against Turkish officials who hold American citizens like this and to put specific sanctions on those individuals. I hope that in the days ahead, our State Department will use that tool in their toolbox to apply pressure on the Turkish people to not impose arbitrary detention on U.citizens. We can push back on the  I hope that in the days ahead, the Turkish Government turns back around to more of an open democracy. They have been a nation in the past that was historic for their stand for religious liberty and democracy in that region. We would like to see a Turkish ally that still stands for religious liberty and the protection of all citizens in the days ahead.  With that, I yield the floor.

600,topic-id,2020,"Madam President, I want to be able to give a quick update to this body on a conversation that started yesterday and has been ongoing for months about Russia and their interference in our elections and how they are trying to engage with us in a way that much of Europe has seen for decades but that we just haven't seen in the United  Yesterday, Senator Burr and Senator Warner stood up and gave an update of where we are in the status of the investigation of the Senate Select Committee on They walked through some of the statistics. We have done over 100 interviews. We have 4,000 pages of transcript from those interviews. We have 100,000 documents that we have gone through so far, and there is more to go. We have completed some areas where we have interviewed everyone who we could possibly interview in that area. In other areas, as we do one interview, they quote a couple of other people, and we chase down those individuals, and it continues. So parts of the investigation are not done at this point, but some of it is.  Several aspects are clear from the investigation, though, again, it is not complete, and we will have a final document at the end. Some of the areas that are clear are that Russia was trying to use active measures to engage us in our last election. That part is very, very clear.  The question comes for many people: Why would they do that? Quite frankly, this is the way Russia has worked for a very long time--this asymmetric warfare they do where they try to constantly interfere in other people's thoughts and conflicts. They have done it across Europe for a long time. They are now doing it here.  Some of this is a product of Russia's having a very weak economy and trying to find some way to bolster themselves up. In the last 2 years, the Russian ruble has dropped 40 percent in value. As they struggle with low oil prices and struggle in the way they function with their government with the oligarchs and have a select group of people who can succeed and other folks who continue to struggle around the country and as they struggle under that system where they have fake elections and such, they try to reach out to other countries and try to interfere in our elections to make us look like them.  We have a free press that they try to engage in. We have free speech that they don't have in We have freedom of religion, which they don't have in We have the ability to be able to have disputes on political issues. They clearly don't have that in If you disagree with leadership in Russia, you will end up in prison. If you disagree with leadership in the United States, you will end up on It is very different to be in an open society like ours. But they reach into what we consider a strength and try to make it our weakness.  We are going to try to get the facts out on this over the next several months as we work through this process. We are going to expose what Russia is really trying to do. Do they use some overt propaganda networks like Sputnik Radio and RT? Is their Russian propaganda on multiple cable and satellite channels throughout the United States? Their version of the facts are designed to create discord in our That is what they do.  They also have ways that are not quite as overt. They reach in on social media platforms. They have their trolls in Russia who have thousands of fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter and other social media apps. They use those thousands of apps to search around any news in America and find a place where there is conflict in America and then try to amp up the volume.  To be clear, the Russians are not creating conflict in We have plenty of it. We disagree on issues. Again, it is our free society. When we disagree on something, we disagree on[[Page S6336]]it publically and sometimes loud. That is who we are as We try to work things out, sometimes at a high volume. But just like two kids who are fighting on the playground in the fifth grade--remember those two kids that started a fight and their friends were watching them? Then, eventually, someone on the other side of the playground started yelling ``fight,'' and the crowd started forming. The Russians aren't starting the fight. They aren't even in the fight. They are the kids on the far side of the playground, trying to get more people to run to the fight. They are not starting the Twitter wars and the battles, but they look at where America is divided, issues like race. Their troll farms will try to find areas where we disagree, such as areas of race, and reach in and try to amplify the volume on that by repeating accusations and by trying to be even more hostile online. They are trying to stoke disunity in our  It is important that we know that every time you see something with a high number of hashtag counts that goes up, it is not always Americans who are pushing that up. Occasionally, it is an outside body trying to raise the volume and make a conflict look even bigger than it already is in America because they are into sowing discord. That is what they love to do. That is what the rest of the nations have seen them do. We should be very clear that the Russians are trying to continue to sow chaos into us.  They have reached into our election systems. In the previous couple of weeks, the FBI notified 21 different States that during the last election season, the Russians tried to interfere in their election process as a Now, that doesn't mean they did interfere. That means they reached in and tested systems. That means they tried to go into voter databases to see if they could access a voter database to see who was registered to vote. They tried to get into a secretary of State's office in a local State to see if they could figure out how they do their elections. That means they reached into systems in States to see what voting machines they used and if they tried to connect them in. They were trying to find out how they do elections, learn as much as they could about their process, and see how far they could get.  Through all of our work, we have yet to find a single vote that was changed. The Russians didn't get into voting machines. They didn't alter the election in any way, but they were constantly probing through multiple States to see what they could get access to.  Now, it is my belief that they are preparing for something else. They are trying to see what they could get access to in the last election to see if they could get back into it and do even more in the next election. We should be aware of that. We should be aware not only of their propaganda, but we should be aware that they are going after our elections to see if they can find a way, at the end of the election, to make us doubt the outcomes.  What can we do about that? I will give you several ideas. One of them, I would say, is that we need to protect the primacy of States running the elections. There is absolutely no need for the Federal Government to go to States and take over their election process. It is a constitutional protection that those States have to be able to run their elections, but every State is also responsible to do it. Of the 21 States that I noted here that the Russians tried to engage in, they couldn't get to a single voting machine. The States are already doing a good job, but they need help.  There is no reason the State of Oklahoma should have to work alone to be able to protect itself from the Russians trying to invade it in the cyber attack. They are going to need some allies to come along with them, but the States should still be able to run the system. There should be more sharing between the State and the Federal There should be an opportunity for the Federal Government to be able to say to a State, earlier than 10 months after the election: Hey, you are being hacked. For the FBI to notify States a couple of weeks ago that they were hacked in the 2016 elections is a little late. When it is occurring, we need to have that engagement between State IT folks and Federal IT folks. We need to be able to have that conversation as it is ongoing so the State can take protective measures as it is occurring. We need to have that cooperation between States and the Federal We need to be able to help States come up with ways they can audit their system after the election is over.  When every election occurs, you should be able to audit it and make sure the machines that were running the election actually were not hacked. You can verify that. In Oklahoma, we have optical scanners. You fill out a paper ballot. You run it through an optical scanner at the end of the election time, and they can count everything from the optical scanner. If there is any question, they can go back to the paper and actually do a hand count. We can literally audit our elections and their process. It is a safe system that we have set up in our Every State does it differently, but I would encourage every State to set up a system where they can audit their system.  We know this year that the Russians were trying to engage in our election. It could be someone else who could do it. Any number of groups could try to interfere in our process. It is basic common sense to say we should have a system of elections we can actually audit. Perhaps Russia, in the days ahead, hopes that our Nation will be more like theirs. We will not be.  We are the longest constitutional Republic in the world. We still need the world. We still put out our values about free speech, free press, freedom of religion, and opportunities for individuals to actually engage and to have conflict with their own government and to be able to disagree publically on things. We still can disagree with each other. We need to be aware that they want to turn us into them. I would hope for the sake of the Russian people, in the days ahead, that they could be more like us.  Ronald Reagan told a story about a friend of his who had a conversation with a Cuban refugee fleeing from communism and oppression in Cuba in 1964. He said that his friend, this Cuban refugee, said:       If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to.      This is the last stand on  We are still a role model for the rest of the world.

268,topic-id,548,"Mr.President, last Friday, President Trump announced that he will slash our refugee admissions to 45,000 in fiscal year 2018--the lowest annual target since the passage of the 1980 Refugee Instead of embracing our moral and legal obligation to address the worst refugee crisis in global history, as has been our tradition for decades, President Trump seems intent on relinquishing our role as the humanitarian leader of the world. The dimming of our beacon is not just a symbolic loss; tens of thousands of human lives are now placed at risk.  There is no rational basis for this shameful retreat. The administration's own analysis shows that refugees contributed a net benefit of $63 billion to our economy between 2005 and 2014. National security leaders across the political spectrum, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, are unanimous in their view that refugees are the most stringently vetted travelers to the United Our commitment to welcoming refugees plays a critical role in strengthening our alliances in areas of conflict.  The President stands alone in his disregard for the staggering suffering we are witnessing around the world. Last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee--on which I serve as vice chairman--unanimously approved a funding bill that demonstrates our unwavering commitment to refugees. It fully funds offices that are critical to the continuity of refugee programs and even provides a $50 million increase to the State Department's refugee assistance and resettlement missions. Our bipartisan bill repudiates any claims by President Trump that the United States is unwilling to commit the resources required to fund a refugee program that honors our history as a refuge for the persecuted. Even the conservative Heritage Foundation has called on President Trump to set annual refugee admissions ``based on historical refugee levels,'' which have never dropped below 67,000 per year since the beginning of the Reagan administration.  I am proud that my own State of Vermont has welcomed and resettled approximately 7,500 refugees since fiscal year 1989. The city of Rutland was preparing to resettle an additional 100 refugees mainly from Syria last year and this fiscal year, until the Trump administration inexplicably halted certain refugee admissions and announced drastic reductions to the refugee resettlement program. Vermont and other States stand ready to do more to address this global crisis, but the leader of our country is shamefully directing them to do less.  Presidents have an obligation to protect our Nation's fundamental values. Presidents of both parties have long understood this. They have not forsaken our history as a nation founded by enterprising individuals seeking refuge and freedom from persecution. They have ensured that our policies do not betray our proud tradition as the humanitarian leader of the world.  This decision illustrates that President Trump is misinformed and that he has caved to the counsel of xenophobic voices seeking to hollow out our refugee program. By shutting our doors to thousands of innocent human beings fleeing persecution and tyranny, he misunderstands the history of the country he was elected to lead. I hope that he reconsiders his callous decision, as the law in fact empowers him to do, in light of emerging humanitarian concerns. Nothing less than our Nation's identity as an unwavering beacon of hope during the world's darkest chapters is at stake.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgS6285.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 36, PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD",2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
646,topic-id,758,"Mr.President, I want to speak briefly about a recent report by the Secretary of State concerning, among other things, impunity within Indonesia's military. This has been a concern of mine, and of many others, for decades. Senate Report 114-290, which accompanies division J of the fiscal year 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act, requires the Secretary of State to submit a report on steps taken by the Indonesian military to, 1, deny promotion, suspend from active service, and/or prosecute and punish military officers who have violated human rights, and to refine further the military's mission and develop an appropriate defense budget to carry out that mission; 2, cooperate with civilian judicial authorities to resolve cases of violations of human rights; 3, implement reforms that increase the transparency and accountability of the military's budget and operations, and achieve divestment of military businesses; and 4, allow unimpeded access to Papua; respect due process and freedom of expression, association, and assembly in Papua; and release Papuans and Moluccans imprisoned for peaceful political activity.  The Secretary submitted this report on September 12, 2017, and the information it contains is both disturbing and disappointing.  Indonesia became a democracy after many years of brutal, corrupt dictatorship under President He had the unwavering support of the Indonesian military, which was responsible for widespread atrocities not only against Indonesian citizens who opposed Suharto but later against the[[Page S6317]]people of East Timor and He was also a Cold War ally of the United  Suharto is gone, and Indonesia has changed for the better. It remains an important ally of the United States, but no democracy can achieve its potential without an independent judiciary and security forces that are professional and accountable or that fails to defend such fundamental rights as freedom of expression and association.  While the Indonesian military is no longer the criminal enterprise it was during the Suharto period, impunity for past crimes remains the norm. As the Secretary of State's report notes, the Government of Indonesia continues to take inadequate steps to hold members of the Indonesian military accountable for human rights violations. One stark example includes the reemergence on active duty and promotions of several former members of the Special Forces' Rose Team, who were convicted in 1999 of kidnapping pro-democracy activists. In another deplorable incident, the Government of Indonesia appointed as the head of the Armed Forces Strategic Intelligence Agency a military officer who was convicted in 2003 for the murder of prominent Papuan civil society leader Theys  Furthermore, military-related entities, such as foundations and cooperatives, continue to hold large amounts of land and other properties and businesses, despite the government's claim that the military has largely divested itself of private enterprises.  Military personnel are still not subject to civilian judicial authorities. Instead, they are tried by military tribunals which lack transparency and often grant much shorter prison sentences than any credible judicial authority would deem appropriate. Although four district courts are authorized to adjudicate cases involving human rights violations, none of them have heard or ruled on any human rights cases since 2005.  Simply authorizing changes or espousing rhetoric without following up with tangible action makes a mockery of the concept of reform.  Other findings in the report are also illustrative of a resistance to reform. For example, the report states, ``Indonesian law provides that military prosecutors are accountable to the Supreme In practice, however, they are responsible to the Indonesian Armed Forces for the application of laws.''  With respect to the Moluccas and Papua, the report states that ``according to international NGO reports, approximately 10 Moluccan independence activists, who were arrested in 2007, remain in custody. . . In January 2015, a court sentenced Simon Siya, a leader in the Moluccan independence movement, to five years in prison on treason charges. He remains in prison. The court also sentenced seven others to two-to-three years for displaying a banned separatist flag during a peaceful pro-independence demonstration in 2014. . . NGOs in Papua continued to report widespread monitoring of their activities by intelligence officials as well as indirect threats and intimidation.''  Accusing people of being traitors and imprisoning them for peacefully supporting self-determination is itself a violation of human rights.  Indonesia has come a long way since the dark days of President Suharto, but when it comes to military reform, it has fallen far short. In January 2018, it will be 10 years since Suharto's death; yet the military remains a largely opaque, unaccountable institution that has not even acknowledged the extent of its responsibility for past crimes. That needs to change.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgS6316-4.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 36, PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD",2017,4,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
909,topic-id,1013,"Mr.President, in 2015, the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, did something that can be all too rare Washington: It listened to the American people. After a record number of Americans spoke in favor of clear rules to protect a free and open Internet, the FCC voted to adopt strong net neutrality protections that accomplished this goal. These protections, which ensure that innovation and free speech can flourish online, are currently under threat as the FCC now moves to repeal them. On net neutrality and on many other key telecommunications policy issues, Chairman Pai has stood against consumers, startups, and small businesses. Today I choose to stand with them and with millions of Americans who support net neutrality by opposing his reappointment.  Vermonters have been clear that they want strong FCC rules in place to ensure that the Internet remains the ultimate platform for economic opportunity and free expression. These protections are particularly important for small businesses, which compete on the internet's global stage against the largest companies in the world. The Vermont Country Store is a great example of a small company that has taken advantage of the promise of an open Family-owned with a rich history dating back to 1897, the internet offered new opportunities to extend the company's reach. As fifth generation storekeeper Cabot Orton said when he testified in Vermont about the FCC's effort to craft net neutrality protections in 2014:       We don't want to imagine an America with two Internets: a      fast one for giant corporations and a slow one for everybody      else. We don't want to imagine being held for ransom by      telecom behemoths and cable monopolies just to reach our      customers with the same speed and convenience that global      conglomerates enjoy . . . A small business website that is no      longer protected from giant Internet toll-keepers would have      one choice: pay to play. Failing that, a company becomes the      proverbial tree falling in the forest with no one there to      hear it.  Chairman Pai has shown total disregard for the concerns of businesses like the Vermont Country In proposing to repeal the existing net neutrality protections, he makes no mention of their importance to the small business community. Instead of recognizing the very real impact on small businesses of stripping away these protections, Chairman Pai claims that there are no possible harms these protections could be designed to prevent.  This is particularly clear when he discusses the current rule banning harmful paid prioritization agreements that would create the type of two-tiered internet small businesses fear. Chairman Pai claims that there was no need for this rule because some large internet service providers, ISPs, said they ``had no plans'' to engage in this kind of behavior. This is despite the fact that at least one major ISP said outright in its 2014 FCC filing that it wanted the ``flexibility'' to charge websites for priority access and that, even though it had no plans for these arrangements, they ``should be permissible and should be tested.''  I introduced legislation to ban pay-to-play deals online before the FCC adopted its rule because of the harm they would cause small businesses like the Vermont Country I find Chairman Pai's failure to understand the importance of a level playing field for small businesses extremely disconcerting.  Not only is Chairman Pai ignoring the small business community by barreling ahead to repeal net neutrality protections, he is also ignoring the clear will of the American people. Over 22 million Americans have submitted comments in the proceeding he started to repeal these critical protections, shattering records at the Poll after poll has found overwhelming bipartisan support for net neutrality. In Washington, Chairman Pai calls net neutrality protections burdensome and unnecessary. In Vermont, we just call them common sense.  Vermonters also value their privacy rights and want basic protections in place to protect their personal data. In 2016, over Chairman Pai's objections, the FCC put in place important privacy protections to prevent ISPs from selling their sensitive information, including their web browsing history, without their consent. These rules also included basic data security and data breach notification requirements. We have seen how important it is to hold companies to basic data security and breach notification standards in the wake of the total disregard Equifax showed for protecting sensitive consumer information.  Unfortunately, Chairman Pai was a strong supporter of the resolution of disapproval passed by this Congress that permanently repealed the FCC's privacy and data security protections. At a time when the personal information of every single American is under constant threat, Chairman Pai thought it was simply too much to ask for ISPs to take reasonable steps to secure their subscribers data and notify them if a breach occurs.  Chairman Pai's approach to rural broadband, which is one of the most pressing issues for Vermonters, also raises cause for concern. Just recently, he has proposed to effectively lower the speed standard used to measure whether Americans have access to adequate broadband service. As someone who represents a rural State, ensuring that we accurately measure how many Americans lack this essential service is critical. Under the current standard set by the previous FCC, 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to true high-speed broadband service. In contrast, only 4 percent of urban Americans lack access.  I supported the FCC's decision to set a high minimum broadband speed to use as the baseline for comparing rural and urban areas. All Americans deserve the same quality of broadband service, whether they live in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont or the heart of Kansas Rural Americans should not be held to a lower standard simply so that Chairman Pai can rig the numbers to falsely claim that he has closed the digital divide once and for all.  Chairman Pai has shown far too often in his time at the FCC that he will side with Goliath over David and that he will ignore the overwhelming sentiment of the American people. With the fate of the open internet and many other critical telecommunications issues at stake, I must oppose Chairman Pai's nomination.

1165,topic-id,1285,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to August ``Gus'' Schumacher, Jr., who passed away on September 24. Gus was an altruist who dedicated his life to discovering ways to help both farmers and those who are hungry, both here in the United States and abroad. His integrity, creativity, and his great courage over decades to sustain a passionate commitment to assisting the poor and hungry, as well as our farmers and rural communities, leaves an immeasurable legacy that will not soon be forgotten.  I have known Gus since his days in From the first time I met him, it was clear his passion was infectious. He brought that passion and his creative ideas to us here in Congress when he was the Massachusetts secretary of agriculture. It was that passion that propelled Senator Kerry and me to craft the first legislation--which became law--to create a farmers' market coupon demonstration project in 10 In 1988, the first year of the demonstration program, we secured $2 million in the Agriculture appropriations bill for the Women, Infants and Children, WIC, Farmers Market Demonstration I was--and remain--proud that Vermont was one of those 10 States chosen for the initial WIC Farmers Market Demonstration Now, nearly 30 years later, the program helps over 7 million nutritionally at risk women, infants, and children across the United None of this would have been possible without Gus's brilliant innovation, determination, and leadership.  Gus put into action his innovative ideas first in Massachusetts and then across the country and around the world with his work at the Foreign Agricultural Service and as Under Secretary of Farm and Foreign Agricultural His work led to a greater emphasis on organizing direct marketing, farmers' co-ops, farmers' markets, crop diversifications, and expanding opportunities for farmer-owned packaging, distributing, and processing facilities. More recently, his leadership and endless resourcefulness was on display through his work at Wholesome For Gus, the only things that mattered were that there were struggling farmers and hungry people who needed help. It did not matter where because Gus understood that hunger transcends all languages and cultures.  We were fortunate to have Gus come to Vermont several times, both during his work at the USDA and Wholesome During his visits with the USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service, Gus's unflinching public service was always on display. He came to meet with the farmers, the food processors, and the dairy co-ops. He came to help Vermonters improve their lives, and I will always be grateful for that.  His recent passing reminds all of us of the need to continue his fight. The fight for the hungry, for our farmers, and for the constant work of more fully realizing America's potential as both a great and a good nation. Gus believed, as should we all, that hunger should not exist in this country. We have the food and know-how to end it. Gus offered creative solutions to fight it. Now we need the political will to do it.  I ask unanimous consent that the September 27 Washington Post obituary that describes Gus's life and career be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From The Washington Post, 27, 2017]   Gus Schumacher, a Force in the Farm-to-Table Movement, Dies at 77                            (By Bert Barnes)       Gus Schumacher, a fourth-generation farmer and third-     ranking official at the Agriculture Department, told the      story of his epiphany about food hundreds of times.       It was the end of a summer afternoon in 1980 at a farmers      market in Boston, and he was helping his brother load up his      truck with unsold produce grown on their family property in      Lexington, The bottom fell out of a box of pears,      scattering the fruit into the gutter.       There, a young mother with two little boys eagerly gathered      them into the folds of her unhemmed shirt. She was a single      mom, she explained, dependent on food stamps, which back then      made fresh fruit and vegetables prohibitively expensive for      her. The pear spill was a bonanza.       For Mr.Schumacher, he would say later, it was a seminal      moment in his life. He grew up on a farm, and it had never      occurred to him that parents would find it hard to provide      their children with fresh fruit and vegetables.       He would change it, he told himself.       Mr.Schumacher--who in a 50-year career also served as the      Massachusetts commissioner of food and agriculture, a food      project manager and agriculture development officer for the      World Bank and finally a co-founder of a nonprofit group that      tries to improve affordable access to fresh, locally grown      food--died 24 at his home in The cause was      an apparent heart attack, said his wife, Susan Holaday      He was 77.       Since that farmers-market epiphany, Mr.Schumacher helped      make food assistance programs more generous in allowances for      fresh fruit and vegetables. He also became a force in the      farm-to-table movement, encouraging restaurants and retail      stores to buy produce locally.[[Page S6318]]       In 2013, Mr.Schumacher received the James Beard      Foundation's Leadership Award for ``his lifelong efforts to      improve access to fresh local food in underserved      communities.''       In Boston, the Globe wrote about a time several years ago      when Mr.Schumacher, dining out at tony Hamersley's Bistro,      sat down at a table, reached into a brown paper bag and      pulled out a shiny, ripe red tomato. He asked for a serrated      knife, olive oil and a plate, then proceeded to make himself      a salad.       ``Who's this guy who's making his own salad?'' chef-owner      Gordon Hamersley wanted to know. His own tomatoes came from      Where had Mr.Schumacher's come from? ``Twenty      minutes from your doorstep,'' Mr.Schumacher said.       That scene, or a version of it, would play over and over      again between 1984 and 1990 when Mr.Schumacher was      agriculture chief for He was always asking      chefs whether they knew any farmers who could supply them      food directly. He created market coupon programs for seniors      and low-income families with children. He chastised breakfast      diners for serving English jellies instead of American ones.       ``Gus was instrumental in bringing two seemingly obvious      groups together who never talked to each other--chefs and      farmers,'' Hamersley told the ``He's basically the      architect of chefs featuring locally grown produce. As      always, there was a team of people with him, but he was      sitting in the chair.''       The Washington Post reported on Mr.Schumacher's work with      refugee and immigrant farmers all over the United He      encouraged them to grow and market their native vegetables,      such as amaranth. From New England, the New York Times      reported, Mr.Schumacher made personal deliveries of Asian      greens that included pea tendrils, Chinese chive blossoms and      Cambodian spearmint to the Washington restaurant       August Schumacher was born in Lincoln, Mass., on      4, 1939. He grew up on a farm in Lexington, and his father      was one of the largest parsnip growers in His      grandfather and great-grandfather were farmers in New York      They grew winter vegetables in glass-enclosed      hothouses.       Mr.Schumacher graduated from Harvard University in 1961      and attended the London School of       Over his career, he had a variety of consultancies, served      as Massachusetts agriculture chief from 1984 to 1990 and was      the USDA undersecretary of agriculture for farm and foreign      agricultural services from 1997 to 2001.       Since 2008 he had served as founding board chairman of      Wholesome Wave in Bridgeport, Conn., which seeks to increase      access to affordable, locally grown fruits and vegetables.       His first marriage, to Barbara Kerstetter, ended in      divorce. Survivors include his wife of 25 years, Susan      Holaday Schumacher of Washington; a stepdaughter, Valarie      Karasz of Brooklyn; and two grandchildren.

When Juab County had trouble with its wilderness boundaries, it was Donna who helped county officials with the realignment.  These two examples show that Donna was capable of tackling a wide range of problems. She was at home working on Social Security claims or public lands disputes. The important thing was that she could help. During a brief stint at FEMA, she even traveled to New York to help the people of that State recover from Superstorm  Donna worked hard for others, and she had a blast doing it. Her coworkers in Utah dubbed her the ``fun sheriff,'' not to be confused with the ``fun police,'' because she would often round up staff members for office parties.

Her love, enthusiasm, and excitement for life made her quick to laughter and friendship, while making her equally capable on her Harley-Davidson or the dance floor.  Of course, Donna's cheerfulness and sacrifice are not limited to her day job. She loves to teach the young as a primary teacher for her church ward and to serve her neighbors and family.

The time she spent caring for her mother, son Trevor, and step-daughter Karen during the final stages of their lives demonstrated her conviction about the eternal nature of families.  If it wasn't plain enough already, let me say it plainer still: Donna Sackett is an inexhaustible source of love for others. She models Christ's love through her deeds.  In her job, as in her private life, Donna Sackett displayed a servant's heart. I will miss her dearly, and so will all the Utahns she touched over her valuable career in public service.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgS6286.txt,1501,PASSING COMMONSENSE LAWS REGARDING FIREARMS,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a member, yes, of the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee, and I know, because we work on this each and every day, that our national budget is a statement of our national priorities and our values. I know very well that the Republicans have put forward, quite frankly, a sinister budget whose chief purpose is to hand tax breaks to billionaires.  Budgets are moral documents. They should not be rigged in favor of special interests and the wealthy few, but the Republican budget is. Our Nation's budget should prioritize working families and the middle class, too many of whom are making low wages and living below the poverty line.  It should assist those struggling to find a job and investment in workforce training, education, job creation, and job training. Instead, this Republican budget creates tax cuts for billionaire, millionaires, and corporations.  Our budget should expand to protect healthcare for all. Instead, this budget steals nearly $2 trillion from lifesaving Medicaid and  Our budget should also invest in our crumbling infrastructure, which, of course, creates jobs. But the Republican budget cuts funding for our roads, our bridges, and our railways.  Finally, with nearly 40 million Americans living in poverty, our Nation's budget should contain a serious and effective strategy to end poverty, especially for communities of color and[[Page H7784]]rural communities who have higher poverty rates.  The House Republican budget does not do this. In fact, it slashes programs that help create good-paying jobs for struggling families by $5.4 trillion. No family in America should be forced to go hungry. Yet, because wages are so low across this country, millions of families now rely on nutrition and food assistance. Yet this budget cuts $150 billion from SNAP, food assistance, and nutrition assistance, which will create more poverty for people who are working. It doesn't make any sense. It is fundamentally immoral.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr.Collins of Georgia). The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Congressional Progressive Caucus' people's budget. Today, millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet and millions more are working hard trying to find a job. Paychecks for everyday Americans are shrinking, while corporations are reaping record profits. Yet, instead of developing a budget to create jobs and to help American families, the House Republicans ``balance'' their budget once again on the backs of struggling families. And for what? To protect tax cuts for billionaires and millionaires and corporations. Again, this is totally disgraceful.  The CPC's people's budget stands in stark contrast to the House Republican budget. It creates 2 million good-paying jobs and invests $2 trillion in infrastructure. It includes a plan to lift more Americans out of poverty, and it invests in communities of color, like expanding computer science education.  It ends the Pentagon's slush fund, known as the overseas contingency account, that for far too long has padded the pockets and the wallets of defense[[Page H7825]]contractors at the taxpayers' expense. It also tackles waste, fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon by demanding audit readiness. It is hard to believe that the Republican budget goes $10 billion over what the Pentagon even requested.  Make no mistake, the people's budget does what the House Republican budget does not. It works for the American people, not special interests, nor defense contractors, or the 1 percent.

As a member of the Budget and the Appropriations Committees and as chair of our Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity, I am really proud that the Congressional Black Caucus budget includes $300 billion in investments into initiatives that have proven to lift millions out of poverty.  For example, it restores the cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, it extends emergency unemployment insurance, it expands access to affordable housing, and it also increases funding for job training and trade assistance programs.  The CBC budget creates a fair Tax Code that provides investments in communities. It boosts GDP by $329 billion and helps create 2 million jobs. This budget addresses poverty head on by investing $120 billion in creating jobs, $25 billion to restore our Nation's public housing, and $80 billion to modernize our schools.  Also, our budget employs the 10-20-30 formula championed by our assistant leader, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.Clyburn), by directing at least 10 percent of Federal spending into areas with poverty rates of more than 20 percent over the last 30 years.

He leaves behind his faithful wife Mary and their two sons, Stephen and  Robert Hales was born and raised in a faithful household in Long Island, He was an all-American boy who played baseball through college at the University of Utah but eventually traded in his baseball uniform for a flight suit, serving in the U.Air Force as a jet fighter pilot. Elder Hales's service as a military aviator would inform the rest of his life and certainly his entire ministry. He took with him the unit motto displayed on the side of his aircraft: ``Return With Honor.''  After his discharge from the military, Elder Hales entered the world of international business. In jobs around the world, he established a reputation as an enthusiastic leader who relished a challenge and dealt fairly with others. Because of these qualities, Elder Hales rose to become president of Paper Mate, a division of Later, he assumed senior executive positions at Max Factor Company, the Hughes Television Network, and Chesebrough-Pond's Manufacturing But Elder Hales never let work dominate his life, as so many executives do. Despite the enormous demands on his time, he stayed faithful to the more important commitments he made to his family and to his  So it was that Robert Hales, a business executive of international renowned, made an unusual decision in the prime of his life: He left the corporate world to give his all to the church. When Jesus said ``Come, follow me,'' Robert Hales left his nets straightaway and became a fisher of men.  Elder Hales was called to become the presiding bishop of the church in 1985, overseeing the church's vast charitable network. As bishop, he used the skills of a business executive not for profit but to help the least of those among us.  In 1994, Elder Hales was sustained to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a church position he held for 23 years until his passing just days ago. From this position as a watchman on the tower, he boldly proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and he also spoke out on such pressing societal issues as religious freedom. He saw that the erosion of religious belief in the United States was quickly devolving into social and political intolerance for religious people and institutions. But this prediction did not lead Elder Hales to despair, no; instead, he redoubled his efforts to edify the next generation--the young men and women who were in the preparatory period of life, as he termed it.  His addresses and sermons were full of moral exhortation and practical advice on living well. Don't walk, run to holiness, he urged his brothers and sisters in faith. Elder Hales knew that holiness is an activity, a pursuit to which we must consecrate our whole lives running the race and enduring to the end.  Through his example and through his words, Elder Hales taught that virtue is not just a good intention but a good deed reinforced and compounded by past deeds.  Elder Hales urged young men and women to embrace the joys of adulthood through marriage, child-rearing, and responsible citizenship. He knew that the way to true happiness lies in those sacrificial activities, not the selfish lifestyles that tempt so many today.  During one memorable address to the General Conference of the church, Elder Hales recounted the advice he received as a boy when he had been tempted to make a poor decision: ``Robert,'' his father had said to him, ``straighten up and fly right!'' From the testimony of his life, it is clear that Elder Hales honored his father's advice in the Air Force, in the workforce, in the household, and in the church. Elder Robert Hales flew right.

358,topic-id,401,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for supporting this legislation.  More than 120 years ago, the Utah Enabling Act, which enabled my State--now the greatest State in the country--to be admitted into the Union, was approved. This granted Utah the right to select acreage to support various public institutions, including public schools and universities. Now, 123 years later, much of the acreage made available for State selection remains outstanding.  The BLM's Pony Express Resource Management Plan governs management practices for public lands in Utah's Tooele, Utah, and Salt Lake It has identified thousands of acres within the plan's area as available for disposal. The State can presently obtain these lands via land exchange. However, the resource management plan does not explicitly state that these lands can be obtained using the unfulfilled land credits granted by the Utah Enabling                              {time}  1730  My bill, the Confirming State Land Grants for Education Act, would simply amend the Pony Express RMP to allow the State of Utah to use outstanding land grant credits to obtain lands within the limited area of RMP that already has been identified available for disposal.  This solution would satisfy both the State and Federal Government and help to keep the promises made to the State of Utah for more than 120 years. More importantly, it would ultimately raise funds for the benefit of Utah students by allowing Utah's School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, SITLA, to manage these lands for the benefit of students. As Utah finds more ways to fund public schools and public education, this bill helps provide much-needed resources.  Notably, the passage of H.2582 would not convey any land on its own. Existing conveyance processes would still apply.  Additionally, my bill does not dictate land use policies once the land is conveyed. As a former mayor, I respect the State and local officials and processes, and I certainly have no desire to supersede them. My bill is merely meant to facilitate the process that enables conveyance through the use of available selection credits.

We have enough natural disasters trying to tear down our homes and tear up our lives that we don't have to do that to each other.  I rise today as an American, as a wife, and mainly as a mother to address some of the double standards that we have in this country. As a member of the Select Panel on Infant Lives, I learned that Federal law increases criminal penalties for crimes involving pregnant women. These laws give protections to the mother and her unborn child--rightfully so.  However, this begs the question: When does the unborn have a right to protection just like their mother?  Obviously, this is an important issue.  Why is abortion not considered murder and killing a pregnant woman a double homicide?  Martin Luther King, Jr., said this about the civil rights movement: ``The Negro cannot win as long as he is willing to sacrifice the lives of his children for comfort and safety.'' How can the dream survive if we murder our children?  Each human life should be protected under the rule of law. Each life that feels pain should be free from being tortured.

441,topic-id,358,"Mr.Chair, I thank Ranking Member Yarmuth for the time to speak in opposition to the Republican budget.  As ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, I am really perplexed as to why the majority continues their assault on American excellence, following President Trump's lead and divesting from investments in American global leadership, science, and infrastructure.  This budget would cut $5 billion for domestic and international investments, while violating the Budget Control Act for defense spending and triggering a $72 billion sequester of all defense accounts.  My Republican colleagues might argue that slashing nondefense investments is necessary to reduce the debt, but this is a false choice. Why would the Republican majority give tax cuts to the very wealthiest if it means this country has to take a backseat to China in research and development or let our own workforce go without the training to fill 21st century jobs?  We know there is a role for government where the private sector has left voids. Many in the private sector believe we should be investing more in basic research, STEM programs, and public transportation. This budget and the appropriations bills that enact this budget have fallen short in these areas.  Given the budget is 6 months late and the appropriations process has actually moved before the budget, we do not have to guess the implications of the budget. We have seen what the Republicans would do under these draconian levels.  Just look, Mr.Chairman, at the Labor, Health, and Education bill that passed the House last month. That bill eliminated entire job training programs like apprenticeship grants, cut the Pell grant surplus, and eliminated Supporting Effective Instruction State grants, a $2 billion investment that reduces class sizes and improves classroom instruction. This cut would cost 8,500 teachers their jobs.  The transportation spending bill eliminated the Department of Transportation's major infrastructure grant program, TIGER, a direct contradiction to the President's promise to improve our Nation's infrastructure and which Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao confirms ``funds innovative projects that improve the safety of America's passengers and goods.''

It is a testament to our State's value of family, heritage, and traditions.  Some people may think our love of history means we cling to the past. It is the exact opposite.

114,topic-id,1445,"Mr.President, a tragedy took place in Las Vegas this week. It is a tragedy that has affected hundreds of families. It is a tragedy in which each and every one of us sends our prayers to those who have lost loved ones. And to those who have family members who are now hospitalized, we send our prayers to you as well, with the great hope that a full recovery is in their future.[[Page S6274]]  This was an unimaginable event that occurred in our country. It is now time for us to talk about this issue. There are many people who say this is not the time to talk about it, but the truth is, the only thing the National Rifle Association wants more than to sell lots of gun silencers is to put a silencer on the debate about gun safety legislation. The only thing the NRA wants more than allowing nationwide concealed carry laws is to conceal the overwhelming support for background checks. The only thing the NRA wants more than to stifle smart gun technology is to stifle debate on gun violence prevention.  So to anyone who says having this debate now is too soon, it is already too late for at least 59 people in Las Vegas and hundreds of others who were wounded. We should not wait another day.  We need to pass commonsense gun safety legislation so that we can hold a moment of silence for the National Rifle Association's stranglehold on American politics. That is what must end in our country.  We need a debate on this floor on background checks. We need a debate in this Chamber on whether we are going to do research on the relationship between guns and violence in our society. We don't need to debate the issue of bringing silencers into our society that can be attached to guns and that would have made it infinitely more difficult for the police to find where the shooter was or for people to know that they needed to hide or move to a more secure location. That would not have happened. We would not have had 59 deaths; we could have had 259 deaths, 559 deaths, or 959 deaths because a silencer would have given less notice to all of those people that they should be moving and hiding and protecting themselves and their loved ones.  On concealed carry, the Republicans are moving a bill that allows for someone to conceal a gun under a law in one State--because that State allows you to conceal a gun, you would be able to move into any other State and continue to conceal a gun even though that State's laws prohibit concealing guns. They want that law to move through.  So when the Republicans talk about debating gun control, what they are talking about is lessening the safety around these guns, lowering the standards that would protect people, and allowing for silencers to now be proliferating on these assault weapons, these weapons of war that should not be on the streets of our country and that have the capacity to kill people without people hearing them.  They say they are needed because we need to protect people's hearing when they are firing assault weapons. Well, it is more important that the police hear the bullets and that the people who might be hit hear the sound of those bullets as they are leaving the gun. That is going to provide far more protection. It is far more important that the police in a State or in a city know that someone has a concealed weapon. It is critically important for police protection. But the National Rifle Association does not want those kinds of protections to remain on the books. That is who they are. That is what they want.  What should we be debating? We should be debating background checks. We should be debating whether someone should be able to buy a gun on Instagram and turn it into an ``insta-gun'' without background checks. That is what we should be talking about out here.  Over 90 percent of Americans want stronger background checks. Yet the Republican leadership turns a deaf ear to the request of the American people because the National Rifle Association does not want there to be background checks on people who are buying guns in our country.  More Americans have died from gun violence in the past 50 years on the streets of America than have died in all of our Nation's wars overseas in our entire history. Let me say that again. More people have died from guns in our own country in the last 50 years than all of our soldiers, sailors, Air Force, and marines have died going all the way back to 1776. That is how much of an epidemic this is in our country. It is an epidemic that now kills 33,000 people every single year in our country, but the Federal Government's investment in researching gun violence is zero.  Diabetes--76,000 U.deaths annually; they get $170 million at the Centers for Disease Flu--57,000 deaths a year; they get $187 million for research. Asthma--3,600 deaths a year; they get $29 million for research at the Centers for Disease Gun violence--zero. An epidemic is ravaging our country, and the Republicans will not fund research to find this link between violence and the use of guns in our society, to do the research that can help us to reduce this carnage on the streets of our country. And because of an appropriations rider from the 1990s, the Centers for Disease Control hasn't conducted research into the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it. If 20 young children in Newtown had died of Ebola, we would have invested funding to study it. If 59 people in Las Vegas died of Zika, would we study it? But our country is suffering from an illness, and we have let it spread because we refuse to write a treatment plan.  The American Medical Association supports ending the ban on research. The American Public Health Association supports ending the ban on research. More than 141 groups want to end this ban on researching the link between guns and violence in our society.  The bill I have introduced with Representative Maloney gives $10 million to the Centers for Disease Control every single year. Shouldn't we be studying how to stop people from firing guns and give the medical, the scientific, and the public health community the resources they need?  We also need to develop new smart gun technologies that would improve safety and reduce accidental shootings. My bill would authorize grants to develop and personalize handgun technology to increase efficiency and decrease costs. If you can use a fingerprint to operate your iPhone, you should be able to do the same thing with your gun to make sure that safety is ensured, to make sure it is your thumbprint on that gun, that if your gun is stolen or lost, no one else would be able to use that gun. Does that make sense? Well, your thumb can work for your smartphone. Your thumb could also work for smart gun technology.  So this is where we are. We are at this critical point where some people are saying: Not now. It is inappropriate. We shouldn't be raising these issues.  But what we should be debating is what the American people want us to debate. Over 90 percent want background checks on anyone who buys a gun in our country to make sure they are qualified, to make sure they do not have something in their background that should disqualify them from owning a gun in our country.  Our debate here should really be about one thing: making the NRA stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American politics. The task for the Republican Party is different. It will be whether they will kill these bills that would legalize more fully silencers being put on automatic weapons in our country, kill the concealed carry law, which is moving through the House and Senate driven by Republicans, and, instead, debate the kinds of things that make our country safer, the kinds of things that poll after poll is showing that the American people want us to do. That is going to be our challenge in the days and weeks and months ahead.  This is the time; this is the place. We are the people who must be conducting this debate to make sure we add an extra measure of safety that American families can rely upon.  I yield back the remainder of my time.

921,topic-id,1802,"Mr.President, I wish to start my remarks with my deepest condolences and prayers for the people of Las Vegas and for the families and loved ones of the victims of the worst[[Page S6248]]mass shooting in our Nation's history. The Nation's heart breaks that innocent concertgoers had to suffer such senseless violence. May you find the strength and love to overcome your grief, to heal, and to move forward.  We owe our gratitude to the brave first responders for their efforts last night and to the medical professionals who are working tirelessly to heal wounds and save lives right now. But enough is enough. Americans are tired of living in fear that their community will be the next Newtown, Aurora, Orlando, or Las We must act so that we do not become numb to this preventable carnage.  This epidemic of gun violence in our country is not preordained. It is preventable. We can begin by banning these military-style assault weapons, like the AR-51, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass casualties on civilians. These are weapons that belong in combat, not in our communities.  Unfortunately, the gun lobby prevailed on Congress to let the assault weapons ban expire in 2004, but we need it now more than ever. We must also pass legislation to ensure that all gun purchases include a background check. Ninety-two percent of Americans support expanded background checks. No one should be able to purchase a gun through Facebook or Instagram without a background check. Instagram should not be ``Instagun,'' which it is in America today.  Let's also close the gun-show loophole that allows anyone to go into one of these Kmarts full of killing machines and buy a gun without a background check. Let's close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns. Let's close the loophole that allows straw purchasers to buy guns and flood our streets with them. Let's repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or the PLCAA, and take away the gun manufacturers' immunity from civil liability. PLCAA should stand for ``protecting lives, creating arms accountability.''  We must also recognize that this epidemic of gun violence is a public health emergency, and we must treat it that way. We must fully fund this critical research agenda at the Centers for Disease Control and give the CDC the resources it needs.  We will hear lots of people say that now is not the time to politicize this tragedy, that talking about legislation is insensitive and wrong. The only thing the NRA wants more than to sell lots of gun silencers is to put a silencer on the debate about gun safety legislation. The only thing the NRA wants more than allowing nationwide concealed carry laws is to conceal the overwhelming support for background checks. The only thing the NRA wants more than to stifle smart gun technology is to stifle debate on gun violence protection.  So to anyone who says having this debate now is too soon, it is already too late for at least 58 people in Las Vegas and the hundreds of others who were wounded. We should not wait another day. We need to pass commonsense gun safety legislation so we can hold a moment of silence for the NRA's stranglehold on American politics. We must make ``NRA'' stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American politics and in our country. That should be our agenda here on the floor of the  What is wrong is leaving Americans in our communities unprotected yet again from gun violence. What is wrong is not having a debate and allowing the NRA to block sensible gun safety legislation. We must act so that we do not become numb to the preventable carnage for the people of Las Vegas and the people of Newtown, Aurora, San Bernardino, and every community in our country. That should be our responsibility now in this country.  Mr.President, I wish to turn my attention to the confirmation of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, the subject of today's vote on the Senate floor.  Last week, I took to the floor to explain how, in his short tenure as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has stood up for big corporations and ignored American consumers.  Under Ajit Pai, the FCC now stands for ``forgetting consumers and competition.'' Here are the five reasons I gave.  1, on net neutrality, I explained how Ajit Pai wants to take a ``weed whacker''--his words--to net neutrality, allowing broadband providers to serve as internet gatekeepers and pick online winners and losers.  2, on privacy, Chairman Pai has actively supported efforts to allow broadband providers to sell consumers' sensitive information without their consent, as well as eliminating requirements for those companies to put in place data security protections, despite the obvious need to protect personal information.  3, on megamergers, Mr.Pai has paved the way for massive mergers, which will squeeze out independent programmers and lead to higher prices for consumers.  4, on the E-rate, the education rate, Chairman Pai has refused to commit to protecting the E-rate, the most successful educational technology program in our country's history, which links up schools and libraries to the internet.  5, on the Lifeline Program, Mr.Pai has undercut the Lifeline Program, which provides access to voice and internet service for millions of low-income  The case against Chairman Pai's nomination is clear. I want to spend a few more minutes today on the particularly critical issue of net neutrality, the chief governing principle of the internet.  Net neutrality ensures that all internet traffic is treated equally, requiring that internet service providers like AT&T, Charter, Verizon, and Comcast do not block, slow down, sensor, or prioritize internet traffic.  Today, essentially every company is an internet company. Every company has to deal with the digital revolution to be relevant in the 21st century. In 2016, almost half of the venture capital funds invested in this country went toward internet-specific and software companies. That is $25 billion worth of investment--half of all venture capital in this country. That is good.  To meet America's insatiable demand for broadband internet, the U.broadband and telecommunications industry--the big companies--invested more than $87 billion in capital expenditures in 2015. That is the highest rate of annual investment in the last 10 years. That is good.  We have hit the sweet spot. Investment in broadband and wireless technologies is very high. Job creation is very high. Venture capital investment in online startups is very high. With net neutrality rules in place, the best ideas, not merely the best funded ideas, can thrive in the 21st century.  Chairman Pai says he ``likes'' net neutrality, but then he says he wants to take an ax to the very order that established today's net neutrality rules. That is like saying you value democracy but don't really like the It makes no sense. Net neutrality is the organizing principle of the internet.  Chairman Pai and the ISPs--that is, internet service providers, the big companies--keep walking around, whispering how title II is some terrible word, some terrible thing.  Let's understand how we landed here. What is title II? It gets very mysterious until you put it into very simple language. In 2010, the Federal Communications Commission attempted to put net neutrality rules in place without reclassifying broadband under title II of the Communications The District of Columbia Circuit Court proceeded to invalidate those rules and said to the Federal Communications Commission: Here is how you can do it, and it will not be struck down. Here is a smart way for you to put net neutrality on the books, which will make it legal.  So the Federal Communications Commission, in correctly reading the court decision, went back, and in 2015 adopted the open internet order, which reclassified broadband as a telecommunications service under title II--under this ability to regulate. They did it, and the circuit court of appeals upheld the rules in a 2016 decision.  There it is: instructed by the court how to do it, follow the instructions, implement, done. It is now baked into the personality of the internet to have openness. The apertures are there for anyone to be able to get on, not to be discriminated against. That is what the internet should be like in the 21st century.  Title II is appropriate because it was Congress's intent to preserve the FCC's[[Page S6249]]authority to forestall threats to competition and innovation in telecommunications services, even as those technologies used to offer those services evolve over time.  We are not locked into one period of technology. As it evolves, so, too, does an evolution occur in terms of what openness means--the ability of everyone to be able to use the internet without being discriminated against.  Broadband has become the single most important telecommunications service Americans use to transmit information to one another, and it has become clear that innovators, businesses, and consumers overwhelmingly view broadband as a telecommunications service.  This is common sense to Americans around the country, with the only exception being big telecommunications lobbyists and lawyers who work to close this internet, who want to stop this incredible, entrepreneurial, democracy-enhancing set of rules that exists to ensure that this communications mechanism is not controlled by just a small number of companies.  Ajit Pai has said that he likes net neutrality, but he thinks it should be voluntary. But voluntary regulations will not work. We know that the broadband industry--your cable, your wireless, your telecommunications provider--cannot regulate themselves. They struggle to even show up on time to install or fix your service.  Do we really trust the broadband industry to resist leveraging their internet gatekeeper role and putting their online competitors at an unfair disadvantage? Of course not.  Americans have made their voices heard about net neutrality. More than 22 million Americans have written to the Federal Communications Commission in the past several months, sending a clear message of support for net neutrality. Hear that again: 22 million Americans sent a message to the Federal Communications Commission that they do not want to see a change in the net neutrality rules for our country. Yet Ajit Pai will not listen. His plan will allow broadband providers to stifle innovation, stifle entrepreneurship. His plan will allow big broadband barons to crush competition, reduce choice, and then make consumers pay more.  We cannot allow this to happen. That is why this vote we are about to take is so important. That is why I urge my colleagues to stand up for consumers and to vote no on Ajit Pai's nomination to be the Chairman of the Federal Communications  I yield back the remainder of my time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

A member of my staff in Sacramento, Devin, was born hard of hearing but didn't receive a screening at birth. For the first few years of her life, she appeared to be struggling to keep up with her peers.  It wasn't until Devin reached the middle of kindergarten that her teacher suggested she get her hearing tested. After receiving her diagnosis, Devin's family was able to seek out tools and resources to help her catch up to her classmates in school.  Devin's story illustrates the importance of early detection and intervention. We know that a child's development in the first few years of their life can have a major impact on their well-being later on.  By extending this program through our legislation, we are ensuring that infants continue to have access to hearing screenings at birth so their parents can make informed choices about their care and management early on.  We have come so far in increasing the number of babies who are screened every year. By passing this legislation, we are continuing that progress.

604,topic-id,3471,"Mr.President, I rise today, as I have on so many occasions, to give voice to the 3.5 million Americans who call Puerto Rico home. Their lives have been turned upside down by Hurricane Maria, and now more than ever, they desperately need to be heard. I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in amplifying the voices of millions of Puerto Ricans calling out for help and the millions here on the mainland who have yet to hear from their families.  Here on the floor with me today are aerial photos of the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria, the astounding damage I saw firsthand when I toured Puerto Rico by helicopter on Friday, pictures largely taken by me.  Take this collapsed bridge in the municipality of Utuado, situated in the central mountains of Puerto Every day, the 30,000 Americans who live in Utuado depend on these bridges to cross the beautiful rivers that run through it, but today those 30,000 Americans are secluded, waiting in the dark, and wondering when help will arrive.  Images like these have stayed with me from the moment I left Puerto Rico, and I share them today because the people of Puerto Rico need our collective voices and support to stop this humanitarian crisis from devolving into a full-blown American tragedy.  This is another example of some of the devastation of a large number of homes in a community.  If we hope to overcome the monumental challenges before us, we need a full grasp of the reality on the ground. I thought that is why President Trump went to Puerto Rico this week--to get a dose of reality. Instead, the President continued to feed on his own warped version of reality. The President told the people of Puerto Rico that they should be ``very proud'' that the death count was only ``16 versus literally thousands of people'' who died in ``a real catastrophe like Katrina''--a real catastrophe like And certainly that was a catastrophe, but this is no less real for the people of Puerto Yet, moments later, the AP reported that fatalities in Puerto Rico have tragically risen to 44. And while I pray it is not the case, I fear that it may be even worse, because we have secluded communities that still have not gotten access, so we don't know what is happening there.  In short, the situation is perilous, and we don't have a moment to waste.  Like many, I had hoped that during his visit to Puerto Rico, the President would take the high road and set a new tone after his administration's woefully delayed and inadequate response to Hurricane Instead, the President took victim-blaming to a whole new level. He told emergency responders and local elected officials: ``I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you have thrown our budget a little out of whack.''  Well, Mr.President, perhaps we have to dial back the budget-bursting, trillion-dollar tax cuts you want to give to billionaire families like yours, because it is going to take more than paper towels to help the people of Puerto  In this country, we don't turn our backs on Americans in need. We don't complain about how much it costs to restore power to hospitals or rebuild roads in ruin that connect people to their government and essential services or get clean drinking water and food and medicine to the hungry and the frail. We are the United States of America, and we are there for each other, whether it is Texas after Harvey or Florida after Irma or New Jersey after Sandy or Puerto Rico after  If you heard the President speak earlier this week, you would heard that everything is going great and that he in particular is doing the greatest job any President has ever done in the history of the world. The administration will tell us that the majority of hospitals are open but leave out the fact that many are running on emergency generators at significantly reduced capacity. They will leave out how the shortages of ambulances and fuel and functional roads have made getting to the hospitals nearly impossible. Even if you do find a way there, the hospitals might not have the medicine, supplies, or doctors you need.  The administration will boast that it has set up 11 distribution points for food, water, and other necessities, but what good is a distribution center that takes hours to reach and is out of supplies before you get there?  They will brag about how half of the people have access to running water but neglect to say that in some rural areas in the north, barely over 13 percent of people have access to running water.  They will boast about all of the buildings being inspected--something that even the Governor of Puerto Rico questioned--but look at this image I took 5 days before the President landed. This is just 25 minutes outside of San Hurricane Maria destroyed many of the wooden homes that populate the island and weakened many of its immense structures, as the picture showed that we had up before. Here is an example of it. So you see that all of[[Page S6338]]these homes are destroyed. Some of them are not made in the same way. Here is a cement structure that is also totally destroyed. I saw the same sights across Puerto Rico in communities near the capital, in the mountains, and along the coast.  What does all this tell us? It tells us an unfortunate truth: that the administration's response to this crisis has been woefully inadequate from the start.  For 2 weeks, Puerto Ricans cried out for help--help accessing clean water, help powering hospitals, help feeding families. Yet the President accused them--the victims of this historic natural disaster--of being ingrates clamoring for handouts. He dismissed the urgency of their situation, and he effectively called the mayor of San Juan another nasty woman who should pipe down.  Well, this is the mayor of San Juan, wading hip deep in water. Does this look like a woman who isn't taking responsibility? To me, it looks like a leader doing everything she can to save lives.  I knew from the start that we weren't getting the full picture, and because the administration went out of its way not to provide support for a bipartisan congressional delegation to visit the island, I decided to go myself. After all, it will be the responsibility of Congress to fund disaster relief and long-term recovery on these islands, and we need the facts in order to produce the right legislation. So last Friday, I boarded an Americans Airlines flight to Puerto  Now, let me be clear. I have visited the island of Puerto Rico I don't know how many times over the past 25 years, both in my official capacity as a Member of Congress and personally to vacation. It is no exaggeration to say that the island I saw on Friday is not the island I have known and loved. The lush, green, tropical landscape that comes to mind when we think of Puerto Rico was mostly devoid of life.  I met with the Governor of Puerto I spoke to local law enforcement officials, first responders, and Federal FEMA officials. With the help of the Governor's office and the Puerto Rico Joint Forces of Rapid Action--or FURA, as they are known on the island--I saw the damage by helicopter. I saw debris and mudslides and fallen trees on the inland streets, destroyed homes sprinkled with the occasional yet all-too-familiar blue of FEMA tarps. A dead green hue covered the landscape that was such a foreign sight to me that I caught myself thinking I was somewhere else.  This was an all-too-familiar scene--the scene of a strong cement structure of a building, on the surface impervious to the strong winds of a hurricane, yet now on the verge of sinking into the The hurricane eroded so much land that in some inner parts of the island, landslides have become the new norm. The people who live here may never be able to return. Entire generations of close-knit communities may never be the same.  Despite these dire conditions, during my visit to Puerto Rico, I felt the spirit of community and commitments shared by so many Americans across the island. After Hurricane Maria, they woke to devastation, no communication, and the isolating affects of roads being cut off by fallen trees, electrical posts, and debris. As they wait and wonder when their government will come to their aid, they are doing everything they can to survive. They have taken matters into their own hands. They are clearing roads, sheltering relatives who lost their homes, and working together to care for the most vulnerable. So through it all, I saw the hard-working spirit alive in Puerto Rico that I see whenever I speak with Puerto Rican families there and across New Jersey, where so many of my constituents are mobilizing to send help as they anxiously wait to hear from their families.  Like so many Americans, I too worried about my family on the island. My brother faces health challenges, and I worried about his care. Fortunately, we had a brief moment to meet, and I was able to give him some supplies--help one person. But as tough as this situation was, he is one of the lucky ones. He lives in a suburb of San Juan which is relatively better off than the more remote, rural areas.  Let's look at a chart of our recovery status. Fifteen days after the storm ravaged the island, where does it stand? Well, 93 percent of our fellow Americans are still without power. I can tell my colleagues firsthand that the heat and the humidity from all of the water that came from Maria is stifling. It is oppressive. It is hard to breathe.  Sixty percent of Puerto Rico has no cell phone service, meaning people have no way of connecting to their families on the island and outside of the island or calling for help if they needed it. If they did, we could have pinpoint accuracy of search and rescue missions.  Day by day, fewer and fewer Puerto Ricans have access to clean, running water. From October 2 to October 3, the population with running water dropped from 29 percent to 13 percent.  The truth is, this situation would be unacceptable in any major city on the U.mainland, but, as the people of Puerto Rico know all too well, they don't get the same treatment as their fellow citizens on the mainland. The ugly truth is that for generations, Congress has treated the people of Puerto Rico not as our fellow Americans, not as people who have fought and bled for their country, like the famous Borinqueneers, an all-Puerto Rican infantry division, who received, recently, the highest decoration Congress gives collectively--the Congressional Gold They haven't treated them as first-class citizens but as second-class citizens.  Hurricane Maria didn't create this disparity, but it exposed the longstanding inequities that have hindered the island's success for generations. The people of Puerto Rico don't receive equal Medicaid funding, Medicare coverage, or access to tax credits. They aren't just numbers on a ledger; they are long-term care for a grandparent, treatment for a critically ill child, and a fair shot to make a living wage and raise a family.  This didn't happen overnight. These wrongs add up over time. As Governor Rossello said so eloquently:       I invite you to reflect on why Puerto Rico is in the      current state of disadvantage and inequality. It's not      something that happened just a few months or few weeks before      this storm. It is a condition that has happened for more than      a century in Puerto  I invite you to reflect on the reality that even after the storm hit Puerto Rico, even when it was evident it was a disaster in the United States, only half of our U.citizens knew Puerto Ricans are U.citizens. So when Hurricanes Irma and Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, these disparities, these inequalities, were laid bare.  None of this should have taken the Trump administration by surprise. We knew the storm was coming. We knew for days that a category 5 hurricane was on a collision course with Puerto Rico, just as communities across the island were picking up the pieces after We have known for years about the island's aging infrastructure, like the downed power line pictured here.  In short, all of us knew Hurricane Maria was a recipe for disaster that would leave 3.5 million Americans imperiled, disconnected, and in the dark. It should not have taken the administration 12 days to issue a disaster declaration--something I called for--for 100 percent of the island because, as I saw on Friday, there is no community in Puerto Rico untouched by this tragedy. Focused leadership would have had a three-star general on the ground the moment the clouds parted, not 8 days after the storms struck.  We needed medical evacuation vehicles and vessels, aid and relief delivery systems on standby, the USNS Comfort ready for immediate deployment--something I called for. Instead, the administration told us helping Puerto Rico is hard because it is an island in a big ocean--but it happens to be an island of 3.5 million U.citizens.  We have no more time to waste. That is why it is so urgent that we take action now. If we could send 20,000 troops to Haiti, surely, we can get more boots on the ground saving American lives in Puerto We need more helicopters airdropping food and water to secluded communities. We need generators delivered and the repair of communication towers expedited.  It is up to the President to mobilize every resource possible--to save lives, to get the lights turned on, to rebuild bridges, to reach secluded communities, to reconnect families. We can't[[Page S6339]]afford to waste any more time, not when lives are on the line, not when elderly residents in nursing homes grow frailer by the moment, not when hungry American children have nothing to eat, not when communities are without clean drinking water for days on end. We need to keep the pressure on the administration.  That is why I wrote the President, urging that he activate the Defense Production Act of 1950 so the military could more quickly deliver vast private sector resources to those in need. That is why my colleagues and I wrote to the White House and urged FEMA to waive disaster relief cost sharing because, as the Governor told me: I have no revenue coming in. I have no revenue coming in, and the likelihood of revenue coming in, certainly in the short term, is not there. How do you acquire the 70 or 75 percent Federal assistance if you don't have the 25 percent to put up? That is why we have written the USDA asking that they use all available resources to get food to the people of Puerto  This is an all-hands-on-deck situation for the Federal Government, but Congress also has a responsibility to act. That is why I sent a letter to Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan urging that they bring forward an emergency supplemental aid package and fund community development block grants for disaster recovery. It is up to us in Congress to immediately authorize, not just the emergency funding needed to save lives in Puerto Rico but also the assistance needed for a full-powered recovery.  We must give Puerto Ricans the tools to rebuild. That means making sure Puerto Rico's financial control board gives the Governor the flexibility to spearhead this recovery. Board members of that control board should be on the island, assessing the damage, speaking to the survivors, allowing Governor Rossello to create a new budget that reflects Puerto Rico's post-Maria reality. The damage, by some estimates, could be as high as $90 billion, so adjusting expectations and enabling flexibility is absolutely critical going forward.  I have said it before and I will say it again. The people of Puerto Rico must come before Wall Street creditors. As it turns out, this is one area where the President and I can find common ground. Just last night, he called for Puerto Rico's debt to be wiped out. I hope all of us--the administration, my colleagues in Congress, and the fiscal control board--can work together to jump-start Puerto Rico's recovery. That must include enabling flexibility, addressing the island's crippling debt, and ensuring that pensions are protected and paid. Imagine not getting your pension--no longer working, having no income, and then your pension is not protected. How do you make it? All of us in the Senate have a responsibility to stand with Puerto How we respond to this crisis will have profound consequences, not just for the Americans who live in Puerto Rico today but for generations to come.  We need to pass a disaster package that matches the astounding damage suffered by the island. The photos I have brought to the floor today give a glimpse--not anywhere near the whole picture--of the devastation on the ground. It is not enough to reconnect a faulty, ailing power grid. It is time to be proactive and rebuild Puerto Rico so it is prepared for the next storm and for the 21st century. It is time to fix the underlying disparities which have hindered Puerto Rico's success. Otherwise, we will simply be rebuilding a broken foundation.  Let me close by saying, I remind my colleagues that Puerto Ricans are not just citizens of the United States--which, in and of itself, should speak to the compelling arguments we should be engaged in helping Puerto Rico as our fellow They have fought to defend our Nation from World War I to the War on Take a walk down to the Vietnam Memorial, and you will see Puerto Rican names engraved in that stone far in excess of the number of people proportionately to the American population. Throughout our history, Puerto Ricans have given their lives so they may remain part of the ``land of the free.'' To this day, more than 10,000 Puerto Ricans serve in every branch of the U.Armed  Let's also remember that beyond the 3.5 million citizens living on the island, there are 5 million Puerto Ricans living in our States, in our congressional districts, and in our communities. In the aftermath of this unprecedented disaster, these Americans deserve the same rights, the same respect, and the same response from their Federal That is what I told leaders from New Jersey's Puerto Rican community earlier this week--assemblymen and women, mayors, community leaders, and concerned citizens.  We all remember how hard it was to secure the funding we needed to rebuild New Jersey in the aftermath of Superstorm We had to fight tooth and nail every step of the way, and, guess what, we had two U.Senators from New Jersey and 13 Members of Congress, joined by our colleagues from New York--two U.Senators from New York and a whole host of congressional Members as well as from Connecticut, which was also affected. It was an incredible time here to try to get relief.  Americans in Puerto Rico have no vote in the Senate, they have no votes in Congress, and the fight to rebuild Puerto Rico will be that much harder, but, as I have in the past, I intend to be their voice and their vote in the U. Now is not the time to pretend like recovery will be a piece of cake. No one--not the Governor, not the President, not any one of us--should sugarcoat the human catastrophe playing out in Puerto It is time for honesty about the conditions on the ground, the challenges we face, and the actions we must take.  Yes, Puerto Rico is an island in the middle of a very big ocean, but we are the most powerful nation on the face of the We have the most advanced military capabilities ever known and the most skilled Armed Forces in the world. We have to be there for 3.5 million Americans who are in need. We are the United States of We do the impossible. Give our men and women in uniform any mission, and they rise to the occasion.  If we conducted the Berlin Airlift, set up tactical operations in the mountains of Afghanistan, built green zones in Baghdad in the height of the Iraq war, then surely we can save the lives of Americans in danger, and surely we can save those lives and help rebuild Puerto We must not rest until every American is safe and the work of rebuilding is done.

241,topic-id,2275,"Mr.President, The most powerful words in our Constitution are the first three words: ``We the People.'' It sets out the mission statement for our Nation, or, as President Lincoln put it, a nation ``of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' Our Founders did not start out our Constitution with ``we the powerful'' or ``we the powerful and privileged.'' They didn't proceed to say that our form of government is all about the powerful and privileged ruling for themselves to make themselves richer at the expense of everyone else.  Thus, going back to the foundation, the vision of our Nation is appropriate because our Republican colleagues have put forward a document--a budget--with a tax plan that is all about government for the powerful. It is all about self-serving government for the privileged. There is nothing about fighting for a foundation for ordinary people to be able to thrive here in the United States of  Indeed, the plan put forward by my Republican colleagues is a plan fit for a king living in a gilded castle--maybe[[Page S6314]]fit for King Trump living in Trump Tower, but certainly not for working Americans living and striving to build the wealth of No, this is not a plan for them. This is a plan for the King Trumps of our Nation, who believe they can deceive the country again and again by putting forward an argument that they are going to do something to help the people while writing it for themselves.  We can take a look at this and realize that the President himself leads that effort to do the sales pitch when he unveiled his tax plan at the National Association of Manufacturers last week. President Trump said: ``My plan is for the working people.'' He said: ``There's very little benefit for people of wealth.'' And he went on to say: ``I don't benefit. I don't benefit.'' He repeated it twice.  Well, as soon as you look at the tax plan, you see that this is wrong. He sent out his other Secretaries to reinforce his message. Secretary Mnuchin showed up on the shows and said: ``The objective of the President is that rich people don't get tax cuts.'' Well, that is a little bit of lawyerly work there. He didn't want to confront the reality that this plan is all about tax cuts for the wealthy. So he said the objective wasn't to do that.  Well, let's talk about the reality. The bottom third economically here in America get zero help from the tax provisions in this plan--none whatsoever. Plus, the broader budget slashes Medicaid by about $473 billion--you know, the one thing that has improved for working people. It has been tougher in a blue-collar communities to get a full-time job. It has been tougher to get a living wage. It has been tougher to save for retirement, with pensions disappearing and employer-supported retirement and savings plans disappearing.  One thing got better, and that is access to healthcare, thanks to In my State, over half a million Oregonians gained access to healthcare. It didn't just help them; it helped everyone. The uncompensated care rate went way down in hospitals and way down in clinics, which meant stronger clinics and stronger hospital services for everybody in the Everyone benefited.  So the one thing that has improved for working America the Republicans in this Chamber wanted to rip it away--stomp on it, destroy it, shred it. They couldn't bear the thought that working Americans might finally have affordable, quality healthcare. They couldn't stand the vision of healthcare as a right. They wanted to return it to healthcare being only for the wealthy and the healthy, but not for ordinary working people.  Well, the bottom third is totally unhelped--in fact, hurt by this plan. How about the middle third? For the middle third--25 percent of the middle third--taxes go up, not down. The tax bracket goes from 10 percent to 12 percent. For the seniors in middle America, this plan takes a trillion dollars away from Not only do my Republican friends hate having healthcare for working people, but they want to destroy healthcare for older Americans at the same time.  So if the bottom third doesn't benefit and the middle third has taxes going up, who benefits here? Simple answer: It is the billionaires. The millionaires and billionaires of America are those whom this plan is written for.  Well, let's just look at the provisions that cost so much money to the The alternative minimum tax is wiped out. Remember how the rich and powerful rigged the system so they were paying no taxes at all? We here in America established an alternative minimum tax, saying that, if you are wealthy, with a ton of money coming in the door, you should pay at least a little. The one tax return we have for President Trump shows he paid taxes because of the alternative minimum tax. That is the only reason he paid taxes.  So when President Trump says he doesn't benefit, clearly that is wrong. If he knows it is wrong, it is a lie. Let's just say he is either incredibly ignorant or trying to be incredibly misleading about the fact that this would benefit him enormously to get rid of the alternative minimum tax.  What is the second thing it does? Where it raised the tax rate at the lowest bracket for working Americans, it lowers the tax rate for the wealthiest Americans, from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. That is a huge reduction that benefits people at the very top, wealthy enough to be paying in the top bracket. Certainly, President Trump, by his own description of his own affluence, would be in that category. So clearly, he benefits enormously from that.  The third huge provision is getting a special rate for passthrough entities. Let's say you own a big development, like a shopping complex or a Trump Tower, and it generates a lot of money and you pass it through to pay your personal taxes from your limited liability corporation. Well, instead of being charged 39.6 percent, the current rate, or 35 percent, at the lower rate or at the corporate rate, no, you get this special deal on this passthrough of 25 percent. So you paid an enormous amount less.  Who benefits from this? Well, the people who own LLCs and pass through huge amounts of money are the ones who benefit from this. Who has a lot of LLCs? Who has, by various estimates, hundreds and hundreds? I heard an estimate that the President has over 500 So if the President has hundreds and hundreds of LLCs, passing through income that is lowered from a 39.6-percent rate to a 25-percent rate--basically, a 15-percent reduction--he benefits enormously from this, as do all of his millionaire and billionaire friends.  Finally, there is the estate tax. This one, I have to admit, President Trump doesn't benefit from today because he hasn't died. But when he dies, his estate would benefit massively. If he is taking out insurance to be able to pay his tax bill when he dies, then he has to take out less insurance. In that case, it does benefit him today. Most wealthy individuals do have that kind of insurance investment to pay the estate tax. A very small number of Americans fall into this category, and that very small number have a whole team of financial planners. That means that, yes, even though, technically, he wouldn't pay the tax benefit until he dies, he pays less for the preparation of paying that. As for the AMT, the lower tax bracket, the passthroughs, and the estate tax, the President benefits enormously from every single one.  There you have it. There is nothing for the bottom third. The middle third get hit with Medicare being slashed, and also with an increase in taxes for a good share of them, but the billionaires at the top benefit enormously. Let's be fair. The President understands this. His advisers understand it. His Cabinet is full of the types of individuals at the very top--the 1 percent, the 0.1 percent--full of the richest They wrote this plan for themselves and to hurt the rest of That is shameful.  There is another provision that the President has put in that probably helps himself, and that is cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. It is keeping with the President's demonstrably false statement that the United States is the most taxed nation in the world. That is simply not true, as a percentage of We have seen the share of tax revenue that companies pay decline.  Here we have the argument that somehow there will be prosperity because we reduce the tax rate. Let's look at those companies that already pay less than 20 percent in corporate taxes because of the big difference between the nominal rate--the stated rate of corporations--and the reality of what they actually paid. A report from the Institute for Policy Studies analyzed 92 U.corporations that paid less than 20 percent in corporate taxes. Did they find that these firms have medium job growth of 20 percent? Ten percent? Five percent? Zero? It is negative 1 percent. There is negative job growth even though these companies paid less than 20 percent in corporate taxes, while the private sector job growth over those years as a whole was 6 percent positive. So those paying less than 20 percent had negative 1 percent growth, while the entire private sector grew with job growth at 6 percent. In fact, during that period, these 92 firms that were studied--in fact, just a fraction of them, or 48 of them together--eliminated basically about half a million jobs. They had very low taxes.  The argument is that they will do more because they don't have to pay as much taxes. They will expand the number of people they hire. But instead,[[Page S6315]]they slashed half a million jobs--just 48 of these firms that pay less than 20 percent.  What happened to the CEOs of those firms? Their salaries went through the roof. Part of the plan here is that you cut as many people as you can, and you have a net profit increase. Sometimes, even when you don't, you get a big increase.  So if we take this as a model of what the President wants to achieve, he wants to empower other companies to follow this track of having this model of slashing hundreds of thousands of jobs and jacking up the salaries of the already richest CEOs in the country. Who were these companies?  AT&T had an effective tax rate of 8 percent. Wouldn't that be nice for middle-class Americans, to have an effective tax rate of 8 percent? While they had that beneficial 8 percent tax rate, they slashed 80,000 jobs and doubled their CEO's pay to $28.4 million. Think of how many ordinary working people would have a better life if they raised their pay by one dollar an hour. But no, the CEO slashes 80,000 jobs and raises to pay himself $28.4 million.  How about GE, which boosted its CEO's pay nearly $18 million in 2016, while cutting 14,700 jobs over 9 years and achieving a negative tax rate? A negative tax rate--get that. They didn't pay a dollar to the National Treasury--not a dollar. They had a negative tax rate. The company got more money back from the government than it paid in taxes.  How about ExxonMobil? Between 2008 and 2015, they had an effective tax rate of 13.6 percent. That is way below 20 percent. In that time period, did we see a significant growth in the number of people they employed because they got this hugely beneficial 13.6 percent tax rate? No, we did not. In fact, they cut their global workforce by a third. At the same time, the CEO of that company, who just happens to be our Secretary of State at the moment, saw his compensation grow to $27.4 million.  The record shows that these companies that are getting these low tax rates are slashing their employees and boosting their CEO salaries. Is that the model that makes for a prosperous middle-class America, slash jobs and a dramatic increase of inequality in this country?  That is why this entire tax plan and the budget are so diabolical. It is everything contrary to ``we the people.'' It is a vision of basically hijacking the National Treasury to inflate the wealth of the wealthiest in America, while doing as much harm as possible to working Americans, laying down a model on the corporate side of rewarding companies for slashing hundreds of thousands of jobs and inflating the salaries of their  Here is the question every Member of this Chamber should ask: Is your priority adding more zeros to the bank balances of millionaires and billionaires? Is that your mission? Are you at work here not representing the people of your State but just millionaires and billionaires? If you are, then you should be full-throated supporting the Republican tax plan and the Republican budget on the floor of this But if you believe in the mission of the United States of America, the ``we the people'' mission of providing a foundation for families to thrive across this land, then there is no choice but to take this budget and this tax plan and shred it, destroy it, burn it, put a stake through its heart in every way possible.  I, for one, believe in this mission of ``we the people.''  Thank you.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Toomey).

623,topic-id,2462,"Mr.President, 4 weeks ago, I stood here on the floor of the Senate and called for increased funding to fight the wildfires. This is just one of the dramatic pictures of Oregon ablaze. It is thousands and thousands of acres.[[Page S6347]]  I had the experience of driving roughly 350 miles in my State and never escaping the smoke from the fires that were in every single corner and in every quadrant of the State of We have seen the challenge of Mother Nature at work this year with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria hitting in Texas, Florida, and Puerto But let's not forget the incredible damage being done in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington by these extraordinary fires.  Over the last decade, we have seen an average of 50,000 fires in America each year. They destroy and burn up more than 5 million acres, but this year the count is well over 8 million acres and counting. In Oregon, we normally have fires that burn, on average, about 500,000 acres, but this year we are well over 600,000 acres and counting.  As a result of these raging fires, we have many communities that have been so powerfully impacted and so many forests destructively impacted. We should stop and ask: What can we do better in terms of our forests and our communities? That is why I am taking to the floor right now.  The first thing we need to do is to end fire borrowing. This is where the U.Forest Service, in order to pay for fighting these fires, proceeds to borrow from every other account. This has become all too common. What are those other accounts? They are the hazardous fuels funds, forest management funds, forest restoration funds, forest conservation funds, road maintenance funds, and funds that are designed to prepare for future timber sales.  All of that does a lot of damage to the preparation. So the fires are more resilient and aren't susceptible to this type of firefighting. We have seen, on average in the last decade, a cost of fighting fires across the country of about $1.6 billion. But this year, we are over $3 billion--almost double. So even though the Appropriations Committee had wisely put in a buffer of several hundred million dollars to prevent fire borrowing, those funds were long ago wiped out.  So there we were 4 weeks ago. I was working to say that now that we are over the allotted funds for the year, let's immediately get more funds that can be used to backfill this shortage in I thank all of my colleagues for the fact that those funds were included in the continuing resolution. We successfully provided a bridge so that firefighting could continue and so that the fire borrowing was quickly repaid.  But that is not a permanent solution--to try to legislate or to backfill on a rapid basis. Indeed, when we have these kinds of fire seasons, it is like other natural disasters. It is like tornadoes and hurricanes and floods. So we need to have a FEMA-style backup for those worst ever fire seasons. That is what my colleagues Senator Wyden and Senator Crapo--bipartisan teamwork--have been putting forth. It is called the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017. It says that when we reach a certain level of funding for fighting fires, the balance will go to a FEMA-style fund. That is exactly the way it should be done.  It has been estimated in the past that if just the top 1 percent or 2 percent of the worst fires were funded in FEMA-style fund, we would never have had fire borrowing in the past. But the most relevant kind of crisp and clean way to do that would be to adopt this bill Senator Wyden and Senator Crapo have put so much work into and which I am certainly pleased to cosponsor. That would be very useful, and we should do that now.  We should respond while the memory is fresh and, actually, while fires are still burning in State after State--certainly burning in my home State of Then we should recognize, too, that this terrible fire year has done so much damage to so many communities. We have communities where the roads have been cut off. We have communities where the tourists disappeared because of the smoke, or other economic enterprises had to shut down for an extended period.  So as we assist those communities hit by Harvey and hit by Irma and hit by Maria, let's also help those communities that were hit by this year's extraordinary fires. That would mean strengthening the Small Business Disaster Loan That would mean taking the additional funding for the USDA Emergency Community Water Assistance Program, and, certainly, it would mean making additional community development block grants available to the communities impacted by these fires. Let's not forget those communities as we provide assistance in funding to the communities affected by the hurricanes.  Then we also need to address the fact that many assets in our forests were scorched by these fires. There are trails that have to be repaired, roads that have to be repaired, watershed repairs to avoid landslides, facilities that were scorched and burned, and wildlife and fish management restoration, including critical sage grouse areas.  I was up visiting the incredible waterfall, the Multnomah They were explaining that several of the trails have bridges--there are so many bridges on the trails in Oregon--and that the fire had burned some of the understructure. So from above it looked like the bridges were safe, but they weren't safe. They can't reopen those trails until they get support to do all these repairs. The Forest Service has estimated that it will take $150 million to restore the damage done to the Forest Service's infrastructure.  So we should make that happen as part of this bill. Then, we should turn to forest fire resilience. We have 2 million acres in need of fire prevention efforts in Actually, we have far more of that in need of fire prevention, but we have nearly 2 million that have already passed through environmental approval for work to reduce the hazardous fuels that are on the floor of the forest, and we need to thin these forests.  You can imagine that when you have clearcuts and those clearcuts are replanted, the trees grow back very close together. In a short amount of time, those forests are very good for fires and very good for disease, but they are neither good for ecosystems nor for timber stands. So they have to be thinned, and that thinning can be done, in Oregon alone, on nearly 2 million acres already approved through the environmental process. The challenge is to get more funds into that effort.  That, too, should be part of this because, whether you talk to an environmentalist or talk to somebody who wants sawlogs for the mills, they both know that if you thin these forests, you make them more resistant to fire. With better timber stands, you have better ecosystems, and you supply a steady supply of sawlogs to the mill.  Let's not reopen the timber wars of the past. Let's work together with a win-win.  I want to show this chart because it indicates the dramatic change of what has happened to the Forest Service budget. We can go back to 1995 and compare it to the year 2015. I want to focus particularly on the orange. The orange is the amount of money that was spent fighting forest fires, and 20 years ago, it was 16 percent of the Forest Service budget. But in 2015--2 years ago--it broke 50 percent. It was 52 percent of their budget. This year, it has certainly gone up much higher than that. So as the amount of funds spent on fighting fires has increased, it has dramatically reduced the amount of funds that support our maintenance and improvement of the forest. That is what is getting squeezed out.  Let me put it differently. The more you spend fighting fires out of a single pot of money, the less money you have to prevent the fires. Everywhere I go they say: Can't we do more on the front end so these forests are more resilient? If you think about how fire works, it really gets going if the trees are close together because one tree lights the next tree on fire. If you thin them, you slow that down. The fire goes from the ground, where there is brush, to the canopy, where there are branches, very easily if the branches are close to the ground. So you trim off those branches, separate the trees, thin them out, shave off the branches, cut off the branches, and suddenly you have a forest that is much more resilient.  There are those folks who have said: Let's just get rid of the environmental rules. Let's just clearcut everything. Let's do 10,000 acres at a time. That is, by the way, 15 square miles. Let's set those 15 square miles next to each other. Let's just shave the Earth and wipe out the forests. That way, there will not be forest fires. Those are the timber wars of the past.[[Page S6348]]  What we have seen is that we can bridge the divide between a good ecosystem and a good timber stand by thinning the forest, by making them more like a natural forest, which is much more fire resilient. In the process of thinning, which has to be done periodically over time, we are also providing a steady foundation for sawlogs for our mills.  There is a mill in John Day, I met with the folks there who were very worried. The workers there were very worried about that mill getting shut down. I was determined to do everything I could to save that mill. What ended up happening is that we found we couldn't save that mill with a timber sale because a timber sale can't commit to a load of logs over a 10-year period. The owner of the mill couldn't commit to the cost of new machinery if he didn't know he would get logs for an extended period of time. So we discovered that we could, though, through a forest health contract--through a stewardship contract--enable a steady supply of thinned logs to make it to that mill and make sure that mill stayed open. Not only did it keep it open, but it added workers to that mill. That is the type of win-win solution that we need.  There is another way of looking at the cost of fighting fires. Here we see, in 1995, 16 percent of the budget going to fight fires; in 2017, 56 percent. Let's look into the future. An original estimate was that we would reach 67 percent by 2025; now the new estimate, based on the changing dynamics in the forest, is that we will get to over two-thirds of the budget fighting fires by the year 2021--four fire seasons from today. That is how big the issue is. That is why we need funds from the front end to be able to thin these forests. This is simply common sense.  If you are the private owner of a private forest, you wouldn't dare let this forest retain this high propensity for fires and disease. You would thin the forest. You would make it a better timber stand; you would make it a better ecosystem. And that is what we need to do.  We have also seen that another way of looking at the changes is how the staffing levels have changed over the last two decades. If we look at just two decades ago, we can see that in 1998 there were about 18,000 individuals dedicated to managing the forest lands and just 5,700 dedicated to going out and fighting blazes. Now we have come into the future, and we see now that the number of people fighting fires is larger than the number working on all of the other forest programs. We have to commit to doing far more on the prevention end. If we let this summer's crisis go without securing funding to thin those forests that have already gone through the environmental process, we are making a huge mistake, and it is going to cost us more because there are going to be even more fires in the future. So not only do we spend more out of the National Treasury to fight them, but we will have less healthy timber stands to fuel our economy.  Let's end the fire burn. Let's provide the funding to restore the fire service assets that were burned, the scourged assets. Let's provide assistance through community development block grants and small business loans to assist the communities that were scourged by these fires. Let's pass Senator Wyden and Senator Crapo's bill, which proceeds to create a FEMA-like structure to back up the worst fire seasons, and certainly, certainly, absolutely, let's invest in prevention on the front end by thinning these forests and getting the flammable buildup of forest branches off the floor of the forests. Those are positive things we can do.  At this moment in Houston, in Miami, in Puerto Rico, people are thinking, what can we do to better prepare for the next storm surge? What can we do to be better prepared for the next hurricane? Well, we know for sure that we are going to have fires across the Northwest in Montana, in Idaho, in Oregon, in Washington every summer, and they are simply getting worse. We must ask ourselves the same question: How do we change this rhythm? How do we operate this differently and better? That is our responsibility in this Chamber, and that is the set of things we can do to have a far better outcome in the future.

Mr.Speaker, it is a rare occasion in Washington when Republicans and Democrats can come together and get behind a change to the banking regulations, but we stand here today behind H.1624 because the banking regulators, frankly, well, they messed it up. They created a rule that gives foreign municipalities a competitive advantage over our American cities and towns, and this advantage is hurting our communities.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation is really quite simple. It will help cities and towns in my State and across the United States save money on roads and bridges and schools. President Trump has made rebuilding our infrastructure a priority for our Nation, and this bipartisan bill paves the way for this type of investment by lowering the price tag for roads and bridges.  H.1624 reverses a backwards banking regulation that makes it more expensive for U.municipalities to finance infrastructure projects. Specifically, the bill will amend the regulation to enable more banks to hold municipal bonds to cover their liquidity requirements. This change should reduce the cost of borrowing for cities and towns across the country. Ultimately, this bill helps taxpayers by making it cheaper to finance infrastructure projects.  H.1624 will help blue States and red States alike, and that is why you have seen such overwhelming bipartisan support for this in the Halls of The bill passed the Financial[[Page H7706]]Services Committee unanimously this summer, and very similar legislation passed the Chamber by a voice vote last year.                              {time}  1515  Still we have got more work to do, and there is now momentum in the Senate to get H.1624 across the finish line.

35,topic-id,388,"Madam Speaker, I rise today to do a little myth-busting. Critics of the 21st Century AIRR Act are selling a myth that the 21st Century AIRR Act will be damaging and adverse to general aviation. This couldn't be further from the truth.  I am a regular general aviation user and a student pilot. My brother-in-law[[Page H7676]]is a GA pilot. I would never support legislation that would be bad for my rural communities and the airports in those communities.  Let's address a few of those myths.  The nonprofit service provider for air traffic control will be prohibited from charging user fees to any segment of general aviation in contrast to the myths that are being sold out there.  The act also prohibits the ATC provider from restricting access to any airspace or any airport.  Further, any changes to access to airports or airspace would be subject to extensive government review and approval.  Additional funding is provided to community airports to assist them to continue to grow and be vibrant in our communities.  Critics would have you believe that general aviation will not have a seat at the table. Again, not true. The nonprofit board of directors designates a seat for community airports, as it designates a seat for general aviation, lease pilots, airlines, and air cargo.  The FAA, in a hearing, indicated it would take another 10 years and $30 billion to update an air traffic control system from the archaic system we have now. When asked, they said that they hoped they would have it accomplished in 10 years. Hope is not a plan.  The Trump administration supports the 21st Century AIRR Air traffic controllers support the 21st Century AIRR Airline pilots support it. The airlines support it, and air cargo supports it. We can go through a long list, yet we continue to deal with myths being spun out there that somehow this is adverse to aviation.  We have an archaic air traffic control system that is hurting our Nation and that is damaging our economy. It is time to move beyond fear and myths.

576,topic-id,674,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the 21st Century AIRR Act, a comprehensive act to reauthorize the FAA and reform air traffic control.  Our aviation system was once the best in the world, but, unfortunately, America is no longer first in flight. Ask anyone who flies. They know our aviation system is plagued with inefficiencies. These range from indirect routes that send us all over, trying to get from one point to another; seemingly endless delays; and time wasted on the tarmac, hoping to take off to head to your destination.  These delays and congestion cost travelers and our economy an estimated $25 billion a year.  You may have heard that argument that there is nothing we can do; 50 percent of our air traffic delays are caused by bad weather.  Well, underlying that is 50 percent of our delays are caused by bad weather because you have to space out aircraft further and differently when the weather is inclement.  Why is that?  Well, in many cases, we are using World War II radar technology to keep track of modern aviation. In fact, over 400 air traffic control facilities were built before the invention of the internet and 9 of them are old enough to collect Medicare if they were a live human being. Think about that. They are that old.  Questions have been asked: Why haven't we simply fixed the problem?  After all, taxpayers and passengers have poured billions of dollars into the FAA to modernize that system over the last 30 years, yet we have little to show for it.  As President Clinton pointed out nearly 20 years ago, ``part of the problem is our outdated technology . . . but a more fundamental problem is also how the FAA operates.''  I couldn't agree more.  We recently had a hearing regarding air traffic control, and the FAA was asked: What does it take to get to a modern air traffic control system like is used in other parts of the developed world?  I was told: If we had 10 more years and $30 billion more, we would hope to have the project done.  I come from private business. Hope is not a plan.  The 21st Century AIRR Act would replace a Federal entity that has proven itself to be ineffective with an independent, not-for-profit board tasked with modernizing our air traffic control system. They would have one duty: providing the safest, most efficient air traffic control service to all users.  Contrary to critics, our board would be balanced. It would be comprised of users of the system. All are represented equally.  Quickly, let me bust a few myths here.  Critics argue that transferring air traffic control services from the FAA to a new entity would be a free giveaway of Federal assets.  Well, first, let me state they are not Federal assets. They are our assets. We paid for them. Everyone in this Chamber has paid for them. Every taxpayer has paid for them. They are owned by the people.  Most of these assets are so old and outdated that, in many cases, they are actually a liability. There are many facilities that are actually environmental brownfields.  A number of FAA facilities no longer meet OSHA standards, yet, somehow, some of the critics claim that these are valuable Federal assets. In fact, users are going to pay to update this air traffic control system. They will pay for the equipment, staff, and technology to finally update a system that we have been trying to do for over 30 years.  Many in this Chamber talk about refocusing the Federal Government, reducing it back to its core missions, reducing government back to what it does best. This bill does just that.  Mr.Speaker, after billions of dollars and decades of Federal bureaucrats' fruitless efforts to modernize our air traffic system, it is time for change. It is time for real reform.  Mr.Speaker, this bill does exactly that.

I have worked with him and his staff throughout my time on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and have traveled with him throughout our home My getting to know him on a personal level has really been a delight, something that has been a highlight of my time while serving in the He is a native of Parsons, KS, which is a small town in the southeast corner of our State, and he brings with him an understanding of the challenges that face rural He understands the importance of access to high-speed broadband and wireless connectivity, and I believe that his roots as a small town Kansas kid make him exceptionally qualified to advocate for rural  Ajit came to Wichita just this past week to explore ideas and explain policy opportunities to close the digital divide within local broadband providers that work in Kansas communities I serve. The lack of broadband connectivity in parts of rural Kansas has lasting economic, educational, and public health impacts, and Ajit Pai has prioritized incentive-based solutions like the Connect America Fund and Mobility Fund to close this divide in a fiscally responsible and competitively driven way.  Outside of supporting high-speed broadband build-out to unserved or underserved areas, Ajit created the Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee to promote broadband deployment across America, including removing regulatory burdens and barriers and improving permitting and the right-of-way process through regulatory reform.  While in Kansas, he was also able to see the great work that was being done to implement the Next Generation 9-1-1 technology in our home As we know, improving these communications systems is absolutely necessary to ensure adequate emergency services to rural and urban Americans alike, and we see that today and over the last several months with the disasters and tragedies that have occurred in our country.  Ajit has also proven himself to be a leader who is committed to free markets, clearly understanding that regulations should be balanced with pro-growth economic principles that do not unduly harm employers or stifle innovation. To this end, Ajit Pai announced his intentions to stand up a new Office of Economics and Data within the FCC to provide economic analysis of the policies and functions of the agency. We are looking for thoughtful, data-backed input to the agency that should lead to market-driven policy decisions the Commission can then hang their hat on.  Critical issues before the FCC today require this type of expertise; things such as efficient and effective broadband deployment, quality spectrum management that schools and libraries desperately need, as well as hospitals that also desperately need this spectrum, and fostering innovation just in the general sense. If we want a growing economy with more jobs, better jobs, higher paying jobs, we need access to the latest technologies across the country.  As the currently appointed Chair of the FCC, Ajit has improved openness and transparency within the Commission, eliminated onerous and duplicative regulations holding up that innovation, and has protected consumers from illegal and fraudulent robocalls. One recent decision under his leadership that has received so much attention from consumer advocates, industry representatives, and policy academics is the FCC order Restoring Internet Freedom Notice of Proposed  Under Chairman Pai's leadership, the Commission has collected tens of millions of comments regarding the agency's proposal to roll back the 2015 open internet order and has extended the deadline so more interested parties can be heard. This input collection, coupled with fundamentally improving the rulemaking processes, has increased the Commission's culture of openness and transparency, something I certainly support and would continue to encourage.  I believe the Federal Government must ensure a fair and open internet that is not blocked or slowed. I do not want outdated utility-style regulations to the internet that were established for telephone companies in the 1930s. Instead of leaving this important regulatory framework open to interpretation and change with every new administration, Congress--the U.Senate--and our Commerce Committee should and must craft bipartisan legislation that preserves the fair and open internet.  Chairman Pai has taken thoughtful steps toward a long-term solution by seeking to eliminate the harmful 2015 regulations hindering broadband deployment and harming an innovative internet ecosystem.  Ajit Pai has repeatedly proven himself to be a public servant of the highest caliber, with strong integrity and character. I am proud to recommend his swift confirmation to the Federal Communications Commission and call on my colleagues to support his nomination. Ajit Pai is an intelligent, articulate public servant who has the character and integrity that is required at the Federal Communications I support his nomination and ask my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  Mr.McCONNELL, Mr.President, as I noted last week, the nominee before us, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, has led a fascinating life with two defining features: hard work and success.

405,topic-id,399,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding.  Mr.Chair, I rise today as a member of the Budget Committee to express my strong opposition to this budget resolution, which, if passed, would leave countless working families behind, and not to mention would, in fact, raise the Federal debt by at least $3 trillion over the first decade and by at least $6.6 trillion by the end of the second 10 years.  This proposed budget is an atrocious representation of our values. As more Americans find it harder and harder to get by, this budget guts what people need to be most successful. It takes away dollars from education; it takes away dollars from the programs we rely on for retirement, for switching between jobs, for healthcare.  We should be focused on funding the things that will enable the workforce to prepare for the 21st century, not gutting programs that will leave them falling further behind.  Rather than funding luxury travel for the Trump administration, let's invest in quality education, job skills training, and properly fund the State Department and foreign aid programs that Secretary of Defense Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dunford have said are critical to our national security.  This budget puts working families, our economy, and our national security at risk.  Passage of this budget would also pave the way for Republican tax reform, if you want to call it that, which would favor big businesses that destroy our small towns.  It shouldn't be easier for a company to get a tax break on buying another robot than training their employees to gain skills for the modern economy. We need a tax plan to incentivize companies to invest in their workers instead of engaging in a race to the bottom where workers are viewed as a burden rather than an asset.  We need a budget that will foster economic growth for all of our people, and we need to make taxes more simple and fair for working families, not give handouts to the rich.  Mr.Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this proposed budget so that we can go back to the table--or, actually, to go to the table for the first time as Democrats and Republicans, and have a conversation about funding the resources that will actually move our economy and country forward into the 21st century and beyond.

115,topic-id,1986,"Mr.President, my colleague from Massachusetts has referred to the tragedy that we all watched unfold late on Sunday evening in Las Vegas, NV--the tragedy, the horror, the shock of so many. Alaska has felt the brunt of that tragedy as well. We lost two Alaskans; at least one other was injured. Mr.Adrian Murfitt from Anchorage, a commercial fisherman, lost his life that evening. Dorene Anderson, who is a mom and self-described hockey promoter, will not be returning to Alaska with her family. Rob McIntosh, who is a realtor[[Page S6275]]from the Fairbanks-North Pole area, was also injured. Our prayers are with him and with all of the families.  Whether they are from Alaska or from around the country, the tragedy, the loss, is just a shocking emotion that has been brought to this It is really horrifying on so many different levels. I express my condolences not only to the families of the Alaskans whom we have lost but to all of those who are suffering.          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  Mr.President, I want to speak on another matter, and that is the tragedy related to natural disasters we have seen visited on our country, the devastating impacts that Hurricanes Irma and Maria have had on the U.Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico, the current relief efforts that are underway on those islands, and how we might help in the long term to rebuild, particularly as it relates to their electric grid and their power sector.  Mr.President, as the Presiding Officer serves on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have the honor of being the chairman of that Committee, and that is the committee of jurisdiction for our territories.  Our committee's history dates back to 1816, when it was then called the Committee on Public The acquisition of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam in 1898, through the Treaty of Paris, led to the creation of the Committee on Insular Affairs in 1899. The U.Virgin Islands were included in that committee's jurisdiction following their purchase from Denmark in 1917.  In 1946, the Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on Insular Affairs merged to form the Committee on Interior and Insular In 1977, the committees were again reorganized, leading to the current structure of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural  Our committee has had the proud distinction of working with the territories for the last 70-plus years. Certainly, following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, we are committed to upholding our responsibilities to the people of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin  Perhaps it is because I was born in a territory--I need to actually look this up; it may be that I am the only Member of Congress or Member in the Senate who was actually born in a territory--but I feel an affinity. One would not think there is much connection between a small island territory like Puerto Rico and the large landmass that we have in Alaska, but in many ways, Alaska is also islanded in the sense that we are not part of the continental 48. So I do follow with great interest and care how Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands are included.  With the current focus almost entirely on Puerto Rico right now, it can seem like a distant memory that only 2 weeks ago, before Hurricane Maria, we had Hurricane Irma, which hit the islands of Thomas and John as a category 5 hurricane. One category 5 is bad enough, but then to have a second category 5 hurricane hit just 2 weeks later, this time impacting the island of Croix, is almost unfathomable.  The devastation we have seen in both the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico can seem overwhelming. Relief operations for the islands are different from what you have with the mainland. When you recognize how you move to accommodate relief, everything has to be brought in by ship or by plane. You don't have the convoys of trucks rolling down the highway from an adjoining You don't have the ability to take alternative routes to reach the affected areas. Once goods are delivered to ports, for instance, it is another challenge, then, to get them from the port for inland distribution.  Even under normal operating conditions, moving the amount of containers that have flooded into the territories would be a challenge, but when you add into it the debris, the downed power lines, the washed-out bridges and roads, the lack of power, and the driver shortages, the challenges become colossal.  Then you have other limiting factors. You have competition for hotel rooms and other lodging as you bring in relief workers to go to the islands while refugees who have lost their homes try to leave. Again, the logistics are almost overwhelming; it is a logistical nightmare.  Despite these very considerable hurdles, we do see that progress is being made. According to recent reports from the Army Corps of Engineers, Federal and local response crews have been working to reopen the ports and runways. In some cases, we have seen sunken ships that need to be removed before a port can begin operations again.  In Puerto Rico, 13 of 16 ports are open or open with restrictions. In the U.Virgin Islands, five of nine ports are open or open with restrictions.  In addition, 15 of 17 priority dams in Puerto Rico have already been inspected. In the case of Guajataca Dam, it is in the process of being reinforced. The dam's spillway continues to erode. Rainfall has increased the water level in the reservoir. We have seen that the debris and the downed power lines need to be removed to allow helicopters to place 44 concrete barriers within the spillway channel. In fact, 900 super sandbags are on their way. Pumps and piping are being procured to help decrease the water level. There are a lot of hands on deck there.  For electricity, as of October 1, 5 percent of customers in Puerto Rico have had their power restored. The Puerto Rico electric utility expects to have power restored to 15 percent of customers over the next 2 weeks.  I looked at this aspect of it and recognize that it is still pretty warm in Puerto I checked the weather this afternoon, and it is 87 degrees. Over the next couple of days, it will be 93 degrees. Making sure that folks have power, have an ability to keep fans, to have air conditioning--this is critical.  Assessments show significant damage to the transmission and distribution systems, so, again, a great deal of work is yet underway there.  In the Virgin Islands, 15 percent of customers in Thomas and 10 percent of customers in Croix have had their power restored. This includes the airports and the hospitals.  On the hospitals, I would note that both the hospitals in the U.Virgin Islands--one in Thomas and one in Croix--have sustained heavy damage and may need to be replaced. Again, long term, moving forward, this is critical infrastructure.  We do know that in the immediate term, the primary relief that Congress can provide is through our appropriations process. We will soon be considering another tranche of disaster relief funds so that those impacted by these hurricanes have the food, water, and medicine they need as recovery efforts continue.  Other options, such as making the rum tax cover-over payments permanent and increasing or lifting the cap on community disaster loans may also need to be considered as ways to get the islands back on their feet.  Another part of our responsibility, though, is to look at potential long-term solutions to persistent problems. In the case of Puerto Rico, it is their antiquated electric grid and power generation system.  I have had many conversations with many colleagues in these past couple of weeks. I am concerned that current disaster recovery rules may mandate that the damaged or destroyed entity be restored with similar material, compared to its condition prior to the disaster. What may seem like a good, general rule of thumb in some scenarios, like this one--I don't think it makes a lot of sense. Why would we consider spending hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild what was an inefficient, unreliable electric power grid in Puerto Rico?  Making sure that we do right going forward is important for us. I am going to be meeting with officials with the U.Army Corps of They have been tasked by FEMA with rebuilding Puerto Rico's electricity grid. I am going to meet with the Army Corps and the Department of Energy to see if there is a way to modernize Puerto Rico's grid during its rebuild, whether by administrative or legislative action. I think we need to look at different considerations moving forward.  There has been a discussion about whether it makes more sense to bury transmission lines rather than rebuild towers. We need to look at microgrids and consider whether they should be developed to provide power to communities throughout the island even if the[[Page S6276]]islandwide grid is down. This is something our committee has been keenly focused on--the application of microgrids and how they might be better utilized.  I would note on this matter that the urban area of Mayaguez is currently receiving power from the hydro-gas plant that is located within its municipality. It is essentially its own microgrid. But the damaged transmission lines prevent electricity from moving to other municipalities across the island.  There are other considerations, including the role that distributed generation plays. Can these Federal entities work with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, PREPA, to develop a demonstration project for the island that would make the grid more efficient, more reliable, reduce the cost of electricity to consumers? These are all things that need to be considered. We had a hearing in the Energy Committee this morning on energy storage technologies, and it was mentioned there that regional technology demonstrations might be particularly helpful for Puerto Rico at this time.  I intend to visit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands with other Members a few weeks from now. We know President Trump is there today. We are going to wait until the situation has stabilized just a bit more to allow for these relief efforts to continue. When we have an opportunity to observe the situation ourselves, I think it is worth noting that we will, on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, be holding a hearing on the impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on both Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, and I anticipate we will be doing that in the coming weeks. We want to look at not only the damage caused and where recovery efforts stand but also lessons learned as well as opportunities moving forward as to how we can rebuild Puerto Rico's electric grid to better than it was before so it does have a resiliency and it does have a sustainability that I think is imperative moving forward.  We recognize that the islands have faced a real tragedy in this natural disaster, but, from this, can we work quickly to stabilize things in the short term but allow this to be an opportunity to think about Puerto Rico's long-term energy future--an energy future that is more resilient and is more sustainable.  So our thoughts and prayers are with all who were impacted by these incredibly powerful storms as they dig out, as they rebuild, as they restart their lives, and just as we will take care of the people of Texas and Louisiana and Florida, I want to make sure the people of Puerto Rico and the people of the U.Virgin Islands know we stand united with them during these exceptionally difficult times and that we will work with them as partners to make their islands stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for whatever the future may bring them.

171,topic-id,829,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute to Ermalee Hickel, the wife of our late Governor, Wally Hickel, who passed away on September 14 at the age of 92. Ermalee was married to Wally Hickel for 65 years until his death in 2010. She is buried next to her husband in Anchorage Memorial Park, standing up, facing Washington, just as Governor Hickel was.  This is the way the power couple of post-Statehood Alaska desired to be remembered. Standing up for Alaskans to[[Page S6357]]Washington, A powerful symbol not only to Alaskans, but Washington, that the battle for Alaska's sovereignty is far from over and that the Hickels, in spirit, stand with Alaskans as we wage this battle to conclusion, however long that may take.  Wally and Ermalee's son, Jack Hickel, remembers these words explaining why his father wanted to be buried standing up. ``He said, if they don't do it right he's going to crawl out of his grave and straighten them out. He thought they were going to screw everything up. He wanted to keep his eye on them.'' Now there will be two pair of eyes gazing east.  Ermalee, I should warn you, has two pretty tough eyes. She was widely known as ``more beautiful than a butterfly, but tougher than a boot.''  The history books will mention that Ermalee was twice the first lady of Alaska, as well as the wife of a Secretary of the They might mention that she was a strong woman, but that really doesn't tell you much about the person, and there is really much more to the story.  Ermalee was born to Lewis and Aline The Strutzes moved from Montana to Anchorage in 1924. They bought a house downtown and raised six kids in that house: four girls and two boys. Anchorage was a pretty small town in the day, but it had plenty of life. As a high school student, Ermalee did it all. She was a softball player, editor of the school paper, and quite popular. She never missed a dance. She ushered at the movie theatre and, unique to Anchorage, worked at a cannery. Upon graduation, she went to work on the local base as the secretary to a military officer, a very important job for an outstanding individual. The Strutz girls were like that--popular, successful, from a really good family.  Wally Hickel, on the other hand, arrived in Anchorage from Kansas in 1940 with all of 37 cents in his pocket. His family was in insurance, but he left Kansas to pursue his passion in boxing. That led him to California, and when it didn't work out, Wally booked a ticket in steerage on a vessel headed to He replenished his bank account by winning a $125 purse at a boxing tournament conducted during Fur Rondy, the Anchorage winter carnival. Wally married a local girl, Jannice Cannon, who went to school with Wally and Jannice had a son, Jannice tragically died in 1943 at the Mayo Wally returned to Anchorage, a single dad, and took a job inspecting aircraft on the ramp of Alaska airbases.  In 1945, Ermalee and Wally were married in a small Catholic Church and went on to build a family. It was a tough time for the both of them. Wally still had to pay off Jannice's medical bills and worked a second job as a bartender and a bouncer to make ends meet.  Wally subsequently quit his job on base and told Ermalee that he figured it out. Anchorage was growing and construction was its future. Turns out, he was right. The family found stability and a modicum of wealth. That gave Wally the freedom to pursue his interest in politics. Over time, Wally's investments in Anchorage's growth provided a strong financial foundation for the family.  Throughout it all, Ermalee was a steadfast partner--managing the house, putting chains on the tires of the car to take the kids skiing, even ironing the pants of her hero, Charles Lindbergh, when he came to Juneau to address the Alaska Lindbergh asked Ermalee if she would get ``the help'' to press his pants. Turns out Ermalee was ``the help.''  ``Ermalee was calm, empathetic and insightful. Wally turned to her and followed her counsel. She guided and protected him, out of sight,'' wrote Anchorage author and historian Charles She read to schoolchildren and visited with elders in the Pioneer's She visited the soup kitchens and the juvenile detention facilities. She fought for benefits for the disabled, raised awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome, and sought to protect seniors from scammers. She did it all without ever seeking credit. Ermalee was always gracious and lovely to me.  Wohlforth headlined his column remembering Ermalee Hickel's legacy with the words ``Ermalee Hickel led Alaska, too.'' She did with dignity and grace from the beginning to the very end. It is an honor and a pleasure to share this story of an Alaskan life well lived with the Senate today.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-05-pt1-PgS6356-4.txt,1694,CLOTURE MOTION,2017,5,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

790,topic-id,509,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize one of our Nation's finest literary journals, the Alaska Quarterly Review, now marking its 35th year of literary excellence.  Alaska Quarterly Review was first published in 1982 at the University of Alaska Anchorage and has evolved to be a joint publication of the university and the Center for Narrative and Lyric From the beginning, it was designed to highlight the work of strong literary voices from Alaska and beyond. Publishing fiction, short plays, poetry, photo essays, and literary nonfiction, the journal has an especially strong commitment to promote new and emerging writers.  The founding editor and editor-in-chief of Alaska Quarterly Review, Ronald Spatz, envisioned the journal as a way to break through stereotypes and present Alaska to the greater literary community. That goal was far surpassed, as Alaska Quarterly Review has won accolades from some of the most prestigious reviewers and publications in the country. Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Michael Dirda wrote in The New York Review of Books that the Alaska Quarterly Review ``remains one of our best, and most imaginative, literary magazines.'' The New York Times Book Review labeled it ``fresh treasure.''  Alaska Quarterly Review has also been featured and supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Alaska Humanities Forum, Alaska State Council on the Arts, and the Rasmussen Foundation, and honored by Alaska Center for the Book and others. A number of works originally published in the journal have been subsequently selected for inclusion in The Best American Essays, The Best American Poetry, The Best American Mystery Stories, The Best Creative Nonfiction, The Best American Short Stories, The Best American Nonrequired Reading, Prize Stories: The Henry Awards, The Beacon Best, and The Pushcart Prize: The Best of the Small  In addition to its literary influence on the national level, Alaska Quarterly Review brings a strong focus to the development and importance of Alaska Native and indigenous literatures. Alaska Native language survival and resilience are portrayed as a national and global concern.  Mr.Spatz writes that Alaska Quarterly Review ``has been and is of Alaska but not We have a global perspective, and, although we have published primarily American authors, our writers hail from a wide range of nations.'' The journal's 35th anniversary observance in October reaches across the Pacific Ocean by featuring ``In the Footprint of the Crocodile Man: Memories, Myths and Contemporary Art of the Sepik River, Papua New Guinea,'' a reflection of the commonalities of human experience. At the same event, the universal elements of birth and language are celebrated in a beautiful film, ``Shaawatke'es Birth,'' performed in English and Tlingit, one of Alaska's precious indigenous languages.  The impact of Alaska Quarterly Review extends far from its origins in my home State and is worthy of celebration by this body and all Americans who recognize the power of the literary arts to shape our thoughts, our ideals, and our country. I commend Alaska Quarterly Review and its editor, Ronald Spatz, its contributors, and its supporters for 35 years of excellence. I hope for many more to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-02-pt1-PgS6259.txt,1694,"TRIBUTE TO TIMUEL D.

1103,topic-id,1619,"Mr.President, I want to acknowledge and thank the Senator from North She has been a champion for the Native people, the indigenous people around the country, including in my State of Whether it is working to address the issues related to childhood trauma, which so many of our young Native children face, or the issues relating to domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking--these are scourges that we see directed, unfortunately, at so many of our Native women in the State of Alaska, in the State of North Dakota, and around the country.  She has cited the statistics. I think sometimes we just get numb by the statistics. When you are told that you are four times the national average, that sounds bad. But what does that mean? When you put a face to it, when you hear the tragedy repeated through the stories, these are not just statistics that we are speaking of. These are real women. These are our sisters. These are our neighbors. These are our friends, and these are human beings who deserve to be respected in their lives but also respected in other tragic deaths. How we work to address these difficult issues needs to be a focus and a priority for us.  So I appreciate what the Senator from North Dakota is doing in bringing attention to our Nation's lackluster--and that is kind of a polite term here--response to the tragedy of missing and murdered Native women and girls.  I am proud to lend my voice to the proposition that Congress, in the exercise of our trust responsibility to our Native peoples, has a responsibility to do more. You would think that that trust responsibility demands us to be paying even closer attention, and yet it seems that we just withdraw from that, that that responsibility is not acknowledged.  Now, it is not often here in the United States that we benchmark our treatment of indigenous peoples against Canada, but in this case, there is actually a compelling difference between Canada's national response to the tragedy of missing and murdered Native women and our seeming indifference here in the United  Down in southeastern Alaska, right across on the Canadian side, lies a town called Prince It is in British The Alaskan ferry comes in from Washington State and stops in Prince Rupert and then moves into Prince Rupert is also the terminus of Highway 16, and the locals refer to Highway 16 as the ``Highway of Tears.'' They refer to it as the ``Highway of Tears'' because it is a road on which Native women and girls have vanished for decades now. The question is, How many? Who is disappearing? Some would say as few as 12 and perhaps as many as 43. CBS News devoted a segment of its news magazine show ``48 Hours'' to the Highway of  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed 54 million Canadian dollars to a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. I will admit that there is some controversy over whether the national inquiry is actually fulfilling its mission, but my point here is that Canada stepped up. They have acknowledged that this is an issue, that this is a problem, and they have responded to the disproportionate victimization of Native women and girls, and they have done so in a tangible way. Here in the United States, as my friend and colleague has noted, we are more than a bit late in acknowledging that the problem even exists.  Earlier this year, the Senators from Montana--both Senator Daines and Senator Tester--were successful in designating May 5, 2017, through a resolution, as the National Day of Awareness on Missing and Murdered Native Women and The resolution recites that some Tribal communities face murder rates that are 10 times the national average, as Senator Heitkamp has noted. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide was the third leading cause of death among Native women between the ages of 10 and 24 years and the fifth leading cause of death for Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 years of age. So we are trying to raise attention and awareness. We are trying to shine a spotlight on this issue.  I certainly think it is high time that Federal law enforcement answer the question, Why? Why is the murder rate for Native women so high, and why are we not addressing it in a comprehensive fashion? The Senator from North Dakota has pointed out that in many areas, jurisdictional issues are at play, and I agree. That is not an excuse. We acknowledge that we have challenges with jurisdictions. Let's figure this out. Women are disappearing and dying.  In Alaska, it is not so much jurisdictional issues; it is the fact that in far too many of our communities, we lack any law enforcement presence. We might have a VPSO--a village safety police officer--but they are not armed. They are very limited in terms of their ability to provide for levels of enforcement. More frustrating than so much of that is that women who have been victimized feel as though reporting doesn't get them anywhere because there is no follow-through. There is no prosecution. There has been no effort that will allow them to have any level of recourse, much less justice, visited upon them.  As we talk about these issues of jurisdiction and law enforcement and the rates that we see, I think we need to be clear that the discussion today--the call for justice--is not driven by statistics and rates. It is driven by their faces. It is driven by the loss of people's daughters, people's siblings, people's friends, including Savannah and Stella and Nicole and Mona These are all real people, real women with names, with faces, with families.  In Alaska, the face we so often associate with the lack of progress when it comes to addressing the issue of missing and murdered Native women is the face of Sophie This year marks the 24th anniversary of the death of Sophie Sergie from Pitkas This is a Yup'ik village in southwest  On August 26 of 1993, Sophie was found dead in the women's bathroom dorm on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus. She was raped. She was shot dead. It is believed that her body remained in that bathroom for some 13 hours before it was found. The murder weapon was never recovered. That case is still a cold case 24 years later. But we don't forget Sophie Sergie, just as[[Page S6366]]we don't forget the women the Senator from North Dakota has shared stories about. We cannot forget these women.  Unlike the tragedies along the Highway of Tears, we really don't know how many Native women and girls have gone missing and murdered. That is a big part of the problem. But I will tell my colleagues that if you ask advocates for Native women, the answer comes back: It is no secret. We all know somebody. We all know somebody who has gone missing, somebody who has been murdered.  That was the testimony of Tammy She is the executive director for the Alaska Native Women's Resource Center, and she testified before a congressional briefing last Tammy told the briefing that her organization has documented as many as 50 names of women. When we think about it, numbers on that order were significant enough for Prime Minister Trudeau to commission a national inquiry. So it causes us to ask the question, What about us? What number do we have to get to before there is a call to action, before we wake up and say: This is not acceptable. This is not acceptable that our Native women are disappearing, are being murdered.  Native women are asking why Federal law enforcement has no protocol for addressing the crisis in our Indian Country, why there is a lack of coordination among criminal justice agencies in this country to set aside the jurisdictional challenges and investigate these tragedies in an effective manner, and why there is a lack of victim services.  In the Indian Affairs Committee, we had a hearing on human trafficking, sex trafficking. It was pretty revealing about the lack of victim services--specific--that could be there to help our Native victims. Right now, the families of missing and murdered Native women in Alaska have to cover the cost of a traditional burial. They have to cover the cost of immediate long-term counseling, and so many other expenses they can't afford. We maintain a victims of crime fund here in this country to address these sorts of costs, but there is no dedicated Tribal funding stream. We have had some pretty bipartisan efforts here in the Senate to establish one, but we haven't even been able to do that bare minimum to provide for the victims.  The issue we are discussing today is tragic and frustrating. It is depressing. But to remain silent is to truly further marginalize Native women and girls, and that is unacceptable. Perhaps we are not going to devote tens of millions of dollars to a national inquiry; However, it is high time that we acknowledge a problem that has failed to make headlines in this country, because you first have to acknowledge that a problem exists to make headway in addressing that problem.  So, again, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for her strong and steadfast advocacy on behalf of not only our Native women but our Native children, our indigenous peoples across this country. I appreciate all that is being done, and I look forward to working with her again as we try to shine a brighter light on a very tragic situation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-10-05-pt1-PgS6361.txt,1694,CLOTURE MOTION,2017,5,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
277,topic-id,2482,"Mr.President, I think all of us felt a familiar knot in our stomach early this morning when we received news of what might be the deadliest mass shooting in American history. The numbers are hard to comprehend. They certainly aren't final. Fifty-eight people are dead, and perhaps over 500 have been wounded, either by the gunshots themselves or by the pandemonium that ensued once the thousands of concertgoers in downtown Las Vegas figured out they were being fired upon from above.  There is nothing wrong with sending every thought and prayer and every bit of your heart to Las Vegas, to all of the family members who lost loved ones, to those who are recovering, to the first responders, and to the community at large. It really does help. I lived through one of these as a witness in Sandy Many of those parents are still my friends. We are about the same age, and our kids are the same age. While there are absolutely no words and no gestures that can ever salve the wounds that come with losing a child--especially a first grader--it did not hurt to know that the rest of the world was thinking every single minute about that community. There was an overwhelming amount of stuff that showed up in Sandy Hook--the teddy bears that piled up in the days and weeks that followed. It was a reminder to that town that they weren't forgotten. It helps. It does. But it is not enough.  I want to just spend a few moments--I know I was preceded by a few of my colleagues--to talk about the work that we have to do here if we are to address what I would consider to be a festering, lingering paradox that exists in this country. What I mean by that is this. This is a country that leads. Almost every great magical invention in this world today--whether it be open economies, participatory democracies, communication through the internet--is essentially a modern American invention.  The reason that we were able to catapult the rest of the world in just a quarter millennium to a point of global preeminence is because we saw big problems and we solved them before anybody else did. Then we took those solutions and we exported them to the rest of the world. That is a definitional characteristic of this country--working harder than anybody else to solve big problems and then giving that solution to others so they can use it for themselves. The paradox lies here. We solved a lot of big problems: How to govern ourselves, how to order our economies, how to talk to each other, and how to save people from disease. Yet maybe the longest standing human concern is a very simple one--concern for our physical safety.[[Page S6252]]  I can chart you a history of civilization based upon society's ability to protect more consistently our physical body. That is, in fact, one of the original reasons why humans found each other--to try to protect ourselves from physical harm that comes from the outside. The paradox lies in the fact that, when it comes to this country's ability to protect its citizens from physical harm, we are not a leader. We are a laggard. We are an outlier when compared to other industrialized first-world nations. You are much more likely to meet a violent death, especially by the hands of a firearm, in this country than you are in other first-world countries.  It is time for us to explore why this paradox exists. Why are we such a leader and why have we been such a leader over the course of 240 years on so many different concerns, and yet we are a laggard when it comes to protecting ourselves and our fellow citizens from physical violence? The scope of this problem is enormous. When you look at OECD countries, there are just a handful that have a higher rate of violence--and, in particular, gun violence--than the United  I have been down on this floor as have Senator Durbin and others to talk about the numbers, over and over. But every day approximately 80 people lose their lives by gunfire, and two-thirds of those are suicide. But still, about 30 people every day are killed with a gun that is used by someone else. There is really no other country in the industrialized world that meets that rate of gun violence.  The mass shootings, which get the most attention, are truly epidemic. We have become normalized and regularized to 50 or 40 or 30 people losing their lives, but this happens nowhere else other than the United States at this rate. This is a uniquely American problem, and, by the way, it is not just the Las Vegases, the Orlandos, and the Sandy We have actually had more mass shootings this year than days in the year, if you categorize a mass shooting as four or more people being shot in any one given time. Let me guarantee you, if four or more people were shot in your town or your neighborhood, that would be a cataclysmic event, and yet it happens on average more than once a day in this country. Because we have become so regularized to it, only with the moments like last night, where the scale is truly epic, do we focus on it as a  I want my colleagues to understand the pain that comes when the victims of this kind of epidemic violence see nothing but silence from this body. The hurt is deep. The scars are wide in Newtown, but they are made wider by the fact that this body, in 4\1/2\ years, has done absolutely nothing to reduce the likelihood of another mass shooting. Indeed, because we have done nothing, the mass shootings continue.  I know these are harsh words, but I believe it in my heart. I think this is an unintentional endorsement that gets sent to these mass murderers when, slaughter after slaughter, Congress does nothing. If the greatest deliberative body in the world doesn't act in unison to condemn them through policy change, it starts to feel and look like complicity. So there is going to be another wave of unimaginable pain that will sweep across Las Vegas and the country as we learn about who these victims were and, perhaps, as the numbers mount. They will, over time, be just as angry and just as furious at this body as those parents in Sandy Hook are today that we do nothing to try to reduce the likelihood of these shootings. Compassion is important, but it is not enough.  I read a little passage of the Bible to my 5-year-old son every night. I am the furthest thing from a theologian, but I know that sprinkled throughout the Bible are references to the fact that prayer has to be matched with action--with works. James says: ``Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.'' Thoughts and prayers need to be matched by action, and that is our job. Our job, frankly, is not just to send good thoughts. The reason why we exist is to act, to change the laws of the Nation, and to address challenges that our constituents face. Since the beginning of time, the most important challenge our constituents have faced--the human race has faced--is that of physical security.  So before I turn this over to my colleagues, let me just run down very quickly through the arguments that are going to be used over the next few days to continue to do nothing. The first is already in operation today, and it is a critique I hear very often. It is often lodged at me personally. It is this: To talk about policy change in the wake of a mass shooting is to politicalize it, to cheapen it. I reject that argument in full force because the reality is that every single day there is a mass shooting. Every single day 80 people die from gun violence. Unfortunately, the news media doesn't pay attention to that regular carnage.  If we aren't talking about policy change the day after a mass shooting in this country, then you are never talking about policy change, because a mass shooting happens, on average, every day. Unfortunately, the ones in which 8 people are shot or 12 people are shot do not get national attention.  Second, whether we like it or not, the world's attention--the country's attention--is positioned on this question of how we protect our country from harm in the immediate aftermath of these mass shootings. It is an enormous gift to the gun lobby, to the forces of status quo, if we cannot talk about how to change our laws to make people safer when everyone's mind is on that question. When a murder occurs, there is not a 48-hour waiting period before the police can try to investigate who did it and how to hold them accountable. So why can't we get immediately to the question of why these shootings are happening and try to solve it?  Also, others today are saying that legislation is a pointless exercise because you can't regulate away evil. There is truth to that. There are evil people in the world who are regularly doing very bad things, and there is no way that a set of laws can stop people from doing harm. But I would argue in some way, shape, or form, that the very nature of government is an attempt to try to regulate the effect of evil on citizens. Our laws against murder, arson, rape, and assault are attempts to try to make sure that people are protected from evil, from bad people. So why can't we have a conversation about how to make sure that people who are contemplating mass violence, at the very least, do the least violence possible?  It is not coincidental that these epidemic mass shootings, in which 50 or 60 or 40 people have died, largely have happened after the expiration of the assault weapons ban. Now that it is much easier to get your hands on a gun that is much more accurate and much more lethal, the likelihood of large numbers of people dying, as happened last night, is much greater.  An AR-15 style weapon does something different to a human body than a pistol does. That is why 20 kids were shot in Sandy Hook, and not a single one of them survived.  Laws do work. Just look at a State like Connecticut, which requires universal background checks, doesn't allow you to buy assault weapons, and requires you to get a permit before you can carry it. When we passed that set of laws, it resulted in a 40-percent reduction in gun violence, even when you attribute or account for other factors that could have caused that reduction. That is a Johns Hopkins study.  In places that have universal background checks, gun homicides are lower; domestic violence homicides are much lower by a degree of 40 percent. Laws work. The data is irrefutable on this point.  Though you can't regulate away evil in total, you can do more to protect people, especially from this mass-scope gun violence.  Third, people will say: Well, this guy clearly was very mentally ill. With gun laws, you can't do anything about the fact that people are mentally ill. That is true. We should fix our broken system of mental health treatment because it is broken, but we should also recognize that this problem of mass execution is a uniquely American problem, despite the fact that there is no evidence that we have a higher rate of mental illness than any other country.  There are plenty of very mentally ill people in other OECD countries. But in those countries, their mental illness is not a straight line to a gun crime, in large part because they have a very different set of laws that make it harder[[Page S6253]]to get your hands on a gun and much harder, if not impossible, to get your hands on a weapon that does the kind of mass violence we saw last night.  Lastly, one of the favorite arguments is that this is just too hot an issue for the U.Senate or a political body to handle, that it is controversial. It is controversial, but it is not as controversial as people may think.  In fact, the issue of background checks--which I understand may not have been dispositive on what happened in Las Vegas last night but might have reduced the likelihood that another 80 people died from gun violence over the course of Sunday--is supported by 80 percent of  Most polls will suggest that a majority of Americans support the other sweep in law changes that I talked about as well.  In fact, many of the first steps we would take as a body--saying that people on the terrorist watch list can't buy guns, tightening up the law to make sure people who are mentally ill can't buy guns--are supported by 80 to 90 percent of our constituents, no matter whether they live in a blue State or a red The question of making sure that only the right people own guns is actually one of the least controversial issues in the American public today. Why don't we start by finding that common ground? Then maybe after that, we can find other common ground.  This is going to keep happening. This is going to keep happening over and over again. I know the answer can't be that we are powerless, as a body, to do something about it. I personally just can't bring that answer back to the families of Sandy Hook for another year.  I don't want to speak for them, but I have a feeling that the delegation from Nevada is going to have a hard time bringing that answer back to the victims in Las Vegas as well.  This is a growing fraternity--a tragic, awful fraternity--of Members of Congress who represent States and have gone through these horrific mass executions. I had too many phone calls from Senators, Representatives, who were already part of that club when Sandy Hook happened. I got to make that call this morning, as well, to offer whatever advice I could on how to help the community heal.  But this silence has become an unintentional endorsement. It has become a kind of sick complicity, and I hope that in the coming days we can come together--Republicans and Democrats--to start talking about, at the very least, some baby steps to show the people of Las Vegas, to show the people of Orlando, to show my constituents, my friends from Sandy Hook, that silence is no longer an option.  I yield the floor.

1015,topic-id,345,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for yielding the time to me.  Madam Speaker, more than 40 years ago, the Supreme Court held that women have the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy prior to viability or at any time to protect the life and health of the mother. This bill is flatly unconstitutional on both counts.  The Supreme Court has blocked every other 20-week ban because 20 weeks is well before the point of viability. Further, the bill includes no exception for the health of the mother, only waiving the ban if a woman's life is at imminent risk, in clear violation of a woman's constitutional rights.  Shamefully, the bill places new and cruel restrictions even on women accessing abortion after rape or incest.  Once again, the Republicans are proclaiming the falsehood that 20-week-old fetuses can feel pain, contrary to the conclusions of every reputable researcher in the field.  What about women like Danielle from New York, who found out in the 29th week of her pregnancy that her baby's brain was dangerously deformed and that, if she and the baby were to survive the pregnancy, the baby would only live a short, extremely painful life.  Danielle and her husband had two young children and faced a heartbreaking decision: Should they put Danielle and their family through the pain and suffering of a dangerous pregnancy and birth and allow their baby to suffer and die in pain, or should she terminate the pregnancy and mourn their baby as a family?  The Constitution guarantees Danielle the right to make that choice with her family and her doctors. It does not grant that right to the politicians sitting in this room.                              {time}  1630  I will close with Danielle's words: ``What my husband and I experienced was just so horrible. Unless people have walked in my shoes, they don't understand. I did what was right for my son and my family, and it's no one else's business.''  On behalf of Danielle, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this horrible bill. We must stop the bans.

416,topic-id,717,"Mr.Chair, since the gentlewoman, my friend from Tennessee, remarked upon economic growth, let me, as one who was here at the time, perhaps correct the  Bill Clinton's economic growth was higher than Ron Reagan's, and that is not in dispute. Barack Obama's economic growth was higher than George Bush's. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month at the end of the Bush administration, to bring up one point, which, by the way, is closer to 2.1 percent.  People here know I follow these issues like a hawk, but the truth is that this budget today that is being put forward is a threat to Medicare and Social Security down the road.  The previous speaker said he is concerned about mandatory spending. I gotcha. Put out a plan. Put out a plan on Social Security and And don't do it in the backdoor way here as they complain about deficits and they prepare to embrace a tax cut of $1.5 trillion or, over 10 years, $2.2 trillion on top of the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 which amounted to $2.3 trillion. So we are at $5 trillion worth of tax cuts, and the Clinton administration left us with four balanced budgets and $5 trillion worth of surplus.  This is not a budget that supports meaningful tax reform. I am ready, and she knows because of our working together in the past, prepared to work with Republicans on fundamental tax reform. The system is begging for it.  Don't call tax reform tax reform when it is really a tax cut. And that is where this is headed, and I think they know that as well.  This is a partisan roadmap that has failed in the past. They are using reconciliation instruction so that the majority can ram through a tax plan here. That is all it is about.  Last night, by the way, the tradeoff is in some States you can keep the mortgage interest deduction if you are willing to give up the State and local tax deduction.  I want to tell you something, I guarantee you right now, based on long history, we will end up keeping both, and they will have to add more to the debt as time goes on.  Is this a cut for the wealthy? Eighty percent of the tax cut goes to the top 1 percent in 2027.                              {time}  1445  This is from the Tax Policy Center in Incidentally, how great is it to have a nonpartisan scoring committee offer us a snapshot of the future?  The average tax cut for millionaires, $230,000 a year in 2027. The average tax[[Page H7782]]cut for the top one-tenth of 1 percent is $1 million in the year 2027.  The people in this country who need tax relief are the middle class. We should be investing in human capital, community colleges; we should be investing in vocational education.  So 45 percent of all households with children will see a tax increase in 2027. Among households earning between $50,000 and $150,000, you are going to see a one-third tax increase in 2027.  I look at this and say: Why are we not offering some relief to middle class Americans? Why are we not investing in them? Do we not have enough faith in them to help them get through what have been difficult times with children in college and costs mounting all of the time?  Instead, it is back to tax relief for people at the very top. I guess concentrated wealth in America now is not a big issue. I guess the top 1 percent in America who, by the way, aren't even asking for tax relief--that is the irony of this. They are not asking for tax relief. They are arguing for more investment in America rather than concentrating more money in fewer hands.  The American people deserve a Tax Code that is based on fairness. Our code should reward hardworking, middle class families, small business, innovation, and ensure that no one, no matter how wealthy they are, can avoid paying their fair share.  Our focus is going to be on helping the middle class, creating jobs, boosting wages, and giving people the assistance they need in a complicated economy with their grocery bills and childcare as well.

11,topic-id,238,"Mr.President, the aftermath of Las Vegas is a time for this Senator to reflect on whether a shooting is like Mateen's, in the Orlando nightclub, where he was motivated as a terrorist, and then there was the remarkable recovery of Congressman Scalise in the attempted killing of Scalise by a shooter who was motivated by politics, and then there is the massive massacre in Las Vegas, apparently by a shooter who was mentally deranged in some form. The fact is, massive amounts of ammunition with high-caliber, rapid-fire assault weapons is making this easier for whatever the motivation of the shooter is. As a result, you get to the point of, how many more of these do we have before you say enough is enough?  That leads to the subject of politics. When does humanity overtake the divisiveness of our politics so we can come together and have a commonsense discussion about what should be done? Because if we don't, and humanity does not overtake our politics, we will continue, and it will be more of the same.

955,topic-id,1392,"Mr.President, I am the Senator from Florida, along with my colleague Marco We, of course, have been at the forefront of this terrible tragedy that is going on in Puerto Rico, and I want to comment on that.  By the way, speaking of bipartisanship, there is a good example. Senator Rubio and I, when our State was hit by Irma, spent 3 days, going around together, showing that we were shoulder to shoulder trying to help Floridians overcome the tragedy that had just befallen them. We dished out food together. We went and surveyed the floods. We went into the poor, little cities. We went and thanked university students who had rescued the elderly, the frail, when they were abandoned. We went all across the The day after the storm, we went first into the Keys to see the destruction there. Senator Rubio and I have been joined at the hip.  When it comes to looking at what is happening in Puerto Rico, it is pretty obvious. Last week, a week had passed since the storm. In fact, the supplies were stacking up, but they were stacking up in the ports. They were not able to get out into the interior of the island. The two of us were pretty strong in our words; that you have to get the most capable organization in to do that when in fact it is almost like combat conditions, and that is the U.military.  Finally, Wednesday night of last week, they sent me a three-star general who started to get it organized. Now we are seeing it distributed out, but it is going to take more because it is an island that is just absolutely devastated. It is going to take a long time to recover, and it is going to take a lot more money.  Remember, these are our fellow American citizens. We saw the devastation in Now the continuing hardship is being tolled in Puerto It is a population where half are without drinking water, only 5 percent--and this is 2 weeks after the storm--of the electricity grid is restored, and cash is in short supply.  Whereas, in Florida we saw the flooded streets, the downed trees, the crushed cars, the flipped over mobile homes, limited access to critical supplies like gasoline. Property damage was everywhere, and it was the entire What we are seeing is--multiply that many fold, and that is what we are seeing in Puerto  We are working on a supplemental funding bill. Remember that right after the first storm in Texas, we passed a $15 billion emergency supplemental appropriations bill. That is going to run out within the next few days so we have to have another supplemental funding bill.  As you can imagine, now it is not just Texas and Florida, but it is the Virgin Islands, it is Puerto Rico, and there are some other States as well. We are going to need to help the people cover the cost of recovery, and we are going to need to jump-start the local economy in those areas hardest hit by the storms.  Today I am going to introduce a piece of legislation. I call it the National Disaster Tax Relief Act, which would give people affected by these storms some much needed tax relief. This is in the shadow of the conversations taking place, as we speak, in a hearing--which I have just come from--in the Finance Committee about future reform of the Federal Tax  The bill I am introducing today would do four things: One, it would let businesses and farmers immediately write off their cleanup costs, not just their replacement costs.  For example, the Florida citrus growers in the central part of the State--and it was finally going to be a good news story on our citrus crop--half of the citrus buffeted by the wind is on the ground.  Go further south into Southwest Florida, 75 percent of the citrus is on the ground. What this would do is allow the citrus growers to be able to, in the first year, write off the costs--expenses, in other words--of removing the downed trees, not just the cost of a new tree. That is especially important to citrus growers all over the United States because they are already hurting from a plant disease, a bacteria known as greening, which kills the citrus tree in 5 years.  Therefore, there are a number of these groves that have been abandoned, but it is valuable land. We need to give an incentive to the citrus grower to be able to go in and plow under that citrus growth and replant--the immediate expensing of that plowing under, plus the replanting of what we think are hardier varieties of citrus that are more resistant to this disease, this bacteria called greening. We think that would be a huge incentive to try to save the citrus industry not only in my State but in Texas, Arizona, There is citrus also in Louisiana and some in other Southern  The second thing the bill does is it gives taxpayers the ability to exempt State and local disaster mitigation payments from Federal taxes, and it lets them save for the next big storm tax-free. That would be in a catastrophe savings account.  It would allow people to save tax-free $150,000 to cover things not covered by insurance. In Southwest Florida, there are a lot of seawalls that cave in, seawalls that are extremely expensive to rebuild and repair. This tax-free account would allow them to put away savings for that and other kinds of costs of remediation. They go out, and they try to save their home by getting tarps on the roof, making certain repairs until they can get the replacement, and the insurance can pay for it. Expensing of those items in the Tax Code would certainly be that incentive.  The bill also includes extra infrastructure financing for areas damaged by the storms; for example, help for low-income housing needs and other infrastructure needs that are so important to economic recovery.[[Page S6290]]  The fourth thing the bill does is it includes tax incentives for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and extends tax benefits that are available on the mainland but not in the territories like the full child tax credit.  Why should we treat our American citizens in a territory any differently taxwise on a child tax credit than we treat our citizens on the mainland, the main 50 States? It shouldn't be. It doesn't make sense.  What is happening in Puerto Rico should concern every Governor Rossello has warned of a humanitarian crisis if we do not quickly move to alleviate this situation.  The Coast Guard is working with FEMA and others to bring in drinking water and other critical supplies as well. Additional work is being done to restore power. Generators are being shipped in to help manage the load at the airport, and there are 30 flights per day now, which is projected to grow to 60 flights in the coming days. Meanwhile, as the evacuations continue, we don't want to leave Puerto Rico in tatters. We have to rebuild. That is going to be an expensive cost to pay.  As we are going into a supplemental package for all of these storm-affected areas, and since the utilities in Puerto Rico were so out-of-date and so arcane, let's think creatively. In remote villages, let's supply photovoltaic cells to generate electricity as a backup because another storm is going to come and the power lines are going to go down. Let's think creatively as we help these areas rebuild.  We are working on this supplemental package to get additional aid to those suffering, and I am hopeful that what I have suggested here as a tax incentive will be a part of that conversation. Our country is hurting. We should be doing everything we can to help it heal.  Now, not only are we healing from coming out of some ferocious storms, but now we have another grim reminder that, in America, we are not treating each other as we would want to be treated. Something is wrong in the psyche of some, so that whatever the motivation is, there would be mass execution. I hope we will soon have a very serious conversation about the direction of this country.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgS6289.txt,859,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
982,topic-id,433,"Mr.President, I would like to recognize the legacy of an extraordinary Floridian and friend who passed away this past weekend.  Alto ``Bud'' Adams, Jr., owner of Adams Ranch, died this weekend at age 91. Born in Fort Pierce, FL, in 1926, Bud was known in Florida and around the Nation for developing the Braford breed, a new breed of heavy-yielding cattle, crossed between the Herefords and the Brahmans, that was better able to handle the heat of south  For 75 years, Bud Adams tended the family-owned Adams Ranch, which has grown to 50,000 acres of land across Lucie, Madison, Okeechobee, and Osceola  The family's land is home to one of the largest cow-calf ranches in the country. This land was also one of the first sets of conservation easements to be added to the Today thousands of acres of Adams Ranch land have been placed into permanent land trust, including part of the Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge and Conservation  Adams Ranch was first purchased in 1937 for $1.50 an acre by Bud's father, Florida Supreme Court Judge Alto Adams,  Since then, Adams Ranch has received multiple environmental awards from Audubon Florida, the Farmers Conservation Alliance, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association for the owners' leadership in land, water, and wildlife management.  Bud was also honored with the Pete Hegener Leadership Award by the Economic Development Council of Lucie County, an honor presented every year to a dedicated business leader who makes a significant contribution to Lucie County's economy and quality of life.  Bud Adams was not just a cattleman and businessman; he was a devoted environmental conservationist and a philanthropist. Bud founded the United Way of Lucie County and supported causes like the A.Backus Museum & Gallery and Heathcote Botanical He also sat on the board of the Indian River State College  In Bud's own words, ``It is not enough for us to just do a good job breeding and caring for cattle. We must have a more holistic approach that keeps man, cattle, wildlife, and the land in a relationship that is profitable, productive and can be continued indefinitely.''  Bud showed us what it truly meant to be an environmental steward and a cowboy. He always took pride in his management of land, water, and wildlife, and Florida is better because of it.  I extend my deepest condolences to his family, particularly his wife, He is also survived by his sister Elaine Harrison; his children Alto Lee Adams, III, and his wife, Cindy, Michael Adams and his wife, Rachael, and Robert Adams and his wife, Cindee; his grandchildren; and great-grandchildren.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-02-pt1-PgS6259-2.txt,859,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,2,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And get this: ten times that, another 80 million acres, are considered high risk to threat of catastrophic wildfires.  If this doesn't amount to a national disaster, nothing does. If we don't acknowledge that it does, this will only continue to devastate our rural communities across the  The previous speaker, my friend from Oregon, talked about the impact of the health to people living in these communities. I could attest to you myself, living in central Washington, we had smoke where the visibility was less than a quarter of a mile for weeks at a time. I knew people who had chronic coughs as a result of this smoke. Myself, get this: I had to come back to our Nation's Capital for my cough to clear up over our August break. The air was that bad.  So, Mr.Speaker, this evening, as you have heard from my colleagues from across the Western United States, as we gather to draw attention to this devastation, these catastrophic wildfires, what they pose to our communities, so States from Arkansas to Arizona, from Colorado to California, Montana to New Mexico, from Wyoming, from Oregon, to the great State of Washington, we are here to stress the importance of addressing the broken funding systems as well as the lack of resources that are necessary to adequately prevent and then suppress and fight these wildfires.  So we gather to highlight the dire need to reform the mismanagement of our Federal forests, which leads to the exacerbation of this devastation. Mr.Speaker, we gather to give voice to our often forgotten communities and our constituents.  Now, you have heard these Special Orders before. We as Members of Congress take these good opportunities to simply speak about a problem and bring light to its actuality, to let people know about it, but tonight is different, because my colleagues and I are here not just to talk about this, not just to highlight the major problem of wildfires across the country, but, in fact, we bring good news as well. We offer solutions to this important issue.[[Page H7740]]  So this evening, I rise in support and urge support of two provisions originating right here in Congress, the people's House, to address these issues.  First of all, H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act, which is sponsored by my good friend from the State of Arkansas, Mr.Westerman, which addresses the disastrous consequences of catastrophic wildfires by utilizing tools the Forest Service and other agencies can use to reduce the threats that are posed by wildfires, by insects, by disease infestation, and dangerous old forest overgrowth that serve as a tinderbox for wildfires.  This legislation would enable the necessary management techniques to address our forest health crises and significantly improve the resiliency of our Nation's forests.  On top of that, H.167, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which is sponsored by my good friend and colleague from Idaho, Mr.Simpson, fixes the way that we budget for wildfire suppression by treating these catastrophic wildfires like any other natural disaster, which they are.  Currently, agencies like the Forest Service are forced to borrow funding from accounts outside of their firefighting in order to address these fire suppression costs. This has become known as fire borrowing. This tool was intended to be an extraordinary measure, but in the past 8 of the last 12 years, the Forest Service has had to move funds from other operating accounts to fight these fires.  Mr.Speaker, this problem is systemic, it is dire, and we must address it.                              {time}  1945  The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act is a necessary solution to solve the crisis.  Mr.Speaker, the fourth district of the State of Washington, which I am proud to call my home, has been devastated by wildfires in recent years, from the Carlton Complex Fire of 2014, which at the time was the largest in State history, to the Okanogan Complex Fire, which only the next year surpassed that record. In addition to that, we lost three firefighters in the process.  Our communities know what it means to live with the overwhelming consequences of continual disastrous wildfires year after year after year, and it doesn't have to be this way. We can solve this problem.  My colleagues and I gather tonight to shed light on this problem and to offer solutions and to let our constituents know that we will not give up in this effort.

630,topic-id,453,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this piece of legislation, which will, quite literally, save lives. I am so grateful that we are having this debate on the House floor at this point.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection I believe that every life, including an unborn baby's life, has dignity and value. But more than 40 years ago, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in direct contradiction to those principles.  In the decades since, I have joined with many families and my colleagues in the House and many across the Nation fighting to undo the damage that has been done. We have got a long way to go in this country, but the passage of H.36 would be a step in the right direction.  A strong and growing body of medical research provides evidence that pain receptors develop in unborn babies at no later than 20 weeks. Medical professionals have testified about seeing babies that age recoil from painful stimuli. Others have been able to measure increases in stress hormones when babies inside the womb are subjected to pain.  If fetal surgery is performed, that baby is given anesthesia in many cases to shield them from the pain of surgery. Yet our Nation's laws allow for these babies to endure the pain of a life-ending abortion. It is absolutely heartbreaking.  My husband and I knew that our lives had completely changed the minute that we heard our oldest daughter's heartbeat. I will never forget that moment. I hope that she knows how proud we are of the generous and compassionate person that she has grown up to become. She has grown up quickly, and I love to think back about those days when she was still a little girl and when she wasn't much taller than  We read a lot back then. We read books. We read the One of her favorite books was Seuss' book, ``Horton Hears a Who!'' which says: ``A person is a person no matter how small.'' Each time we read that line, I thought back to those first moments when I heard her muffled heartbeats and thought about Kassidy and thought about ``a person is a person no matter how small.''  I had that blessed moment three different times with my three different children, and I pray every day that each and every baby's heartbeat would be heard by parents who understand the gift that that life is from our God who loves them dearly.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defend the smallest among us this week and pass H.36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection I thank the gentleman for his leadership.

It has been often said that gracious living and good politics is all about gratitude. Paying something forward is how you show your gratitude.  Quite frankly, the simple truth about this Republican budget is that it rolls back a century of progress. It sets the stage for the dismantling of Social Security, which lifted more people out of poverty than anything, and for Speaker Ryan's plan to turn it over to Wall  It sets the stage for turning Medicare over to the insurance industry--Medicare that provided our elderly with insurance and life opportunities that heretofore had not existed.

473,topic-id,252,"Mr.Chair, I rise in support of the proposed budget resolution, which will provide the spending cuts that Washington needs and give a pathway to reconciliation for tax reform.  Our national debt sits at an astronomical $20 trillion and is projected to reach close to $30 trillion within 10 years. Washington's out-of-control spending hinders our economy, Mr.Chair, and by kicking the can down the road, it puts the financial burden on the backs of our children and of our grandchildren.  Not only is our debt unsustainable, but high levels of government debt needs substantial resources, and taxpayers' dollars must go to servicing our debt. Over the next decade, the cost to service our debt will rise 219 percent, meaning we will spend close to $800 billion by the year 2027 simply to pay the interest on our debt.  This budget reduces spending by $5.4 trillion over a 10-year window. It does not expand the size of Federal It does not encroach on State or local authority.  This is a conservative path forward and will help us accomplish what we came here to do: meaningful tax reform.

94,topic-id,394,"Mr.Chairman, Article I, section 9 of the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. This assigns to Congress the role of final arbiter of the use of public funds.  Despite this clear declaration of power, the Office of Management and Budget estimates that agencies collected over $513 billion in fines, fees, penalties, and other offsetting collections and receipts in fiscal year 2017. Allowing agencies to have slush funds outside of the normal appropriations process is a recipe for bad acting.  The RSC budget calls for implementing the Agency Accountability Act, which directs that all fines, fees, and settlements go to the Treasury, making them subject to the normal appropriations process. This would end the agencies' ability to operate independently and outside of the oversight of More importantly, it would allow Congress to fully account for how much money the government actually collects and where that money is coming from.  I am also pleased that the RSC budget does what is increasingly becoming an impossible task: it balances the budget, all while prioritizing defense spending to keep this country secure. This budget sets forth the bold ideas necessary to put the country back on a path of fiscal responsibility.  The Congressional Budget Office reports that if we stay on the current irresponsible fiscal path we are on, by 2047, in 30 years, our debt to GDP will be 150 percent. Stated more simply, our debt will be 50 percent greater than our entire gross domestic product.  We must put our Nation back on a path of fiscal responsibility, and the RSC budget does exactly that. As former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullin warned, our national debt is the greatest threat to our national security. By putting our Nation on a sensible fiscal path of balancing the budget, we reduce the extremely heavy burden that a bloated Federal Government places on America's working families, allowing them to prosper and making the government less intrusive in their lives.  I would also like to add extemporaneously in regard to what we are doing on SNAP benefits. What we are doing is imposing work requirements on able-bodied adults with no children. I want to repeat: able-bodied adults with no children. I think most Americans would agree that if they are getting payments from the Federal Government, they ought to at least do some work.

534,topic-id,432,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Progressive Caucus' budget.  In his farewell address, President Eisenhower said: ``We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.''  Instead of trying to put America on a sustainable financial path, the progressive budget seeks to mortgage even more of our grandchildren's and great grandchildren's future, frankly, by spending over $57 trillion over the next 10 years. With the national debt surpassing $20 trillion just last month, now is the time to rein in reckless government spending, not explode it.  In addition to these spending increases, the Progressive Caucus is proposing nearly $9 trillion in tax increases over the next decade. These enormous tax increases do not come close to covering the cost of the irresponsible policies proposed. I want to repeat that. Enormous tax increases that don't come close to covering the cost of what they have proposed.  As a result, the Progressive Caucus' budget raises the debt to over $27 trillion by 2027. In fact, by fiscal year 2027, our deficits would be near $1 trillion.  Higher taxes and higher spending would stifle the American economy and put our debt on an expedited upward trajectory. It is time for us to make tough decisions when it comes to this country's budget. The decision to oppose the Progressive Caucus budget is not one of those tough decisions.  This budget also makes no effort to curb waste, fraud, and abuse. Instead, it would expand bureaucratic programs by trillions of dollars without proposing any oversight measures. For example, it would spend $41 billion on ``free college'' promises, and $1 trillion on childcare and universal pre- Mr.Chairman, it reminds me of the shovel-ready programs that were part of the Obama package just a few years ago. We all had this expectation that this money would go to rebuild our infrastructure, and it turns out just a little over 3 percent of that money actually made it to infrastructure projects; somewhere in the range of $30 billion out of over $800 billion.  That is what I see in the progressive budget. It continues the failed ObamaCare experiment, and even goes so far as to allow States to experiment with socialized medicine.

To make matters worse, since 2013, the amount we have been incorrectly sending out has been trending upwards. Instead of reducing our fraudulent payments, the rate at which we pay them out has been increasing. Since 2003, there has been a total of $1.2 trillion in improper payments.

If one were to draw a chart from 2001 and 2003 to the present time, what contributes to the deficit and the debt?  I am glad to hear someone from the other side talk about that debt, because I thought you forgot all about it. This budget seems to think that you have amnesia.

492,topic-id,664,"Mr.Chairman, the budget that is being considered here today sets in motion the process of the first major tax reform that we will have been able to see in 3 decades. We are on the cusp of a really exciting opportunity to give Americans what they deserve: a Tax Code that works for them, not against them.  Now, on the House Ways and Means Committee, we spent many months meeting, holding hearings, discussing, working on almost a daily basis ways to craft a tax plan that is simpler and fairer for all The framework that was just rolled out last week takes that into account and lays out a plan that will lead to more jobs and, most importantly, bigger paychecks.  You know, the economic ``recovery'' since the Great Recession hasn't worked for a lot of It certainly hasn't worked for a lot of Minnesotans that I represent. Economic growth has been anemic, and we remain uncompetitive in far too many areas. Many are living paycheck to paycheck, and either have or now are at risk of having a lower standard of living than their parents.  Young people, like my daughter's generation, will go backwards if this country is not fundamentally more competitive economically. They feel like they just can't get ahead.  Meanwhile, seniors, and baby boomers who will soon become seniors, are also at great risk. Their savings, as well as the government's ability to fulfill its commitment to Social Security and Medicare, could be undermined if we don't grow our economy at a higher rate.  So both Republicans and Democrats agree that it is time to fix our broken Tax No one is defending the status quo, Mr.Our current Tax Code punishes American workers and manufacturers. It is a maze of special-interest loopholes that are unfair to hardworking It burdens families and small businesses with excessive paperwork and compliance costs, creating unnecessary frustration each and every tax season throughout the year. That is why 9 out of 10 Americans either pay someone to do their taxes or have to buy the financial software to do their taxes.  Mr.Chair, our Tax Code is holding our country back. It is holding our economy back. So we have a stark choice. We can either truly grow the economy and put ourselves back on a path to real prosperity, or we can continue with weak economic growth, which only benefits ``the few'' and will do nothing for the rest of us when the next economic downturn happens.  Tax reform, for me, is about one thing and one thing only. It is about restoring the hope for a prosperous future for ourselves, for our parents, and, most importantly, for our children.  It is about Paula in my district, in Plymouth, Minnesota, who said that the Tax Code is hurting her small business and preventing her from hiring more employees and giving them a raise.  It is about an owner of an extrusion company in Chaska, Minnesota, that I just spoke to. He said he would invest in new equipment and machines if this tax plan passes.  And it is about lowering rates across the board for all Americans, as well as small businesses, so that they can keep more of their first dollars earned.  Tax reform means increasing the personal income for average Americans and reducing the cost of living so that day-to-day expenses are more affordable. This will lead to families being able to save for their future and their retirement. It will allow people to take more control of their lives and their finances so that they can save and spend and invest their hard-earned money as they see fit.  Mr.Chairman, this is a really important opportunity we cannot let slip away to help middle-income families and small businesses. Passing this budget puts us on a path for tax reform that has so much potential to unleash and grow our economy to the benefit of middle-income families in Minnesota and across the country.                              {time}  1645  ",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgH7777-2.txt,1930,"HONORING HELEN SMITH, POW ADVOCATE, ON HER 91ST BIRTHDAY",2017,4,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On behalf of Chairman Hensarling, I would like to take a moment to speak about the instructions given by the chairwoman of the Budget Committee to the Financial Services Committee to find savings of $14 billion.  Now, that is what we were sent here to do: to find those places where it makes sense to cut the budget and we don't harm anything. In fact, in this case, the Financial Services Committee is going to help things in rural communities by finding those savings that the chairwoman instructed us to find.  Several years ago, the Democratic majority passed the Dodd-Frank resolution, the Dodd-Frank That enshrined too big to fail. It created unaccountable agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection  Earlier this year, this body passed H.10, the Financial CHOICE That was trying to prune back the capabilities of CFPB to hurt the rural areas, which it had been doing in my district.  Carlsbad National Bank recently shared with us how it takes them 185 pages to complete a mortgage loan, 185 pages for a small bank for just the simple resolution of buying a home.  Many times our community banks are simply stopping to offer that service. No one else is willing to come in to New Mexico and lend into these rural communities. So we are facing a very serious problem.  Sometimes community banks are having to consolidate. That hurts rural communities even worse, because the consolidation usually moves the bank's headquarters outside the State or outside the community. It weakens the fabric of the community.  So by finding the savings in this budget resolution which we were instructed to do, we not only save the money, but we also stop the encroaching regulations that CFPB is putting out, harming the rural communities, harming rural homeowners.

1269,topic-id,934,"Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his great leadership as the ranking member on the Budget Committee in the House, and I thank all of the members of the Budget Committee for their great work to make the budget that was proposed earlier, the Yarmuth budget, a statement of our values. That is exactly what a budget should be.  A Federal budget should be a statement of our national values, and what is important to us as a country should be reflected in the priorities that we place into that budget. The budget before us, proposed by the Republicans, is just the opposite of that. It is accompanied by a tax proposal that they put in, one of the biggest transfers of wealth to the wealthiest people in our country in our country's history. Every time they do it, they make it worse.  I let you be the judge: Is a statement of our national values to cut a trillion dollars from Medicaid, cap and take Medicaid down a bad path, in order to give tax cuts to the richest people in our country?  Is it a statement of our values to take a half trillion dollars out of Medicare to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country?  Our distinguished ranking member has listed some of the things that would be cut if we went down this unfortunate path posed by our colleagues on the other side.  This is a budget that steals from the middle class. It steals hundreds of billions of dollars from critical job-creating, wage-increasing investments, infrastructure, job training, and clean energy. It harms veterans, it cuts education, it abandons rural America, and it guts education.  This is really a mystery to me. When you cut education, with the stiff competition we have, this is one of the worst budget decisions that you have made. Nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investing in education: early childhood, K-12, higher education, postgraduate, and lifetime learning for our workers.  That is how you grow the economy. That is how you bring money to the Treasury, and not by cutting it in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country.  Is it a statement of values to cut education so that you have a tax cut that benefits 80 percent?  I know you don't want the public to hear this, and I can understand why. How could it be a statement of the values of the American people to cut the education of our children in order to have a tax cut where 80 percent of it benefits the top 1 percent of people in our country? It is just not right.  As they do that, the deficit hawks, who seem to be an endangered species on the Republican side of the aisle these days, are adding close to $2.4 trillion to the deficit, not counting debt service or interest on that national debt. Then they say: Oh, that is okay; we need to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars so that we can give tax cuts.  Where do the tax cuts go? $2.6 trillion goes to corporate  Guess what happens to the middle class. There are $470 billion in tax increases to the middle class, about a half trillion dollars in increases to the middle class, $2.5 trillion in tax cuts for corporate Again, it is adding so much to the deficit.  Now they say: Oh, trickle-down economics is going to pay its own way. We will get that money back.  Not so. It never happens. But don't take it from me. No less a figure than Bruce Bartlett, who worked for Congressman Jack Kemp, a real supporter of supply-side economics--and, as was said, supply-side turn into trickle-down, et cetera. As a proponent of supply-side economics, he said: We never said it would pay for itself. We just advocate it as an economic approach.  But anyone who says, and this is from him, that the whole supply-side dynamic scoring pays for itself--part of this argument--is all nonsense. It is not true. He went on to say that it was bull--you finish the sentence.  So, here we are at a place where we can increase the deficit, decrease job creation, hurt the middle class, benefit the top 1 percent, and add to the national debt in historic proportions that will be very hard to collect from deficit hawks--if any of you exist over there.  Instead, we have an opportunity today for a better deal for the American people--better jobs, better pay, better wages, and a better future--where we lower costs for America's working families and middle class families, and where we prepare them with the tools for the economy of the 21st century.[[Page H7881]]  I thank the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky, the chair of the Bourbon Caucus, for his great leadership in bringing a better budget that is a statement of our national values, that supports American workers with responsible tax reform, calls for parity between defense and nondefense, and strengthens the ACA and protects  Every time the Republicans come to the floor and try to stack the deck even further for their wealthy friends, we have to have this conversation.

315,topic-id,183,"Mr.Speaker, our tax system is broken and in desperate need of reform. We need a simpler Tax Code that is fiscally responsible, makes American businesses more competitive, and allows working families to prosper in a 21st century economy.  But the Ryan-McConnell tax proposal would do the opposite and fails on the promises made by President Trump to boost the middle class. Middle class families would see an average tax increase of $1,290 per year. That is a 380 percent increase for an average family of four.  A new analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said that the Ryan-McConnell proposal would add $5.6 trillion to the national debt, a 27 percent increase from the current debt which is already too high.  Under this proposal, the increased deficits will far outweigh the benefits[[Page H7846]]of reductions, and economic growth and hardworking Americans will both suffer.  Instead, we need forward-looking policies that are fiscally responsible and create opportunities for families and businesses in today's economy.

611,topic-id,748,"Madam President, in many ways, the Children's Health Insurance Program has been an outstanding example of what a bipartisan, democratic process can accomplish. Twenty years ago, President Bill Clinton worked with a Republican majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives to successfully pass the Children's Health Insurance Program into law. That legislation passed with 85 votes in the Senate--an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote--to recognize the simple fact that all children born in this great country of ours should have healthcare coverage.  The Children's Health Insurance Program, along with our Nation's community health centers, has more often than not seen great bipartisan support. As Members of Congress, we have always come together and understood the importance of these programs, and we have done everything we can to ensure that quality, cost-effective care is available to millions of Unfortunately, as I stand here today, funding for both the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers has expired.  The Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, provides healthcare coverage to over 100,000 children in my home State of Michigan and more than 9 million children nationally. In addition, community health centers serve as the primary medical home to over 600,000 Michiganders and more than 20 million individuals across our country. For people living in rural and underserved areas, their community health center is their doctor's office and often their only choice when it comes to care close to home.  We have already passed the deadline to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Community Health Center We have passed the time to act. We should not wait any longer to provide certainty to the millions of children and their families who depend on CHIP and to the Americans who will lose access to care if their community health center is closed.  We are already seeing the impact of our inaction in the CHIP program. Several States have begun to warn that they may be forced to end enrollment of new children, cut back services, or end their programs altogether if we do not act soon. Independent experts estimate that at least 10 States could completely run out of funding for their Children's Health Insurance Program before the end of the year, while funding for the remaining States' programs would not be very far behind.  This is not a responsible way to govern. I have heard from physicians in my State, especially in rural communities, who fear that this lack of action will mean great harm to the patients they serve. I have heard from pediatricians who know firsthand what the end of CHIP would mean for Michigan's children. As our country grapples with what we can do to expand mental health treatment and address the expanding opioid epidemic, letting these programs lapse would be a huge step in the wrong direction. This unnecessary uncertainty has already forced some community health centers to contemplate staff hiring freezes and layoffs. It is certainly harming their day-to-day operations. It has made it difficult for them to recruit new doctors, and it has made it harder for their offices to obtain loans to grow their practices and to serve more patients.  Luckily, this is a problem we know how to solve. I am proud to have cosponsored bipartisan legislation with Senators Hatch and Wyden that would ensure funding for the Children's Health Insurance I also support similarly bipartisan legislation by Senators Blunt and Stabenow to extend funding for our Nation's community health centers.  I welcome the fact that the Senate Finance Committee held a markup yesterday and was able to advance the bipartisan bill to fund the Children's Health Insurance Now the rest of us in Congress need to do our job. Let's bring both of these bills up for a vote because, quite frankly, we cannot afford to wait any longer. Our Nation's children and millions of Americans who use community health centers as their primary medical home cannot afford to wait any longer. Historically, these programs have not been controversial to reauthorize, and they should not be now.  I am urging my colleagues to prioritize the children of our rural and underserved communities who will be hurt if we do not act soon. Let's do what is right for our country's children and families and pass this vital legislation as soon as possible.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Although the full extent of the two hurricanes' impact has yet to be assessed, it is clear that the damage from these storms is unparalleled.

809,topic-id,4865,"I know that that is why I am here because I need to be their voice, because they are voiceless right now. If you look on national media, you hear about what is happening in Puerto Rico, and, Lord knows, I feel for our fellow islanders, our brothers and sisters over there, but very rarely do you hear about what is happening in the Virgin  On September 6, Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms this century, destroyed the islands of John and Thomas, the islands that are part of the district that I represent. Three weeks later, the island of Croix was devastated by Maria, a second Category 5 hurricane ripping through the U.Virgin Islands in less than a month. Both Hurricanes Irma and Maria have wreaked havoc in the U.territories of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean nations.  We forget that there are other places in the Caribbean that have also been struck, Martin and Sint Maarten, Barbuda, Anguilla, our very close neighbors, the British Virgin Islands, Tortola, Anegada, Virgin Gorda, Jost Van Dyke, places that Americans love to go to, to vacation, to enjoy themselves, not thinking about the lives of the people that are there or not there anymore.  We know that right now the island of Barbuda is without an inhabitant, without an inhabitant in centuries. There is no one on Barbuda after the hurricane.  Turks and Caicos, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, one that also strikes me is Dominica was not hit by the first Hurricane Irma, and that little island nation reached out to the U.Virgin Islands, reached out to Puerto Rico and said: We don't have much, but we are going to give you the money that we have. We, as a government, will give you 200,000. We will bring relief. We will bring whatever we can.  And 2 weeks later, Hurricane Maria struck them and has devastated that island.  Their Prime Minister went to the United Nations a week ago and begged, begged the support of the free world, begged the support of the members of the United Nations to support them.  Although the full extent of the two hurricanes' impact has yet to be assessed, it is clear that, in the Caribbean, the damage from these storms appears to be unparalleled.  President Trump issued major disaster declaration for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries have been reported alongside widespread infrastructure damage all throughout the  I received a text just this morning from members of my family who are still looking for loved ones on the island of That is why, in the days and months ahead, we must continue to work together to ensure that the individuals and families impacted by these devastating storms receive all the aid they need. The catastrophic destruction caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria demands massive amounts of aid to address the overwhelming needs of the countless victims who now face the daunting task of rebuilding their lives.  FEMA has been on the ground in the Virgin Islands even before Irma hit the islands of John and There are now more than 12,600 Federal staff engaged in response and recovery operations from Hurricanes Maria and Irma in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, representing nearly three dozen departments and agencies.  Storms of this magnitude require the full attention and support of the entire The people of the Virgin Islands have lost their homes and possessions. Businesses have been lost alongside hospitals, schools, utility systems, and other vital infrastructure.  To give you an example, after Irma, Roy Schneider Medical Center, the only hospital on the island of Thomas, was partially destroyed, its roof ripped off, its walls caved in, windows blown out. Patients needed to be evacuated to the island of Croix and to San Juan to be at Juan Luis Hospital on Croix and additional hospitals on San Juan, as well as the veterans facility there.  Of course, people were thinking that Croix, after Irma, would be the base. As people on Thomas and John were reeling from the devastation of Irma, post offices were gone, schools annihilated, mud slides began after additional rains, people in Coral Bay on John felt lost, isolated, trapped. Many people had days, almost weeks before they could get out and be in the rest of the public population.  When Maria came, Maria struck what we thought would be our base camp, the island of Croix, and as luck would have it, the only functional hospital left in the Virgin Islands, the hospital of Juan Luis was breached by Hurricane Maria and has now been condemned by the Army Corps of  What facility will Virgin Islanders use? Will we continue to be in tents manned by the brave men and women of our military who have come down to support us? Will we operate from an operating room, an emergency room in a box, what they have given us thus far?  That can't be. We have one functioning operating room that is being held together by the good graces and MacGyvering of the men and women of Juan Luis Hospital right now. Should that be for American citizens?  I went on distribution lines. I went to grocery stores where people were waiting for hours. I am telling you hours--3 hours to get gas; 3, 4 hours, the entire time of a curfew, to go on a distribution line to get a couple of packs of[[Page H7662]]water and some MREs for a family, standing out in the hot Caribbean sun. People were sharing umbrellas, sharing water, singing with each other trying to keep their spirits up.  I met a man who had his veteran's cap on, Vietnam vet, people who are members of The American Legion and asking me: ``I fought for this country; I am an American citizen; do they think about us? I have not seen us on the news. My family tells me that we are not on the news,'' because, of course, his TV is not working, because almost all of the Virgin Islands is in darkness.                              {time}  2045  We have been able, through the valiant effort of our water and power authority and the linemen and others who are out there, to bring power to critical structures; to our government house; to the main blocks in Christiansted; to parts of Charlotte Amalie, the capital of the Virgin Islands; to the airport so that relief planes can come in and out. That is who is in light right now.  But for so many others and children right now, it is darkness for them. The couple of hours that they have outside of the curfew are to be making the rounds to get ice, to keep insulin refrigerated in their homes, to keep milk for children and formula for babies cold before it goes bad. That is the daily struggle now of Virgin Islanders, American citizens, veterans, people who pledge their allegiance to this flag, people who are proud to say that they are American citizens.  As we saw on the mainland in the United States following Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and, most recently, Harvey, Americans need to come together again with compassion and care. I have heard commitment from the President and my colleagues in Congress to the U.territories receiving the support they need.  Moving forward, I am hopeful, but vigilant, and I will make sure that they keep to their promise and their commitment that President Trump and this Congress delivers on the promises to support their fellow Americans in the Caribbean region. This is a plea by me on behalf of my people to keep us in your thoughts, prayers, and support in the coming months and years. May our collective attention span endure enough through the constant new cycle so that we can come together to move beyond relief to healing and prosperity.  This is an opportunity. I keep trying to tell our young people on the islands who are in despair, who have low morale, that this is an opportunity for us to leapfrog technology, to create the kind of Virgin Islands, for the Virgin Islands to be the beacon in the Caribbean region, the beacon of what American might can do when it does what it is supposed to do.  It is this Congress' constitutional responsibility to the territories. The benign neglect that this Congress has gotten away with for the last 100 years needs to stop right now. They need to stop wagging their finger and telling Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands that they have not done what they are supposed to do when this Congress knows that they are not doing the right thing by those territories. Our formulas are different. The money that we receive is different. We get the short shrift on every bill that comes on this floor. Yet, still, you expect us to stretch that out like the poor stepchild that you think we are to make do and keep quiet.  But it is going to stop right now. We cannot be quiet anymore, because not only are we hungry, 30 percent of the children of the Virgin Islands live in poverty, but now we are blind as well. There is no cell reception in most of the areas of the Virgin While I was down there last week, my staff and I roamed the islands with our cell phones, sitting in bypasses, sitting in areas with others, trying to get a signal to plead with the National Security Council, plead with FEMA, and others to do the right thing by the Virgin  Given the enormity of the challenges ahead, the Virgin Islands will require the coordinated and sustained financial commitment of the United For this reason, I ask that Members of Congress fully support inclusion of funding in forthcoming disaster supplemental packages that will aid in short-term as well as long-term relief, recovery, and reconstruction of the Virgin The international community, including the United States, has an obligation to work with affected governments to restore infrastructure, provide critical relief, and help recovery and build back our islands. We must act quickly to save lives, ensure that those in the Virgin Islands are back on the road to swift recovery.  Listen, I know we are hearing that FEMA is on the ground, that supplies are there, and that things are moving along. I must admit, FEMA is on the ground. I see the supplies in the cartons, in the containers on our ports, and I hear the discussions at daily briefings that go on at our local emergency management system to how they are working hand in hand with I believe that the Army Corps and the Department of Defense and FEMA are there and they want to lend a hand.  But something is not working, whether it is in the local government, a dysfunction there, or dysfunction in communications, or dysfunction at the highest levels of the Federal Because when I go to neighborhoods like Whim, when I go to Tutu High Rise, when I go to Coral Bay, when I go to Hannah's Rest, when I go to Frederiksted and talk with people and they tell me they haven't had water in a week, something is wrong, and something needs to be done by this Congress that has the responsibility for the Virgin  How can a child in the United States say that they don't have water? How can a child in the United States say that water is streaming over them because many of the roofs in many of these areas are completely gone?  So what I wanted to do was to walk the Members of Congress and you, Mr.Speaker, through the destruction that I have seen with my eyes in the Virgin  What you see right here is a home. This is a private homeowner's home completely gone. It looks like a construction site. It looks as if they are trying to start building when, in fact, this was someone's home before.  Additionally, this is another home that now looks like a construction site that people are living in. People can no longer be here. They have abandoned--they have had to leave this home.  I have additional things that I would like to show you.  This is a line right now of people to fill up some containers with gas so that they can keep generators going for a couple of hours a day so that their children can read, so that they can wash themselves, so they can find out what is going on in the outside world. People can listen to a radio to find out what is not being said about them by others.  Here is another home in the Virgin This is the kind of destruction that took place on the islands that I represent, the islands that are my home. This is all of Our transportation system between the islands has been completely obliterated. This is a ferry that was used between Thomas and John to bring goods, to bring people between those islands. The islands of John, Cruz Bay, Chocolate Hole, and Coral Bay now feel cut off, left out, because the ferry system has been down for many weeks.  Look at this. This is what is happening in the Virgin Islands right now. This is the main street in If you look over here, this is the government house, and this is what our roads look like after the hurricane. You can see that this roof is actually a part of the roof over here that has completely been sheared off by Hurricane Maria and strewn across the street. Lines are down and poles are down.  This is a commercial business on the island of Croix, a business that will take months, if not a year, at least, to recover if FEMA moves quickly on supporting a small business loan so that they can have the support that they need to be able to do that.  These are the things that you don't see on the news that the people of the Virgin Islands are dealing with right now. What is our greatest asset--and has been for some years after our oil refinery was closed, after this Congress in 2004 changed the rules for the American JOBS Act that took away many of our knowledge-based businesses, our financial services sector--is we have had to rely on tourism.  And this is a hotel room in one of our major hotels. This is what the destruction of the hurricanes look like in the[[Page H7663]]Virgin Islands right now. This is a hotel room that will not be available for the coming months for the people of the Virgin Islands to be able to sustain themselves with employment.  What I am showing you now was, at one point, two homes, two homeowners' families. You can see the two houses look literally as if a hurricane just came across them and smashed them with a fist from the top. You can barely make out what was once in these homes. These homes no longer exist. These people have no homes.  There is no temporary shelter designation right now. People are living in shelters in some of the few schools that are still intact, which means: Where are our children going to go to school?  Many of our schools have also been destroyed. What will happen to the children of the Virgin Islands? What will happen to us all?  Here is what some of the roads look like when we talk about the utility system and the need--or why we are in the dark in the Virgin Islands right now.  This is a major road. Can you imagine having this next to your house? Can you imagine this amount of transponders, transformers, in front of your home?  This is why most of the Virgin Islands are in the dark right now. This is what is happening on these islands.  This is someone's home. This is our industry. This is tourism right now in the Virgin This is a hotel room in one of our major resorts. Places known over the world--Caneel Bay on John--are gone, are obliterated, will be no more for 2 or 3 years.  What are the people of the Virgin Islands supposed to do? Are we asking for much?  We are asking for support. We fight in your wars. We begged when we became part of the United States to be part of the draft because we want to take on the responsibility of American citizenship. But under the Constitution, it is this Congress, Mr.Speaker, which has responsibility for the territories: Puerto Rico, the U.Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern And I have to tell you that it has been a poor job that you have been doing of that responsibility thus far.  We get the short shrift in Federal funding in formulas. Let's not talk about the Affordable Care We don't even have an exchange to have been upset that we lost an exchange. That was never given to us. The Virgin Islands, with 30 percent of the children living in poverty, still don't get the disproportionate share for hospitals that the rest of the United States get.  Why?  I can't get a straight answer about why we shouldn't have it, but we don't. Neither do the smaller island territories.  This is what we are left with. And we are asking you for your support. I am asking you for their support. I am begging for support for the people that I represent, because many Virgin Islanders are not going to beg you for support. That is not in them, that is not who they are. The biggest phrase that people have right now when I go around the islands after Irma and after Maria--both Category 5 when they struck the U.Virgin Islands--and I ask people, ``How did you make out?''--that is now our new greeting for one another: ``So good to see you. How did you make out?'' And people's response is continually: ``Thank God I have life. I am blessed I have life.''  And when you have to press them to ask them, ``What happened to your home,'' then they will just shake their head, ``It is no more. My home is no more. But thank God I have life. I am good. We are good.''  That is the kind of people who are the people of the Virgin So they are not going to beg this Congress for support. I am going to beg for them, because you haven't been doing it out of your own volition or what you know is right to do. You haven't done it thus far. What is happening in Puerto Rico is happening in the Virgin Islands right now.  As the sole representative here in Congress representing the Virgin Islands, I will continue the work that I have been doing in support of the islands' overall recovery efforts, including facilitating generators and security for local grocery stores, businesses so Virgin Islanders can get fresh food and goods, working with local shipping companies to clear the ports and bring commerce and relief packages to the islands, coordinating with housing support for the Red Cross and local shelters, as well as rebuilding efforts of the U.Army Corps of  Additionally, I will continue to update my residents and businesses around the ongoing efforts to make sure that the U.Virgin Islands continue to receive the attention and support they need during these difficult times.                              {time}  2100  While the devastation of this hurricane season has been felt in many parts of our country, it is imperative that we make sure our Virgin Islands continue to be remembered and supported as we begin the long and arduous process of our recovery. We are hopeful. Virgin Islands' motto is ``United in Pride and Hope.'' That is who we are.  I want to thank the Virgin Islanders who are living in the mainland because they, through their efforts, have bridged the gap. Our office gets calls continually from Virgin Islands associations in places like Houston, Atlanta, New York, Tampa, Orlando, Miami, good Virgin Islanders like Tim Duncan, who, through his own efforts, brought planeloads of support to the people of the Virgin Islands because we want to take care ourselves. We don't want to ask for your support. But it is your responsibility, Mr.Speaker, it is the responsibility of this Congress to ensure that that is done.  I think back on, as a child, hearing stories about Casper Many of you may not know the name, but many of you may know him from gangster movies, discussions about New York at the turn of the 20th century. He was a Virgin Islander who created something that everybody calls the numbers system in New  After a hurricane and a tsunami in the Virgin Islands, he, of his own pocket, reached in, commissioned a ship, and sent that ship filled with goods for his fellow Virgin Islanders back home.  That is what is happening now because we can't always count on the Federal Government to do what is right by us. We have to count on ourselves. But I am going to make sure, and I will fight continually with those colleagues on either side of the aisle, whomever is willing to, to support the people of the Virgin Islands, to ensure that their efforts are not in vain.  Let me give you a statistic when I talk about veterans and us willing to fight. In the last five conflicts, Virgin Islanders have paid the ultimate price, have greater casualties, three times the national average per capita. We send our sons and daughters on the regular to fight our wars. That is not a duty that we shirk from.  Are you shirking from your duty to us, of your responsibility to us?  I understand, as I have said, FEMA is on the ground, but there are children who are not getting water. There are old people who are eating MREs that others have brought back to them. Is that what should be happening?  Not everybody can get to a distribution center. Not everybody can carry packs of water on their shoulders, on their heads, on their back a mile, whatever it is, to get back to their home because, as crazy as it sounds in this day and age, not everybody owns a car, not everybody can do that. So this Congress has got to figure out a way.  I know that Ranking Member Cummings and I issued a request on September 29 for my good friend--and he is my friend, Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee--to express our extremely grave concerns about the dire status of recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, requesting that the committee hold an emergency hearing this week with officials from the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, as well as from the White  The committee this week, I know, has no hearings, no business meeting, no activity scheduled for the entire week, and this issue is in desperate need of rapid and robust oversight. Millions of American citizens residing in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands are facing massive calamities, widespread disease and death, and we need to help them now.  Lieutenant General Russel Honore, who commanded Joint Task Force[[Page H7664]]Katrina, recently warned the administration's response to this humanitarian crisis is replaying a scene from Admiral Paul Zukunft, the Coast Guard Commandant, warned this week that the victims feel betrayed, they feel isolated, and they are probably getting a sense of betrayal of ``where is the cavalry?'' Everybody else is seeing what other individuals in Puerto Rico have said and their concern for what is happening.  Now, I want my colleagues to know, I am not necessarily saying that it is the Federal Government's fault. If it is the fault of local government, then shame on them and let's expose that for what it is, because all I am concerned about is the welfare of the people of the Virgin Islands, not protecting local government, not protecting bureaucracy, whether it be at the Federal level or at the local level.  Let's have this hearing. Let's get that information out.  The fact that there is no functioning hospital in the Virgin Islands should scare the heck out of us. I was in the hospital at Juan Luis on Wednesday and watched doctors and others creating lists of people, how to get them off the island, how to get our disproportionate amount of dialysis patients off the island, how they were going to deal with those who have shunts, heart disease patients in the coming weeks with one makeshift operating room that they were working out of.  How were they going to do that? How were they going to operate out of a tent that the Army was setting up when we still have a month and a half of hurricane season in the Virgin Islands, in the Caribbean? We are not going to be able to continually ship people off the island, fix them up, triage them, and get them off.  Our labor and delivery: What if there is a child with special needs when they are born? What about neonatal services, if that is needed, for a child that is born during this time? God help us. And if you don't act, God help you in this time of need of your fellow  I want to thank those Members who have reached out to me and who have expressed their desire to support and help us. Thank you. I am calling on you now for that help to make sure that the people of the Virgin Islands do not continually feel forgotten.  I want to thank House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who recently issued a statement calling for the swift and immediate financial commitment to help rebuild the Virgin  I want to thank my Republican colleague, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto She and I have been continually texting. I remember texting with her through Maria as she and her brother were holding the door of their home in Puerto Rico, trying to ensure that Maria did not get in that house. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your sisterhood as we both go through this, and how ever you need me, I am there for you.  Republicans must join Democrats; Democrats must join Republicans in Congress to address the needs of the communities in crisis by swiftly passing a robust relief package that provides assistance not only today, but throughout the long road to recovery. This is our chance in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to show American might, to show American technology, to show American strength.  President Trump, you have complained about the other islands not wanting to support us when we go to the United Nations or the Organization of American States against places like Venezuela or Cuba or Show that they can vote with us because Americans do what they are supposed to do for the islands that they have responsibility over.  How are they going to trust us if we can't even take care of what belongs to us?  Our fellow Americans in the Virgin Islands deserve to know that their government will be there for them without question or hesitation.  I want to thank the country of Denmark, our previous owner. Many of you know that the Virgin Islands have had seven flags that have been flown over those islands. We are a very valuable place. We are geographically situated in the mouth of the Caribbean Basin to support the United That was why we were purchased in 1970.  But we have maintained close ties with Denmark, and I want to thank the Ambassador and the Prime Minister, who reached out and said that they wanted to support the territory and submitted the request of the Danish Government to our own U.Government to bring their own additional emergency management agency to the Virgin Islands in support of ongoing efforts in areas such as healthcare, water purification systems, and experts, command control support, logistics for clearing, and security support. Thank you for your continued commitment to us.  Let that not be the only commitment that we have. I know that the Federal Government, the executive branch, is doing its part. Let this Congress do its part. Let this Congress show, in this time of crisis, that it can rise above partisanship and support the islands of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin  Let those 3.6 million Americans living in those territories--more than many States in this country--know that they have the full support of this Congress, of the American people, that they are not just a sound bite, that they are not just a rum and Coke and a pina colada when you decide that you want to get away from where you live, that we mean more than that to you, that we are, indeed, full citizens in this American experience, in this democracy.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

530,topic-id,595,"Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona, also, for his leadership within the caucus.  I am proud to rise in support of the Congressional Progressive Caucus' budget alternative. This is a practical, progressive vision for our country by providing solutions to counter the Republican cuts to vital programs and tax breaks for the wealthy.  Let me contrast the House GOP budget with the Progressive Caucus budget.  First, in healthcare, the Republican budget embraces TrumpCare by incorporating the House-passed American Health Care Act, which cuts at least 20 million people from their care. This includes up to $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, threatening care for seniors in nursing homes, children, and struggling families. It makes $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, ending the Medicare guarantee and shifting cost risk on to seniors.  The Congressional Progressive Caucus budget defends and strengthens the Affordable Care It lowers prescription drug costs and expands access to mental healthcare and addiction treatment.  We invest in workers. The GOP plan slashes investments in workers and programs to help more Americans get back to work, programs like apprenticeships and job training. And yet the people's budget would create 2.4 million jobs over its first 3 years and raise wages for American workers.  The Republican budget, their $5.4 trillion in spending cuts means less funding for roads and bridges and schools. Our budget puts a $2 trillion investment into strengthening our Nation's infrastructure.  The Republican budget drastically cuts Federal funding, which could undermine our ability to respond to disasters. The people's budget provides $200 billion in emergency disaster funds to rebuild communities devastated by hurricanes.  The Republican budget guts our public education system with cuts that could devastate schools and further disinvest in public universities. The Progressive Caucus budget makes debt-free college a reality and provides for the refinancing of student loans. It expands access to pre-K education and provides childcare for all families.  Let's get real. The reason we are debating the budget this week: Republicans can't wait to get started on their tax breaks for the wealthy. The Republican tax plan should be called the Trump Family Tax Plan because it enriches the wealthy on the backs of the middle class.  The Progressive Caucus gets it right. Not one more penny in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest The Progressive Caucus budget ensures that the top 1 percent pay their fair share in taxes, we close corporate loopholes, and we expand the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit for working families.  We must reject the Trump Family tax cut and invest in our roads and bridges, our schools, our healthcare, and our workers. Progressives are proposing bold policy solutions as clear alternatives to the cruel budget cuts Republicans are proposing.  The people's budget is an investment in the American people, and I urge you to support the Progressive Caucus people's budget.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, my friend reminds me of a story when Ronald Reagan was pushing his tax reductions a generation ago that produced the biggest expansion in our Nation's history. He was approached one day by a working class fellow on a stop that the President was making, and the man looks at him and says: Mr.President, the Democrats say that you Republicans want to cut taxes on the rich. Is that right?  Reagan says: Well, that is what they say.  And the man says: Well, you go ahead and do that, Mr.President, because a poor person never gave me a job.

843,topic-id,195,"Mr.Speaker, 4 years ago, 26 small children and teachers were massacred at Sandy Hook Elementary, and Congress lacked the courage to act. Two years ago, the Emanuel 9 were murdered by a White supremacist, and Congress did nothing. Last year, in a hate crime against the LGBT community, 49 people were killed in the Pulse nightclub terrorist attack, and Congress did nothing.  This week, at least 59 people have been killed and over 500 injured in the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Will Congress yet again lack the courage to act?  Will we prioritize thoughts and prayers at the expense of substantive action that saves lives? Will we hide behind the ``it's too early to talk about gun violence'' excuse? If so, when is the right time? A week from now? a month? a year? or perhaps after the next mass shooting?  For the over 1,500 mass shooting victims since Sandy Hook, the right time to talk about gun violence has tragically come and gone, but we can and must turn the page today.

1194,topic-id,323,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise for my constituent, Allie, because we should not be playing politics in Congress with women's health choices and with the family decisionmaking rights of all  Last spring, Allie and her husband were thrilled to learn that she was pregnant with their second child. A few months later, they found themselves heartbroken in a doctor's office in order to terminate a pregnancy that they had so badly wanted.  Everything had gone smoothly until about 12 weeks, when a routine test returned with extremely abnormal results. Allie and her husband hoped for the best and waited several more weeks until they could perform an amnio.  Sadly, the results of the amnio were unbearable. They found that the fetus had grown from a compromised cell line. There were multiple genetic anomalies that would result if the pregnancy continued to term in a child with extraordinarily grave and untreatable physical, cognitive, and developmental problems.  The news was crushing and the decision was agonizing, but Allie knew the path forward for her family was clear. She would become part of the tiny group of women having abortions after 20 weeks, less than 2 percent of all abortions.  But Allie's story doesn't end with the decision that she and her husband made. Because she is a Federal employee, the Hyde amendment prevented her insurance from covering her abortion services. Fortunately, Maryland is a State where we respect women's choices, and Allie was able to go to a clinic and she paid $900 out of pocket.  Allie recovered quickly from the procedure and she was able to get pregnant shortly thereafter. This summer, Allie and her husband were thrilled to welcome a beloved second child into their family.  Mr.Speaker, Allie has one thing to say to lawmakers here today: We made the choices that are best for our family, and I trust all women to do the same.

956,topic-id,598,"Mr.President, today, I am introducing the Corporate Management Accountability Act, which request each publicly traded company to disclose its policies on whether senior executives or shareholders bear the costs of paying the company's fines and penalties.  In 2014, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William Dudley, gave a speech on Enhancing Financial Stability by Improving Culture in the Financial Services In this speech, President Dudley said, ``in recent years, there have been ongoing occurrences of serious professional misbehavior, ethical lapses and compliance failures at financial institutions. This has resulted in a long list of large fines and penalties, and, to a lesser degree than I would have desired employee dismissals and punishment. . . . The pattern of bad behavior did not end with the financial crisis, but continued despite the considerable public sector intervention that was necessary to stabilize the financial system. As a consequence, the financial industry has largely lost the public trust.''  Since 2008, ``banks globally have paid $321 billion in fines . . . for an abundance of regulatory failings from money laundering to market manipulation and terrorist financing, according to data from Boston Consulting Group.'' Unfortunately, despite these fines, we continue to see disappointing behavior at our financial institutions, whether it is Wells Fargo betraying the trust of its customers by opening unauthorized accounts or it is Equifax endangering millions of consumers by compromising critical personal information. Indeed, in my home State of Rhode Island, nearly half the State may have been affected by the cybersecurity breach at Given these and other breaches and lapses, it is clear that many financial institutions have a long way to go in rebuilding the trust of Rhode Islanders and the American people.  At the same time, it is also clear that more must be done than simply fining and penalizing financial institutions at the corporate level. Senior executives, many of whom are all too eager to take credit for a company's good news, must also take more responsibility for the bad news, especially if it is true that the buck stops with them. For example, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded ``the financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the collapse of Lehman Brothers,'' and yet, according to the Congressional Research Service, not a single senior executive officer at Lehman Brothers at the Federal level was charged, went to jail, or personally paid a Federal fine or penalty for the damage caused at Lehman Brothers that rippled through our economy in 2008.  According to Professor Peter Henning, who also writes for the New York Times in its White Collar Watch column, ``a problem in holding individuals accountable for misconduct in an organization is the disconnect between the actual decisions and those charged with overseeing the company, so that executives and corporate boards usually plead ignorance about an issue until it is too late.''  The Corporate Management Accountability Act I am introducing today is one attempt at helping to solve this problem. The bill asks publicly traded companies to disclose whether they expect senior executives or shareholders to pay the cost of corporate fines or penalties. This approach is supported by University of Minnesota Law School Professors Claire Hill and Richard Painter, who also served as President George Bush's chief ethics lawyer, as well as U.PIRG, Public Citizen, and Americans for Financial  Companies must do a better job of aligning executive incentives so that they are motivated to put their shareholders, and not themselves, first. I urge all my colleagues to join this legislative effort to hold senior executives accountable for their actions.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgS6289.txt,1982,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
548,topic-id,424,"Mr.Chairman, let me thank the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, Bobby Scott, for his hard work, and the rest of the CBC in putting this budget together.  Mr.Chairman, I think that what I am having a hard time doing is wrapping my mind around the same failed arguments that we hear over and over again that we are going to cut trillions of dollars in taxes so that we can help the upper middle class and the top 1 percent really, and that is somehow going to benefit the poorest people in the country; we are going to exacerbate the deficit saying that we are going to create jobs.  We know it never happens, and then all of a sudden we find ourselves with an increasing debt and deficit, and then we go to the poorest people in this country and we ask them to pay for it. We cut the programs that are vital to lifting them out of poverty.  I agree with my colleague on the other side of the aisle. My mother is a perfect example that a great education will lift you out of poverty and that having a Historically Black College and University that you can go to will prepare you for your future. But the problem is we don't talk about the fact that the Republican budget cuts education.  So how can we say with a straight face that we propose to lift people out of poverty, help people achieve the American Dream, help our children dream the impossible dream, and then give them the power so that they can go achieve it while we are cutting their education and we are cutting all the programs that help them to achieve it?  Look, we always hide behind protecting our country and the national defense. The biggest threat to our national defense resides on 1600 Pennsylvania It is a shame when most people in this country and my colleagues wake up in the morning and say: Are we going to war with North Korea? That is not good for the economy, and that is not good for the mental health of the country. But I think that the Secretary of State has a great disposition and strategy when it comes to the national defense and diplomacy.  I think the key with what we have to do with budgets is understand that they are moral documents and they express our values, and cutting the disabled and others is not a true statement of American values.

1075,topic-id,554,"Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to share my strong support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, or Micah's  My colleagues who oppose this bill adamantly defend a mother's ability to have a late-term abortion and a doctor's ability to perform it. But, Madam Speaker, I have heard no mention of the third person in the room: the unborn baby.  I am astounded that the opposition chooses to focus solely on the two individuals who can speak for themselves, with no mention of the one who cannot. That is exactly what we are here to do today. We are here to speak up for those who can't speak for themselves. We are here to defend those who cannot defend themselves.  Our bill seeks to do this by restricting abortions after 20 weeks, or at the 6th month of pregnancy, the point at which research shows the unborn babies can feel pain.  Last week, I, too, had the opportunity to meet the little boy this bill was named for: Micah As many of you know, he was born at 22 weeks and spent 4 long months in intensive care.                              {time}  1730  Micah survived, and this year he is in kindergarten. You see, children like Micah, who are born prematurely, are treated as patients. Special care is given to reduce their pain and increase their chances for survival, just as it should be.  So, Madam Speaker, my question to those who would oppose this bill is this: What is the difference between a baby born at 6 months outside the womb and a baby at 6 months inside the womb? How can one be treated like a miracle they are created to be and the other be treated like medical waste? If a baby like Micah can survive outside the womb given the appropriate care, shouldn't we give other babies like him the same protection and chance to live?  I have listened to my colleagues on the other side call this bill extreme. I say to oppose this bill is extreme. If we won't stop abortions at 6 months of pregnancy when a baby feels pain, when will we stop them?  We have to draw a line somewhere. To say aborting a little baby who can actually feel the pain of the procedure being forced upon them crosses the line is a gross understatement.  Madam Speaker, I am unapologetically pro-life, and I oppose abortion at any stage. I will always fight to grant greater protections for life under the law. As a society, I pray that we will start assigning greater value to life at all stages in this country.  Madam Speaker, so often we get caught up in the policies of this issue and we forget that these are babies, for goodness' sake. They feel pain, and we need to protect them. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit and join me in supporting this underlying bill.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

I encourage all Members of the House to vote in favor of this budget, and that is because our national debt continues to grow exponentially every day, every hour, every minute, and every second. We cannot afford to have any more time waiting to address the spending crisis that we are in.  This budget begins to put these irresponsible elitist policies behind us, and creates a culture around here that makes sure that our friends and neighbors who really need the help get the help without forcing our Nation's bills on our children and grandchildren, future generations, some of whom don't even exist yet.  Specifically, this budget reforms mandatory spending so it is focused on those, Mr.Chairman, in our communities who really need help. This will ensure that our country will focus limited resources on those who are most vulnerable, while encouraging a culture of self-reliance instead of government dependence.  We should be measuring, Mr.Chairman, success of these programs on how many people we get off of them, not how many people we trap in them.  Mr.Chairman, as the chart I am holding shows, because mandatory spending is over two-thirds of our total annual spending, reforming this part of our spending is the only way to really get our debt and deficits down. This budget, for the first time, starts addressing this part of the pie, $203 billion worth, and that is because of the leadership here of Republicans in the House of  Now, this budget also protects our friends and neighbors by making sure our families are safe, that the military has the tools that they need, and that the administration has the money it needs to secure our border.

439,topic-id,333,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Chairwoman Black for yielding.  Imagine what our opinion would be of a movie review where the reviewer simply looked at a movie poster and then[[Page H7785]]wrote the review and came to a conclusion that they didn't like the movie. They didn't listen to the music. They didn't see the direction. They didn't see the pacing. They didn't see the acting. They didn't see the script. They didn't see the cinematography. They saw nothing other than a movie poster and they came to a conclusion.  We would dismiss that and we would say: How ridiculous. How absurd.  Mr.Chairman, that is exactly what the Tax Policy Center did this past week. They wrote a review of a proposal as it relates to tax reform, and they didn't have the details.  Why didn't they have the details?  Because many of these details don't exist.                              {time}  1515  Specifically, they wrote a review which was very pejorative, which the Wall Street Journal completely trashed. They made this finding, and they had no notion of what the income brackets are like in our proposed tax reform plan. They had no notion about the anti-abuse rules that the Ways and Means Committee is working through to make sure there is not an abusive situation as it relates to pass-through entities. They had no notion about some of the offshore protections that are being contemplated.  Let's avoid the hyperbole. Let's avoid the hackneyed, old, tired, and faded bumper sticker that says that any kind of pro-growth tax reform is a sop to the rich. It is complete nonsense.  I think the proof will be in a tax reform proposal that this House hopefully will be considering in the coming weeks and months that will bring buoyancy, optimism, and a real opportunity for us to take advantage of a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a Tax Code that nobody can defend and nobody likes.

633,topic-id,485,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, pre-born babies feel pain. The medical field has found clear evidence that pre-born babies have the capacity to feel intense pain at 20 weeks.                              {time}  2015  That is what this legislation is about. When a child's body is gruesomely dismembered, they feel pain. When the abortion doctor attempts to use a ``less crunchy technique''--as we learned in last year's abhorrent videos about Planned Parenthood, which was their words--to procure more intact body parts, they feel pain.  Mr.Speaker, I shudder to think of the millions of lives taken from this world in such a gruesome and violent manner. Equally disturbing is the thought of how much pain has been endured by millions of pre-born babies whose lives have been cut short since Roe v.  We must do more to promote a culture of life in this country. We must do more to lessen a culture of violence. That is why I rise today in strong support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection By acknowledging that babies feel the pain of abortion at 20 weeks, this legislation affirms the inherent humanity of the most innocent--unborn babies--in our country.  To add to that, this legislation also includes protections for babies that survive an attempted abortion. It ensures that children who do survive and are able to continue to live outside the womb are given the immediate medical attention they deserve so that they have a chance to live.  With growing developments in the medical field, children are able to survive outside the womb at earlier points in pregnancy. Such was the case for Micah Pickering, for whom this legislation is name for. Micah was born at 20 weeks' gestation and is now a healthy 5-year-old.  The Congressional Budget Office recently reported that approximately 2,750 lives per year will be saved through this bill. That is 2,750 girls and boys; daughters and sons; brothers and sisters; and not medical waste, like opponents of this legislation would like you to believe.  The United States is only one of seven countries, including North Korea and China, that allow abortion after 20 weeks.  Are we really that kind of Nation? Does our Constitution not grant all Americans the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant they are?  Mr.Speaker, this is commonsense legislation. I urge every single Member of this body to take a deep look inside themselves and ask if they support not only inflicting pain on unborn babies, but also denying these innocent babies their constitutional right to life.  I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, for his leadership on this important issue.  If you want to stand for a culture of life, vote for this bill. If you want to take a stand against a culture of violence, vote for this bill.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

237,topic-id,953,"Mr.President, today I rise to speak about our country's need for tax reform. As our previous speakers have indicated, this is a critical time in our country, and we have an opportunity to make some good decisions that will impact our Nation for literally generations to come.  Reforming our Tax Code is a top priority not only for myself but for many of my colleagues and the We are committed to delivering tax reform that will provide more jobs, bigger paychecks, and a fairer tax system for the American people.  Over the 8 years of the previous administration, economic growth averaged a paltry 1.5 percent annually, which is about half of the post-World War II average. This anemic growth has led to stagnant wages and, according to the Joint Economic Committee, has cost families an average of $8,600 in income on an annual basis. It is no wonder that half of the American public says they are living paycheck to paycheck. This is simply not acceptable.  Even more concerning, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting economic growth to remain under 2 percent over the next 10 years if we do not act. If that happens, let me just share with you the real concern. If we allow economic growth to stay under 2 percent, then we will literally bring in revenue based upon the size of our economy. If we allow economic growth to move at a paltry 2 percent or less, then we won't have the revenue to pay our bills.  Today, right now, we are looking at trillion-dollar deficits. Yet, if we take a look at where the dollars are going, they go basically--looking at our entire budget, about 28 percent of the money that we spend today is found within the 12 appropriations bills that make up the defense and the nondefense discretionary side of the budget. All of the remaining items, making up 72 percent, are in areas of mandatory payments--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt. If we don't do anything and if we continue on this same path, with the type of growth we have, then we can expect that within 9 years now, by the year 2026, our country's 250th birthday, 99 percent of all of the revenue we take in will go into Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt. That means there will be only 1 percent remaining for defense of our country, roads, bridges, research, education, and all of those other items that many people really want to see and that help us to move ahead as a country.  We have to make changes now that will allow our country's economy to grow and prosper the way it used to. The way we believe we do that is by changing our Tax Code, changing the regulatory environment in the United States, and sending the message back to the businesses that this is the place where they want to do business. They don't have to leave our shores in order to actually make a profit and be able to keep that profit.  It is our intention to deliver policies that will jolt our economy, allow hard-working families to keep more of their paychecks, and provide financial opportunities to lower and middle-class families. Tax reform is a vital component of this.  Our current overly complicated Tax Code is more than 70,000 pages in length. It takes Americans more than 8.1 billion hours each year to file their taxes. A fairer, simpler Tax Code will grow the economy, increase wages for American families, improve American competitiveness overseas, and provide much needed certainty for our business community.  It has been 30 years since our Tax Code was last reformed. The rest of the industrialized world has learned from America what it takes to be competitive. They have seen what our tax rates have become. They have lowered their tax rates. They are now inviting businesses to their shores rather than to ours. Businesses that can go anyplace in the world they want to are not choosing America as their location anymore. We have to change that because when they come back, they bring good-paying jobs with them. They keep the profits here, which are reinvested within our borders rather than overseas, and that adds to a growing economy here, which allows us more revenue through even lower tax rates.  The average corporate rate in the United States today is 39 percent, compared to 25 percent by our foreign competitors. This puts American businesses at a disadvantage right out of the gate. We must reform the tax rate to one that incentivizes businesses to remain here in America and keep good-paying jobs from going overseas. Doing so will unleash the full potential of this American economy.  One thing we can all agree on is that taxes are too high and that the tax rate, no matter who you are, should be lowered. Allowing all American families to keep more of their hard-earned dollars by taking them out of the hands of Washington and putting them back into their pocketbooks will result in a more prosperous That means more people investing in America long term. When our economy is healthy, every American will feel the positive effects.  I am encouraged by the ongoing discussions and progress being made to alleviate the tax burden on American businesses and American families, and I will continue to work with anyone serious about lowering taxes and reforming the code to provide a much needed boost to our sluggish economy. The American people deserve better than the uncertain growth and burdens still lingering from the previous administration.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

Last night, more than 58 people were tragically murdered and over 500 wounded in a senseless act of violence in Las Vegas,  The murderer was found to have 20 guns, including at least one automatic rifle. No person should be allowed to possess a weapon that makes indiscriminately killing human beings easier.  It just baffles me that some of my colleagues don't agree with that basic premise. Not only do they not agree with sensible gun control measures like background checks and no fly, no buy, they won't even allow public research dollars to be used to research gun control and gun violence.  Until Congress acts to make it harder for dangerous people to acquire these types of weapons, tragedies like this will continue to happen.  How many more people have to die?  How much more blood must be shed before Congress decides to act?  Moments of silence and sympathy and prayers from Members of this body are not enough anymore. The time has come to act.

118,topic-id,1824,"Mr.President, after failing to throw 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently have last week, the Republicans are continuing their attack against the working families of our country with one of the most destructive budgets in American history.  I know the American people today, for very good reason, are preoccupied with the horror of what happened in Las Vegas, and people are horrified about what has happened in Puerto Rico, but I would beg of the American people to please pay attention to the budget proposal and the so-called tax reform ideas brought by the Republican leadership in the Senate, as well as in the  This proposal would cause devastating economic pain for tens of millions of Americans by, on the one hand, giving incredibly large tax breaks for the wealthiest people in the country, while at the same time making it harder for our children to get a decent education, harder for the families of this country to get the healthcare they need, harder for families, literally, to put food on the table, harder to protect our environment, and harder for the elderly to live their retirement years with dignity.  This is the Robin Hood proposal in reverse. The Robin Hood principle in reverse is that instead of taking from the rich to help the poor, this proposal makes massive cuts in programs desperately needed by the middle class and working families of our country, precisely to give unbelievably large tax breaks to the people on top--the people who least need those tax breaks.  At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where we have more inequality today than at any time since the 1920s and more inequality than almost any major country on Earth, where the very, very rich are becoming much richer and we have 40 million people living in poverty and tens of millions of middle-class families are going nowhere in a hurry, this Republican budget, according to the Tax Policy Center, at the end of 10 years, would provide 80 percent of the tax benefits to the top 1 percent.  Right now, today, the rich are doing phenomenally well. Everybody understands that. The middle class is shrinking. But according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, by the end of the decade, nearly 80 percent of the tax benefits in the Republican plan would go to the top 1 percent--under this plan, this Republican plan. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the richest of the rich, would receive a tax break of over $1 million a year.  At a time when so many of our families are struggling to put food on the table, struggling to figure out how to send their kids to college, struggling to figure out how to pay for childcare, we have a Republican tax proposal that would provide trillions of dollars in tax breaks to the richest people in this country.  This is a budget that would increase the Federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. We have heard on the Senate floor my Republican friends talking about how worried they are about the $20 trillion national debt and how high the deficits are. This proposal, designed to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, would increase the Federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade, and, by the way, this is a conservative estimate. There are those who think the deficit would go up a lot more than that.  This is a Republican proposal that eliminates the estate tax. What is the estate tax? Republicans name it the ``death tax,'' but let us be clear about what this tax is and who benefits from it. Despite Republican efforts trying to find farmers or ranchers who would benefit from it, this is not legislation designed to help farmers or ranchers. This is legislation designed to help the top two-tenths of 1 percent. So 99.8 percent of the American people will not benefit one nickel from the repeal of the estate tax. Only the wealthiest of the wealthy will benefit. If this Republican proposal to repeal the estate tax would go through, the Walton family of Walmart, the wealthiest family in America, would receive a tax cut of up to $52 billion.  Does anybody for one second think that, at a time when so many of our people are struggling and when we have a $20 trillion national debt, we should be passing legislation that gives the wealthiest family in this country up to a $52 billion tax break by repealing the estate tax?  But it is not just the Walton family, of course. This is a budget that says that if you are the second wealthiest family in America, the Koch brothers--and this, by the way, is just coincidental, no doubt. I know it is amazing how these coincidences take place. The Koch brothers are a family who contributed hundreds of millions of dollars year after year to the Republican Party to elect candidates who represent the wealthy and powerful. Just coincidentally, that family would receive a tax break of up to $38 billion.  People ask why the Koch brothers are contributing hundreds of millions of dollars every campaign cycle. That is a huge amount of money. That is a huge amount of money for normal families, but when you are the second wealthiest family and you have a tax break of $38 billion, contributing a few million dollars every campaign cycle is pocket change and is a good investment.  This is a budget that will cut Medicare by $450 billion. Right now in this country, we have millions and millions of seniors who are struggling to make ends meet. They can't afford their prescription drugs. They can't afford to keep their homes warm in the wintertime. Yet this Republican budget would cut Medicare by $450 billion.  Now, the Republicans tried, time after time, despite massive opposition from the American people, to repeal the Affordable Care In every one of their pieces of legislation, they made devastating cuts in Well, they are back again. Ostensibly, this is not a healthcare piece of legislation. It is a budget. It is so-called tax reform. There is $1 trillion of cuts in the Medicaid So if you were worried last week, 2 weeks ago, and 1 month ago about what the terrific Republican healthcare bills would do, stay worried because this bill will cut $1 trillion over 10 years in Medicaid, resulting in at least 15 million Americans losing their health insurance.  Can you imagine a set of priorities that says that we are going to throw 15 million people off of health insurance in order to give tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest families in this country?  It really is unbelievable.  This proposal not only adds to the deficit, not only makes massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, it also impacts the American people in many ways. We have a program in this country called the Women, Infants, and Children Program, and at a time when the United States has the highest rate of infant mortality of any major country on[[Page S6278]]Earth, what we do to try to deal with that issue is provide help to low-income pregnant women and their babies after the babies are born. This Republican budget would make about $6.5 billion in cuts to the WIC Program, eliminating nutrition assistance to over 1.2 million pregnant women, new moms, babies, and toddlers in Vermont and all over this country.  Here are the priorities: Tax breaks for the Walton family, for the Koch brothers' families, who are billionaires, and cuts in programs for low-income, pregnant women who want to have healthy babies.  At a time when the cost of childcare has skyrocketed all over this country--in the State of Vermont, it is a very serious problem; families cannot find affordable childcare--the Republican budget eliminates Head Start services for 25,000 children each and every year by cutting this program by about $3 billion. In total, the Republican budget would cut more than $5 trillion from education, healthcare, affordable housing, childcare, transportation, and other programs the working families of this country desperately rely upon.  Let's be clear about something else. This is not me talking; Republican economists are saying the same thing.  What is the theory underlying this whole approach of giving tax breaks to billionaires? The theory is that when you give tax breaks to billionaires and large, multinational corporations, somehow or another, they are going to start using the new revenue they acquire to invest in the economy and create decent-paying jobs. This is the so-called trickle-down economic theory, and this is a theory that Senate Republicans and President Trump have embraced with this budget.  The fact is that anyone who looks at history understands that whole theory is a fraud. It has always been an abysmal failure. Since Ronald Reagan and George Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and deregulated Wall Street, trillions of dollars in wealth have been redistributed from the middle class and working families to a handful of millionaires and billionaires. That is what trickle-down economics results in--a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the people on top--and that is exactly what this Republican proposal will do.  Today we have more wealth inequality than at any time since the 1920s. Unbelievably, the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. This budget would make a very bad situation worse, and it would increase the level of wealth inequality in America today.  As the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I intend to do everything I can to oppose this absurd set of priorities, and when I do that, I am speaking for the vast majority of the American people. Poll after poll after poll tells us that the American people do not think billionaires need more tax breaks. Poll after poll after poll tells us that the American people do not agree with the Republican leadership when they want to throw millions of people off of the health insurance they have. This is not a budget for the American people. This is not a budget for economic growth. This is a budget paid for and fought for by the Koch brothers and a handful of billionaires who will gain very handsomely if this budget were to be passed.  I would remind my Republican colleagues--and this is not a very radical idea--that we were elected to the Senate not just to represent a handful of billionaires; we were elected to the Senate to do our best for the middle class and working families of our country. This should not be legislation designed as payback for hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions. We need to pass legislation that protects the interests of working families and the middle class and lower income people.

434,topic-id,405,"Mr.Chair, I would say to my colleague from Kentucky, I think the rhetorical device that he is using at the end of each speaker is very effective and it is persuasive. But I would challenge him with this: I think one of the things that we have got to struggle with as a body, both Republicans and Democrats alike, is not being selective on the issue of the deficits. What we can't say is deficits are okay if it involves more spending for all of us as a body to distribute as we see fit, but deficits are not okay if they involve a tax cut and sending money back to individuals within each of our communities.  It is for that reason, again, I have voiced my concerns with regard to some of the components of this budget. But I think that the big issue for me is, simply, we cannot continue to spend as we are and have the ship of America sail forward.  It was Erskine Bowles who was the Democratic Chief of Staff to former President Clinton who observed: ``We are walking our way toward the most predictable financial crisis in the history of man if we don't get our arms around spending.''  So, for me, while not perfect--and I certainly cede that point--I think the building blocks of what this budget is trying to get toward is a sustainable economy.  How do you have a sustainable economy?  Many of the things that my Democratic colleagues have talked about in terms of education, workforce development, those things. But it is also about the foundation of: Is our spending sustainable?  You can't go on spending more than you take in forever without having bad things happen at the individual level, at the corporate level, and certainly at the governmental level.  I think it is about: Is our tax load sustainable?  Spending drives tax loads, which is interesting. I pulled a chart that shows for the first 100 years of our country's existence, we spent about 3 percent of It bumped up after World War We are now roughly around 20 percent, and we are on our way to 30 percent.  The question we have to ask in this budget or any other budget like it is: Can we continue to do this without going to the exact spot that Erskine Bowles was talking about?

A deficit is simply a deferred tax. A debt is simply an accumulation of deferred taxes. One of the things, again, we have to get our arms around is that we are stacking up deferred taxes. We are stacking up an accumulation of taxes with debt and deficits. This budget, I think, begins to nudge us in the right direction in doing something about it.

1262,topic-id,338,"Mr.Chairman, I rise, as well, in opposition to the substitute amendment, and I do so because I am struck by the ways in which you can, at times, agree on the diagnosis but disagree on the cure.  I think we would all agree, Republicans and Democrats alike, that we have a real problem in the way that wages have indeed stagnated over the last 30 years. A lot of my Democratic colleagues are nailing it in terms of that diagnosis.  The question though, is the cure. And the question there is: Can we fix that problem by raising taxes by $2.7 trillion? Can we fix that problem by increasing spending by $6.2 trillion? Can we fix that problem by increasing the debt by $3.9 trillion and, in essence, having a budget that never balances?  I would argue, no, and I would say, instead, what we have to look at is the basics, which we have been dancing around, which is the mathematic formula that says: Savings drives investment, which drives productivity gain which, ultimately, impacts standard of living or wages. And what we don't focus on enough is this notion of the investment part of investment; if you want to increase productivity, you have got to increase investment.  In fairness to my Democratic colleagues, part of that is public investment, but another part is private.  What my colleague from Virginia was just getting at a moment ago was, for 50 years, regardless of tax rate, 90 or 28 percent, the take to government has been about 18 percent of GDP very consistently.  So what I would argue is we, indeed, need more public investment, but we also need private investment to go with it. And if we don't watch out, what is being contemplated with this Democratic substitute is a process that will ultimately crowd out that much more in the way of private investment so key to increasing productivity.

This is according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy  It slashes $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid, even worse than TrumpCare, and it ends the guarantee of Medicare benefits for American seniors.

Now, most people don't actually feel that because the ordinary worker has not seen any wage growth in the last 2, maybe 2\1/2\ or 3 decades. The income gap between top executives and the average worker is bigger than ever. At the same time, corporations are raking in record profits as they ship jobs overseas.

It is a first step toward fixing a broken tax system.  Instead of giving tax breaks to companies that offshore jobs and that pay poverty wages, our bill encourages businesses to create good jobs here at home.  Here is how the bill works. We reward patriot employers with a tax credit for each employee's wages. To qualify for the patriot employers tax credit, a business must fulfill the following checklist:  One, invest in American jobs, no offshoring or tax inversion schemes;  Two, pay living wages;  Three, contribute to workers' retirement security through a defined benefit or defined contribution plan;  Four, provide quality health insurance;  Five, provide paid leave;  Six, and lastly, have practices in place to support employment of our troops, our veterans, and people with disabilities.  There is a companion bill that was introduced by Senator Sherrod Brown, and I am sure he will get more cosponsors.  Small businesses, under 50 employees, can qualify for the tax credits by meeting only some of these criteria.  Unlike the Trump-GOP tax giveaway proposal, our bill is responsible. It pays for the new tax credits by closing existing tax loopholes that incentivize corporations to invest overseas.

So we don't want to be rewarding corporations that are avoiding U.taxes and offshoring American jobs and giving them benefits. So the Patriot Employer Act fixes that. It raises taxes on corporations that offshore and reduces taxes on businesses that invest in good, American jobs.  The President talks about America first. This is exactly the kind of thing that we should be doing. Let's not create incentives to take those jobs away. But still, the Trump-GOP tax plan is a betrayal of American workers. I don't know if he knows that. It does nothing to raise wages. In fact, 80 percent of the plan's tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of earners.  At the same time, 30 percent of middle class families--$50,000 to $150,000--would actually see a tax increase under the plan.  As for corporate taxes, it doubles down on the problem in the current Tax While our current Tax Code lets multinationals put off paying taxes on offshore profits, the new Republican plan would give permanent tax breaks for offshoring.  The Republican tax plan means less revenue for investments that grow the middle class, like education and infrastructure, which we need so badly, which he said he wanted to do. We want to do it with him. It means more[[Page H7735]]jobs shipped abroad. For many middle class families, it would mean a smaller paycheck.  So we are offering a different path.

616,topic-id,1397,"Mr.President, here is what is happening with so-called ``tax reform.'' Tonight, the Budget Committee is voting on a budget resolution that does two things.  First, it sets the spending limits for everything in the government--environment, energy, defense, healthcare, education, transportation, and so on.  Second, it includes something called reconciliation instructions that basically direct all of the committees to report back with legislation that either increases or decreases the Federal deficit by a certain amount. This time around, here is what they are doing--asking the Senate Finance Committee to draft legislation to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Again, this is going to pass on a party-line vote, with Republicans prevailing, to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. This is what will start the tax reform process.  That is not all. Republicans still haven't given up on decimating our healthcare system. They are still trying to cut Medicaid and, this time, Medicare, and they are going to use this tax bill. They are going to cut $473 billion from Medicare at a time when our population is getting older and many seniors are already struggling. They are also going to cut $1 trillion from This is the program that pays for one out of every two births in this country. It helps millions of families who have loved ones in nursing home care.  Last week, they tried to pass a healthcare bill that cut taxes. Now they are trying to pass a tax bill that will cut healthcare. Their proposal will, actually, increase the deficit by $4 trillion. That is 12 zeros.  Here is what we could do with $4 trillion. We could completely rebuild half of the airports in the United We could put 20 million people through 4 years of college. We could pay off the debt for every student loan.  Instead, the United States is going to be in the red by $4 trillion, but after they cut $1 trillion from Medicaid and one-half trillion dollars from Medicare, the party that has railed against the Federal debt and deficit will still add $2.5 trillion to the deficit.  This is all so that they can give tax cuts to the richest people in the United I promise you, I understand that both parties are sometimes guilty of exaggerating and that sometimes both parties are guilty of relying on talking points and relying on caricatures of the other side, but you couldn't caricature this bill if you tried. This bill is already a caricature of what people say Republicans are all about, which is to shred the social safety net and provide tax cuts to the wealthiest  They are going to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, and they are going to cut tax rates across the board, but the people who will actually benefit will be the people at the top. The Tax Policy Center, which is a nonpartisan, highly respected group, has crunched the numbers, and they found that within 10 years, 80 percent of the benefits of this $4 trillion tax bill will go to 1 percent of  Remember what is happening. We are borrowing a huge chunk of this, and whatever is not borrowed comes out of Medicare and So the programs that pay for women to give birth in a hospital or for elderly people to get healthcare will be decimated, and the wealthiest Americans will pay less in taxes. This is bad policy, not just for the people who work hard but for the whole economy.  I want to give you a specific example. Again, both parties rely on talking points, and both parties accuse each other of having the wrong set of ideas, but we have an example of what happens when you do this. This bill is actually modeled after what they did in the State of The State government eliminated one of its business taxes, telling people that it would help the State's economy. Instead, the economy slowed down, which left them with even lower tax revenues. They had to cut government programs, like education, and now people do not want to send their kids to Kansas public schools anymore because they do not have the resources to educate their children.  This is not a path that America should follow. Everyone needs to pay their fair share, and that includes big corporations and the people who are benefiting from the system and making millions of dollars every year, but in this proposal, they are the ones getting all of the tax breaks.  Companies already have huge tax breaks. Some corporations end up paying zero in Federal income tax every April 15 even though they are making healthy profits. They have teams of lawyers and accountants who help them dodge paying even a penny to the Federal That is why corporate income taxes make up less than 10 percent of all of the revenue to the Federal Meanwhile, at least 30 percent of the middle class will actually pay more if the Republicans succeed with their tax reform package.  Think about this.  Thirty percent of the middle class is going to see tax increases in their tax bills. Why? It is because they have to find some money to subsidize the tax cuts for the richest people. Some of the money will be found by borrowing; some of the money will be found by making cuts to Medicare and Medicaid; and some of the money will be found by increasing taxes on the middle class. One out of every two households with children will see its taxes go up under this plan. Increasing taxes for these people while decreasing them for big corporations is not a plan for economic growth. We have heard over and over that Republicans do not want to add to the deficit--I don't either--but this is, literally, what they are voting to do tonight.  Again, this is not a talking point. This is not a sort of rhetorical flourish. The bill, itself, provides for $1.5 trillion worth of deficit spending. Yet it is not deficit spending on the military; it is not deficit spending on disaster response; and it is not deficit spending on Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security or any of the social safety net programs that they claim is the problem with the Federal budget. It is deficit spending for the purpose of a tax cut, 80 percent of which is going to 1 percent of the country. This is not conservative--certainly not fiscally conservative--and it will not help us to grow the economy.  It is no surprise that this policy is bad, because, again, the process has been so bad. With healthcare, they ignored regular order. They obliterated the committee process. They ignored They ignored the way the U.Senate is supposed to work, and they failed. One Republican Senator says that he will not vote for anything that adds one penny to the deficit. Another Republican Senator said that he[[Page S6344]]will not do anything that does not cut taxes for everybody. It already does not meet that test. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle--Republicans too--have promised not to cut Medicaid or It violates all of those promises.  If you did not like the ACA repeal because it cut Medicaid, guess what. This cuts Medicaid more. If you made a promise to your voters not to cut Medicare, you should be aware that this bill provides for one-half trillion dollars in cuts to If you are railing against debt and deficits, this is the biggest budget buster that I have ever seen in my short, 5-year career in the U. During the campaign, the President of the United States promised not to cut Medicare, and the senior Senator from Arizona has called for regular order. This violates every procedural and policy principle that has been articulated on this Senate floor since I have been here. I do not see a way forward on this legislation when it has been conceived in a purely partisan way. It will only take us deeper into dysfunction. For the sake of the Senate, let's stop going down this path. Let's restore regular order and work together on a bipartisan tax reform process.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

904,topic-id,1102,"Mr.President, before my planned remarks on the Federal Communications Commission, I want to say a few words about the awful events that happened in Las Our hearts are with the families affected by the tragedy and with the city of Las Vegas, and we do send them our best wishes and our prayers. But we can do more than send our thoughts and prayers to the grieving. We can do more than thank the first responders. We can do more than lower the flag to half mast.  We can take a stand against gun violence by passing commonsense gun safety laws. Otherwise, this becomes a ritual of mass murder, mourning, and moving on. Let's stop this awful ritual. Let's stop the violence. Let's do something about it.  Mr.President, I wish to talk about the nomination of Chairman Ajit Pai to lead the Federal Communications Commission for another 5 years. When it comes to Chairman Pai, personally and professionally, I want to say that I believe in his integrity as a public servant, and I believe he is smart and qualified. But the FCC is supposed to create competition and protect consumers, and Chairman Pai isn't doing that.  First, Chairman Pai's FCC is trying to get rid of net neutrality. Net neutrality is a Federal rule that says ISPs--internet service providers--must treat all content equally. They can't discriminate by making certain kinds of content slower, charging more for other kinds of content, or blocking some content altogether.  That is the basic premise of the internet. Once you pay for your broadband internet access and then you jump on a browser, everything comes down to the same speeds. It is so foundational to the way we use the internet that it is actually hard to describe a future without net neutrality, but it could be that you pay your ISP, and certain websites download fast.  Certain websites are almost impossible to find. For certain websites, you have to pay a premium just to be able to capture their content. Forget what you may have to pay Hulu, Netflix, and others. The ISP will essentially control your access to the internet. That is why net neutrality was so important. It is not that, in that moment, things were necessarily undermining the current internet but that, without a firm rule, these companies may have incentives to change the internet as we know it.  When Chairman Pai announced that the FCC would review the rules on net neutrality, he said: ``This is a fight we intend to wage, and it is a fight that we are going to win.'' But that is not how the FCC is supposed to work. This is a quasi-judicial agency. They are supposed to propose a rule, allow the public to weigh in, and then the agency considers the comments before making a decision. Chairman Pai had made it clear from the beginning that he had already made up his mind. Even though there were 22 million individual comments from American citizens about what we should do with the free and open internet, he had decided in advance of that.  Unfortunately, this is part of a pattern. Right after Congress took away the FCC's ability to protect people's privacy online, he wrote an op-ed that essentially read that this is good news. It is pretty unusual to have a chairman of a quasi-judicial body weigh in on something that the legislative branch does or to completely disregard the process for public input. Chairman Pai has not yet demonstrated a willingness to stray from the party line.  One of the things I like about him is that I know that he has a big brain. We have talked policy, and when we have had private conversations, I have seen that he has liked the engagement, that he likes the job, and that he likes public service. The challenge is that there has been no instance in which he has done anything that was other than predictably That is OK for now, as it has been a relatively short tenure, but what we need in an FCC Chairman is someone who takes his own views and the facts, as the record becomes established, and makes up his own mind. He is not a Republican while he is on the His job is to apply the facts and his own judgment.  During the confirmation hearing, I asked him about the President of the United States calling the media the ``enemy of the state.'' He would not say one way or another what he thought of those comments or how he would guide the FCC based on those comments. At some point, he needs to demonstrate some independence from his party and from the  With this vote, the Senate has a chance to say that the person who leads the FCC should understand, at a bare minimum, how to run a quasi-judicial agency in a nonpartisan fashion,[[Page S6240]]that he or she should value public input, and that he or she should not simply go along with what the party is asking and implement it no matter how it stacks up against the statute.  Here is another example. Earlier this year, Chairman Pai rolled back a rule in order to allow local TV stations to be bought up without any limits by one single company. This decision seemed to be for the benefit of one company, the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which just happens to be a company with strong conservative leanings. Sinclair is already the largest owner of local broadcasting stations in the United States, but now it is trying to buy another company, Tribune Media, which would expand Sinclair's reach into 72 percent of the households.  For decades, both Congress and the FCC have taken steps to protect local broadcasting because it has benefited the public interest. So, under normal circumstances, Sinclair would not be able to buy up these other stations, but Chairman Pai has changed the rules so that this company will have even more power and reach. The secondary beneficiary of this change will be the Republican Party, because Sinclair has a decades-long history of pressuring its local stations to broadcast certain news that helps the Republican cause.  We need an independent Chairman at the helm of the We need someone who will make decisions based on statute, not based on political affiliation. That is why I will vote no on Mr.Pai's nomination, but I hope that I will be proven wrong.  I yield the floor.

1116,topic-id,700,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today heartbroken and bone weary from the gun violence that continues to wrack our country. Just this year alone there have been 273 mass shootings, shootings with four or more victims. Every day we read of another child tragically lost.  Our Nation awoke yesterday to the horrifying news of yet another mass shooting, this time in Las It is once more now the worst shooting in our Nation's history. This violence sears our hearts and leaves countless families forever tragically changed.  I extend my sincere condolences to all those who lost loved ones and send prayers of recovery to those wounded. Please know that the American people are grieving with you.  I am incredibly grateful for the extraordinary professionalism and bravery of law enforcement and first responders during this attack. But our words and prayers are not sufficient for the people of Las Vegas or the other victims of daily gun violence across our country. We owe them more. We must come together to tackle this epidemic with action. Enough is enough.  There is no one single solution to the gun violence now, nor are there any easy answers, but that must not stop us from making progress where we can. Incredibly, however, this body is set to consider rolling back some of the commonsense regulations we already have in place for gun safety.  It is inconceivable to me that this House is preparing to vote on legislation to weaken restrictions on the sale of silencers. Such sound suppressors make it more difficult for law enforcement officers to identify the point source of a weapon and to react to protect our public.  Why are we considering a bill that makes firearms more deadly and makes it more difficult for police to respond?  But that is not all. There is also a proposal to weaken State concealed carry laws with national reciprocity.  This dangerous legislation would undermine local safety laws and deny States their right to establish their own concealed carry safety standards. Requiring States to accept the concealed standards of every other State will effectively create a dangerous race to the bottom and leave the least restrictive State law as the effective national standard.  Mr.Speaker, we should be debating and voting on proposals that can reduce gun violence in our communities. We must not allow the difficulty of the path ahead prevent us from embracing solutions that move us in the right direction.  Earlier this year, I introduced the Ghost Guns Are Guns bill with my colleague, Congressman Espaillat of New This bill will address the glaring[[Page H7680]]loophole that allows gun buyers to bypass a background check by purchasing their weapons as unassembled kits online. These kits can be delivered to anyone's doorstep with all the parts needed to assemble a fully functioning, totally untraceable firearm.  The Ghost Guns Are Guns Act simply says that these weapons should be regulated like other firearms and require a background check like other firearms. More than 9 out of 10 Americans support background checks. This bill is a commonsense step forward, and I urge my colleagues to join me in seeking its passage.  We also face the problem of stolen guns. Last year alone, more than 18,000 guns were lost or stolen from Federal firearm dealers. Many of these stolen weapons were later used in violent crimes. That is why I introduced the SECURE Firearm Storage Act, to require all Federal firearm licensees to securely store their inventory when not open for business.  The Chicago Sun-Times said this bill was, ``so obviously right, it's hard to believe it is even necessary.'' I agree, and I invite my colleagues to join me in passing this bill as well.  These are but two commonsense ideas. I am open to any and all ideas to make progress in reducing gun violence in our communities and helping make our communities safe--from universal background checks to making gun trafficking a Federal crime, to limiting access to high-capacity magazines and military assault weapons.  Enough is enough. We cannot allow this epidemic to continue. Together, we have the opportunity to save lives. I urge my colleagues to join me, and let's take this time to act.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7679-2.txt,1E+14,PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,topic-id,2186,"Mr.President, first, the Nation continues to reel from the awful events of Sunday night in Las Vegas--the most deadly mass shooting in modern American history. It has gotten even deadlier in the last 24 hours, with 59 dead and 527 injured--some wounded by gunfire, some injured because they were trampled in the chaos. There were 22,000 concertgoers who fled for their lives from the scene. The police found 23 guns in the hotel room of the monster who committed this atrocity and 19 more at his home. Some of them had been modified to cause even more carnage.  Of course, as always, the beauty of the American people and the first responders pulled through. I saw on TV today a man who had been shot. Two young women came and risked their lives while those shots were going. They took off his belt and tied a tourniquet around his upper thigh because he was bleeding profusely from his leg. They saved his life. He said he will never know who they are, but they saved his life. That story, I am sure, will be repeated over and over again. The valor, the bravery of the average American and the greatness of our first responders is the only counterpoint to the evil, the carnage, the horror we have all witnessed.  We cannot banish evil or madness from the Earth, but we sure can do what we can in our power to make our country a safer place. We need commonsense reforms, and these reforms have broad public support.  In the face of tens of thousands of gun deaths every year, too many Republicans in Congress have tried to enact the dream agenda of the NRA and the gun lobby. They have pursued a national concealed carry law. Can you imagine if that were to have passed? This horrible man could have concealed carry under the laws of Nevada and gone to Times Square in New York City or to Walt Disney World in Florida and just shot away.  Most of our police organizations are against this concealed carry bill. In light of the carnage, in knowing of the evil that exists, with the power of evil magnified by guns and automatic weapons, how can we try to pursue it?  What about gun silencers? There is a move actually in this Congress--it is in the House right now, and I am sure it has support on the other side of the aisle in the Senate--to make it easier for citizens to acquire silencers. Why? Let me tell you something. One of the few ways the police had to go after the shooter was trying to hear the sound of where the guns were coming from.  Thank God our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have pulled back on this bill. It is not the first time. They had to postpone a hearing on the bill when the congressional baseball team was attacked during an early morning practice. When two mass shootings force you to delay a bill that would make those mass shootings harder to detect and stop, maybe it is a sign that you ought to let go of the bill once and for all.  Of course, we have this absurd NRA nostrum that if everyone were to have a gun, we would all be safe because if people were in an arena--a place--where someone was shooting, they could shoot them back. They sure could not have shot back at someone who was 32 stories up in a hotel. This idea that the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun is absurd in this situation. It is absurd in many situations.  So where do we go from here?  This place has been gridlocked on the issue of gun control for a while. President Trump, before he ran for office, was for certain sane, rational, limited aspects of gun control. After Sandy, he called for the gun laws to be tightened. I know when he ran, that the power of[[Page S6269]]the NRA, the money of the NRA, and the narrow special interest of the NRA lobbyists here were just the swamp he decried--small groups going against the public interest and persuading Congress to do that. Yet maybe he can have a bit of a reawakening, in the horror of what happened, as he goes to Las Vegas tomorrow.  Today I am calling on the President to come out against the absurd law about silencers--to threaten a veto if he must and put an end to that bill. I am also calling on President Trump to bring together the leaders of Congress and let both sides know he is ready and willing to address head-on this issue of gun safety. He should tell Members of his party it is time to work to address this epidemic that costs the lives of more than 30,000 Americans a year.  I am glad the President is going to Las Vegas--that is a good idea--but he should take it a step further. He should call us together and lead this Nation in some rational laws about gun safety that the overwhelming majority of Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--support.  If we truly want to honor our first responders and protect our fellow Americans, as we say we do, President Trump should stand up and tell the NRA that they are not always right, abandon some of their most extreme policies--I would abandon most of them--and come to the table and do the work that so many Americans are desperate for Congress to do.          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  Mr.President, on another matter, the crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, today, President Trump will be visiting Puerto Rico nearly 2 weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto In my view, the lateness of his visit is indicative of his leadership and the Federal response to this humanitarian crisis. It has been slow, it hasn't been well coordinated or sure-footed, and it has been too late in coming.  President Obama visited Sandy two days after the storms hit. President Trump himself was much quicker to visit Texas when Harvey hit. Two weeks is too long. It is better than nothing. That is for sure. But it is too long. It sends a signal that maybe he believes what happened in Puerto Rico is less important than what happened in Texas or in  In the lead-up to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, President Trump was tweeting on an almost daily basis, prevailing on Texans and Floridians to stay safe from the storm. That was the right thing to do. But when it came to Puerto Rico, there were no tweets or public statements in the lead-up to the storm, and it took several days to even mention Puerto Rico in his tweets. Even then, he had mostly blame for Puerto Rico or pats on the back for his own administration. He kept decrying fake news, but he couldn't fool the American people. They saw on TV what was happening and the devastation that stayed for so long.  Let me give a comparison. The President said that, because it is an island, it is harder to get to. It is, but when Haiti was struck by a massive earthquake in 2010, the United States didn't wait for things to get worse. We ramped up military and disaster assistance quickly and responded with an overwhelming amount of support. Within 2 days of the earthquake in Haiti, 8,000 troops were in route. Within 2 weeks, 22,000 troops were in route with 300 helicopters assisting relief efforts. Even to this moment, the number for Puerto Rico is much smaller. That shows that the response has not been good enough. Why was his response for Puerto Rico so much less than the response for Haiti?  So we need a much better response on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin I would say to President Trump, I am glad you are going--glad you are going--but this is your chance to make up for what has been a plodding start.  When the President visits Puerto Rico today, he should not get into any political fights or blame Puerto Rico for its problems. The President needs to figure out what is wrong and what else has to be done and marshal the resources of our government and our military to fix it. The 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands are counting on their These are American citizens.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, returning to the Republican tax plan, over the weekend, we heard some pretty absurd claims from Republican legislators and Cabinet officials about the tax plan. The President and his top advisers are selling this as a middle-class miracle, but every independent analyst is saying that the Republican plan focuses on the rich to the exclusion of the middle class.  The GOP tax plan lowers the top rate from 39.6 to 35 percent and repeals the estate tax, which affects only the top two-tenths of 1 percent of the estates in this country, or any estate over $11 million. That is not the middle class. It lowers the rate on passthrough entities, creating a huge loophole that would allow wealthy hedge fund managers, law firms, and lobbyists to pay a rate that is a lot lower. According to the Tax Policy Center, the top one-tenth of 1 percent would reap 80 percent of the benefits of the GOP plan. The top 0.1 percent, or folks who make more than $5 million a year, would get a break of a million dollars a year. How many Americans believe that people who make over $5 million a year should get a $1 million tax break? That is what is in the bill right now.  They are saying that maybe it will change, but why did they put out such a shoddy product to begin with? Why didn't they wait and put in more details than what is there now? It is not a middle-class tax cut by any stretch of the imagination. Those who put together this bill, the hard rightwing of the Republican Party, really aren't interested in middle-class tax cuts. They are interested in tax cuts for the rich and scraps for everyone else. Nothing makes this clearer than their budget resolution, and every day this plan comes with a surprise.  Here is the surprise today, and it is amazing. The Republican budget resolution calls for a $450 billion cut in Folks, this tax bill cuts your In the budget bill that outlines the tax bill that we are doing this week, the plan calls for a $473 billion cut in Medicare and more than $1 trillion in cuts to  If you are an older American, you are saying: Maybe this tax bill will not affect me.  It sure will. It sure will because, amazingly, to pay for these tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans--the most powerful of Americans--they cut your Medicare by over $450 billion and cut Medicaid by $1 trillion.  Haven't our Republican colleagues learned? When they tried to do a similar thing in healthcare--to cut healthcare so they could save money and cut taxes on the very wealthy--they had to abandon it. This is going to meet a similar problem. It is going to meet the opprobrium of the American people--$1.5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans--and the budget tees up even more cuts to If the GOP tax plan were to pass, another provision known as statutory pay-go would offset the deficit increase automatically with cuts to Medicare and many other programs that support our Nation's economy. So not only does this bill favor the rich, the very wealthy, but to help finance those tax cuts for the wealthy, they are cutting Medicare by one-half trillion dollars--close to one-half trillion dollars--and they are cutting Medicaid by $1 trillion.  So this is just like the Republicans' first healthcare bill, but in reverse. In the first TrumpCare bill, the Republicans proposed cutting back on healthcare to sneak through tax breaks for the rich. Now they are proposing massive tax cuts to the rich to sneak through cuts to healthcare.  Wait till America finds out about this bill. It is going to get the same cold, horrified reception that the healthcare bill did, and it will not pass. The American people will not be fooled. They have seen this movie before. The top 1 percent of corporations would win, and millions of seniors, the disabled, and working-class Americans would lose, and lose a lot.  The rich are doing great. They don't need a tax break. To compound the injury, to say we are going to pay for their big tax break by cutting Medicare and Medicaid, that ain't going to fly. Don't even try it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.[[Page S6270]]  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

188,topic-id,2706,"Mr.President, as we continue to grieve with the people of Las Vegas and families of the injured and the deceased, when I think of the pictures I see of those beautiful young people who had the best of life ahead of them, we ache for them. But our thoughts must turn to action so this doesn't happen again.  What can we do as a nation to change? Because surely when there are more mass shootings this year than there are the number of days this year, when we average more than one mass shooting per day, something has to change.  I am sure that if you asked the grieving families whether they want the laws to change so this might not happen again, the overwhelming majority would say yes, they would want us to do something. If we could talk to those brave souls who were killed and are now in Heaven, they would say: Do something. They wouldn't say: Let's wait. They wouldn't say: Leave things alone. The fact that they were killed, the fact that there were so many injured--they wouldn't think it is political to try to save their lives or prevent somebody else from dying the way they did. So when folks say: Don't bring politics into this, that it is inappropriate, I am sure the families of the loved ones who were lost would agree with me that it is appropriate and important and necessary.  Politics is where we are supposed to come together and debate the great problems of our time in order to find solutions to them. Politics is how we are supposed to make our country a better, safer, more prosperous place to live. And there is no more appropriate time than now to talk about the issue of gun violence.  Yesterday, President Trump visited Las I am glad he went to show our solidarity and remind everyone there that they have the full support of the But he didn't talk about guns. There is a huge opportunity he[[Page S6329]]missed to lead this Nation in a reasonable, moderate debate on gun safety, but that opportunity is not over. The President still has the opportunity. All eyes are on the President to see if he will grasp the opportunity and lead the Nation to do something reasonable and moderate about guns and gun safety.  President Trump, are you going to wait to hear what the NRA says first? Are you going to wait for the NRA to give you the green light? You ran your campaign saying you were beholden to no one. You fashion yourself as a strong man. Well, are you going to show that you are not beholden to anyone now? Are you going to show your strength now? Are you going to be the first Republican President in a generation to buck the NRA? You know what the right thing to do is.  I say to President Trump: Come out and say that you support and would sign a law to ban bump stocks--the modification used by the Las Vegas gunman to make his weapons automatic. That is small, and it is the right thing to do. Don't wait for the NRA to make up their mind. Do it.  Of course, banning bump stocks can't be our only response. It is hardly enough. Even though we should do whatever we can in this body in obeisance to the NRA, we must do more. Abandoning efforts to deregulate silencers would be the next step. The police were able to figure out where the gunman was because of the noise from his gun in the Mandalay Bay  Let's forget about implementing a national concealed carry reciprocity. My police officers in Times Square don't want to let someone who has had no check, who might have a mental derangement like Paddock, come to Times Square--and they can't do anything about it; that is what that law would do--or any other heavily populated place, the downtowns of many of our big cities and even medium-sized cities, Disney World, baseball games, football stadiums. If this concealed carry reciprocity passed, crazy people could carry weapons concealed into any football stadium in America, and the police couldn't check on them and see if they had a gun.  We have to do these things. If you looked at what would be the most effective way in stopping the daily gun violence that is doable, the most important and attainable thing to do would be adopting universal background checks. It is common sense, it is measured, it is prudent, and it would be really effective.  The bill Senator Murphy introduced yesterday is one I have been involved with for a long time, and we should see if we can get enough support to pass it. We can and should talk about these issues more. It requires only a modicum of moral and political coverage. President Trump and Republicans in Congress ought to show that moral and political courage now by bucking the NRA and engaging in a reasonable debate about commonsense gun laws.  Fully automatic weapons are already illegal, made so by a law signed by President Reagan in 1986. Banning bump stocks is entirely consistent with the books. Senator Feinstein introduced a reasonable proposal. What are we waiting for, the NRA to give us a green light? That is so wrong.  If the President and Congress are so beholden to the NRA that they can't do the very bare minimum--banning a device that allowed a shooter to kill 59 Americans with ease, a device whose ban would in no way infringe on the legitimate rights of gun owners--then our politics, our means of making this country a better and safer place, will have once again failed us.          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  Mr.President, turning to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, yesterday, once again, Congress received a request from the administration for a supplemental aid package that will go to help Puerto Rico, the U.Virgin Islands, and other States hit by storms. It also includes some money for the Western States beset by wildfires.  It is a good first step, but it is just the start of a long recovery and relief effort that will require additional aid from this While aid and resources are necessary now, these islands are just starting to assess the damage. Once they determine how devastating these storms actually were, we need to respond immediately to provide additional support and funds to assist their recovery and rebuilding, just as we have done for past storms and disasters. On this package, I have three points.  First, I am urging my colleagues to add additional and vital flexible funding for recovery like the community development block grant. We gave CDBG to help Texas after We can't deprive Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands of this money.  Second, I am warning my colleagues on the other side--particularly those in the House--not to attach any extraneous, ideological policy riders to this urgent aid package. Ideological policy changes to the Flood Insurance Program and forest management policies should come nowhere near this bill. They tried to do it last week in the FAA bill, and we had to send it back because of joint opposition, both sides of the aisle. Let's not go through that again. I thank our chairman of the Banking Committee for helping in that regard.  Third, it has become clear that Puerto Rico's recovery will be further hindered by its ongoing debt crisis. That crisis, coupled with the devastation from Hurricane Maria, has led to growing concerns that the island will soon face a liquidity crisis. Simply put, the island is running out of money to pay for essential services like first responders, not to mention funds for rebuilding and recovery. The funds we hope to include in the disaster package are critical, but we have to make sure the island has enough cash to start the process. In FEMA, local governments often have to lay out the money first and then they get repaid, but Puerto Rico doesn't have the money to lay out so we have to deal with that issue to make it effective.  With these issues in mind, we should act quickly on this supplemental aid, but it is just the beginning of Congress's aid to rebuild.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, finally, on the Republican tax plan, I have so much to say about this plan. It is so awful in so many ways: huge tax cuts for the wealthy and the powerful, raising taxes on middle-class people--which I am going to talk about in a minute--blowing a huge hole in our deficit, and to fund the tax cuts for the rich, cutting Medicare and Medicaid by close to $1.5 trillion.  We are all in favor of a serious tax reform debate. We have mentioned our guidelines: no tax cuts for the 1 percent, no increase in the deficit, and do it in a bipartisan way. The Republican plan does just the opposite. That is why Democrats are so opposed. It lavishes tax breaks on the rich, pays for it by cutting Medicare and Medicaid, and leaves everyone in the cold, except the very wealthy.  Today I want to focus on one provision of the GOP tax plan: the repeal of the State and local tax deduction. The Republican plan raises taxes on millions of middle-class families across the country by repealing the State and local deduction. Forty-four million Americans take that deduction. That is about one in eight. It is about one in four or five families who take that deduction. One-third of all taxpayers take the deduction. It is almost one in three. They don't just get a few pennies back. They get several thousand dollars off their taxes each year. It is not just a rarified group in States like Massachusetts, New York, and The reason it brings in $1.3 trillion is because it affects so many people throughout the entire country.  If you do not believe me, look at the numbers. Look at these charts. I am posting the percentages for each Forty-six percent of the people in Maryland get an average deduction of $12,900. Connecticut gets 41 percent. I showed one of my colleagues that Virginia is higher than New Thirty-seven percent get an $11,000 deduction.  Massachusetts, To my colleagues from Utah, 35 percent of Utah taxpayers get an average deduction of $12,954. In Utah, they say: Well, the standard deduction makes up for it. With most families, the standard deduction will not because we are taking away the standard exemption so it is a wash if you are a family of three.  Let's keep going. Minnesota and New I want to show my Republican colleagues how it would affect some of their Let's take One-third of all taxpayers get an average[[Page S6330]]break of $9,000. Look at these numbers, my colleagues. I am going to send them to every one of you. Look how it affects your  Here we go. Iowa, 29 percent of all people get a $10,000 break, on average; Pennsylvania, 29 percent, an $11,000 break; Arizona, 28 percent, a $7,000 break.  My friend from Idaho, I didn't know he would be here, but his number on the chart--28 percent of Idahoans get an average of an $8,800 break. Do you want to take that away from them? The standard deduction doesn't make up for it if you have one child or more. Nebraska, 28 percent get an $11,000 deduction.  By the way, these numbers come from a group that put it together, but it is from the These are IRS numbers.  South Carolina, 27 percent, $8,000; Missouri, 26 percent, $9,800; Ohio, 26 percent, $10,000. Kentucky, my dear friend the Republican leader, in his State, 26 percent of the people--one out of four--get that State and local property deduction, averaging $9,995. Do you want to take that away?  Alabama, where our dear friend the Presiding Officer is from, gets 26 percent. One out of four of his constituents get an average break of $5,900. Kansas, 25 percent, gets an average break of $9,400.  I am saying these numbers because our friends on the hard right, who just want to lower their own taxes, are telling everybody, oh, this is just in four States--Massachusetts, New York, California, New  No, it is across  Let's keep going. I am having a good time. I hope you all are.  Oklahoma, 24 percent of the people get an $8,000 break. I think this is Mississippi, 23 percent, gets a $6,300 break; Louisiana, 23 percent, close to one out of four, $6,700. Texas, the great State of Texas, where our majority whip comes from, 23 percent, close to one out of four Texans, get a $7,800 break. Indiana, 23 percent get an $8,700 break; Florida, 22 percent get a $7,300 break. Wyoming--it wouldn't affect Wyoming because it is a rural State--22 percent get a $6,300 break.  The State that is least affected is still very affected. South Dakota and West Virginia, only 17 percent of the people get a $9,000 break in West Virginia and a $6,000 break in South North Dakota, Tennessee, and Arkansas--21 percent, 19 percent, 18 percent breaks, between $4,900 and $6,800.  The Achilles' heel of this bill--there are many--is State and local deductibility. It kills the middle class and the upper middle income people. It doesn't really affect the rich. They do not pay a lot of property taxes, the bulk of these deductions. They make their money in high-income places. They have a lot of stocks and a lot of bonds. It is the middle class and the upper middle class who get clobbered by this tax break. The standard deduction does not undo it because you lose the standard exemption. Even if you are just a husband and wife without kids--  Mr.President, I am going to ask unanimous consent that the debate be delayed for a few minutes. I know my colleagues are--well, I just need to finish my remarks. I am almost done.  The benefit of State and local deductibility affects every State, every city, every town, every municipality, and goes deep into the middle class and the working class.  One other point I have to make, now realizing this, some of our Republican colleagues are saying we will modify it. Folks, there is no real way to modify the provision to eliminate State and local deductibility. If you want to give a choice that will not work--because for middle-class taxpayers, it is only the combination of their itemized deductions, such as State, local, mortgage, and others, that make it worth it for them to itemize.  If you have to choose between the mortgage deduction and your property tax deduction, it is a loser. So they say: Well, we will just do this for the very rich. Yet, as I mentioned, that is not where the money is. Where are you going to cap it? It is mostly a middle-class deduction. If you cap it, say, for people whose incomes are above $500,000 or $1 million, you don't bring in much money. So it is a loser. You cannot fix it. Get rid of it. You cannot fix it. The plans that are being done still continue to hurt the middle class dramatically.  The Republican plan to repeal State and local cannot be fixed, modified, or tweaked around the edges. Each of the proposals does not work. It must be scrapped. The State and local deduction affects everyone, even the almost one in five taxpayers in the lowest States where it affects the fewest people. It is just one of the many flaws in this broken, broken framework.  Let's start over. Don't just do a Republican plan that appeals to the handful of very wealthy corporations and very wealthy individuals. Work with us on a fair plan that helps the middle class, not the very wealthy. We are ready, but if you do the same thing that you did on healthcare in trying to do it by yourselves, I think that you will meet with the same fate that the healthcare bill did.  I yield the floor.

214,topic-id,1831,"Mr.President, I understand the administration intends to submit its first request for disaster aid for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands today. It is a good first step, but it is just the start of the financial aid we will need to provide to the American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin  I urge my colleagues to work quickly to add additional and urgent funding for recovery, like community development block grant dollars, just as we did for Texas after Hurricane Harvey, with the understanding that an additional and more comprehensive request for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida, Texas, and the western wildfires will be coming from the administration once the damage assessments are complete.                        Las Vegas Mass Shooting  Mr.President, returning to the events in Las Vegas on Sunday, we cannot let this American tragedy, another in a long line of American tragedies, fall out of our hearts and minds too quickly.  Let us pledge to be there for the families of the 59 Americans who were killed and the over 500 Americans who are still injured and recovering. Seeing the pictures of so many of these beautiful, young people in the prime of life--young, excited about the world, some of them newly married, some of them a little older with young children--breaks your heart. So not just today or this week, but in the weeks and months to come, let us pledge to continue to show our gratitude to those firefighters and cops, the emergency and medical personnel, and all the other first responders who rushed to the scene. Let us pledge to remember the acts of everyday heroism that are a beacon of light in this moment of darkness: the lines to give blood that stretched around the block at 6 a.m., the teachers who went to school the day after the shooting to try and give their students a sense of normalcy. I hope these are the things President Trump highlights in his visit to Las Vegas today.  And one more thing: President Trump has an opportunity to wrench his party out of the grasp of the NRA and get our country and our Congress to start talking about commonsense gun safety reforms. Before President Trump ran for office, he repeatedly supported several sane, rational gun safety measures, including the assault weapons ban and longer waiting periods to purchase a gun. As recently as 2012, President Trump supported President Obama's response to Sandy In the wake of Sandy Hook, President Obama called for action. In the wake of[[Page S6295]]Las Vegas, President Trump should do the same.  We have heard it over and over again: Now is not the time to talk about gun safety because it would politicize the tragedy. My friend the majority leader said no less than three times at his press conference yesterday that it is premature and inappropriate to talk about any legislative solutions to the epidemic of gun violence.  As Martin Luther King said in his letter at the Birmingham Jail, ``not now'' means never. ``Wait'' means never. That is what he said: Wait means never.  The Republicans don't want to talk about it today, tomorrow, next week, next month, or next year. We know why they don't want to talk about it. They know the country is totally against their view. It is not political out in the country. Over 90 percent of Americans support universal background checks. A significant majority of Republicans support them. That is not political, I would say to my friend the majority leader.  It is political for him because he is afraid of the NRA, a powerful lobby that is off to the extreme. It is not political for American people or for They are for it. Over 70 percent of gun owners support background checks for private sales and at gun shows. The only place where this is political is here, and that is because the NRA, the gun manufacturers, and their powerful lobby make these folks afraid--afraid to do the right thing. They know it is the right thing.  The NRA and these lobbies are the swamp the President is talking about. President Trump talks about the swamp, groups of lobbyists who thwart the will of the American people. That is what the NRA does.  So I say to the President, Mr.President, you have an opportunity to buck the NRA, buck the gun lobbyists, buck the swamp, and lead this country in an adult conversation about gun violence. The President can and should bring the parties together--the leaders of this Congress--and let both sides know he is ready to address this issue head-on and talk about sensible, moderate measures of gun safety and, above all, background checks.  The President's visit is an important one today. He should be going. He should seek to provide comfort to the families and express gratitude to our first responders. But he should take it one step further. Call us together, lead this Nation in a debate about rational, moderate gun safety laws. Get us started on the work that so many Americans are desperate for us to do.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, on one final matter, the Republican tax plan, we Democrats have long said that we are willing to work with our Republican colleagues on tax reform, and we laid out our principles early on so that there would be no mistake about them. We wanted tax reform to be deficit neutral. It shouldn't increase the deficit. For every reduction in rate, they ought to close a loophole. We wanted it to go through regular order, not the way healthcare did, not reconciliation, but work with us. You would get a much more sensible product. Most importantly, we didn't want to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent. They are doing great already. God bless them. They don't need any more tax relief. It is the middle class that does. But the framework the GOP released last week violates all three of these commonsense principles, vastly favoring the wealthy over working  I have spoken several times about tax breaks for the rich included in this package--lowering the top rate from 39 to 36 percent, repealing the estate tax, opening up a gaping tax loophole for hedge fund managers, wealthy Wall Street firms, lobbyists, and law firms by lowering the rate on passthroughs so that these rich people would pay only 25 percent on their personal income tax while other people pay a lot more.  This morning, I want to highlight not only how the Republican plan favors the rich but also sticks it to the middle class. This is something that the Acting President pro tempore has brought up.  Just this week we found a bombshell contained within the GOP resolution they are using to pass tax reform. The Republicans plan to cut Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid by more than $1 trillion. It can be a little hard to find, but it is right there in the GOP budget--$473 billion for Medicare, $1 trillion for  If you are an older American, if you have a family in a nursing home or someone in treatment for opioid addiction and you think the GOP plan doesn't affect you, think again. The AARP--not a political organization, it simply represents the interests of the elderly--sent a letter yesterday opposing this Republican plan, the one in the House, and I think we have one in the Senate as well. It is the same group that represented senior citizens and fought the debacle on healthcare that the Republicans proposed.  The Republicans are proposing to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and That is the bombshell this week. That is the nugget that will destroy their whole plan. Americans are so against those kinds of cuts.  Amazingly, it is just like the inverse of the Republican plan on healthcare. In each case, they gut healthcare for Americans who need it most to pay for taxes for Americans who need it the least.  The healthcare plan focused on cuts to Medicaid but snuck in tax cuts for the rich. This plan focuses on tax cuts to the rich and sneaks in cuts to Medicare and  The GOP budget is another page out of the same playbook. The GOP plan contains another punch to the gut of the middle class.  This is what the Acting President pro tempore, I believe, spoke about yesterday.  In the form of the repeal of the State and local deduction--44 million Americans take the State and local deduction. That is one-third of all taxpayers. This is not just a small, rarified group in California or New It is across the country. They get an average of several thousand dollars off their taxes each year. That includes 40 percent of taxpayers making between $50,000 and $75,000 per year and 70 percent of taxpayers earning from $100,000 to $200,000.  This is a middle-class tax deduction worth several thousand dollars a year, and the GOP tax plan yanks it away. Taking it away means double taxation on middle-class families.  For many families, this will not be offset by a larger standard deduction in the GOP plan. Largely due to the elimination of State and local, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 30 percent of those making between $50,000 and $150,000 and 60 percent of those making between $150,000 and $300,000 will see a tax increase with the GOP plan, and that is after doubling the standard deduction. By the way, don't think that it is just a few States; the numbers are astounding across the country, as folks in every State claim this deduction. I say to my dear friend the chairman of the Finance Committee that 35 percent of Utahns take this deduction, 33 percent of Georgians, and 32 percent of  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of how many taxpayers are affected in every State by removing State and local deductibility and how much it will cost them on average.

215,topic-id,616,"I urge my colleagues to look in the Record and see how it affects them. You are fooling yourself if you think that you are not affected by the State and local deductibility.  Of course, if you are a family of four in one of those States, the repeal of State and local could be a killer because, again, you would lose the personal exemption. The larger the family, the greater the loss of exemption.  I want to make one final point on tax reform. This is related to two people whom I know, and I knew one of them before he ever arrived in I have to make this point because what I heard them say over the weekend just turned my stomach. It was astounding. It was awful.  Over the weekend, we heard some pretty extraordinary claims from Republican legislators and Cabinet officials about what the GOP tax plan was all about, but Gary Cohn and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin deserve a special admonition.  Chief White House economic adviser Gary Cohn actually said: ``The wealthy are not getting a tax cut under our plan.'' That is not a surmising of what he said; that is a direct quote. ``The wealthy are not getting a tax cut under our plan.'' Comments like that should make everyone's head spin. According to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent would reap 80 percent of the benefits of the GOP plan. The top 0.1 percent--the folks who make more than $5 million a year--would get a break of more than $1 million a year.  Some might argue, of course, that it will cause economic growth. I do not think that it will, but at least make your real argument. Do not hide it. You know that the American people do not agree with you. That is why you hide it.  Only in Wonderland, where down is up and up is down, could Gary Cohn's comments be believed. It is something like out of the Ministry of Truth from George Orwell's ``1984,'' which would be to cut the top rate by 4 percent and repeal the estate tax--yes, no tax cuts for the wealthy. It is why the Washington Post gave Gary Cohn four Pinocchios for his statement. If they had allowed more Pinocchios on the scale, I am sure he would have gotten them. He earned them, unfortunately.  What about Secretary Mnuchin? His lack of credibility resembles Gary Cohn's. He said that he believes the GOP plan would reduce deficits by $1 trillion. ``We think there will be $2 trillion of growth. So we think this tax plan will cut the deficits by a trillion dollars.'' Mnuchin's claim is fake math at its worst. As was written in the Washington Post, no serious economist, liberal or conservative, believes that a tax cut boosts economic growth so much that the tax cut pays for itself, let alone adds $1 trillion in revenue as Mnuchin claims. Four Pinocchios were given by the Washington I am sure that he too--Steve Mnuchin--would have earned more  Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin claim to be economic experts, and they both used to work at Goldman If they had used this kind of math at Goldman Sachs, they would have been shown the door a long time ago. As I said before, they should know better, and they do know better. They ought to stop deliberately misleading the American people. It demeans them. It demeans the administration.

905,topic-id,960,"Mr.President, first, let me thank my friend from Hawaii for his words.  I will make a statement for the record with regard to Mr.Pai, as I agree with Senator Schatz' vote and will be voting no, but I want to first speak about the horrible situation in Las                        Las Vegas Mass Shooting  Mr.President, there are precious few words for days like this. Last night, as everyone now knows, at a concert in Las Vegas, NV, a gunman opened fire on a crowd of 22,000, killing at least 58 and sending hundreds more to the hospital. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the history of our country.  Our collective hearts, so hardened now by the absurd frequency of these mass shootings, are broken once again. We mourn for the families of the fallen, and we pray with the families of the wounded. We have the deepest gratitude for every first responder, cop, and firefighter who rushed to the scene, as their heroism in the moment of this national tragedy has been an inspiration. Yet today we are filled with shock and horror, with sadness and rage.  The horrific massacre was perpetrated by an American on his fellow Americans and the visitors from every corner of the world, who are the very lifeblood of Las We are left with many questions, the answers to which we will seek in the coming days and weeks.  How did this monster acquire the arsenal that he used to rain down death on a crowd of innocents? Were these guns purchased and compiled legally? What was this person's perverted motive? Was there any history of mental health issues?  What circumstances could lead a man to commit such violence upon his fellow human beings--complete strangers--what twisted reasoning, what demented logic?  There is much more that we do not know than what we do know. Some of the questions that we have today will not have clear answers. Others are, perhaps, beyond our fathoming. Yet some will have answers, and we will have to reckon with the fact that this man was able to assemble an arsenal of military-grade weapons.  As much as we might hope to, we cannot banish evil from the Congress cannot do that, and the President cannot do that. What Congress can do and what Congress must do is to pass laws that keep our citizens safe, and that starts with laws that help prevent guns, especially the most dangerous guns, from falling into the wrong hands.  We will take care of the injured--their bodies and their hearts--and nurse them back to health. We will mourn those lost with all of our collective love and support. We will bind up this new national wound. Then, we will aggressively ferret out the facts, and based on that reality, we will confront--we must confront--the deeply troubling issues that have been raised by this atrocity.          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  Mr.President, our friends and relatives and fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands should know that, even while we mourn and process the incomprehensible events in Las Vegas, we remain laser-focused on the needs of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, and we will continue our advocacy for a more comprehensive, more sure-footed, and better coordinated response to their crisis.  Mr.President, shortly the Senate will vote on the nominee to be Chairman of the FCC, Mr.Ajit  I cannot support this nominee for the office of The FCC is tasked with the critical role of protecting consumers and promoting innovation in the telecommunications and technological fields that are becoming more and more integral to our day-to-day lives. However, over his time at the FCC and particularly in his tenure as Chairman so far, Mr.Pai has established a clear record of favoring big corporations at the expense of consumers, innovators, and small businesses.  He supported congressional attempts to reverse the FCC's 2016 broadband privacy rule, which would have prevented big cable and internet companies from profiting off of personal internet data. Now, internet service providers no longer have to obtain consumer consent before they sell or share sensitive personal data.  Most disturbingly, Chairman Pai is currently attempting to dismantle the open internet order, the net neutrality rules under which millions of consumers currently have access to a free and open internet. Net neutrality has had a huge impact on everyone who uses the internet--on communities of color, on small businesses, on schools, on civic engagement, and on our economy.  Net neutrality is not the only issue where I disagree with Chairman Pai's agenda. In his first 2 weeks on the job, Chairman Pai stopped 9 companies from providing discounted high-speed internet to low-income individuals, and he jammed through nearly a dozen industry-backed actions, including some to begin curtailing net neutrality. The most alarming part: these clandestine moves to clip the public's fundamental right to a free and open internet were done without seeking public comment first.  It is no surprise, therefore, that Chairman Pai would be willing to further undermine the FCC's protection of net neutrality, notwithstanding the views of the nearly 22 million American citizens who have commented in opposition to his net neutrality proposal.  The open internet order is working well as it is and should remain undisturbed. Mr.Pai, however, seems bent on rolling back the open internet on behalf of a few corporate friends, rather than serving the American consumer and the American economy by keeping the current protections in place.  For these reasons, I feel very strongly that I must oppose his nomination; I cannot support this agenda, which I believe imperils consumers and the internet itself.

477,topic-id,352,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, and I thank Chairman Black for her hard work developing this blueprint.  Our Nation's national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. While there are many factors driving our Nation's fiscal health and long-term spending outlook, I am working to address one of those items this year: our Nation's need to dispose of spent nuclear fuel.  In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and enacted a formal nuclear waste management program for the Federal Government and set a 1998 deadline for the Department of Energy to begin to dispose of used fuel. Nuclear utilities signed a contract with DOE requiring this deadline to be met. Unfortunately, the Federal Government did not meet that deadline and has yet to take title to this material.  Since then, the Federal Government has been held liable for not meeting this deadline, and the courts awarded financial damages to utilities due to the breach of contract. The payments resulting from these lawsuits are paid from a specific Department of the Treasury account, known as the judgment fund, a permanent, unlimited fund not subject to budget caps or annual appropriations.  Since 2009, DOE's total liability has escalated from $12 billion to nearly $30 billion, or over $2 billion in total liability for each year of delay. Last year alone, the nuclear waste costs were about one-third of all Federal Government payments due to litigation. Put another way, American taxpayers are paying over $2 million every single day in which we neglect our moral and legal obligation to permanently dispose of spent nuclear fuel.  It is time to get our nuclear waste management program back on track. Bipartisan legislation I introduced, H.3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017, which passed out of the Committee of Energy and Commerce by an overwhelming vote of[[Page H7792]]49-4, would do just that. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to address this budget challenge.  Mr.Chair, I thank Chairman Black again for her leadership and support of this important issue.

183,topic-id,896,"Mr.Speaker, Congress has just approved an FAA extension to fund the agency for 6 months, but our work is not done. We have a responsibility to pass a long-term FAA bill that ensures America remains a leader in aviation.  The status quo means American aviation manufacturing will lose out to competitors in Europe, China, Brazil, and We will lose jobs. It means the drone industry will continue to go overseas for testing and development. That is more lost jobs. The status quo means more delays and lost time for our passengers.  Let me read you a quote: ``The FAA is the only agency of government worse at procurement than the Congress has tried to reform it; it didn't stick. We have got to try something different to get it to be more agile to give us 21st century equipment and software that we need.''  Mr.Speaker, that is not my quote. I am quoting the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure And that, based on what he has said and what we have seen over the last 20 years, that is why it is time to reform the  With my Republican and Democratic colleagues, I have introduced H.2997, the 21st Century AIRR Like all major reforms, there have been false claims made against this bipartisan bill. The false issues I want to address are from general aviation.  My colleagues and I, including Sam Graves, worked with the general aviation community to include everything they have asked for in this bill. Not one of their legislative requests was excluded. In fact, Congressman Graves now supports the bill because of how far we went to address the needs of the GA community. We did so because general aviation is vital to our unique aviation system, and I would never sponsor legislation that harms my own rural community and the GA pilots and the several hundred GA pilots who live within it.  Here is what the general aviation community asked for:  They did not want to pay user fees to use air traffic control services, and they won't. All they have to do is look at page 83 in the bill. The only entity that will be able to change this is Congress, just like it is today.  They did not want any airspace restrictions. This bill prohibits airspace restrictions for the GA, and just look at page 114 to find that. In fact, GA doesn't have that guarantee today. Our bill actually puts that guarantee in law for the first time.  They wanted to fully fund the Airport Improvement I want to fully fund the Airport Improvement Program, in part, because it helps my district and small- and medium-sized airports in rural communities around this country. AIP will be funded the way it has been in the past, and it will be, going forward, by the traveling public.  Currently, AIP funding is flatlined at $3.3 billion a year, but over the course of the bill, we will raise that up to almost $4 billion, and you will find that on page 7 of the bill.  GA wanted parity on the board, and they got it, the ability to nominate two board members. So the board will be balanced. It will include airports, pilots, controllers, commercial passenger carriers, cargo carriers, regional carriers, general aviation, business aviation, plus the government will put two seats on the board.                              {time}  1045  A super majority will choose two independent board members, and then they will choose a  Yet even when faced with these facts in black and white text, opponents of reform still claim these guarantees are not in the bill. Ask a member of the GA community what we can do to get their support, and they will say: ``Nothing.'' They want to keep the status quo.  Unfortunately, a few Washington special interests that represent business jets oppose this commonsense reform. Think about it this way: 850 million passengers will fly commercially every year, and that number will go to a billion over the next 10 years; this bill is real reform that will benefit them at no cost and harm to the business jet aviation; in fact, every person that flies commercially subsidizes business jets using the air traffic control system.  A small number of GA owners, the number is about 500,000, are opposing something that will benefit a billion passengers that will fly annually.  Another thing that was brought up is that we harm the defense of this country. That is absolutely not true. As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, I would never do anything that would harm the defense of this country. And Secretary Mattis and Deputy Secretary of Defense Shanahan have been on the Hill, have written letters supporting our efforts to this fact.  In conclusion, Mr.Speaker, this is not speculation. This reflects the very carefully drafted text of the bill that the House will vote on in the coming days. I encourage Members to read the bill and come to us with questions.

1185,topic-id,1021,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, 44 years ago, the Supreme Court issued its landmark Roe v. Wade decision. It reaffirmed the constitutionally protected right of every woman to safe and legal healthcare, including the right to choose.  When life puts a woman in even the toughest of circumstances, the highest court in the land said the decision that she makes should be hers, free from any interference from the government.  Roe v. Wade is a firewall that women rely on, but with every passing year and every new session of Congress, politicians have tried to chip away at it brick by brick, hoping it will crumble away.  Most politicians are not medical professionals. We shouldn't be meddling in healthcare decisions that should be made between a woman, her doctor, her family, and anyone else that she chooses to include. The American people are tired of politicians who are not doctors, often playing one on television with this medical decision.  This is the only medical procedure that Congress has made an attempt to regulate, the only one, and it says quite plainly: We can't trust women to make a decision; we have to do it for them. The majority tries to direct this over and over again.  The medical professionals whom we should be listening to all oppose this ban. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists call it a part of a legislative agenda that is ``not based on sound science'' and that ``attempt to prescribe how physicians should care for their patients.''  That certainly speaks it loudly.  The American Medical Association said that it ``strongly condemns any interference by the government or other third parties that causes a physician to compromise his or her medical judgment as to what information or treatment is in the best interest of the patient.''  Conservative political groups have also been pushing the bill to try to use it to run up the score in the next election. Why do they do it? Well, the main sponsor of this bill has admitted--and I hope everybody hears this; this is a Congressman from Arizona who sponsors this bill, who admitted the abortion bans are, in his words, good politics--``it will cost some people the election, but it will cost more Democrats the election than it will I am convinced that in very few districts in America someone will lose because they voted'' for this ban. ``And if that is the case, maybe they need a different district anyway,'' whatever that means.  That makes it as plain as day, as far as I am concerned, as to why, year after year, for 40 years, we have been confronted with this.  It is abhorrent to me, and it should be to everyone here, that matters of personal conscience are being reduced to who is up and who is down in the polls.  This bill is dangerous, and it is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court established in Roe v. Wade, and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, that a woman has the unequivocal right to choose abortion care. This is the Constitution of the United States that we all justly revere.  Meanwhile, every Federal court that has reached a decision on bans like this in States has blocked it every time. This includes rulings striking down bans in States like Arizona, Idaho, Arkansas, North  Mr.Speaker, this bill before us is nothing more than the latest attempt by the majority to pass off political posturing as proven science.  Now, after birth, strangely, this body exhibits scarce attention to the well-being of the child, and that is proven by the fact that you cut back on food stamps; Women, Infants, and Children care; daycare; Head Start; one after the other, the same group that couldn't find it in their hearts last Friday to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program before it expired, along with community health services, which again helps children. More than 9 million children in America get their health insurance through the program that expired.  The majority did absolutely nothing after 20 children, 6-year-olds and 7-year-olds, were shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, 5 years ago. And funding, as I said, for both food stamps and the school lunch program is routinely cut.  I don't know anything else to call that but pure hypocrisy: We love it until it is born, and then it is somebody else's problem.[[Page H7688]]  A 3-year-old girl in my district was recently killed by the adults she believed were supposed to take care of her. They abused her so violently that she was bruised from head to toe and was internally hurt. There were adults around, but not a single one helped her.  The Child Protective Services of Monroe County got two reports about abuse and neglect, but the agency was too overworked and stretched too thin to act in time, which is another hypocrisy: We are not going to fund those programs enough so that little children would live. Three years old, and nobody lifted a finger to help this child. They did nothing to save her life.  This is just some of the reality that children face today. All too often, this Congress does absolutely nothing to address it. To truly care about children is to care for them long after they are born.  Now, we have taken up this bill before, and it was a one-house bill, never able to pass the Senate, and I sincerely hope this bill sees that same fate.  When the American people went to the ballot box, they were electing politicians, not somebody to meddle around with their medical needs. It is simply appalling. Just remind yourself that the only procedure that we deal with is the fact of a woman's right to choose, which is protected by the Constitution of the United Enough already.  Mr.Speaker, the majority acts like a group of elected physicians. It has some. They are quiet. It is shameful.

Mr.Speaker, the majority keeps trying to take the women's personal decision and put it in someone else's hands.

They pushed a bill that would allow women to die if an emergency room employee coming to her aid had a ``conscientious objection'' to performing an abortion that would save her life.  Today, they are trying to pass an abortion ban that would put up even more obstacles and prevent women from receiving safe and legal abortion, which is protected by the  The bill before us today strikes at the heart of Roe v.

469,topic-id,379,"Mr.Chairman, the national debt is a staggering $20 trillion. We are handcuffing future generations with what--if we don't take action--will become an unsurmountable fiscal crisis. This budget resolution before us today is a step toward putting our Nation back on a sustainable fiscal path. But even more, it will lead to greater prosperity and opportunity for American families and generations to come.  My own experience as a 17-year-old, I had the good fortune to be able to buy a small construction company from my older brother for $1,000 when I was fresh out of high school. Through a lot of hard work and a dedicated team of individuals, we were able to grow that company, employing over 150 people with family-sustaining jobs, family-sustaining wages.  That is what we call the American There are countless stories like that: the idea that we can begin with little or nothing, work hard, play by the rules, and achieve our dreams.  Unfortunately, in today's economic environment, for many, the American Dream seems out of reach.  Mr.Chair, that is why this budget is so important. Not only will it put us on a sustainable fiscal path, but it lays out the path forward for tax reform that will give American families the opportunity to improve their lives.  Consider a constituent that I spoke to this week. This particular constituent is a single father of 5 in Lancaster He asked me if our tax plan means more money in his paycheck. Now, he makes it work today, but it is difficult for him, and he could use some help. This is exactly the kind of hardworking American we are trying to help with our reforms.  Americans deserve this budget because it lets us pass tax reform to help families like the one I just described. They deserve it because too many Americans today do everything right but still struggle to make ends meet. Americans deserve it because they should have a more honest Federal Tax Code and a simplified filing process that allows them to spend more time with their family, to save for their children's college fund, or to plan for their retirement.  Passing this budget helps to make these things possible, and I strongly urge my colleagues in this Chamber to support it.

1227,topic-id,170,"Mr.Speaker, President Barack Obama, under his executive powers, established the DACA program which temporarily protected immigrants who were brought to the U.as children from potential deportation.  Our Nation made a promise to DREAMers that by coming out of the shadows, following the rules and laws of our great land, they would not be deported to a foreign country that they never knew or barely remembered.  DREAMers came to the United States under no volition of their own as young children, making this country the only home most have ever known. DREAMers have jobs, pay taxes, and contribute to the prosperity of our Nation's economy. Since its implementation, the DACA program has added over 50,000 jobs to our economy. Ninety-three percent of DREAMers are currently employed.  Over the next decade, DACA beneficiaries are projected to contribute $460 billion to our Nation's GDP; $24.6 billion in Medicare and Social Security; and an estimated $2.5 billion annually for State and Federal contributions.

1229,topic-id,203,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New However, on September 5, President Trump announced he would end DACA and look to Congress to develop a legislative solution for DACA recipients.  Well, Congress has a solution. It is H.3440, the Dream We have heard about it from sea to shining sea. The Dream Act would allow DREAMers to earn lawful permanent residence with a pathway to citizenship. It would also give them the opportunity to continue contributing to their communities by encouraging them to pursue higher education, work for at least 3 years, or serve in our United States military.  To qualify under the Dream Act, a person must graduate from high school, pass a background check, demonstrate proficiency in the English language, and not have a felony or any other serious crime that could pose a threat to our country. With the DACA set to expire, now is the time for Congress to act.  We must bring the Dream Act to the floor for a vote because Congress has been silent for too long. DREAMers are doing their jobs.

934,topic-id,742,"Mr.Speaker, I know you have heard the story. Sunday, in Las Vegas, 59 people at a concert were mowed down and more than 500 were wounded.  I know you have heard this story, too: last June, 49 cellphones on the floor of the Pulse Nightclub were ringing and ringing and ringing and were never answered.  What about this story: two years ago, eight students who just wanted to learn and their professor who was there to teach them were mowed down in their classrooms at Umpqua Community  And everyone knows that, nearly 5 years ago, the bodies of 20 elementary school children and 6 teachers lay in Sandy Hook Elementary School in what was then the unthinkable act of horror.  So here we are again with what was once unthinkable becoming mundane.  Mr.Speaker, how have we as a society become so debased, how have we strayed so far from what is right and what is just so that we hardly blink at the massacre of innocents in schools and movie theaters and classrooms and concerts and nightclubs? And it goes on and on and on.  So I ask you today, how many lives must be destroyed before Congress acts? Nine lives in Charleston showed us nine was not enough. Thirteen lives at Columbine showed us that 13 was not enough. Certainly 20 small children killed in their classrooms at Newtown? The 32 lives lost at Virginia Tech? Again, not enough. Forty-nine lives in Orlando? The more than 33,000 Americans killed each year by guns? No, that is not enough.  The fact that more Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields in all our wars since the American Revolution, is that not enough?  Now 59 people have been murdered in Las Vegas and hundreds more are left struggling with injuries, both physical and mental, but the worst part--and believe me, I have trouble picking out the worst part--daily mass shootings have somehow become just ordinary.  The massacre in Las Vegas was the 273rd mass shooting in the United States this year.  Last year, I posted the name and photo of every single victim killed in mass shootings on the walls outside my office. There were 476 shootings, with 597 people killed and 1,734 wounded. Not enough. It is never enough.  That is how I learned about Tamia Sanders, who was 14 years old when she was killed while sitting on her porch next to her mother; about Antonio Hinkle, who was 32 when he was gunned down and killed at a cookout pushing children out of the way of gunfire; and about Willow Short, age two, who survived a heart transplant only to be slaughtered outside and alongside the rest of her family by her own father.  I stand before you filled with rage and sadness to say this has to stop. Moments of silence provide little comfort--frankly, no comfort. It is a show here to somehow suggest that if you make the headlines, we will give you a moment of silence, but for the 476 other mass shootings each year, we are not going to give you a moment of silence.  Do we really lack the courage of conviction? Other industrialized countries have seen no such blood-soaked streets.  By remaining silent, we are not just being cowardly, we are being complicit in these crimes.  Mr.Speaker, we must honor the dead by taking action. Now is the time for a vote, and we know what the vote is on.  Our human instinct is to try to find patterns and make sense out of the most horrific and senseless acts. Whether the shooters are terrorists or domestic abusers or the mentally ill, one pattern is the same: access to deadly weapons that can allow a lone gunman to lay waste to human life on a massive scale must stop.  This is why we must ban assault weapons that have, time and time again, caused mass bloodshed and the attachments that make them into automatic weapons that you can purchase for a mere $50.  Automatic weapons are banned in the United States, machine guns are banned in the United States, but if you can buy a $50 attachment and make it into a machine gun, how have we banned anything?  Let's make sure every gun purchase requires background checks rather than just 60 percent of gun purchases.  Mr.Speaker, it is time to do more than be silent.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7681-2.txt,1890,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

123,topic-id,2215,"Mr.President, we need tax reform that helps small businesses close these tax loopholes that are taking jobs overseas. Instead, we need to create those jobs at home. We need tax reform that puts money in the pockets of middle-class families in Michigan and all across the country, and we need an American budget that shows what we value as  Too often, we think of budgets as sterile numbers on a spreadsheet. In reality, budgets are about people. They are about the middle-class Cass City parents who are sitting down to do their taxes and feeling as if it is they, not the wealthiest 1 percent, who are carrying the heaviest burden. They are about helping small business owners in Pontiac, MI, family farmers in Cadillac, and Michigan companies that are creating good-paying jobs. They are also about ensuring that the most vulnerable among us--our children, senior citizens, people with disabilities--are valued and protected.  We cannot consider a budget without considering people. Will it help middle-class families thrive? Will it help small business owners grow? Will it help protect people who cannot protect themselves? Unfortunately, the Republican budget and tax plan suggest that we do not value people, plain and simple.  There are 47 million Americans who depend on Medicare--seniors and people with disabilities. Yet the budget resolution we will be considering tomorrow in the Budget Committee will cut $473 billion from For the low-income children, parents, seniors in nursing homes, and people with disabilities who depend on Medicaid, in that budget resolution, Medicaid would be cut by $1 trillion.  We just went through this debate twice in efforts to gut healthcare, to gut Medicaid, which would take away healthcare from tens of millions of people. The American people said no, and the Senate said no--twice. Yet we are right back again. Here they go again on the budget resolution, putting forward huge--even bigger--cuts in This time, it is not just Medicaid, it is Medicare, which was not in the last two proposals that we rejected, because they hurt too many people by taking away their healthcare.  Now we have a budget resolution that will be coming to the floor of the I am assuming they will have enough votes. They certainly will not have mine or those of my Democratic colleagues, but if every Republican in committee votes for it, we will have on the floor a budget resolution that will cut Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid by $1 trillion.  Why is that being done? It is being done to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest among us. In fact, 80 percent of the tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent. It would be 80 percent who would receive a cut of about $200,000 a year--a cut. The majority of people in Michigan do not make $200,000 a year, but this would be a tax cut of $200,000 a year, on average. This is not what I was talking about before in our helping small businesses and middle-class families and closing tax loopholes that are taking jobs overseas. This is a straight-up, trickle-down tax cut that has not worked before in creating jobs. It creates a lot of deficits but not jobs, and people in my State are still waiting for it to trickle down to them.  Republicans are asking seniors, people with disabilities, children, and families to give up healthcare in order to fund a huge tax cut for the richest 1 percent, which will cost more than $2 trillion. To me, that sounds like backwards budgeting for sure.  I do not often quote my friend from Kentucky, but Senator Paul was absolutely right yesterday. He tweeted this:       This is a GOP tax plan? Possibly 30 percent of middle-class      families get a tax hike? I hope the final details are better      than this.  I do too. I hope that the final details are a lot better than this if it is going to be something that the people of Michigan will support and benefit from.  Under the Republican plan, a senior citizen in Saginaw, MI, who is making $20,000 a year would get a tax increase; a married couple with two kids and an income of $70,000 in Gaylord, MI, would get a tax increase; and a single mom with three kids in Battle Creek, MI, who works really hard every day in juggling and caring for her kids and who earns $50,000 a year, which never seems to stretch far enough, would actually pay $1,000 more in taxes because, under the plan, if you have more than one child, you will actually see your taxes go up because the personal exemption for each child will be taken away.  Senator Paul is right. This is just plain wrong. I do have to give Republicans credit, though. They keep upping the ante. It wasn't even a week ago when they were trying to take healthcare away from people in Michigan and across the country with a plan that would increase costs and reduce healthcare. Now they are trying to take healthcare away from people who need it most by raising taxes on middle-income families and cutting Medicare, as well as  We do need tax reform. I would like very much to see the code simplified, but any tax proposal needs to meet three basic requirements to get my support. First, tax reform needs to be bipartisan, rather than coming up with this proposal in the budget resolution which, once again, just like healthcare, would be jamming something through on a partisan vote. It needs to be bipartisan. It needs to be thoughtful.  Those of us on the Finance Committee are thoughtful people. We worked for 2 years in bipartisan working groups on each section of the Tax Code, getting ready to have a thoughtful discussion and negotiation on real tax reform that would help small businesses grow--by the way, they are creating a majority of the new jobs--as well as making sure families in America who are struggling would be able to have a simplified Tax Code and a tax cut. So I am all for doing a bipartisan approach, but that is not what is happening here. That is not what will be put into the budget resolution tomorrow, and, unfortunately, it doesn't appear that it is what is going to happen in the Finance  The other reason for wanting to do this in a bipartisan way is that it is the only way to make sure it is permanent. If you use these truncated processes of reconciliation to try to jam something through, it is not permanent. I know from businesses in Michigan, large and small, as well as families, that to be able to plan, they want to see some permanent changes, and doing it this way is not permanent.  Second, tax reform needs to help businesses create jobs right here at home. Over the last year, I visited more than 120 small businesses in Michigan, and I have seen for myself how they are driving my State's economy. I also know how challenging it can be for them to navigate the complex Tax The owner of a small business shouldn't have to spend hours with an accountant instead of with her customers. We can fix that. At the same time, tax reform needs to preserve important incentives for manufacturers that are creating jobs here in Michigan and in our country.  I don't believe we have an economy unless somebody makes something or somebody grows something. We need to make sure that the tax policy that supports capital intensive companies remains intact, and we need to close the gigantic loopholes that incentivize our jobs going overseas.  I have one simple proposal. It is not everything, but it is a symbol of how bad the situation is. I have been trying to get it passed now for over 10 years here, and it keeps getting blocked and filibustered. It is called the Bring Jobs Home It is very simple. The Tax Code right now allows a company moving overseas to write off all their moving costs. So the workers losing their jobs help pay for the move through their taxes. The community pays for the move through their taxes. It makes no sense to do that. My Bring Jobs Home Act would stop that and say that you don't get to write off the costs when you are leaving our country. However, if you want to come back, if you want to bring jobs home, we are happy to let you write off those costs, and we will give you an extra 20 percent tax credit to bring those jobs home. If you want to leave, you are on your own. That is what our Tax Code should say to businesses that are moving our jobs overseas.  The third important measure in tax reform is that it needs to put money in the pockets of hard-working families. Michigan families are working hard every day to make ends meet. For too long, working-class and middle-class[[Page S6281]]families have watched as all of the benefits seem to flow to the wealthiest among us over and over and over. Middle-class families are stretched to the breaking point, and it is time they get a break.  That is what the President originally said. This was going to be a middle-class tax cut. Yet, when we run the numbers, it is just not true. For too many, they are going to see a tax increase. As I said before, 80 percent of the Republican tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. You can even break that down more with 0.1 percent, and it is shocking that those individuals are going to get a million-dollar tax cut.  When you look at the majority of people in Michigan who work hard every day and don't earn $200,000 or more, and you look at the fact that there would be a tax plan brought forward that would actually give a tax cut of $200,000 a year, and someone with three children or four children would actually see their taxes go up--wait a minute--what is wrong with that picture?  Unfortunately, this budget and tax proposal falls short in a number of ways, beyond Medicare and Medicaid cuts and what is happening in terms of families. As I said before, it is far from bipartisan. As with healthcare, Democrats have been locked out of the process. Republicans have been meeting in secret--no Democrats allowed.  The Republicans are having to use this reconciliation process to force something that will not be permanent. There is little reason to believe that this will help American workers. As I indicated before, it will not close loopholes that are taking jobs overseas.  It doesn't benefit hard-working people and working families that are working really hard to make it every year, every week. It does not benefit them.  The Republican budget and tax proposal targets the most vulnerable. It isn't bipartisan. It will not stop offshoring. It will not benefit the middle class. There is one thing that it will do. There is one thing that those who analyze this agree upon. It will explode the deficit. The independent analysis shows that these proposals would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion. So there is $2.4 trillion in lost revenues that would go to increasing the deficit.  Our friends across the aisle scoff at that. These tax cuts, they say, will pay for themselves. Although in our Finance Committee hearing today, when we asked both the Republican and Democratic experts who were testifying, no one said it would pay for the tax cuts--no one.  President Trump said this huge tax cut will be rocket fuel for our economy. But when you look at the 2001 tax cuts, there was no rocket fuel there. In the 2003 tax cuts, there was no rocket fuel there. In 2012, the State of Kansas had tax cuts that almost caused them to have to go to a 4-day school week for children because of the huge deficits. There was no rocket fuel there.  There are two things to remember about rocket fuel. It is unstable, and, if you are not careful, you will get badly burned.  Budgets aren't about numbers; they are about people. They are about middle-class parents wondering why the wealthiest get all the breaks and they get the bill. It is about a small business owner wondering why she can't run a bakery without hiring an accountant. It is about seniors on disability wondering if Medicare and Medicaid will be there for them while they watch the 0.1 percent get tax breaks and there are future generations being stuck with the bill for tax cuts that will not pay for themselves.  Budgets are about people, and this budget fails them. It is time to work together across the aisle to do what is right, to make sure that the budget and tax proposals work for everybody, not just a privileged few, and that they help companies create jobs here at home and focus on policies to benefit our working families.

141,topic-id,516,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona, who I consider a friend and one of the great leaders in the Congress, for leading this Special Order and for bringing this important matter before the  2017 will go down as the worst wildfire season in history. My home State of Utah has definitely felt the effects. In June, the Brian Head fire burned more than 71,000 acres in my It burned for nearly a month, creating more than $36 million in damage. And that doesn't count the millions--indeed tens of millions of dollars it took to fight the fire.  While the fire was burning through my district, I was able to meet with local, State, and Federal leaders to take a tour of the fire and to survey[[Page H7737]]the damage and to try to find a solution. The images I saw as I toured this fire were truly heartbreaking. Dozens of evacuated homes, burned homes, ruined forests, firefighters and volunteers who were working day and night to try to contain the fire, ash-filled lakes.  I took more than an hour in a helicopter to fly around the circumference of this fire. As I was flying around looking down, thinking about, among other things, the wildlife that had been devastated by this fire, I wondered: How long will it take for us to recover from this, for this beautiful landscape to recover?  And I can promise you this, it will not happen in my lifetime.  My family owns a ranch, and almost 70 years ago, we had a similar fire. You can still see the scars from that fire, which is several generations now.  One incident manager told me: ``In 29 years of fighting fires, I have never seen a fire move so fast, burn so quickly and so hot that it could not be controlled or fought head-on.''  You have to wonder: Why is that?  The answer is very unfortunate. It is due to mismanagement.  Current mismanagement--and it is mismanagement--has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease that make for a ripe forest for catastrophic fires. These heavy-handed regulations paralyze forest managers so they can't accomplish the critical tasks that are necessary for proper forest management.  This failure to treat high-risk areas and to remove hazardous buildup has left our land susceptible to fires that grow in size, severity, and cost.  So you have to ask yourself: What is the answer? How do we stop this? How do we stop it from happening again?  And the answer is really quite simple. Federal policies have contributed to recent catastrophic fires, and wildlife management begins with proper land management.  That is why I support Representative Westerman's bipartisan Resilient Federal Forests Act, which allows agencies to do this work so that we can prevent these catastrophic wildfires.  I look forward to the House passing this important legislation. Let us bring back the beauty of our forests. Let us bring back the health of our forests. Let us prevent these catastrophic fires that rage out of control.  I thank Mr.Gosar for bringing this again to the floor.

It is what I refer to as our time to talk about the Alaskan of the  Many watching and on the floor and those who have visited our great State know that Alaskans think it is the most beautiful place in the world. There are natural wonders everywhere. We had a beautiful summer. We have resilient, warm-hearted, fiercely independent but accepting people. We have challenges in Alaska just like the rest of the country, but at the heart of our State are kind, generous people full of different cultures and backgrounds that we celebrate.  Most people don't know this about Anchorage, AK: My hometown is probably the most culturally and ethnically diverse city in the country. We have places of worship all over the city and the State that reflect that great diversity of Alaska and  One of the stalwarts of our faith community for the past 47 years has been Pastor Alonzo Patterson of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, and he is our Alaskan of the week. Every Sunday he fills his church with spirit, joy, and gospel music punctuated by ``amens'' that float through the church, down the street, and work their way into our community and into our hearts. That is what he has been doing for 47 years.

Then, in 1970, he was called to Shiloh, one of the few African-American churches in He designed and rebuilt Shiloh at its current location, and under his leadership, Shiloh's membership, its facilities, and its energy took off.  He has conducted thousands of marriages and baptisms. He has given thousands of eulogies, celebrated graduations and anniversaries, counseled countless couples, people who are grieving, people who are rejoicing, people who are suffering, and he has helped turn that into action--not just for the African-American community but for all people and all races in our community and in our  Pastor Patterson told a reporter:       The church was and always has been a sanctuary in the Black      community. It is the meeting place, the community center, the      focus for support and help, the place you come to be      important, the psychologist for your particular problem, the      time to shout out your frustrations and the only place to be      significant.  He continued:       You could be a Deacon or something in the church where in      the rest of the community you were just another Black person.      The church was for us a panacea for many of the social ills      that existed then and still have relevance.  That is what he talked about. That is his heart and soul, how he saw his church and congregation. Thanks to Pastor Patterson and Shiloh, the city is a more inclusive place for all. He has helped heal those social ills for thousands of our fellow  One of his friends, Celeste Hodge Growden, a member of the church, said:       He and the church have led the way for a lot of things that      have been accomplished here [in Anchorage].

Congratulations to Pastor Patterson for being our Alaskan of the   Mr.President, I would like to say a few words about my Members on the other side of the aisle who are doing something that is just not helping the United States of America right now; that is, obstructing progress with regard to the new administration.   I understand that right now my party is in the majority, and to be honest, I have been someone who thinks we should spend a lot more time here in the Senate, working in the Senate and getting things done. We have a lot of work to do. But I see that people back home can get frustrated with some of the lack of progress, and some of that we can address by spending more time in this body.   Some of the questions that are coming out are about why things aren't getting done. It is a good question. Answers can be complicated, but what it mostly boils down to is that a lot of issues in this body--a lot--rely on consensus. The rules were carefully constructed so that the minority has a say in the legislative process. For the most part, I believe that is a good thing. As a former President once pointed out, we are not a red or blue America; we are the United States of   With that said, the people did elect us to come here and start getting[[Page S6345]]things done. Implicit in their votes for a new President and a new administration was to be able to put people in the Federal Government to work, to focus on growing the economy, and to focus on rebuilding the military after a 25-percent cut over the last 8 years, to focus on better jobs and higher wages.   Throughout history, whether it has been Republicans or Democrats, the minority party has understood this. When a new administration gets elected, they start to put nominees in place, and the Senate takes action. We hold hearings and we have votes to put Senate-confirmed officials in the Federal Government to work. If you don't like the person, you can ask them tough questions in hearings and you can vote against them on the floor of the Senate or in committees. But what we are seeing right now is pure obstruction. On every single nominee, the maximum amount of time is required before there is even a vote. This is something new. This is something different. In fact, the current minority leader said the following words in 2013:        Who in America doesn't think a President, Democrat or      Republican, deserves his or her picks for who should run the      Federal Government agencies?   That was the minority leader in 2013. They were wise words then, but apparently he and his Members have forgotten those words.   I have some facts here on the board. At this point in time, 10 months into President Obama's Presidency in 2009, the Senate had allowed more than 318 nominees to be cast by a simple vote. The Senate only asked for a procedure known as cloture five times. Essentially, President Obama got elected, and the Senate Democrats and Republicans worked to get his team put in place. Yes, the Republicans did that. Certainly, I wasn't here then. They voted against some of these nominees, and that is fine. But what they did was they let them come to the floor for a vote.   In contrast to what I mentioned about President Obama's first year in office, only 100 of President Trump's nominees have been confirmed through voice vote. That is less than one-third of the courtesy given to President Obama 8 years ago. Cloture votes for Trump's nominees have been required for 100 nominees. Remember, I just said there were five for Obama's nominees 8 years ago. There have been 100 for Trump's nominees, and only 63 have been allowed by simple voice vote. What does that mean? It means that each vote requires a 2-day waiting period and then another 30 hours of debate. That is what it means.   The press won't write about it. My friends in the press sitting up here in the Gallery won't write about this. The contrast between the Trump treatment by the Senate and the Obama treatment by the Senate is incredible, and we don't hear a word out of the press on this. And this isn't partisan; this is just hurting the American people. There was an election, and now we need to fill the government with people who can run agencies. With all due respect to my friends on the other side of the aisle, they are not doing it. They are not allowing it.  We had a vote on an Eighth Circuit judge last week. It had to go through cloture. We essentially spent the whole week on this--2 days and 30 hours. The judge passed the Senate by a 95-to-1 vote. It was a 95-to-1 vote. He wasn't controversial at all so what was the point? The point was simply to delay.  Again, here is the difference. Nominations sent to the Senate are about the same. President Obama had more 8 years ago but not too many more. There were 520 versus 443 for President Trump confirmed. At this time during the Obama administration, there were 342. Trump has 163. So that is 66 percent for the Obama nominees 8 years ago and 37 percent for the Trump nominees.  The press will not write about it, but this is a disservice to Americans, whether you are a Democrat or I will just mention a few. We have had nominees, such as the Assistant Secretary for Health in Health and Human It came out of committee several weeks ago. It is sitting on the floor. The Assistant Secretary of Health, it is not a controversial position for the company, but it is an important position. I bet that person is going to finally get passage from the Senate at some point by a big supermajority, but we are delaying it. We are delaying it.  I really would love it if the minority leader would come down, look at the American people, and just say: Here is why we are delaying. Here is why we are delaying. Explain it. They love to do this kind of stuff, procedural ``dark arts,'' thinking people aren't watching. People understand this.  The head of a leading Democratic think tank told the press they intend to hold up and tie up floor time on every single Trump administration nominee. Now, if that happens, if they take the time for every nominee--there are over 1,000 who need Senate confirmation--and they take the entire amount of time they are allowed with cloture and other votes, if they don't extend the courtesy that was extended to President Obama when he was trying to put his team in place, the Trump administration will never have a team in place. It will literally be 4 years.  I hope today the press starts writing about this because the difference here in 8 years is quite remarkable and yet nobody is talking about it; that being that the minority leader and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stop obstructing what every other administration has had in terms of a courtesy, which is, if you win the election, whether you liked it or not, you work with the other side in the U.Senate to get your people in place--Department of Defense officials, Department of Transportation officials, Department of Health officials, Environmental Protection Agency officials. We have to get the country moving again, and the obstruction, which is unprecedented, by the minority leader and unfortunately many of my colleagues on the other side is only harming the American people. It is only harming the progress that the vast majority of Americans want, whether you are a Democrat or a I am hopeful they are finally going to change and start moving forward nominations and letting us vote on them so we have an opportunity to actually get this country moving again.

17,topic-id,1511,"Mr.President, a recent survey reported that 50 percent of people in this country consider themselves living paycheck to paycheck, and one third of these people say they are just $400 away from financial crisis. That is not acceptable.  Unfortunately, after 8 years of economic stagnation under the Obama administration, living paycheck to paycheck is starting to feel like the new normal for most But it doesn't have to be. We have the resources to be the strongest economy in the world. American workers and job creators are as dynamic and creative as ever, and they can get our economy thriving again. In order to get them to do that, we need to clear some obstacles in their path. That starts with reforming our complicated and outdated Tax Code, which has increasingly been strangling our economy.  This month, Republicans in the House and Senate are making comprehensive tax reform one of our top priorities. After weeks of work, last week leaders from the Senate, the House, and the White House unveiled the framework that will guide our final tax reform legislation.  The framework is built around Republicans' five principles for tax reform: first, providing tax relief for the middle class; second, increasing wages, jobs, and economic growth; third, keeping good-paying jobs here at home in America; fourth, increasing American competitiveness in the global economy; and, finally, fifth, simplifying the Tax The framework outlines our plans to provide relief for middle-class families.  First, we will lower rates for hard-working By collapsing the seven income tax brackets to three, we will ensure that working families get[[Page S6273]]to keep more of what they earn. Our plan will also expand the child tax credit and make it available to more families, and our plan doubles the standard deduction, which will provide significant relief for those who need it the most. Under our plan, a family making $24,000 a year will no longer owe any Federal income taxes. All of these measures will provide direct relief to working families.  Just as important for families, however, is the other half of our tax reform plan, which involves creating the kind of economic environment where hard-working Americans can thrive--the kind of environment where Americans have access to good jobs, higher wages, and more opportunities.  Over the past few weeks, I have come to the floor to talk about Republicans' tax reform principles and have highlighted some of the ways our tax reform plan will improve the economic outlook for American families. Last week, I talked about our third principle, reforming our Tax Code to keep those good-paying jobs here at home. This week I would like to spend a few minutes talking about our fourth principle, which is keeping American businesses competitive in the global economy.  In order for individual Americans to thrive economically, we need our businesses to thrive. Thriving businesses create jobs, provide opportunities, and they increase wages and invest in workers. Right now, though, our Tax Code is not helping businesses thrive, and it is making it more difficult for American businesses with an international footprint to compete in the global economy.  Our Nation has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world--at least 10 percentage points higher than the majority of our international competitors. It doesn't take an economist to realize that high tax rates leave businesses with less money to invest, less money to spend on wages, less money to create new jobs, less money to devote to research and development of new products and services, and less money to put back into new property or equipment for those businesses. This situation is compounded when an American business has international competitors that are paying a lot less in taxes than you are. It is no surprise that U.businesses struggling to stay competitive in the global economy don't have a lot of resources to devote to creating new jobs and increasing wages.  On top of our high business tax rates, there is another major problem with our Tax Code that puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage globally--our outdated worldwide tax system.  What does it mean to have a worldwide tax system? It means that American companies pay U.taxes on the profit they make here at home, as well as on part of the profits they make abroad once they bring that money back home to the United The problem with this is that most other major world economies have shifted from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.  In a territorial tax system, taxes are paid on the money earned where it is made and only there. You are not taxed again when you bring money back to your home country. Most American companies' foreign competitors have been operating under a territorial tax system for years. So they pay a lot less taxes on the money they make abroad than American companies pay. That leaves American companies at a disadvantage.  Foreign companies can underbid American companies for new business simply because they don't have to add as much in taxes into the price of their products or services. When foreign companies beat out American companies for new business, it is not just American companies that suffer. It is American workers. That is why a key part of the tax framework that Republicans unveiled last week involves lowering our massive corporate tax rate and transitioning our tax system from a worldwide tax system into a territorial tax system. By making American businesses more competitive in the global economy, we can improve the playing field for American workers.  There are a lot of other things we are going to do to help hard-working families and American workers, from improving the tax situation for small businesses to helping family business owners, farmers, and ranchers like those in my home State of South Dakota by repealing the death tax.  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to complain about our plans to repeal the death tax. They complain that it is not something to really worry about since they claim relatively few estates are expected to actually have to pay the tax. Well, I would like them to come and talk to some of the farmers and ranchers in my State of South Some of these farmers and ranchers are paying tens of thousands of dollars a year in an effort to avoid having their families hit by the estate tax when they die. Why? Because they know that without careful and costly planning, if the Federal Government comes around after their death demanding a staggering 40 percent of their estate, their children won't have the money to pay the government without risking the farm or the ranch.  Farming and ranching is a land-rich but cash-poor business. Farmers and ranchers own valuable land, but they are only earning cash on the crops they grow or the livestock they raise on that land. So while their overall farm or ranch may have a substantial value, the amount of money they have coming in is relatively small and subject to the swings in the market from year to year. Too often, when farmers and ranchers die, the vast portion of their estate is made up of their land, while actual disposable income is a very small part of it. If they don't take measures to avoid having their family hit by the death tax, the family will have no choice but to sell off some or all of their land to pay the government, which means, in many cases, losing the family's farm or ranch. And the same situation faces other types of family-owned businesses across the country where the value of the estate is tied up in that business.  Removing the threat of the death tax for family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches would free up resources that these business owners could invest in their businesses and in our economy instead of on complex estate plans, insurance, and expensive tax professionals.  Before I move on, let me just remind everybody that when we talk about the death tax, we are talking about double and sometimes triple taxation. The money the government is taxing has already been taxed at least once. It boggles the mind that some think that a person's death is justification for taxing his or her income a second or a third time. Death should not be a taxable event. When someone dies, they shouldn't have to see the undertaker and the IRS at the same time.  Our Tax Code is increasingly strangling our economy and placing heavy burdens on hard-working American families. If we want to improve the economic situation of American families, comprehensive tax reform is essential.  Republicans in the House and the Senate are continuing to work on the final draft of the bill that we will take up later this fall. I look forward to passing comprehensive tax reform that will help American families thrive, that will create greater economic growth, better paying jobs, higher wages, and bigger paychecks for American workers.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgS6268-3.txt,1534,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A native of Kansas, Chairman Pai has focused on the expansion of rural broadband and the acceleration of next-generation infrastructure deployment.

I am particularly heartened by Chairman Pai's efforts to treat his fellow Commissioners fairly by instituting the process of sharing documents with other Commissioners before discussing them publicly.

With respect to the thorny issue of internet regulations, I am pleased Chairman Pai has sought to hit the reset button on the 2015 title II order because, as I had previously said, the FCC should do what is necessary to rebalance its regulatory posture under current law.

Rather than prolonging the back-and-forth debate on this issue, I, once again, invite my colleagues to work with me to find a lasting legislative solution that will resolve the dispute over net neutrality once and for all.

First, simplify the Tax Entrepreneurs spend way too much time and way too much money complying with the Tax Code instead of focusing on growing their businesses.  Second, lower the tax rates that our companies and employers pay. That is something that foreign governments around the world, both friends and foes, have already done to attract more jobs, more businesses.  Third, let companies of all sizes write off the cost of their growth-producing investment immediately, this is called expensing, instead of deducting them slowly from the taxes over many years under very complicated depreciation rules.  Fourth, stop punishing our businesses for investing overseas profits by bringing them back home to Move away from the system that double taxes American companies that do business overseas.  These steps will boost economic growth. Growing markets will give entrepreneurs the confidence to risk starting a business, which many won't even do today, as we have seen more and more startups not making it to the starting line.  More startups create more jobs, an average of six new jobs per startup, and more economic growth means continuing to spread that prosperity.  I am happy to report that these recommendations are a large part of our tax reform framework that has just recently been unveiled: simplicity, lower tax rates, expensing, stop double taxing our American businesses that do business abroad, reward investment in America, and boost economic growth.  We need a Tax Code that makes America the best place in the world to do business and grow your business and keep your business.  Our job creators who are corporate taxpayers now face the highest tax rate in the developed world. While other countries aggressively lower their tax rate, Mr.Chair, to attract new businesses, we left our businesses standing still.  Mr.Chair, the tax reform framework would slash our corporate rate from the highest in the world, at 35 percent, to a competitive 20 percent. Instead of the worst, we get much better. In a global economy, that is just not a luxury, that is a necessity.  Our tax reform framework will not only help American companies compete with foreign ones, but also bring capital back to America to invest and grow jobs here at home.  Let's look at how the Tax Code is punishing our small businesses who pay individual taxes as pass-throughs, not just with complex taxes but also high tax rates.  When Main Street businessowners went to sleep on December 31 of 2012, their highest tax rate was 35 percent. When they woke up the following year in January of 2013, Mr.Chair, their top rate spiked to 44.6 percent due to Obama administration policies.  Many on the other side of the aisle will say that most small businesses don't pay the top rate, but taxpayers who do pay the top rate, those small businesses, in many cases, are responsible for much of our economic activity and our employment as pass-through businesses.  Every small business owner dreams of being successful, and the high top rate punishes the very success that we want them to achieve in Adding to the Federal rate, the tax rate, the local rate, many of these small businesses pay over 50 percent in taxes.  The tax reform framework not only slashes rates for American employers but our small businesses as well. The top rate for pass-throughs will be 25 percent.  Another feature of the tax reform framework, Mr.Chair, would allow businesses of all sizes to deduct their business expenses, their investments, immediately through expensing. This would encourage companies to make the kind of investment like buying state-of-the-art equipment that would lead businesses to grow, create more jobs, pay better wages, higher economic growth, and the best part of all, larger paychecks for workers.  Mr.Chair, we have a choice to make. We can turn our backs on the most vulnerable Americans and doom them to more of the same, subpar growth, stagnant wages, more debt, less opportunity, a complex and outdated Tax Code that punishes job creation and investment in America, or I hope we choose a better path forward, a better future for Americans, bigger paychecks, and it starts today with the passing of this budget.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

496,topic-id,523,"Mr.Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.LaHood), who represents the central part of Illinois, and is a new member of the Joint Economic  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of 71, the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. This bill makes necessary and responsible funding determinations by reducing the size and scope of government, cutting Federal spending by $5.4 trillion over 10 years, and balancing the Federal budget in fiscal year 2027.  Given our Nation's more than $20 trillion in debt, it is past time to get serious about our Federal spending so that important programs are able to be sustained long term. In addition, this bill sets the stage for much-needed tax reform. Small businesses and farmers are the bedrock of the American economy. For decades, we have allowed our Tax Code to balloon with loopholes and tax breaks for special interests, hurting our local economies and middle class workers.  That is why it is so crucial that we pass this commonsense budget as the first step in reforming our Nation's outdated Tax Our current system continues to fail small business owners, farmers, and middle class families with its overwhelmingly complex system. That is why over 90 percent of Americans have to pay for help with filing their taxes every year.  Not only does this cost people their hard-earned money, but this also costs us our valuable time. Every year we[[Page H7797]]spend a combined 8.9 billion hours filing our taxes. That is time we could be using to focus on our work and families. For businesses, that is time they could use for expanding and growing our economy.  The solution here is not to defend the status quo, as some on the other side of the aisle continue to do, but to simplify our Tax Code and lower the rates for businesses and the middle class.  Another crucial part of reforming our Tax Code must be the elimination of the death tax, which harms farmers like those in the 18th Congressional District of Family-owned businesses and farms that use their hard-earned dollars to invest back in their businesses are often forced to sell off parts or all in order to pay the death tax.  There is nothing fair about penalizing our job creators and the drivers of our economy for investing in and growing their business. In fact, it is estimated that repealing the death tax would grow our economy by 0.9 percent over 10 years.  These small business investments are often necessary for small businesses and farmers who depend upon expensive machinery to earn their living. Our current Tax Code, however, encourages businessowners to put off their investments as they are only able to deduct the cost of equipment over many years. By allowing full expensing, businesses and farmers can fully invest in the tools they need to become more productive, all the while earning more savings.  According to the Tax Foundation, full expensing would save businesses money, leading to nearly a 5 percent increase in income for low- and middle-income workers.

They have to live within their means, Mr. The Federal Government, for too long, hasn't lived within its means, and this budget is about that. This budget is about tax reform. This budget is about growing our economy. We haven't seen the growth in this recovery that we have seen in others.  Mr.Chairman, I remember when I got my first job at McDonald's.

238,topic-id,784,"Thank you, Mr. I appreciate the opportunity to speak today. Like last week, I didn't plan on speaking on this subject, so my staff is probably wondering once again what their boss is going to say. But I was thinking that maybe we could translate a little bit of what we are trying to do with tax reform, because we talk about tax rates, exemptions, exceptions, and simplification--all this stuff that is important because it gets baked into the bill--but we don't spend a lot of time explaining why we are trying to do what we are doing.  The last time we had real, meaningful, impactful tax reform was back in 1986. That is when Republicans and Democrats came together and decided that the stagnant economy that I grew up in--I graduated from high school in 1978. I didn't immediately go to college. I moved away from home when I was 17 years old, and I was working. It was an economy that was not unlike today's. In many respects, it may have been a little bit worse. The environment was the same. Iran was behaving badly, and Russia was behaving badly. We had sort of the same sort of global environment that we have today. We had the threats that we have to confront every single day, and we had the threat to the future of a generation. I mean, literally, people had no earthly idea, if they were getting an education, whether they would be able to get a job because the job-creation numbers when I was 26 years old were terrible. People were worried about whether they could pay for college.  So why are we doing tax reform? We are doing tax reform because it is time for the American economy to grow back to what it is capable of doing, what it has done in the past.[[Page S6313]]  We need tax reform so we can create economic expansion that lets us pay down our debt, which many people in the military say is the single greatest threat to our national security.  We need tax reform and we need to grow the economy because we owe it to this generation to have the same opportunities that I did.  It can be done, but we have to do it probably through reconciliation because right now, even though many of the proposals that we are putting forward--the tax rate and the kinds of policies we are putting forward have been supported by our colleagues and many of my friends on the other side of the aisle. For some reason, they don't make sense anymore. They made sense back in 1986 when Democrats and Republicans joined together to do tax reform. If you were in your midtwenties then, you saw prosperity unlike anything we have seen right up to today. That was the last time we saw great growth in our economy. We need to get back to providing those same sorts of opportunities.  People will tell you that we are not giving a cut to the little guy or the working man. Well, one thing you don't see when you see the percentage rates that we are talking about on individual tax rates that we are targeting is that there will be tens of thousands of people who will pay zero taxes. There is a actually a zero tax bracket. There are people who, because of the exceptions and exemptions that we are proposing, will actually fall below having a Federal tax liability. We need to talk about that.  We need to recognize that we have to provide relief to the entire spectrum, from the businesses that hire people and create jobs to the working families and the people who don't make enough where we can take any more away from them because they need it to pay their bills. They need to pay their electric bills, their utility bills, their school tuition, and all the other things that working families are struggling to do today, just as I was struggling to do back in 1986.  So I hope this Congress will deliver on the promise we made last year to cut taxes, to get this economy moving again, and to provide the same opportunities for the generation going to school and the people who aren't in school, who are struggling to make a living--the same opportunities that I got when I was that 26-year-old back in 1986. We can do it. I know we can do it because we have done it before. It is a promise we made and a promise we need to keep.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

139,topic-id,513,"Mr.Speaker, I really appreciate the gentleman's efforts to be able to highlight the threat from wildfires that we are having in the  Mr.Speaker, in recent weeks, the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have dominated our news cycles. Our hearts certainly go out to the people who have been impacted as they rebuild their lives and continue to work to ensure that they have the resources they need.  When we hear the term ``natural disaster,'' most of us probably think of hurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes. Unless you come from the Western United States, you probably don't think of wildfires as a natural disaster. But they are, and they have devastating effects.  Wildfire season is a part of life in the West, but this year's fire season is shaping up to be the worst in history. Years of mismanagement of our national forests have led to conditions where fires are burning longer and hotter than ever before.  We need to address this problem on two fronts: one, through better forest management; and, two, by updating wildfire response so it is more in line with the Federal response to other natural disasters.  On the forest management front, we need to give the Forest Service the tools to engage in actual forest management. This means removing the dead and downed timber that serves as a fuel source for either man-made or naturally occurring fires, empowering local foresters and land managers to identify and designate areas of high risk, and supporting collaboration between all levels of government.  These principles are laid out in the Resilient Federal Forests Act by my colleague, Mr.Westerman from I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation.  We must also reform the Federal budgeting process for wildfire prevention and the suppression efforts. For too long, the process the Federal Government has used to allocate money to fight catastrophic wildfires has undermined forest management efforts that could prevent these types of fires from igniting in the first place.  Under current law, if firefighting costs exceed an agency's budget, it must shift money from non-firefighting accounts to make up the difference. Last year, the Forest Service had to transfer $700 million from other budgeted line items to cover firefighting costs, which brought the agency's total firefighting efforts to about 55 percent of the entire budget.  You would think that firefighting wouldn't be the biggest line item in the budget for an agency tasked with maintaining healthy forests. It is critical that we treat wildfires like other natural disasters after an agency's wildfire suppression funds are exhausted. The cost of any extraordinary firefighting that goes beyond the agency's annual budget should be funded through a budget cap adjustment similar to what is used by FEMA for other natural disasters.  It is my hope that we can continue to bring more attention to wildfires that are burning across the West and the impacts they are having on our communities, and also that we can work together to advance policies that better support forest management and fire prevention and suppression efforts and forest health.                              {time}  1915  ",CREC-2017-10-03-pt1-PgH7736.txt,1997,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 36, PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD",2017,3,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

120,topic-id,1309,"Mr.President, I am joined today by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator We thought we would come to the floor together and talk about Senator Domenici, our former colleague who passed away recently.  Pietro Vichi Domenici was born to Italian immigrants in Albuquerque, NM, in 1932. He was a grocer's son. He worked in his parents' store and attended Catholic school. He graduated from our own University of New He pitched in college on the Albuquerque Dukes' farm team, and he taught high school mathematics. He went to law school and built a law practice. He was elected to the U.Senate in 1973 and became New Mexico's longest serving  He was a husband, father, and grandfather. He married Nancy Burke right out of law school, and his beautiful wife of 59 years was key to his long and successful career. She is a good friend of ours, and we spent an hour with her in Albuquerque a little over a week ago. She is still very strong, and she is still very focused, as one would expect as a mother and grandmother of her children and grandchildren.  Pete Domenici was a statesman. He worked across party lines to find pragmatic solutions for the American people. New Mexicans will always remember him as one of the strongest fighters our State will ever know.  Senator Domenici and I belonged to different political parties, and we didn't always agree on things, but I always appreciated that he cared deeply about the issues, and he put the Nation and New Mexico's interests first as he saw them. I join all of New Mexico in thanking him and in mourning his passing.  Senator Domenici's math skills and his beginnings in local government served him well during his 36 years in the U.Anyone who has served in city government knows the importance of a budget. Sitting as chair or ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee for 22 years, he held the Federal Government to the same rigorous, logical standard. He mastered the complexities of the Federal budget and served longer in a leadership position on that committee than any other He was a budget deficit hawk and a realist. He understood that supply-side economics do not work and that big tax cuts will not result in growth leading to a balanced budget. He went up against his own party, and he went up against President Ronald Reagan on the same budget issue.  In the 1990s, he worked with President Clinton to produce a budget surplus for fiscal year 1998--the first surplus in our budget since 1969. His willingness to work with Democrats, his pragmatism, and his stature with his own party made it possible.  On the Budget Committee, he understood how to align New Mexico and national interests.  He recognized the potential of our National Labs--Los Alamos and Sandia--and the potential they had for our He understood their importance to the national interest. He championed their work for decades. Our Labs provide thousands of good jobs in central and northern New Mexico, and the breadth and depth of their research and scientific contributions to our Nation are nothing short of astonishing. Pete Domenici played a critical role in the Labs' developments.  He also had a key appreciation of the importance to New Mexico and the Nation of our military bases. In 2005, Cannon Air Force Base in southern New Mexico was slated to close. This would have cost New Mexico lots of jobs and would have had a devastating impact on the overall economy of the Senator Domenici, along with the entire delegation and Governor Richardson, worked to secure a different and critical mission for Cannon Air Force Today, the 27th Special Operations Wing is going strong at Six thousand men and women are employed, and rural Roosevelt and Curry Counties benefit from the base's $500 million economic impact.  Senator Domenici's fingerprints are not only all over the Budget Committee but are all over the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--which he chaired for 4 years in the early 2000s--and the Indian Affairs Committee, which I am fortunate to sit on today. He helped position the United States to be energy independent through the Energy Policy Acts of 2005 and 2007--the last time we really had bipartisan energy acts. He was a strong advocate on behalf of Tribes, working[[Page S6279]]to advance Indian healthcare and resolve longstanding water rights disputes, protecting Native art from counterfeiting, and improving reservation roads.  My Uncle Mo talked a lot about the importance of being able to disagree without being disagreeable and to work together, if possible. Senator Domenici understood that while the delegation was divided by party, it was united in its love for New He knew that New Mexico would be stronger if everyone worked together. It is partly thanks to him that our delegation continues a tradition of working together regardless of party.  Senator Domenici's commitment to bipartisanship did not end in 2009 with his Senate tenure; he continued to try to find solutions that worked for everyone as a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center in  The Pete Domenici Institute for Public Policy at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces carries on his tradition through scholarship. The Senator said:       It's time for us to join together and take these [partisan]      issues out of politics. The problems we face are so big,      people from both sides need to sit down and say, ``We can't      approach this the normal way.'' Some great leadership is      needed.  We could really use that commitment to bipartisanship in the Senate halls today.  Senator Domenici was in Washington for many years, but he never was out of touch with everyday New Whether it was the acequia repairs in the Espanola Valley, creating a port of entry at Santa Teresa, funding new fighter jets at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, establishing the Petroglyph National Monument, protecting Valles Caldera, forming the Hispanic Cultural Center and Museum in Albuquerque, Pete Domenici identified New Mexico's needs and came up with solutions.  Pete and Nancy had a special passion for people who live with mental illness, borne from his own family's experience. This is an issue that he and I talked a lot about and that our two families shared. He worked across the aisle for many years to achieve parity in insurance coverage between mental healthcare and medical services. Any family who experiences serious mental illness understands that the two should be treated the same and that adequate mental healthcare is absolutely necessary.  In 2008, Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity That Federal law means that millions of persons with mental illness and substance abuse disorders have better access to the care they really need.  Senator Domenici spoke passionately and personally about mental health. He also did so on immigration. His mother originally immigrated to the United States illegally. During World War II, she was taken in a raid aimed at ``Italian sympathizers.'' Those of us who were here during the immigration debates in 2006 remember his plainspoken and moving speech on the floor of the Senate, where he said:       I understand this whole idea of a household with a father      who is American and a mother who is not, but they are living,      working, and getting ahead. I understand that they are just      like every other family in There is nothing      different. They have the same love, same hope, same will and      same aspirations as those of us who were born here have.  I couldn't agree more.  Pete Domenici, my good friend, son of Italian immigrant grocers, a great Senator, a great American, and a great New Mexican, thank you for your remarkable contributions.

696,topic-id,735,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) for yielding. He has done a great job of really making Congress aware and the American public aware of just how important the Jones Act is to our country.  There have been a lot of misconceptions out there, a lot of reports on the news that were just quick to pick up on a sound bite. But the fact of the matter is, when you talk about trade, when you talk about taxes, labor, and other things that you have added, national security, it is the Jones Act that is keeping all of those things going strong in I just really appreciate the gentleman doing that.  When we talk about middle class jobs in this country, there has been a lot of talk in this country about how we have lost a lot of middle class jobs over the last 20 years.                              {time}  1845  These jobs, because of the Jones Act, have been protected, and we need to make sure that we keep those jobs here in America going strong.  I am so glad that the gentleman also cleared up the confusion about what was really going on in relation to Puerto Rico, that American ships were doing what they were supposed to be doing, and that there were other issues on why people weren't getting supplies. The American public needs to know that.  When the gentleman starts talking about minimum wage, middle class wages, obviously, the Merchant Marines, the mariners out there who work on these cargo and container ships, help keep that middle class strong in  One of the reasons why they are able to do that is because many of those jobs related to the Jones Act, as the gentleman knows, are union jobs. The people who run those unions work very hard to make sure people have good wages and that they have good benefits so they can take care of their families and be able to send them to college.  As the gentleman knows, I have talked with the gentleman before, and he heard Representative Boyle earlier, who is also the co-chair of the Blue Collar Caucus, talk about how important these issues are to us, and I know as well as Mr.Garamendi and everyone else within our caucus.  I just want to point this out very briefly. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, unionized workers are compared to their nonunionized counterparts in showing that their wages are 14 percent higher on average. Again, if you have jobs that are paying 14 percent higher on average, we need to protect those jobs because we want people to have more spending power to be able to make our economy strong and great, not less spending power.  The union wage premium is even larger for some demographic groups that, on average, receive lower pay, including workers of color and those without a college education. According[[Page H7734]]to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, unions increase workers' benefits really substantially. Ninety-four percent of union workers have access to retirement benefits while only 65 percent of nonunion workers do.  As the gentleman knows, we discuss Social Security in this Chamber quite often, and how we are going into our retirement years and whether or not we are going to be able to take care of ourselves when we are no longer able to perform certain physical functions is obviously something that is very important.  Union workers are 28 percent more likely to have health insurance and pay a lower share of premiums for it. They are also 54 percent more likely to have a retirement plan than nonunion workers at workplaces. Union women in the United States are more likely to take parental leave, which is also more likely to be paid.  Again, whether it is the Jones Act or Davis-Bacon, we need to make sure that in this country we keep these jobs going strong and that we keep the conversation going in that direction.  Again, I just want to thank the gentleman for the work that he has done to raise awareness on this issue. We need to continue to talk about this just so the American public understands just how important this is to our economy and to our society as we continue to grow our workforce into the 21st century.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding.

146,topic-id,1369,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding and for his leadership on this, and to my other colleagues from the West, who understand what we face, the problems we face, and what has happened to our forests.  I stand united with all of you in the Western Caucus, because this is something we have done some work on in the past and then we have been stalled out, especially in the last 8 years. I know that President Trump stands with us, wanting to pass legislation, get it down to his desk so he can sign it so we can begin to be better stewards of our great public forests, these public forest lands important to all of us.  As we saw painfully this summer, smoke chokes our citizens, it chokes children. Literally, in my district, elementary school children had to be sent home because of the smoke in their schools because of forest fires.  In Oregon, we have seen some of the worst fires in our State's history. It seemed as if every day came with new reports of more fire, more smoke. While this year's fire season has been particularly intense and devastating, images like these are nothing new for Each summer, smoke has filled our skies in Oregon year after year after year. Vast swaths of our land in our beautiful State are charred.  Unlike private forest owners, the State of Oregon, which I am very proud to be a resident of, and our forest policy and tribal lands and county lands, after a fire, they go in and clean it up, they replant, they get a new, healthy, young forest growing, which if you are concerned about reducing carbon emissions, you want healthy trees, because they actually sequester carbon. Burned, dead, decaying old trees actually emit carbon.  So we can do good things for the ecology of our world by planting new trees after a fire. We will talk about that in a minute.  Smoke inhalation has become a health hazard for Oregonians in their communities. I can't tell you how many in my communities, day after day after day, were given warnings by our health authority that the air was too dangerous to breathe, that it was unhealthy to breathe.  A recent study found that wildfires contribute three times as much fine particulate matter into the air as previously thought, and this definitely can cause respiratory problems and make it difficult to breathe, as the citizens of our great State found this summer.  Wildfires also pollute our atmosphere with carbon. In 2002, the Biscuit fire in southwest Oregon burned more than 500,000 acres, half a million acres. The carbon dioxide emitted during that fire amounted to almost one-quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted in the entire State of Oregon this year.  By the way, we have burned 678,000 acres this year in Oregon at a cost of more than $340 million to fight those fires, State, local, and Federal costs, mostly  Tomorrow, the Energy and Commerce Committee, which I chair, will hold a hearing to take a look at the air impact of fires, in part because I have constituents who have seen that, in some cases, fires are not aggressively fought if they are in certain federally designated areas, wilderness areas. There is a temptation, apparently, to not use all our tools, and to instead let them burn. That doesn't take into account what happens to air quality and the health of our citizens when fires are allowed to ravage and burn.  So we will take a look at the issues involving air quality and pollutants emitted into the atmosphere and discuss how better management of our[[Page H7739]]forests could help prevent catastrophic fires and actually protect our airshed and our health.  Each of us today faces a similar situation. Devastating fires ignite across the West as fuel loads build across our public lands--Mr.McClintock did a great job laying that out--while broken Federal forest policy stands in the way of better management, healthier air, protection of our habitat and our watersheds and our streams and our forested communities.  8.2 million acres burned this year. By the way, my colleagues, that is an area larger than Maryland, it is three-and-a-half or so times the size of, I believe, Puerto Rico, which has been wiped out. We talk about the devastation and disaster there and in the Virgin Islands and every other place, but somehow we sort of overlook the fact that we lose this almost every year in our West and in our forested land.  Communities watched their mills close, meanwhile, as Federal policy and lawsuits and litigation has prevented proper management of our forests. So we have lost our jobs, we have lost our infrastructure, we have lost the revenues for our schools, and, in some cases, for basic services like law enforcement.  Now, promises that somehow recreation and outdoor activities would replace those good family-wage jobs, tourism, they are falling short, because guess what, events are being canceled because now the fires are destroying the airshed.  Constituents of mine have been sending photos this year about some of the fires. This one right here is from Mike, who was returning from a hunting trip just a few weeks ago. This was the Eagle Creek fire burning in the scenic Columbia River Gorge area between Cascade Locks and where I live in Hood  We had an evacuation notice within a half a mile of where I live on Rand It was level 1, but they had them higher than that as you got closer to this fire.  Meanwhile, events like Cycle Oregon, its 30th anniversary, canceled because of the smoke; Sisters Folk Festival canceled because of the smoke. Down in Ashland, the Oregon Shakespeare Theater, world-renowned festival, they had to cancel nine of their shows at a cost of $400,000 direct revenue loss, not to mention the concerns they have about indirect loss, people who didn't show up for other performances, and might even affect their annual sales.  People are really tired of this. They expect this Congress to take action to try and protect and become good stewards of our national forest land, but this picture tells you what we faced. The Columbia Gorge, where I grew up right near here, I can't remember a time the freeway was closed as long as it was this summer. We had to go over across the river to Washington to our good friends on Highway 14. All the freeway traffic was diverted there, and there is still one lane here that can't pass, because now we are worried about mudslides and rockslides and trees coming down the hillsides.  We need to get back to positive, active management in our Federal forests.  Five years in a row, the U.House has enacted legislation, sent it over to the Senate, that would give our professional foresters, our scientists, the tools that they clamor for and need to better manage our forests and reduce the overloading of debris, of dead and dying trees, open up these stands to what they should be naturally, get back in balance with nature. Every year this goes over to the other body, and somehow it never comes back. That has to change.  So tonight, I thank my friend from Arizona who organized this. He knows what forest fires are like in My colleague from Washington, my colleague from California, myself, our colleague from Montana, we have dealt with this year after year after year. Now, more than half of the Forest Service budget is spent fighting fire. That is not what we should do as a matter of bad policy.  We need to change Federal policy. We need to let our scientists manage these forests, restore jobs to our forested communities, protect our airsheds, our watersheds, and get back in balance. So I commend my colleagues in the Western Caucus for moving this forward.  I just finished a very positive meeting with the Speaker of the House, who is committed to helping us on this matter. I look forward to us having the opportunity to vote on the Resilient Federal Forests bill and get our Senate colleagues on board as well.

320,topic-id,310,"Mr.Speaker, I really want to thank our Members on both sides of the aisle, and especially the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Burgess) and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Guthrie), who has an identical bill, the House companion bill to this one.  652 revises the Public Health Service Act's expanding access to critical resources for the deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns and young children. It will boost training of healthcare professionals in helping these young parents and ensure that, in turn, they can help educate the patient's family members.  This bill will also deliver relief to parents and caretakers of young children that have hearing loss, granting them important resources to aid in their care.  Again, the Health Subcommittee vice chair, Brett Guthrie, is the author of the House companion.

I am particularly pleased about the potential to harness new and improved data collection systems to improve access.

87,topic-id,512,"Mr.Chairman, $20.2 trillion. Our national debt is more than $20.2 trillion.  Let's put it this way: each American's share of the national debt is $62,000. From the retiree in North Carolina who has already done so much to serve the country, to the newborn child in New York with so much potential, that is $62,000. In fact, it is more than the median American family brings home in an entire year.  Our debt continues to mount, even as Federal reserves reach record highs. This leads to an undeniable conclusion, even from Captain Obvious: the Federal Government has a spending problem.  The growing Federal Government has significant negative consequences for the country and its people. The large Federal debt reduces investment, productivity, and wages, while Federal interventions in the economy reduce the incentive to work, resulting in a shrinking labor market.  The debt can have dangerous implications for our national security, recently causing a bipartisan group of leading national security officials to write that ``our long-term debt is the single greatest threat to our national security.''  Most fundamentally, when the Federal Government is too big and too intrusive, it interferes with our unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Eleven months ago, the American people voted to give Republicans unified control of government. Now it is time to follow through and implement the policy agenda that Congress and the President were elected on.

Instead of a future of high debt and low growth, the RSC budget proposes a positive blueprint for success and opportunity. Our budget focuses on progrowth, profamily policies that will boost America's economy and provide a strong fiscal foundation for generations to come.

He is President Trump's nominee to the Federal Reserve's Vice Chair for He has gone through the revolving door so many times that it is hard to keep up--from a big Wall Street law firm, to the Treasury Department, back to the Wall Street law firm, back, eventually, to the Treasury Department, then to a private equity fund, followed most recently by a trip to another private equity fund. Now Mr.Quarles is ready for another spin through the revolving door.  The Vice Chair for Supervision of the Fed is one of the most important jobs in the government. After the 2008 crisis, Congress put the Fed in charge of supervising the biggest banks. That included banks and other financial institutions that would bring down the whole financial system with them if they went under--the so-called ``too big to fail'' institutions. The Fed is what stands between millions of American families and another economic catastrophe that could rob them of their jobs, their savings, or their homes. After the 2008 crisis, Congress created the Vice Chair for Supervision position to lead efforts to supervise these giant institutions. There is no other position in government that has a more important role in stopping the next financial crisis.  So what kind of supervision and oversight does Mr.Quarles believe in? His motto seems to be, ``Whatever the big banks want, give it to 'em.''  Mr.Quarles has spent more than a decade in private equity and investment management, where he has argued repeatedly for weaker rules for giant banks, including relaxing the rules for stress tests that evaluate banks' soundness, lowering capital and leverage standards, and repealing the Volcker rule.  At his hearing before the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, I showed Mr.Quarles a 124-page list of financial rule rollbacks from a lobbying group for the biggest banks in the country. I asked him to tell me which of those dozens of changes he disagreed with. He couldn't name one--not one.  The 1 thing that we need from a Vice Chair for Supervision is independence from Wall Street--a demonstrated willingness to stand up to the wishes of[[Page S6331]]the big banks and protect the interests of working families. There is not a speck of independence in Mr.Quarles' track record.  Mr.Quarles' time in government also raises red flags. As Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, he was responsible for overseeing financial institutions, markets, and regulations in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Let me say that again. Mr.Quarles was the Treasury official in charge of helping to oversee Wall Street in the years leading up to the crisis. Does anyone want to point out how that worked out?  If Mr.Quarles had wanted to stand up to the banks, he could have found and fixed systemwide problems in the markets before catastrophe struck. Instead, in 2006, when the banks were making gobs of money off of risky bets that eventually crashed the economy, Quarles gave a speech in front of a roomful of bankers and said: ``Fundamentally, the economy is strong, the financial sector is healthy, and our future''--the banks'--``looks bright.'' Less than 2 years later, the entire system exploded and cost Americans, collectively, about $14 trillion.  Make no mistake about it, confirming Mr.Quarles endangers the health of the economy. The last time that Mr.Quarles was in charge, he failed to act to protect the American people from the biggest recession since the Great Depression either because he missed the signs or because he deliberately ignored them. Either way, that makes him the wrong person for the job.  American families deserve a strong leader as the Vice Chair for Supervision of the Fed who will fight hard to keep them safe. Everything we know about Mr.Quarles says that he will be fighting hard for the big banks. I will be voting no on Mr.Quarles' nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.

917,topic-id,1345,"Madam President, I wish to begin by offering my condolences to the victims of the massacre in Las Vegas last night and to their loved ones. I am heartsick for the residents of Las Vegas and everyone around the country who woke up to the horrendous news of last night's attack and who is worried sick about whether their family members, friends, and neighbors are  Thoughts and prayers are good, but they are simply not enough. Thoughts and prayers are not enough when more moms and dads will bury their children this week. Thoughts and prayers are not enough when sons and daughters will be forced to grow up without their parents.  Attacks like the one last night have happened all too often in Enough is enough. We have to have a conversation about how to stop gun violence in America, and we need to have that conversation right now.  Madam President, I want to take some time to discuss the vote we will be taking shortly on the nomination of Ajit Pai to serve as the Chair of the Federal Communications Commission, or the  One thing that last night showed us is the importance of connections. Every day, moms and dads pick up their phones to check in on their kids, students go online to do research on homework assignments, and families sit together to watch the newest hit television show or movie. It is just a fact--media and telecommunications services play a vital role in helping American households connect with their loved ones, communities, and the world around them.  The FCC makes sure those services are available and accessible to all Americans, whether they live in a rural community or in a large city--at least that is what the FCC is supposed to do. There are a lot of powerful companies that want to change that picture, companies that want to change the rules so they can line the pockets of their corporate executives and their wealthy investors. Those powerful companies have launched an all-out assault on every branch of our government with only one goal: to make sure the government works for them and for their buddies. If it leaves everyone else in the dirt, they don't much care.  As powerful companies know, it is good to have friends on the inside, and they have invested a lot of money in making friends. Giant corporations have spent unlimited amounts of money to elect politicians who will promote their views and to flood Congress with lobbyists who will work around the clock to destroy laws and rules that the industry doesn't like and to reshape those laws to suit corporate interests. But electing politicians and inflating Congress with lobbyists isn't enough. Their Republican buddies in Congress can only do so much. Powerful corporations need weak agencies that will not hold them accountable, so they work to fill those agencies with their allies--friends who can undo the rules that giant corporations don't like, friends who will not go after those companies when they throw the rules out the window to make an extra buck.  The FCC is one of the agencies that have been on their hit list for a long time, and now they see their opportunity to execute a corporate takeover of the They started at the top with Ajit Pai, President Trump's pick to chair the  Since his appointment as Chair of the FCC, Chairman Pai has worked at breakneck speed to transform the FCC from an agency that works in the public interest to a big business support group.  Chairman Pai started with net neutrality protections--rules that help keep the internet free and open by preventing giant broadband companies from discriminating against certain internet users and turning the internet into another service that caters to those who can pay top dollar. Like his big broadband buddies, Chairman Pai[[Page S6246]]opposes net neutrality. Once President Trump was elected, Chairman Pai declared that the days of net neutrality protections were numbered, and now he is working hard to reverse those rules.  Chairman Pai has more items on his agenda. He is working to weaken the FCC's Lifeline Program, which helps low-income households across the country pay for phone and broadband service. Chairman Pai has also halted the FCC's efforts to demand some accountability from private prison phone companies that charge sky-high rates to prisoners and their loved ones. Chairman Pai thinks it is just fine for private companies to make it harder for prisoners to stay connected to their families and their communities by charging exorbitant phone fees.  Chairman Pai defends killing these strong, public-centered rules by repeating a version of the same old, tired refrain that we have heard over and over from industry: Government should stay out of the way and let big corporations do as they please because when big corporations make lots of profits, that benefits everyone. Yeah, right. That worn-out theory has been disproved time and time again. Americans know that when government is asleep at the wheel and big companies get to make the rules, those giant companies make out like bandits, while everyone else gets stuck with the bill.  That is not all. When government doesn't do its job, when it fails to protect the public interest, the big guys can grow even larger and more powerful and can translate greater economic power into greater political power, and that is where it gets very scary. Just look at Sinclair Broadcast Sinclair is the largest television station owner in America, and it has made a name for itself by aggressively promoting ultraconservative views. It is infamous for forcing its stations to regularly run rightwing segments, and it melds its radical ideology with a take-no-prisoners profit-making mission, finding more and more creative ways to reduce news coverage and instead promote its sponsors' products.  Being the biggest isn't enough for Sinclair--it wants to become even more powerful, so it has put in a bid to purchase Tribune Broadcasting, another large television station owner. If government regulatories don't stop the merger, Sinclair would have access to over 70 percent of American households. If the alarm bells haven't already gone off, this is where they should start ringing like crazy.  During the Presidential campaign, Sinclair was a huge supporter of then-Candidate It used its power in local television markets to spread slanted, pro-Trump news stories. Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, even bragged about reaching a deal with Sinclair to get more positive news media coverage of  The day before Trump's inauguration, Sinclair's chairman met with Pai--who was then an FCC Commissioner but who was expected to be promoted to Chairman--he met with him to urge him to change the rules so Sinclair can grow even more powerful. When President Trump nominated Pai to chair the FCC, Sinclair got exactly what it wanted: Chairman Pai immediately got to work changing the rules so it would be easier for Sinclair to acquire  Local media is sacred to many It is where we catch up on what is happening in our communities from people who know and care about our communities. A merger between Sinclair and Tribune would allow Sinclair to change that dynamic. With more local programming coming from a centralized source, there would be less information and less diversity of ideas in local reporting. That kind of concentrated power is bad for competition, and it is worse for democracy. Whether the Sinclair agenda is on the political right or the political left, no single, centralized corporation should control access to local programming for so many households.  We need a strong Chair at the FCC, a Chair who understands that the government's role is to work for American families and to hold giant corporations accountable. We do not need a Chair at the FCC who is working for the most powerful communications corporations in this country. That is why I will vote no on the nomination of Chairman Pai to be Chairman of the  Thank you, Madam  I yield the floor.

96,topic-id,502,"Mr.Chairman, I want to state to my colleagues on this budget that there are two fundamental assumptions that are being made that need to be challenged.  One, you are saying that we have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. This country is spending on domestic priorities and defense at a level that existed when the President of the United States was Dwight Eisenhower, and that was before Medicaid and  We have a significant issue about how we are going to meet the needs of the people of this country, both on defense, where we need some help, but definitely on the domestic side as well.  The second assumption that you are making--and it is an assertion that is made over and over again--is that tax cuts will pay for themselves. That is the theology of your budget: tax cuts pay for themselves.  You know, why not go to zero, and we will all be rich?  That is essentially what is being said here. But the tax cuts are always at the high end of the income spectrum, which is exacerbating inequality and creating a problem for us to meet essential needs in this country.  So this question of tax cuts paying for themselves and fiscal responsibility, let's have a little bit of history here. This was the theology of George Bush when he passed the tax cuts when he became They did not pay for themselves. We went from the Clinton-era surpluses to the Bush-era deficits, and in another fiscally, grossly irresponsible move, he put the war on the credit card.  The war was on the credit card. We had unpaid-for tax cuts and we had an unpaid-for war. And this is not just fiscal responsibility; this is governmental, personal, congressional irresponsibility. You have got to pay for things. Whether it is the war or it is food stamps or it is any program that you want to pick, you have got to pay for it.  You don't pay for it by the magic asterisk of saying, ``the tax cuts that we propose,'' when we are going to spend by cutting taxes or going into a war that we don't pay for, $1 trillion, it doesn't work. And that is why we are in this path that is very dangerous with respect to the long-term debt.  I believe in that. We have got to pay our bills. When we had the majority, we had a doctrine that said: Pay as you go.  If any Democrat, the budget chair, or me wanted to propose some spending, we either had to come up with the revenue or we had to cut somewhere else. I believe in that.  But I don't believe in unpaid-for tax cuts paying for themselves. I don't believe that more spending pays for itself[[Page H7861]]and we can just put it on the credit card.  Now, we have got some problems and challenges in this country. We have got an opportunity problem.  The Acting The time of the gentleman has expired.

153,topic-id,1596,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.Gosar) for his leadership in setting up this Special Order on the importance of proper forest management, proper forest management on our Nation's Federal lands. I would also like to thank him for his unwavering support of my bill, H.2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017.  It is my sincere hope that we see H.2936 move off the floor of the House with strong bipartisan support and then move through the Senate and get it on the President's desk so he can sign this and we can start the process of reversing something that has been going on for many years.  As a person educated in forestry, I can tell you that forests grow slowly. We almost don't recognize the change in the forest because it happens so slowly over time. But given enough years, we see what has happened to our timberland out I have a map here of all the forest fires that we have seen out West this summer.  We didn't just get to this point overnight. It happened over a series of years. It happened when, back in the 1990s, I believe, we had an overreaction to probably some forest management practices that weren't the best that they could be. The pendulum swung way too far, and we got in a position where, what I say is, we were loving our trees to death, and we stopped managing our trees.  But we kept putting fires out, and fire is nature's natural way to manage overgrown forests. So what we have seen happen over time is we have seen more insects and disease infestations. As these trees grow closer together and fill the growing space, they start competing for water; they start competing for sunlight; they compete for nutrients; they become weak, and they become susceptible to insect attacks; they become susceptible to disease; and then they die. We get lightning strikes or we get fires to get out, and then we are dealing with a catastrophic event.  But it doesn't have to be this way. If we would employ sound forest management practices, we can do a lot to mitigate the intensity and the number of these fires.  As we look at issues that are created with these fires, we know that this has been the worst fire season on record, but it broke the record that was set in 2015 as the worst fire season on record. I predict that, if we don't start managing our forests now, in the next coming years we are going to see new worst fire seasons on record.  This is a process that will continue to get worse unless we address the problem. It is to the point where it is going to take time to reverse what has happened and to get the forest back into a healthy state.  I was notified this week about a sheep farmer down here in southeast Wyoming, in Torrington, who was a young guy getting into the business, and he lost five sheep. He took them to the veterinarian to do a postmortem analysis and found out they died from smoke inhalation.  Now, the fire that was creating the smoke that was drifting down there was about 800 miles away in If it is causing that kind of health risk to sheep, what is it doing to the residents that live out here? I know that there have been schools closed, there have been people who have to stay indoors, but this creates a health risk. It is more than just a risk to healthy forests. It is a risk to healthy humans.  We have got another map here, and this shows the smoke drift on a particular day. I believe this was September 14. This is a map that was produced by NOAA, and you can see where the fires were, and you can see how the winds carry the smoke. The red shows the most intense areas of smoke, the lighter green the intermediate, and then the darker green shows where the least smoke intensity was.  This map really illustrates how fires in certain areas, the smoke gets picked up by the wind and gets carried to different places across the country.  When I look at this map of the Western United States--and me being from Arkansas, some might ask: How do these fires affect forestry in Arkansas?  Well, we have talked about fire borrowing. When we take money from one account in the Forest Service budget and put it in the firefighting account, that takes money away from management practices that could take place on the forest in Arkansas and other places to the east where we don't have as many catastrophic fires. On top of that, we see how the smoke drift affects many, many parts of the country.  When we think about the smoke, what is that smoke? It is mainly carbon. One of the main purposes of a healthy forest is to fulfill the cycle of photosynthesis, where it pulls carton dioxide out of the atmosphere, takes that in through the leaves, converts it into sugars, and releases oxygen back into the air. The forests clean the air except when they are burning at the rate that they are burning right now, at 8.5 million acres of our Federal timberland that went up in smoke, putting hundreds of millions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere. If we want to talk about taking carbon out of the atmosphere, the solution to that is a healthy forest.  But not only do forests clean the atmosphere, they clean the water. The more ground cover we have, the more water gets filtered as it goes into the ground, as it goes into streams.[[Page H7741]]  But overstocked forests can also prevent water from actually getting into the ground table and getting into streams. In areas in the West where we are having water shortage problems, proper management of forests can help to alleviate those problems.  We are not talking about clear-cutting. I get so tired of people saying, ``All they want to do is clear-cut our Federal forests.'' We don't want to clear-cut the Federal forests. We want to manage them. We want to use practices like thinning from below, where we take out small stock, where we take out the smaller trees. Some of it is merchantable; some of it is not. We can produce timber that can be used in the rural areas where it is grown to help the economies out there.  But the end goal is to have a healthy forest with larger trees spaced further apart without all the fuel ladders going down to the ground so that, when a fire moves through these areas, it burns at a low temperature through the ground. And guess what. That creates great wildlife habitats when we do that.  There are so many benefits of having a healthy forest, and as a forester, a forester who was trained at a school that was started by Gifford Pinchot, who is the father, along with Teddy Roosevelt, of our Federal forests, it is embarrassing to me what has happened to our Federal lands across this country.  Roosevelt and Pinchot talked about conservation. They talked about leaving our resources in better shape than we found them in. Right now, we are not doing that. We are allowing the lack of management to destroy these resources for future generations. We are allowing the lack of management to emit hundreds of millions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere and also take that vegetation away that provides wildlife habitat, that provides a filter for clean water, and that provides timber that is pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.  We can do better than this. We have provisions in the Resilient Federal Forests Act to allow the Forest Service to actually manage the timber. We require them to do a no-management analysis, because when you look at the dynamic nature of a forest, if you say, ``We are not going to do anything,'' well, you just made a management decision.  Again, the trees are living, growing organisms. Even though the Forest Service says, ``We are not managing it,'' they are going to continue to grow. They are going to fill the growing space. If we continue to suppress fire, the fuel load is going to get worse, and we are going to have more and more forests subject to catastrophic wildfire of, I believe it is, 192 million acres of Federal timberland in this country. About 60 million acres right now, according to the Forest Service, is subject to catastrophic wildfire.  It is time to act. We have waited too long, and the problem continues to get worse. It will continue to get more severe as time moves on if we don't start intervening now.  Mr.Gosar, I want to again thank you for putting this together, for the efforts that you are putting forth so that we can take a proactive stance to make not only our air cleaner by not having all these catastrophic wildfires, but to conserve our forests so that they are healthy, so that they are functioning the way that they should be.  I want to thank you again for all that you are doing, the work for the Western Caucus and all the members here, realizing, on both sides of the aisle, how important it is that we do the right thing, that we pass H.2936, and that we start addressing this problem now.

428,topic-id,362,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of the budget resolution, and I commend Chairwoman Black on her leadership and tireless efforts.  Much has been said about our $20 trillion debt, and I would like to add that we know that that debt can only be paid back with tax dollars that will be extracted from future taxpayers.  We debated and passed 12 appropriations bills in this As heated as those debates were, they were on less than one-third of Federal spending. To attack our debt, we have to attack mandatory spending. This budget does that.  As I traveled around my district and talked to people in my district, I have been pleased to hear that business is good. Businesses want to grow, and they want to expand. But I have not been pleased when they told me that they cannot find employees. So I went back and looked at data. Arkansas has our lowest unemployment rate ever right now, but we have also got the lowest labor participation rate.  In the years from 2008 to 2016, we saw a 5.7 percent population growth. We saw a decrease in unemployment from 6 percent down to 4 percent, or 5\1/2\ down to 4 percent, but we had fewer people actually working in 2016 than we had in 2008. We had a decrease of 0.8 percent of people working and a decrease of 2.4 percent of people in the labor force during that time period.  We have to put plans and programs in place to get our economy growing. We have to get more people back to work. During that same time, we saw an increase in SNAP benefits. We saw 330,000 people, or over 14 percent of our State's population of able-bodied, working-age adults, getting their health insurance through Medicaid expansion.  We need to focus on addressing our budget woes. We need an economy that is growing and a labor force that is working. We need a military that is strong.

127,topic-id,2227,"Mr.President, this week on an island nation one-tenth the size of Rhode Island, more than 60 countries will gather at the fourth international Our Ocean Catalyzed by then-Secretary of State John Kerry, the United States hosted the premier international ocean conference in 2014 and 2016. Secretary Kerry's legacy continues with the Malta Conference now going on, hosted by the European Union, and that will be followed by scheduled conferences in Indonesia in 2018 and Norway in 2019.  Nations come to these conferences to share ocean conservation achievements and to pledge future efforts in sustainable fisheries, marine debris prevention, marine protected areas, maritime security, and climate change. At last count, conference organizers in Malta are anticipating more than 150 separate pledges from governments, NGOs, and the private sector. Since Secretary Kerry started it, the Our Ocean Conference has produced hundreds of commitments, totaling nearly $10 billion and protecting nearly 4 million square miles of ocean. Though the oceans cover more than 70 percent of our Earth, they are often taken for granted. Oceans drive our weather, cool our planet, provide food and income for billions of people, and absorb much of our carbon dioxide emissions.  So for my 181st ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I will return to the topic of what we are doing to our oceans. The oceans provide a hard-to-deny reminder of what is happening, thanks to greenhouse gas emissions, climate change denial, and America's legislative paralysis.  Physics and chemistry don't care about fossil fuel industry propaganda. It doesn't affect them at all. Science measures how our carbon pollution continues to drive unprecedented change in the Earth's oceans.  The oceans have absorbed about one-third of all the excess carbon dioxide emitted by human activity since the Industrial Revolution; that is, around 600 gigatons of carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean. The effect of absorbing all that carbon dioxide is chemical, making ocean water more acidic at the fastest rate in 50 million years. Humankind has been on the planet only about 800,000 or so years, so 50 million goes way back.  This acidification is potentially calamitous for the ocean ecosystem. Off Washington, Oregon, and Northern California, 50 percent of pteropods were measured to have ``severe shell damage,'' mostly from acidified sea water. If that species collapses, the bottom falls out of the oceanic food chain, with a cascading effect up to us at the top of the food chain.  Ocean acidification is causing real economic concerns on coasts all around the country. It is affecting Florida's reefs, for instance. Rhode Island's clammers, lobstermen, and aquaculture growers watch with real alarm the damage acidified seas are doing on America's northwest coast. Oyster hatcheries there experienced significant losses when new hatches were unable to grow their shells in the acidified seawater. Those hatcheries now need to buffer ocean water to keep the pH at a survivable level for baby clams, oysters, and other shellfish. Well, you can do that for your aquaculture lab, but you can't do that for the ocean. So it bodes well for the future of these shellfish.  In addition to the CO2 the oceans have absorbed--30 percent of that--they have also absorbed heat. They have absorbed over 90 percent of the excess heat that climate change has trapped in our atmosphere, thanks to the operation of the greenhouse gases we have emitted. The oceans, in doing that, have conferred on us an extraordinary blessing because without their absorbing more than 90 percent of that heat--forget the 2 degrees Centigrade cap that we worry about--we would likely be already more than 36 degrees Centigrade hotter. That isn't just life changing; that is species-changing variation in our planet. When oceans absorb all of this heat, which is equivalent to more than a Hiroshima-style nuclear bomb per second going off, the principle of thermal expansion kicks in. As oceans warm, they expand, and as the world warms from the remaining heat, ice melts. So between the two, sea levels rise.  NOAA, in January, updated global sea level rise estimates based on the latest peer-reviewed scientific literature. Ice sheets and glaciers are melting faster than previously expected, raising global sea level rise estimates in this century--under the ``we do nothing on climate change'' scenario--by around 20 more inches on average.  Apply these findings to the U.coast, and the news gets particularly harsh for the northeast Atlantic coast, including my home State of Rhode Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council is now telling us that we need to plan for as much as 9 to 12 vertical feet of sea level rise by the end of this century. The refusal of the Republican majority to do anything serious about climate change is going to have a big effect on the very map of my  This is the present Upper Narragansett Bay, including Providence up here, our capital city, down to Greenwich Bay down here, and Warwick on the west side. Over here, we have Bristol and Warren on the east side of the image, and it still looks actually very much like it did when early explorers first came to Rhode Island in the 1600s. And it looked very much like that for centuries before, when the Narragansetts and the Wampanoags lived here. But as climate change raises sea levels, all of this is changing rapidly.  The Coastal Resources Management Council has developed something called STORMTOOLS, which is an online simulation to model sea level rise and storm surge, so we can see how rising sea levels will affect my  This is the same image as that one. I will put one over the other so that you can see the match. Everything that is blue is land and is now submerged on these 9-to-12-foot sea level estimates. It all has changed quite dramatically. Warwick Neck breaks off and becomes Warwick Neck Much of the town of Barrington here becomes a new salt lake. This is a bedroom community with a lot of wealthy people living in very nice homes, and it all goes under water. Down here, Bristol and Warren become an island, and off of them, Poppasquash Point becomes two islands. This continues all around the The map changes, and we become a Rhode Island archipelago. Look at Newport, Little Compton, Tiverton, Providence, Jamestown, Point Flooded areas in my State represent billions of dollars in losses to Rhode  Of course, around the visibly flooded areas are the less visible areas where legal setbacks, flood zones, velocity zones, and other building restrictions prevent construction. In those areas that are still above water, it is still unbuildable because the property has become uninsurable, unmortgageable, or unsellable. That is a pretty hard hit to expect my State to take without objection.  It is not just Rhode Island; all sorts of changes are happening along America's coasts. Up in the Gulf of Maine, ocean waters are warming faster than nearly any other place on earth. A study published in Elementa last month found that summer temperatures in the Gulf of Maine last two months longer than in the 1980s. Longer, warmer summers benefit some species, but others get hurt, including what little is left of the iconic cod.  Native villages in Alaska and island communities in Louisiana and Maryland are facing tough decisions about abandoning traditional shorelands and islands and relocating. Around the world, entire nations are planning for relocation as the ocean steadily rises over their island homes.  Layered on top of this sea level rise is the worsening risk of storm surge[[Page S6283]]and flooding from hurricanes and other storms. The Presiding Officer does not need to be told about this. His State has experienced it firsthand.  This satellite image is a snapshot of this particularly destructive 2017 hurricane system. From the left to right, we see Hurricane Katia, Hurricane Irma--at category 5 strength--and Hurricane Jose down here.  As the recovery efforts continue for our citizens in Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, and we look at hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster relief emergency spending, here in Washington we might want to think about helping coastal States around the country get serious about predicting what is coming, shoring up our coastlines, fortifying coastal infrastructure, and preparing for what climate change has in store for us.  Climate change is not the only way we are damaging the oceans. Each year, around 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enters our oceans from land. By 2050, we could see as much plastic in the oceans as fish in the oceans by weight, since plastics do not fully degrade in the ocean. They just break down into smaller and smaller pieces of plastic, and those travel the globe on ocean currents.  Plastic is now everywhere; on our beaches, in our oceans, ingested and entangling our wildlife. It is even in tapwater, salt, and other foods that we humans consume. Plastic waste has been found on remote islands, in deep-sea sediments, and in sea ice.  In an area previously inaccessible to researchers due to that sea ice, the Arctic is apparently releasing frozen plastic back into the oceans. That is how badly we are polluting our oceans. An international research expedition to the North Pole even found chunks of plastic littering that remote region.  Thankfully, there is interest in solving our ocean trash problem in the At last year's Our Ocean Conference, over $1 billion was pledged to combat marine debris. Additional commitments are expected this year. Our Senate Oceans Caucus work parallels work around the world. The Senate Oceans Caucus is a bipartisan group. There are 36 of us. We have made marine debris one of our focus areas.  In August, by unanimous consent, we passed the Save Our Seas Act, a bipartisan bill to reauthorize NOAA's marine debris program and expand its ability to deal with severe marine debris events, where tsunamis or huge storms sweep enormous amounts of plastic garbage into the oceans and then ultimately onto our shores.  The bill asks the President to increase U.international efforts to reduce marine debris, including improving international waste management practices and improving research on plastics that will actually biodegrade in the ocean. It also directs the U.Trade Representative to start considering marine plastic debris--much of which comes from just a few countries--when dealing with them in future trade agreements.  We reinforced this piece of the bill recently in the National Defense Authorization Act, which we passed just last month.  The Save Our Seas Act garnered support from environmental NGOs, from corporations, from chemical trade groups, but there is still much more work to do. We have abused and ignored our oceans for far too long. The oceans are warning us in every way they know how, and we can't afford to ignore those warnings any longer. We must start taking serious action to respond to what we are doing to our oceans. I promise you, anybody who knows anything about oceans hears those alarm bells ringing. It is time for us to wake up.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

I further ask that the cloture vote on the Cissna nomination occur upon disposition of the Quarles nomination, and that if cloture is invoked, all time postcloture be considered expired and the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.  I further ask that following disposition of the Cissna nomination, the Senate resume consideration of the Gingrich nomination, with a vote on cloture at 1:45 p.m. on Thursday; and that if cloture is invoked, the Senate vote on confirmation at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 16.  The PRESIDING Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.

290,topic-id,809,"Mr.Speaker, I have the honor of serving on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I rise today in support of the 21st Century Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization We call it the AIRR Act in the committee.  H.2997 is a unique opportunity in a bipartisan way to do something big together for the American people.  I know we hear that a lot in this Chamber, Mr.Speaker, but so often it seems like it is just out of our reach. That is not the case today.  Under Chairman Shuster's leadership on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr.Speaker, my colleagues and I have worked to craft the kind of bold, forward-thinking reform that America's 21st century aviation system needs. It is in reach today to make that the law of the land.  When we sit together to reauthorize the FAA, Mr.Speaker, it isn't just about attending to the Nation's business of ensuring safety of air travelers across the country. Of course, that is a priority, but it is an opportunity to implement the kind of innovative reforms that we have seen across the globe and that America needs to reestablish itself as the world's aviation leader.                              {time}  1030  We have an opportunity together to deal with a bloated bureaucracy, to reduce taxpayer costs, to improve efficiency all in an industry that is designed to prioritize customer's experience and customer service.  Mr.Speaker, Americans pioneered air travel, and we remain the safest aviation system on the planet. But our own outdated bureaucracy, our own outdated rules are standing in the way of American innovators and making air travel more time consuming, more costly, and safety innovations more difficult.  Mr.Speaker, with this legislation, we have a chance to empower our innovators, to better serve our travelers, and to preserve the world's finest commitment to safety, as we always have.  As is the case, Mr.Speaker, with any heavy lift, with any big task, there are always concerns in keeping America's system safe and the American people safe a highest among those concerns.  Mr.Speaker, what you need to know today is that with the support of General Mattis, with the support of the Department of Defense, the AIRR Act has focused on preserving the primacy of preserving national security in our aviation infrastructure.  Mr.Speaker, the bill has the support of those dedicated public servants at the Pentagon because it has been sensitive to these issues. It maintains the DOD's access and management of airspace. It doesn't allow user fees that are charged to passengers to be passed onto taxpayers through the It leaves intact the President's and the DOD's proper authorities to manage this space.[[Page H7757]]  In addition, it provides unequivocal definitions about the importance of defense to the American people and balances the needs of general aviation with the needs of the Department of The oversight will always remain with the FAA, with the DOT, and with the United States  Mr.Speaker, after we preserve national security, we turn our attentions to the general aviation community. And if you have talked about this bill at all with any of your constituents back home, Mr.Speaker, you heard the concerns of the general aviation community about what it will mean to them to completely reform America's air traffic control system.  Mr.Speaker, we have to balance the role of government oversight and accountability with private innovation. Our bill is designed to empower those innovators but to preserve the protections that GA has today.  Mr.Speaker, I want to refer you to a graphic. You will find it at the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's website. It is transport.house.gov. You can't see it from where you sit, but I have line by line by line the law that we are talking about, the bill that we are talking about, the reforms that we are talking about, and how it protects our friends at the general aviation community.

531,topic-id,762,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate my friend from California for yielding to me. As you know, Mr.Chairman, he is not just down here as the ranking member on the House Budget He is also the leader of the Republican Study Committee's Budget and Spending Task The leadership he has provided in all those areas means a lot to the entire institution. I am grateful to him for it.  I also want to say I am grateful to my friends in the Progressive I disagree with their budget, and I plan to vote against it.  Mr.Chairman, how often do we come down here and folks want to complain about what is not going right, but they don't want to do anything about it?  To my friends' credit in the Progressive Caucus, they laid out a vision, and that is exactly what I came here to Congress to be a part of. Let's lay out our visions. Let's have some votes. Let's count those votes and see where we go from there.  As you know, Mr.Chairman, absolutely any group could offer a budget today, yet we only have four alternatives being considered. That tells[[Page H7823]]you something about how hard it is to put your ideas forward. So I want to thank my friends on the Progressive Caucus for doing that.  I want to run through a couple of things that their budget includes, Mr.It includes a 4 percent pay increase for Federal workers across the board. It includes $500 billion in green energy incentives. It imposes a carbon tax to deal with greenhouse gases. It cuts $70 billion from the Defense Department and, in fact, eliminates altogether the spending on the global war on terror.  Mr.Chairman, these are all legitimate policy disagreements.  Their budget also increases revenues, taxes, by $10 trillion, but spends so much more on American priorities that we continue to end up with almost a $1 trillion annual deficit in year 10.  Mr.Chairman, this is the kind of debate that we have to have. I want to understand the priorities of my friends. I want to understand where they want to see more investments. And then I want to understand how it is we are going to balance this budget together. Because what is lacking in this plan, Mr.Chairman, what frustrates me the most about the Progressive Caucus plan is not the investment in green energy, it is not the investment in the Federal workforce, it is not the investment in healthcare; it is the fact that they don't believe we can do these things while raising taxes by $10 trillion on the American people and balance the budget at all.  Mr.Chairman, if folks want to raise taxes in this institution--I think our problem is a spending problem. I don't think it is a taxing problem, but I am willing to have that discussion with them to understand their point of view.  But the reason I will ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this budget is not because it raises taxes $10 trillion; it is because it raises taxes $10 trillion, yet continues to borrow from our children and our grandchildren in the form of annual debt and deficits.  I think we can do better. But we cannot do better without an honest discussion of the issues, Mr.Say what you want to about the budgets you are going to see on the floor here, these alternatives that we are going to discuss.  There are a lot of talking heads on TV who just want to talk about it and don't want to do anything about it. If you are looking for a ray of hope today, look at the Progressive Caucus, which I disagree with about almost everything as it comes to how to peg the numbers, but they put their vision forward tonight. They said: Let's take a stand tonight.  If we can work together across that aisle, Mr.Chairman, there is absolutely nothing that we cannot do on behalf of the American people.  Vote ``no'' on this budget, but applaud the effort that has gone into it such that we can try to find common ground going forward.  If we have but one thing to agree on in this institution, let it be to agree to pay for those things that we think are important. Whether it is wars or whether it is green energy, whether it is troops or whether it is Federal employees, let us agree that we should pay for those things today with our dollars, and the borrowing from our children and grandchildren should be ended forever.

740,topic-id,2951,"Mr.Speaker, it is going to be a great day. I don't know how your Wednesday has gotten started, but we are now in the throes of budget day.  Budget day only happens on the floor of this House once a year, and it is one of those times where I would tell you the House operates as every man, woman, and child across this country believes the House should operate every day.  I have the great honor as a member of the Rules Committee and as a member of the Budget Committee of bringing this structured rule to the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, 71, the rule that we will be debating for the next hour, makes in order every single budget substitute that was offered in the Rules Now, let me tell you what that means in practical terms.  Over the next 2 days, we are going to hear visions laid out for what the American government should spend, what American policies should look like, what the Federal budget should include.  Over the next 2 days, we are going to hear visions laid out from every single Member or group in this institution that cared enough about this process to craft a budget of their own.  Mr.Speaker, I serve in the Republican Study I was once chairman of the Budget and Spending Task Force on the Republican Study I had the honor of crafting a substitute budget to bring to the floor to offer for my colleagues' consideration.  Over the next 2 days, any Member who has a voice that needs to be heard[[Page H7765]]has had the opportunity. We put out the call last week. My friend from Massachusetts and I, we sit on the Rules Committee, Mr.We send out the call to the membership in advance to say this is what we expect to happen in the Rules Committee, this is what we are going to be considering in the Rules We sent out the call for any Member of this House to craft their substitute amendment, and we received four.  We received one from the Congressional Black Caucus, we received one from the Progressive Caucus, we received one from the Republican Study Committee, and we received one from the Democrats on the Budget Every single one of those has been made in order by the rule that I will ask my colleagues to support today.  We are going to debate those. We are going to vote on those each individually, allowing everybody to have their say. That budget that this House ultimately agrees on collectively, collaboratively after these days of debate, we will then send to the United States Senate for its consideration.  Mr.Speaker, they say that budgets are a reflection of values. I believe that to be true. We are going to have budgets on the floor of the House to consider that cut taxes, budgets that believe that the economy has not grown to its full potential, budgets that believe that the American workforce participation rate is still at historically low levels. We have to get men and women back into the workforce. We have to reward that dignity of work. We have budgets that are going to cut taxes in an effort to stimulate that job growth across this land.  We have other budgets that are concerned that we are not bringing enough revenue into the government coffers. It is true, Mr.I know you are thinking it. We are bringing in more tax revenue today than we have ever brought in in the history of the United States of That is true, but we are still running budget deficits. So we will consider those budgets today that don't necessarily believe that spending is the problem; they think it is tax collection that is the problem.  We will consider budgets that raise taxes by about $2 trillion. We will consider other budgets that raise taxes by about $4 trillion. Mr.Speaker, I think we will even consider budgets that raise taxes by $9 trillion.  Mr.Speaker, there are only two things that can happen in this institution. We either have to raise more revenue, or we have to cut spending, or we have to mortgage our children's future. Three things: raise taxes, cut spending, mortgage our children's future.  Over the next 2 days, we are going to have that debate and we are going to have that discussion.  I know where my constituency lands, Mr.There are tough decisions that have to be made, and they believe they sent men and women to Congress to help make those tough decisions. We sit on the Budget That is what we do.  If you have not gotten a chance to work with her this season, Mr.Speaker, Chairwoman Diane Black on the House Budget Committee, if there is a more patient and more persistent Member of this body, I don't know who that would be. She has worked tirelessly to move this process along, to get us to this point where we are today, trying to bring people together around a unified vision of what we can do and what we should do not just as an institution, but as a nation.  I expect we will have some disagreements over the next 2 days, Mr.It won't surprise me at all. In fact, I think this institution is characterized by the things that we disagree about. Certainly that is what the media would like to focus on. But at the end of this process, what will have to be said is that we have considered every idea, that we have considered every point of view, that we have made room for every voice, and that we have now come together on a common pathway forward. That is what is ahead of us, Mr.Speaker, if we support this rule that we are debating now.  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this rule. I hope you will find that budget that meets your constituency's needs, support that underlying budget, and then let's move a budget to the United States Senate and speak with one voice for the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Woodall) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I obviously rise in strong opposition to this rule. This can be a frustrating place. So frustrating, that sometimes I want to tear the remaining two strands of hair I have on my head out, because what we do here, in my opinion, is not to advance anything that is good for the American people. This is a frustrating place, because what happens on this House floor is either nothing or you guys make things worse.  On Sunday, we once again witnessed a massacre, the worst mass shooting in American history. People across this country are demanding action, but the response of the Republican leadership in this Congress is nothing. We had a moment of silence, but it means nothing because that is all we do. There are no hearings, no debate, no votes, just absolutely nothing.  It is obvious that too many Republicans have been intimidated and have been frightened or have been bought off by the National Rifle It is shameful and, quite frankly, it is disgusting.  If the Republican leadership of this House is not willing to lead, then move aside. Allow us to bring measures to the floor so we can have a vote, so we can have a debate, so we can enact measures that might save some lives.  Mr.Speaker, what we are considering today, this Republican budget, is an example of the majority making things worse for the American people.  Budgets are moral documents. They show what we value and what we care about. And if this budget reflects Republican values, then shame on When you look at the specific programs House Republicans target, it becomes clear just how cruel this budget really is.  Last night, in the Rules Committee, I complained loudly to the distinguished chairwoman of the Budget Committee about the cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program known as SNAP, basically a program that provides poor people food. It helps prevent hunger in this country. In this budget, they call for $164 billion in cuts to this program.  The chairwoman said: Well, I believe that people who get this benefit ought to work.  I pointed out to her last night, and I am going to point out to my colleagues here today, that the majority of people on this program--67 percent of the people who are on this program are not expected to work. Why? Because they are children, because they are senior citizens, because they are disabled.  Of those who can work, the majority work. But you have individuals who are working, who are on SNAP because they earn so little that they still qualify for this program.  So why aren't we demanding that work pay more in this country? Why aren't we coming together to demand an increase in the minimum wage so it is a livable wage, so that people who work don't have to be on public assistance?  Instead, we have yet another attack on poor people in the form of these cuts.  The gentlewoman said: Well, I want to narrow it down to just able-bodied adults without dependents. They all ought to work.                              {time}  1245  Well, many of these people do work, Mr.Speaker, but many of them don't work, for a number of reasons. Many have limited educational experience, with 80 percent having no more than a high school education or a Some are aging out of foster care. Some have underlying mental health issues, difficult histories of substance abuse, or are ex-offenders with nowhere else to turn.  As many as 60,000 of these able-bodied adults without dependents who have qualified for SNAP initially are veterans. These are brave, courageous men and women who have served our country, who have returned home and are having difficulty reintegrating into the community, getting on their feet. Our gratitude for their service is, we[[Page H7766]]are going to throw you off the food benefit? I don't know what people are thinking who drafted this in the budget.  The chairwoman of the Budget Committee said: Well, it is important that we constantly review programs to see if they are working, if they are living up to our expectations. I agree. I am a liberal I want to make sure that whatever programs are in existence are working, are effective. Nobody is for ineffective government.  I happen to sit on the Agriculture Committee, Mr.We have already held 23 oversight hearings on this program--23 on SNAP alone. We have had Republican witnesses, and we have had Democratic witnesses. As my friend from Georgia knows, his party is in control, so Republicans get to have more witnesses than Democrats do. We have had 23 hearings, and not one witness, not one, recommended a $164 billion cut in this program.  In fact, what they recommended, Democrats and Republicans, was that we ought to strengthen wraparound services. That means like you ought to fund fully job training programs so that States can guarantee people a slot in a job training program.  Many argue, Democratic and Republican witnesses, that the benefit is too inadequate, that we need to expand the benefit, because contrary to what you hear oftentimes on this floor about SNAP and about how generous the benefit is and that it is like a gravy train, if you will, the average SNAP benefit is $1.40 per person per meal. That is it. That is the benefit.  That is why when you talk to the heads of food banks all across the country, in every State in this country, they tell you the same thing, that they experience an uptick in people who need to utilize their services in the middle and toward the end of the month because, basically, the benefit is not enough to carry them through the month so they can put enough food on the table for them and their families.  We have 42 million people in the United States of America, the richest country in the history of the world, who are hungry. I am ashamed of that, and I am ashamed because hunger is a political condition.  What I mean by that is we can solve it, but we don't, because for some reason, this population, these people struggling in poverty, never quite rise to the level as the very wealthy in this country.  We have a budget here that not only cuts SNAP but basically cuts a whole bunch of other programs aimed at helping people get out of poverty and helping struggling middle class families.  Basically, this budget, just so everybody is clear, is kind of a blueprint to help pave the way for the Republican tax cut bill that they are going to produce on this floor in the not-too-distant future.  It was interesting last night in the Rules Committee, we heard people talk about, well, we have to make tough choices because we don't want to saddle our children and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren with debt. Well, if, in fact, my Republican friends get their wish and pass this tax cut, we are told that it will add about $2.4 trillion to our debt.  The deal is this, Mr.One of the faults in their budget is they have these assumptions that we all know are not true. Like, for example, the Affordable Care Act is going to kind of mysteriously just disappear, and they are going to be able to cut Medicaid by close to $1 trillion to help offset the cost of their tax cut. But the last time I checked, their repeal barely passed this House, and it can't seem to get anywhere in the United States Their assumptions are fantasy. They are not based on reality.  Mr.Speaker, it is not just food assistance that this budget dismantles. It cuts half a trillion dollars in Medicare and ends the Medicare guarantee. It rips apart the Affordable Care Act, drastically raising healthcare costs for older and low-income adults, and kicks another 20 million people off their health insurance if they get their wish here. It makes higher education more expensive. It cuts veterans' benefits. It reduces our commitment to ensuring that our neighbors have access to affordable housing. It even sticks the American taxpayer with a $1.6 billion bill to begin constructing a costly and stupid and ineffective wall along the U.southern border with  In case people are scratching their heads, during the campaign, Donald Trump said that Mexico was going to pay for the wall. I guess he didn't mean it because a downpayment was put into their budget.  I could go on and on and on, but you might ask yourself, Mr.Speaker: Who wins? The answer is simple. If this budget goes through, and they pave the way for their tax cut, it is clear who the winners are: Donald Trump, the Trump family, and all of his wealthy friends. While all these cuts in the budget come from our safety net programs, infrastructure investments, and programs that help middle and working class families, none of the savings in this budget--that is right, not one penny--come from closing tax loopholes that benefit big corporations or the wealthy.  As I said before, the drastic cuts are all being used to try to finance this massive tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthiest in this country. Give me a break.  Mr.Speaker, it is galling how indifferent that so many in this House seem to be to those who are struggling in poverty. America's most vulnerable, granted they don't have super PACs, they don't have big lobbyists, their voice in Washington is supposed to be us. The whole purpose of government, in my view, is to make sure that everybody gets a fair shake, and the people who need government the most are the people who are struggling in poverty.  But to listen to my colleagues and to look at this budget that they put together, it is clear that the poorest Americans in this country are being treated as if they don't exist, as if they are invisible, as if they don't matter. I just find that deeply offensive.  President Kennedy said it this way. He said: ``If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.'' It is frustrating. It is just frustrating that here we are with this budget which devastates so much of what I think is important.  If we implemented what this budget asks us to do, this country would become a tale of two cities, and it is already getting to that point. It would truly become a tale of two cities. It would create a government without a conscience, and I think we need to push back and we need to reject that.  Mr.Speaker, this isn't some Ayn Rand fantasy where we can just mess with the numbers and see what happens. We are talking about real people here--people who are counting on us; people who need help. This budget fails by any measure, in my opinion, to be a budget even for Republicans to support.  I think America's hardworking middle class families and all those working to struggle to get in the middle class deserve a heck of a lot better than this.  Mr.Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this rule and certainly vote against this cruel Republican budget, and I reserve the balance of my time.

741,topic-id,6268,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, you heard the passion of my friend from Massachusetts, and I have had an opportunity to work with him on the Rules Committee for 7 years now. I can tell you that every bit of that passion is sincere.  So often I think folks turn on C-SPAN, they look at a group of politicians talking, and they think it is all for the cameras and it is all for show. I will tell you that while I sometimes have that same suspicion when I turn on a program of folks I don't know, with folks I do know, I can tell you that that passion is sincere.  What I can also tell you is that many of those concerns are misguided, and I think that is important. What happens here in this institution matters. Our ability to have that debate with one another matters. The truth is, as you know, Mr.Speaker, most of that debate doesn't happen here on the House floor.  My friend from Massachusetts and I are here today because it is time to vote. We are here to bring the rule, we are here to bring the substitutes, we are here over the next 2 days to vote. The conversation has gone on not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, but for the better part of this year on what the budget is going to look like.  I happen to have a copy of the budget report right here, Mr.It captures all the votes we have taken. It[[Page H7767]]captures all the debates we have had. It captures what the intent of the institution is.  Now again, we are going to have a choice of which budget we want to support. If you think taxes are too low, you can vote to raise taxes. If you think taxes are much too low, you can vote to raise taxes a whole lot. If you think the tax code as it exists today is a ridiculous compilation of confusing provisions stitched together by a patchwork of Congresses over the last 40 years, you can vote for fundamental reform.  If you are tired of the fact that America used to be number one in the world in terms of tax competitiveness and now we are at the bottom of the list and you want to take America back to being number one, you can vote for that, too. I happen to put myself in that category.  I want to read, if I may, Mr.Speaker, from the budget report. The fact is, I can't. I imagined myself a younger man when I grabbed that report.  If I can now read from the budget report. ``The resolution's reconciliation instructions,'' that is what is in the budget, Mr.That is what allows us to take a tax package from the House to the You have heard about how the Senate is having a tough time getting anything done because it requires a supermajority. It requires 60 votes. Through reconciliation, you can get things done with less than 60 votes. That is how the Affordable Care Act was passed, with less than 60 votes. You can get the tax bill passed with less than 60 votes.  It says this. ``The resolution's reconciliation instructions that the Committee on Ways and Means will develop will be a deficit-neutral tax reform legislation and report such legislative language to the Committee on the Budget.'' Deficit neutral. Nobody wants to blow a hole in the budget, Mr. What the discussion is, is can we do better than today's tax code? Candidly, Mr.Speaker, if any Member of this body wants to take the position that we can't do any better, the IRS is as good as it can be in implementing the American Tax Code today, the Tax Code that is twice as long as the Bible is absolutely as concise and succinct as it can possibly be, those Americans who spend dozens of hours, even dozens of days, even dozens of weeks trying to put together their taxes, that is just the best we can do.  Mr.Speaker, I have seen it happen. Sometimes folks throw their hands up and think: We can't do any better. Not me. Not today.  We can all agree that we can do better than what we are doing today. Passage of this budget gives us that opportunity.  You heard my friend from Massachusetts speak from the heart, Mr.Speaker, about the ability we have as a government to care for one another. I would tell you that responsibility isn't uniquely a government responsibility. I would say it is a faith responsibility, it is a family responsibility, it is a community responsibility. It is a responsibility that begins at home. It doesn't begin here, it begins at home, but it is a sincere responsibility, and it is one that we want to do better at every day.  I am sure you are aware, Mr.Speaker, the labor force participation rate in America is the lowest it has been since the President from my great State of Georgia, Jimmy Carter, was in office. The labor force participation rate. There is not one of us in this body who can drive down the street without seeing a ``help wanted'' sign. There is not one of us in this body who can go out to a business without seeing someone asking folks to come in and help, yet fewer Americans are working today than ever before. Why? It is a hard question.  Fewer Americans are working today than since the 1970s. Why? It is important that we ask that question.  The budget is not designed to answer it. The budget can't answer it. I sit on the Budget I don't have the jurisdiction to answer it, but I know this: you will find in this budget a discussion of whether it is better to support people in poverty or lift folks out of poverty.                              {time}  1300  It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. I would tell you that we can support people until we can lift them up, but that lifting them up must be our goal. Supporting them is not enough.  You will find it here, Mr.Speaker, in these pages. This is a vision document. This is what we are gathered together to do today, and we will have legitimate disagreements about when we are doing enough in a particular area and when we are doing too much.  There are those in this body, Mr.Speaker, who believe passionately in education. I am one of those people. I come from a district with amazing school systems.  You can go to any public school in my district, Mr.Speaker, if you work hard and apply yourself. I don't care what your background is, I don't care where your family is from, I don't care what you have stacked against you; if you work hard and apply yourself in our public schools, you can be anything you want to be.  I know everybody wants that for their constituency back home; and I have colleagues who believe that only Washington, D.C., is successful enough, has a track record of success strong enough to implement that vision back home.  I don't come from that camp. I see a lot of failure come out of Washington, D.I see a lot of bureaucracy come out of Washington, D.I see success come out of parents and teachers and principals back home raising taxes, supporting those institutions, making sure every child has a chance. We do that together as a community.  The discussion that we might have in this institution, Mr.Speaker, is not: Do you believe in education?  It is: Do you believe educators in Washington, D.C., have the best answers, or educators back home in your district have the answers?  The truth is that we don't have many educators in Washington, D.We have bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., who oversee educators. I side with my educators back home. It is a legitimate disagreement that we are welcome to have.  What can't be said, though, Mr.Speaker, is that there are any disagreements over these next few days that we are not going to be allowed to have. I have said it before, and I will say it again because it makes me so proud. We don't always have time or make room for all the voices in this institution, Mr.You know, sometimes we pick and choose winners and losers, whose voice is going to be heard. Not today. Any Member of Congress could submit their budget to the United States House of Representatives Committee on  It is a hard thing to produce a budget. I told you I have done it before, Mr.It takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of commitment. But if you believe that you have a better idea, you can do it. And if you did it, we made it in order in the Rules Committee last night and we are going to debate it on the floor and we are going to vote on it on the floor.  We can't always say that every single idea, every single substitute is going to make it to the floor for a vote. We can say that today. I am proud that we can.  It is not going to stop the disagreements, Mr.Speaker, but what it is going to do is air those disagreements; what it is going to do is allow us to talk about our differing visions; and what it is going to do is allow us to come together on a common vision at the end of the day.  I hope my colleagues will support this rule so we can begin that process, and I hope my colleagues will support the underlying budget of their choice.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in opposition to the Republican budget.                                       United States Conference of                                             Catholic Bishops,                                  Washington, DC, August 31, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: As Congress proceeds with the 2018      budget process, the United States Conference of Catholic      Bishops (USCCB) reaffirms that the federal budget is a moral      document with profound implications for the common good of      our nation and world. The budget requires difficult decisions      that ought to be guided by moral criteria that protect human      life and dignity, give central importance to ``the least of      these'' (Matthew 25), and promote the welfare of workers and      families who struggle to live in dignity.       The Catholic Church teaches that it is the role of the      state to promote the three pillars[[Page H7768]]     of the common good. In May 2017, we outlined these three      pillars: respect for the fundamental and inalienable rights      of the human person, promotion of human development, and      defense of peace. Our Conference has long supported the goal      of reducing future unsustainable deficits that would harm all      citizens, especially those who are poor. However, a just      framework for sound fiscal policy cannot rely almost      exclusively on disproportionate cuts in essential services to      poor and vulnerable persons.       Sharp increases in defense and immigration enforcement      spending, coupled with simultaneous and severe reductions to      non-defense discretionary spending, particularly to many      domestic and international programs that assist the most      vulnerable, are profoundly troubling. The House Budget      Committee's 71 proposes increasing defense      spending by $929 billion over the next decade, which is $72      billion above sequester levels. This is coupled with a      proposal to cut $4.4 trillion over the same period from      domestic and international programs that assist the most      vulnerable, potentially impacting health care safety net      programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and CHIP, as well as food      security programs like The proposal would also reduce      current funding levels for environmental stewardship by $824      million.       Such deep cuts would harm people facing dire circumstances,      and would place the environment and natural resources at      risk. When the impact of other potential legislative      proposals, including the proposed reduction of spending on      health care by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next      decade and implementation of tax policies that would offer      trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy over the same      period are considered, the prospects for vulnerable people      become even bleaker.       Our nation should elevate diplomacy, along with      humanitarian and international development assistance, as      primary tools for promoting lasting peace, regional stability      and human rights. The USCCB urges Congress to reject      71's proposed fiscal year 2018 budget authority level of      $41.521 billion for the International Affairs functions of      government. This would represent a $10 billion cut from this      year's appropriations for those functions. Although the USCCB      does not support every individual International Affairs      account, it has repeatedly called for robust diplomatic      efforts to end longstanding conflicts in a range of      countries, including Syria and Iraq, as well as for robust      funding for refugee and humanitarian assistance. It is hard      to reconcile the need for diplomacy, political solutions, and      life-saving humanitarian and development assistance with cuts      to the State Department budget of the magnitude proposed by      71.       At the same time, 71 anticipates dramatic      increases in immigration enforcement spending. We fear that      such increases could pave the way for enactment of many of      the destructive proposals contained in recently released      budget plans, including increases in immigrant detention      beds, the construction of a wall along the entire border      between the United States and Mexico, and the expansion of      agreements with state and local governments that threaten      local law enforcement's ability to foster trusting      relationships with immigrants in their jurisdictions. Any      changes to the tax code called for through reconciliation      should include a provision to empower the educational choices      of families. The reconciliation process should not be used to      achieve savings through cutting health care, nutrition,      income security, or other anti-poverty programs. This budget      attempts to use the reconciliation process to fast-track over      $200 billion in cuts to anti-poverty programs over the next      ten years, including Medicaid and The bishops have      devoted their efforts to addressing the morally problematic      features of health care reform while insuring that all people      have access to health care coverage.       The human consequences of budget choices are clear to us as      pastors. Our Catholic community defends the unborn and the      undocumented, feeds the hungry, shelters the homeless,      educates the young, and cares for the sick, both at home and      abroad. We help mothers facing challenging situations of      pregnancy, poor families rising above crushing poverty,      refugees fleeing conflict and persecution, and communities      devastated by wars, natural disasters and famines. In much of      this work, we are partners with government. Our combined      resources allow us to reach further and help more. Our      institutions are present in every state and throughout the      world, serving some of the most marginalized communities and      enjoying the trust of local populations.       The moral measure of the federal budget is how well it      promotes the common good of all, especially the most      vulnerable whose voices are too often missing in these      debates. The Catholic Bishops of the United States stand      ready to work with leaders of both parties for a federal      budget that reduces future deficits, protects poor and      vulnerable people, and advances peace and the common good.           Sincerely yours,     His Eminence Timothy Cardinal Dolan,       Archbishop of New York, Chairman, Committee on Pro-Life          Most Oscar Cantu,       Bishop of Las Cruces, Chairman, Committee on International      Justice and     Most Christopher Coyne,       Bishop of Burlington, Chairman, Committee on          Most Frank Dewane,       Bishop of Venice, Chairman, Committee on Domestic Justice      and Human     Most George Murry, SJ,       Bishop of Youngstown, Chairman, Committee on Catholic          Most Joe Vasquez,       Bishop of Austin, Chairman, Committee on  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Coalition on Human Needs against the Republican budget.                                     Coalition on Human Needs,                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the Coalition on Human      Needs, I strongly urge you to vote no on 71, the      proposed FY 2018 Budget Resolution, and to vote for the      substitute budgets advanced by the Congressional Progressive      Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus, and the Democratic      alternative budget resolution.       The Coalition on Human Needs is an alliance made up of      human service providers, faith organizations, policy experts,      labor, civil rights, and other advocates for meeting the      needs of low-income and vulnerable people. Our members      understand that the economic security of millions of American      families depends on building on the progress we've made in      health coverage, jobs, basic living standards, and ensuring      that our children are well-prepared for productive lives. But      the majority's proposed budget does not build--it breaks      apart our engines of progress. It will make our nation weaker      for decades to come.       The most recent survey data on poverty in the U.shows      the biggest two-year decline since the late 1960's.      Refundable tax credits for working families, SNAP/food stamps      and housing subsidies have lifted multi-millions of people      out of poverty. The decline in the proportion of our      population without health insurance continued its decline in      2016, down to 8.8 percent. More people are working, and in      general, low- and moderate-income households have finally      started to make income gains.       The budget advanced by the House Budget Committee would be      a dangerous backwards plunge, stripping trillions of dollars      from programs that work to reduce poverty and create security      and opportunity. Medicaid, Medicare, working family tax      credits, nutrition assistance, education and housing      assistance: these are just some of the services the budget      would massively cut. The budget takes trillions in funding      that supports economic security and progress and hands it to      the wealthy and corporations in the form of enormous tax      cuts.       The primary goal of 71 is to allow huge tax      cuts to be enacted with only a simple majority in the      These tax cuts are claimed to be a critical element in      increasing economic growth enough to make the tax cuts      deficit neutral. Reputable economists are skeptical that the      proposed tax cuts would boost the economy to the 2.6 percent      average growth projected in the budget and acknowledge that      tax cuts to corporations and the rich deepen the deficit.      History supports this: the economy grew and unemployment      declined more during the Clinton tax increase years than      during the Bush era tax cuts. And the Kansas experience with      tax cuts is cautionary: revenues plummeted, with the tax take      in 2016 $570 million lower than in 2013, even after counting      increases enacted in sales and cigarette taxes. The economic      growth that did occur from cutting taxes was estimated to      bring in about $30 million, leaving the state very deeply in      the hole. The state legislature has recently reversed course,      unwilling to slash education budgets as much as the revenue      hole would have forced. They saw that they were weakening      their state. Congress should not inflict the same dangerous      lesson on the entire nation.       We urge you to reject 71 because of its      central choice: paying for tax cuts that overwhelmingly favor      the rich and corporations with cuts to essential services.      Our nation faces major challenges: reducing disproportionate      poverty among children and helping children and young adults      to advance in education so they can meet the challenges in      our economic future, protecting seniors in their retirement,      and rebuilding communities. Both the emergency needs of      communities devastated by natural disasters and the similarly      urgent threats from opioids and other epidemics, decaying      infrastructure and inadequate public health and consumer      protections demand a vigorous federal response. Instead of      making these investments, the House budget would cripple the      federal capacity to respond by slashing domestic      appropriations by 44 percent compared with FY 2010 levels      over the next decade and making similarly extreme cuts in[[Page H7769]]     health care, nutrition, income assistance for seniors, people      with disabilities, and working families. In addition to      trillions of dollars in cuts and structural constraints to      basic mandatory programs, the budget would fast-track $203      billion in cuts to domestic programs over the next ten years      through reconciliation rules. Cuts like these would      recklessly weaken us; they are self-inflicted wounds.       The proposed tax cuts will worsen inequality and reward      businesses that park their income offshore. Instead, Congress      should insist that corporations and the rich pay their fair      share. Please vote against weakening America, and instead      protect and expand investments as called for in the budgets      proposed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus,      Congressional Black Caucus, and the House Budget Committee      Democrats' substitute. These three constructive alternatives      deserve your yes vote.           Sincerely yours,                                                Deborah Weinstein,                                               Executive  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to all Members of Congress from the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda against this Republican budget.                                                 National Hispanic                                            Leadership Agenda,                                                    July 26, 2017.     Re NHLA opposition to House Budget     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Hispanic      Leadership Agenda (NHLA), the coalition of the nation's 45      preeminent Latino advocacy organizations, we are writing to      express our deep concerns with the budget resolution that      recently passed out of the House Budget Committee and urge      you to vote against passage of the resolution if it comes to      the House floor. The resolution threatens the basic living      standards of tens of millions of Americans in order to      subsidize tax cuts for the wealthy. From education and      scientific research to basic assistance and health programs,      the House budget would cut $4.4 trillion from entitlement      programs and $1.3 trillion from non-defense discretionary      programs over the next decade, crippling the most important      drivers of our nation's economic engine--working families.      For these reasons, and those detailed further below, NHLA      will consider any votes on the budget resolution for      inclusion in future NHLA scorecards evaluating the support of      Members of Congress for the Latino community.       Budget resolutions serve as fiscal blueprints that signal      the priorities of government spending to support all      Americans in their attainment of the American However,      rather than seek to bolster opportunities for American      working families, the House budget places the burden of      reducing our deficit squarely on the backs of families      struggling to make ends meet in order to give tax breaks to      wealthy corporations and individuals. Rather than investing      in America's future homebuyers, workers, and students, both      the House budget and President Trump's budget undermine the      progress our country has made and prioritize corporate      interests over those of hardworking American families.       The trillions of dollars of cuts in the House budget would      have a catastrophic impact on the millions of Latinos who      struggle to put food on their tables and a roof over their      heads. Recent research by UnidosUS (formerly NCLR) provides      evidence of the strong impact of federal assistance programs      on lifting millions of Latinos, especially children, out of      poverty. In 2015, for example:       Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) lifted about 2 7 million      Latinos out of poverty, including 1.4 million children.       Child Tax Credit (CTC) lifted an estimated 981,000 Latinos      out of poverty, including 560,000 children.       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) lifted an      estimated 1.3 million Latinos out of poverty, including      640,000 children.       Rental assistance lifted about 720,000 Latinos out of      poverty, including 270,000 children.       Supplemental Security Income (SSI) lifted an estimated      630,000 Latinos out of poverty, including 140,000 children.       The House budget resolution would threaten the      effectiveness of many of these programs. The budget plan also      calls for cuts to Medicaid and other health programs more      severe than the House-passed bill to repeal the Affordable      Care       Further, the House budget resolution dismantles consumer      and worker protections, jeopardizing the ability of Latino      and all working families to build and maintain wealth. The      budget plan not only guts the Consumer Financial Protection      Bureau--the only agency whose sole mission is to protect      Americans from predatory practices in the financial      marketplace--but also undermines our nation's workforce,      cutting funding for the Wage and House Division in the      Department of Labor more deeply than proposed in the Trump      budget. Additionally, Latino workers cannot afford cuts to      the Environmental Protection Agency, which protects our human      health and environment from toxic chemicals. Working families      need more and better enforcement of consumer financial and      labor protection laws to protect Americans from abuse, and      also ensure law-abiding financial service providers, as well      as employers, are not harmed by unfair competition by      unscrupulous actors.       Simply put, the House budget resolution would harm American      families and workers, especially Latinos, making our nation      more inequitable and less prepared for economic challenges.      We strongly urge Members of Congress to oppose the House      budget plan and instead support a budget that defends the      interests of the American public and prudently spends      taxpayer dollars.           Sincerely,     Hector Sanchez Barba,       Chair, NHLA, Executive Director, Labor Council for Latin      American Advancement (LCLAA).     Bruce Goldstein,       Co-Chair, NHLA Economic Empowerment and Labor Committee,      President, Farmworker     Eric Rodriguez,       Co-Chair, NHLA Economic Empowerment and Labor Committee,      Vice President,  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the AARP, the Main Street Alliance, and the League of Conservation Voters, all in strong opposition to the Republican budget.                                                         AARP,                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of over 38 million      members and other Americans who are age 50 and older, AARP is      writing to communicate our views as you consider      71, the House Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal      Year 2018. As the process moves forward, AARP urges you to      support Social Security, Medicare, and other key programs      that millions of Americans depend upon for their health and      financial security and oppose proposals that would hurt older                           Medicare and Social Security       Our members count on Social Security and Medicare and      believe they should be protected and strengthened for today's      seniors and future generations. Proposals creating a defined      contribution premium-support program; restricting access by      raising the age of eligibility; or allowing hospitals and      providers to arbitrarily charge consumers higher prices than      Medicare can make health care unaffordable for older      These proposals do little to actually lower the      cost of health care, but simply shift costs from Medicare      onto individuals--many of whom cannot afford to pay more for      their care. We urge you not to include attempts to cut      Medicare benefits or increase beneficiary costs in the      upcoming budget proposal.       The typical senior, with an annual income of around $25,000      and already spending one out of every six dollars on health      care, counts on Social Security for the majority of their      income, and on Medicare for access to affordable health      coverage. We will continue to oppose changes to current law      that cut benefits, increase costs, or reduce the ability of      these critical programs to deliver on their benefit promises.      We urge you to continue to do so as well.           Medicaid, Long-Term Services and Supports and SNAP       Medicaid serves as a critical safety net for millions of      people in every state, including over 17 million poor elderly      and children and adults with disabilities, who rely on vital      Medicaid health and long-term care services. Efforts to      reduce or cap Medicaid funding could endanger the health,      safety, and care of millions of individuals who depend on the      essential services provided through this program.      Furthermore, caps could result in significant cost-shifts to      state governments unable to shoulder the costs of care      without sufficient federal support. Instead of arbitrary      caps, proposals should focus on efforts to improve Medicaid,      such as encouraging more individuals to receive services in      their homes and communities rather than costly institutional      care.       SNAP plays a vital role in feeding millions of hungry      Americans, including over four million older      Proposals to block grant the program, or impose work      requirements will make SNAP less responsive and accessible in      times of need; and without clear work requirement exemptions      for the elderly and disabled, would bar these individuals      from receiving SNAP benefits.       We ask you to reject the cuts proposed in 71.      We stand ready to work with you to develop proposals that      protect and improve Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and                Sincerely,     Jo Ann Jenkins,       Chief Executive     Joyce Rogers,       SVP Government Affairs,                                  ____                                         Main Street Alliance,                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2017.     Re 71, Fiscal Year 2018 Budget     Members of the House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representatives: Main Street Alliance, a network of      small business owners[[Page H7770]]     throughout the country, strongly urges you to oppose      71, the Fiscal Year 2018 Budget This budget,      if enacted into law, would cut $3.4 trillion from Medicaid,      Medicare, Social Security, education, employment and      training, food and housing assistance, and infrastructure      spending over the next 10 years. This will significantly harm      small business owners and their employees, damage local      economies, and decimate state budgets.       Millions of small business owners, their employees, and      their families rely on Medicaid and Medicare for access to      healthcare critical to their survival. The House Budget      Resolution would strip them of their health coverage. The      proposed budget would slash $1.5 trillion from Medicaid and      other health programs, and gut Medicare by $500 billion,      transforming both from systems in which beneficiaries are      guaranteed certain levels of coverage, to a capped amount per      enrollee. Work requirements would also be imposed on      This puts 69 million Medicaid recipients and 57      million Medicare beneficiaries at risk for a loss in      services, including millions of small business owners and      their employees.       Healthcare, education, food, and housing costs would      skyrocket under the House Budget, devastating local economies      and small businesses that depend on consumer demand from    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 customers in their communities. In addition to the deep cuts      to healthcare, the budget would cut $150 billion from the      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which enables      nearly 22 million families to put food on the table, and      eliminate $90 billion from education, training, employment,      and social services programs, significantly scaling back Pell      Grants, which help nearly 8 million students afford college.      These draconian spending cuts would force vulnerable and      working families to pay more for vital programs, resulting in      a reduction in their disposal income and the amount of money      they can spend on goods and services. Small business owners      would see a decline in customers.       The House budget cuts would siphon trillions of dollars out      of state economies from 2018 to 2027. Because the block grant      funding scheme provides a fixed amount of Medicaid and      Medicare funding for states each year, the proposal would      also leave states on the hook for any and all unexpected      healthcare costs from recessions, natural disasters, public      health emergencies, or prescription drug price spikes, and      unaccounted costs like the aging of the population. The deep      reductions in federal healthcare, education, employment and      training, food and housing assistance, and infrastructure      spending would force states to make up the difference,      drastically cutting the quality of services offered. As state      budgets contract, employment would decrease and small      businesses would decline.       The impact of the House Budget Resolution on small      businesses will be felt in the loss of vital services,      reduced business, and contracted state budgets. We urge you      to protect Main Street small businesses owners, working      families, communities, and economies, and oppose the House      Budget Reject any budget that enables tax cuts      for the very wealthy and large profitable corporations to      lose revenue, since it will force deep cuts in vital programs      that harm small business.

Re Oppose FY18 House Budget     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: The League of Conservation Voters      (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national      priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National      Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of      members of Congress on environmental legislation. The      Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters      nationwide, and the media.       LCV urges you to vote NO on 71. This budget      resolution includes a huge giveaway to oil and gas companies      by paving the way for drilling in the Arctic National      Wildlife Refuge, one of America's most iconic landscapes. It      threatens environmental and public health safeguards,      provides tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, and      slashes programs and protections that benefit communities      across the country, among other harmful provisions.       The House budget resolution puts some of our most iconic      landscapes at risk. It contains reconciliation instructions      that aim to open up the pristine Arctic National Wildlife      Refuge and possibly other public lands and waters to      drilling. The Arctic Refuge is one of the largest remaining      intact ecosystems in the world. It has sustained the Gwich'in      people for centuries and is home to an incredible array of      wildlife, including caribou, wolves, polar bears, and nearly      200 species of migratory birds. We have a moral obligation to      protect this natural treasure and to transition to a clean      energy future.       Following in the footsteps of the Trump administration's      unconscionable budget proposal, the House Republican      leadership's budget resolution would make dangerous cuts to      programs that benefit the most vulnerable in our society      while benefitting polluters. Included in the resolution are      provisions that will lead to trillions of dollars of cuts to      health care and programs that provide basic living standards      for struggling families, as well as other substantial cuts.      Meanwhile, it would account for $1.6 billion of federal funds      to pay for a xenophobic and environmentally harmful border      wall. Rather than investing in safeguards for clean air and      water, protections for our national parks and other public      lands that drive our outdoor recreation economy, and growing      clean energy industries, this budget sells out those      priorities to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and      billionaires and for gifts to corporate special interests.       We urge you to REJECT 71 and will strongly      consider including the vote on this bill in the 2017                Sincerely,                                                   Gene Karpinski,                                                         Mr.Mr.Speaker, I just want to make sure that it is clear that, certainly on the Democratic side, we are very much dedicated to trying to lift people out of poverty. That is one of the reasons why we oppose this Republican budget that cuts $211 million from financial aid programs to help people be able to get additional higher education. That is one of the reasons why we have complained loudly about the inadequate funding for job training. You want people to train for employment, you need to make sure that those slots are available so that people can get the training and the assistance they need.  The gentleman says: Don't worry about the debt because the reconciliation instructions will instruct the Ways and Means Committee to do a deficit neutral tax plan.  Well, I mean, there is lots of stuff in here that are assumptions that aren't true, like, you repealed the Affordable Care That didn't happen and it is not going to happen.  And what we are told from the Tax Policy Center and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, according to their analysis, is that what the Republicans are proposing in terms of their tax plan will basically cost well over $2 trillion, and that will be added to our debt.  So I don't--we can debate fantasyland if we want, but the reality is the reality, and this budget is a bad deal for everybody.  Mr.Speaker, this week, our Nation witnessed the deadliest mass shooting in history. We have endured horrific mass killings in Newtown, San Bernardino, Orlando, and now Las Vegas, among many others, all without any congressional action. The killings happen every single day on our streets, at public events, and even in our homes.  Mr.Speaker, my heart broke when the children of Sandy Hook were killed, and I remain absolutely stunned that this Congress has done nothing about it, nothing.  Now 59 people lost their lives in Las Vegas during what was supposed to be a celebratory event, a concert, and this is only 16 months after the last deadly mass shooting in Gun violence in this country is out of control, and all we have done is cater to the gun lobby.  The United States Congress is a legislative body, Mr.We are not a think tank or a church or a synagogue. Thoughts and prayers are not what this country expects from us, and it is not what it needs from us. The people of this country need us to act, to pass laws that protect their lives and their children's lives.  As my colleague in the Senate, Senator Chris Murphy, has said: ``This must stop. It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend that there aren't any public policy responses to this epidemic. There are. And the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with legislative indifference.''  For this reason, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Mr.Thompson's bill,367, which I am a cosponsor of, which would establish the Select Committee on Gun Violence  Mr.Speaker, let me explain what I mean when I say ``defeat the previous question.'' We are here debating which bills will come to the House floor this week, the agenda for the House of The majority chose to consider their misguided budget. We can do that.[[Page H7771]]  But what I am saying is that we should also take the first step in at least setting up a committee to look at gun violence in So if we say no to ending debate on this rule, by defeating the previous question, we can then debate whether or not to create this committee. This is the least we can do.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker," I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.Thompson) to discuss our proposal.

742,topic-id,3404,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  If you have not tuned in to this debate until just these past few minutes, you might not know that this is the budget debate today. We have been prepping for the budget debate today for about 10 months now, and we are ready today not just with one budget, but with a variety of budget choices. And what is wonderful about this process is it has been such an open process.  You can come down to the House floor and air absolutely any idea that is on your mind. That has not just been true today, Mr.Speaker, but that has been true throughout this entire budget process. In fact, I have a letter signed by literally hundreds of groups that support not just voting on the rule to bring the budget to the floor, but groups that support passing the budget as we passed it out of the House Budget  Now, if my colleagues have any concerns about that, I hope they will come and knock on my door, Mr.Speaker, because I promise you that one of these groups is going to be from their part of the country.  Certainly, in Georgia, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce is on that list. So our folks back home are supportive. If you are from Alabama, I have got Alabamans on here. If you are from Baton Rouge, I have got Baton If you are from Battle Creek, I have Battle Creek, because what we are working on here isn't a Republican budget, Mr.                             {time}  1315  What we are working on isn't a regional budget. What we are working on here is the national budget for the United States of America that can be transformational for absolutely every citizen in absolutely every corner of this country.  We have that opportunity. I think we are going to seize that opportunity, but we can't do it until we move this rule to get to the underlying bills. I encourage my colleagues to do that.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I include in the Record letters from the UAW, the SEIU, The National Treasury Employees Union, AFSCME, the American Federation of Government Employees, and         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &            Agricultural Implement Workers of America-UAW,                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.       Dear Representative:  On behalf of the International Union,      United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement      Workers of America (UAW), I am writing to strongly urge you      to oppose 71, the House Fiscal Year (FY) 2018      budget resolution. The federal budget is a moral document as      well as a fiscal blueprint, and 71 fails      spectacularly on both fronts. This draconian budget would be      a disaster for our economy, the middle class and our most      vulnerable citizens.       The proposed budget forces working people and retirees to      pay for enormous tax cuts to the wealthy. Despite claims to      the contrary, by 2027, roughly 30 percent of households      earning between $50,000 and $150,000 would see an increase in      their taxes. 71 cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicare      and Medicaid and ends the programs as we know them. Medicaid      and Medicare are literal lifelines for many of our most      vulnerable citizens--especially children and the elderly.      Medicaid is the largest provider of nursing home and long-     term care.       This radical piece of legislation creates fast-track      procedures to implement the tax cuts that will overwhelmingly      benefit the wealthy and multinational corporations. The      average tax cut for millionaires would be $230,000 a year by      2027. It eliminates the estate tax, which currently only      applies to the top two tenths of one percent of estates,      giving the ultrawealthy $239 billion in tax cuts. By 2027,      80% of tax cuts will go to the top one percent.       It also uses these procedures to make at least $203 billion      in cuts to mandatory programs that are important for working      families and our most vulnerable citizens. In[[Page H7772]]     total, this budget assumes $5.4 trillion in spending cuts.      Cuts of this magnitude would almost certainly lead to      slashing funding for Legal Services Corporation, federal      employee pensions, nutritional assistance infrastructure, and      unemployment compensation, to name a few. It also repeals the      Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and the Affordable Care       This budget resolution takes America in the wrong      direction. We have tried ``trickle down'' economics several      times in the past; it did not work then and it will not work      now. These tax cuts will not pay for themselves. Instead,      they will come at the expense of hardworking every day      Americans--many of whom have trouble affording basic      necessities today.       We strongly urge you to oppose 71 and instead      work on a federal budget that invests in our country and      works for ALL           Sincerely,                                                      Josh Nassar,     Legislative                                  ____                                       SEIU Stronger Together,                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of      the Service Employees International Union (``SEIU''), I write      to oppose 71, the FY18 House budget resolution.      This budget would further rig the system against working      Americans by slashing resources that help families afford      basic needs like healthcare, food, and education--all to pave      the way for tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. SEIU      believes The People's Budget is a better way forward for      working families. While the House Republican budget would      continue to leave working families behind, The People's      Budget makes American workers its first priority through      critical investments in health care, education, and      infrastructure.       The first goal of any elected representative should be to      improve the lives of their constituents. 71      fails to meet this standard. To pay for tax giveaways for the      wealthy and corporations, the budget resolution includes      reconciliation instructions that would significantly      undermine basic living standards for families. For example,      under the reconciliation instructions, committees are      directed to make cuts of $203 billion dollars over ten years      to programs that could include Medicaid, Medicare,      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and programs      for people with disabilities, which provide critical support      for millions of       By threatening Medicaid, this budget ignores the tens of      thousands of people who mobilized month after month to      soundly reject efforts to dismantle healthcare and cut      Efforts to reduce or cap Medicaid funding put at      risk healthcare for 74 million Americans--including children,      people with disabilities, and seniors. Hospitals could be      forced to close or cut services, further reducing access to      care, especially in underserved areas. States--which must      balance budgets and already face fiscal pressures--would not      be able to make up the lost federal Medicaid dollars and      would likely be forced to deny coverage. Furthermore, the      cuts would lead to significant job loss in the healthcare      industry, one of the fastest growing sectors in our economy.       In contrast, The People's Budget would focus on reforms to      increase access, affordability. and quality of health care by      building on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act      (``ACA''). In its entirety, it would move the nation's health      care system closer to achieving universal coverage, while      ensuring that working families would have affordable care. At      the same time, it would invest in developing innovative care      delivery models that control costs and increase quality. The      People's Budget would put America's health care system on the      right path forward.       The House Republican budget, however, would compound the      proposed Medicaid cuts with potential cuts to Medicare,      Social Security Disability Insurance, and nutrition      assistance. The budget doubles down on its harm to seniors      and people with disabilities and further shift costs to      states. The cumulative impact of the deep cuts proposed in      this budget would force states to make drastic spending and      job cuts, raise taxes, or both. This budget pressure would      likely also trickle down to local governments in the form of      decreased funding to cities and counties, creating a fiscal      crisis in communities across the nation.       While 71 would force Americans to make a false      choice between programs that are essential to their      communities and tax giveaways for the wealthy, The People's      Budget invests in American communities through a robust      infrastructure program and makes debt free college a reality      for all students--without sacrificing health care for      millions of The House Republican budget makes no      such commitment to education, and its steep cuts create the      potential for state budget crises that put education programs      and working families' futures in jeopardy. Trickle-down      economics have left America's middle class behind for      decades. It is time we turn the page towards an economy that      is designed for working families and aimed at improving their      lives.       The proposed FY18 House Budget Resolution is a disaster for      America's working families. By decimating programs that      provide healthcare, food, housing, and education to set the      stage for massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations,      this budget is an attack on our communities' quality of life.      We respectfully urge you to reject the proposed budget      resolution, and instead support The People's Budget which      would prioritize working families in building an economy that      works for everyone. We will add votes on 71 to      our legislative scorecard.           Sincerely,                                                   Mary Kay Henry,     International                                  ____                                             The National Treasury                                              Employees Union,                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.       Dear Representative: As National President of the National      Treasury Employees Union, I represent over 150,000 dedicated      federal employees at 31 agencies. I am writing to ask you to      VOTE NO on the House Budget Resolution, Con Res 71.       The House Budget Resolution instructs the Committee on      Oversight and Government Reform to produce at least $32      billion in cuts to programs under its jurisdiction, which are      federal employee benefit programs. While the Budget Committee      recommended sizable cuts to federal employee retirement, it      is important to highlight that this program has been utilized      in recent years to help pay for both infrastructure and      unemployment insurance. This was twice accomplished by      increasing the amount federal employees contribute toward      their retirement benefits, and occurred against a backdrop of      a multi-year pay freeze, further squeezing employee      paychecks. In recent years, federal employees have endured      compensation losses of close to $200 billion for deficit      reduction, from the above retirement changes and from reduced      pay increases in 2014, 2015, 2016, and in 2017. At a time      when private sector raises are averaging 3%, federal wage      increases continue to trail behind.       Federal employees play a vital role for taxpayers--ensuring      air, water and food safety, border and national security,      consumer protections, and preserving our national parks, to      name just a few of their functions and missions. Like all      Americans, federal employees face ever-increasing food,      utility, health care, and college bills, and have rent and      mortgage obligations. Families will fall further behind if      their take-home pay is slashed or if cost-of-living      adjustments, similar to those made to Social Security,      military retirement and to veterans' benefits to keep these      payments whole, are removed in retirement. These further cuts      will also degrade morale, make it difficult for agencies to      recruit and retain quality employees, and will erode income      security for retirees.       Additionally, I ask you to strongly oppose Representatives      McClintock and Walker's Amendment in the Nature of a      Substitute that places a severe financial burden on federal      employees by eviscerating federal employee compensation, and      further unfairly attacks worker protections and labor      organizations.       On behalf of our nation's federal employees--who live and      work in every state and congressional district across the      country--serving as scientists, accountants, statisticians,      park rangers, and law enforcement officers, I ask you to      reject the cuts contemplated in the Budget Resolution, and      VOTE           Sincerely,                                               Anthony Reardon,     National                                  ____         American Federation of State, County and Municipal            Employees, AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2017.     Member of the House of Representatives,      Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose 71, the      fiscal year (FY) 2018 budget resolution approved by the House      Budget Committee and scheduled to be considered by the full      This budget plan would impose considerable hardship on      many Americans in order to slash taxes for the wealthy and      corporations and to boost defense spending.       The budget decisions made by Congress each year are vital      to ensuring that the economy is strong and that our      communities are safe and prosperous. Yet, this budget      completely undercuts responsibility for shared prosperity by      applying the same misguided priorities proposed by President      It sets woefully inadequate spending levels for      critical public services and cuts over a trillion dollars      from non-defense discretionary spending (NDD), in order to      significantly boost defense spending and provide massive tax      giveaways to wealthy individuals and large corporations.       The budget slashes $5.7 trillion over 10 years including      $1.3 trillion from NDD programs that have already been      compromised by austere budget caps. FY 2018 statutory caps      lower funding for NDD programs by 17 percent adjusted for      inflation below FY 2010, and the House budget cuts this by an      additional $5 billion. The additional cuts proposed in the      House budget would weaken public services that all Americans      rely on, create massive budget problems for states, and lead      to enormous job losses. It would force dramatic cuts in,      education, job training, federal employee pensions, and      nutritional assistance. Over 10 years, the budget cuts $4.4      trillion from entitlement programs, such as, Medicare and      Medicaid, including at least $203 billion in entitlement cuts      to be[[Page H7773]]     made through the ``fast track'' reconciliation process. As a      result, safety-net programs that millions rely upon are once      again a target, further shifting enormous and unsustainable      costs to the elderly, disabled, students and states.       Rather than increasing revenues for investment that creates      jobs and spurs economic growth, the proposed budget creates a      fast-track process for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit      corporations and the wealthy. In fact, according to the      nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the Trump/GOP tax cut would      largely benefit the richest 1 percent. The budget also relies      on the gimmicks of dynamic scoring and sham accounting,      hiding the true cost of unnecessary and harmful tax cuts.       The budget approved by the House Budget Committee would      hurt families, kill job growth and send the economy into a      downward tailspin. I strongly urge you to oppose.      71, the proposed 2018 concurrent budget resolution.           Sincerely,                                                       Scott Frey,     Director of Federal Government                                  ____                                            American Federation of                                Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation      of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, which represents over      700,000 federal employees across the country, I strongly urge      you to oppose any FY 2018 budget resolution proposal that      includes reconciliation instructions to the Oversight and      Government Reform Committee (OGR) requiring cuts within its      jurisdiction to reduce the deficit by $32 billion for the FY      2018-2027 period, when the House considers various FY 2018      budget proposals during the week of October 2, 2017. These      cuts would target federal employee retirement benefits, as      that is the only substantial mandatory spending within OGR's      jurisdiction.       Such an approach would be consistent with the Senate Budget      Committee's FY 2018 budget resolution proposal that excludes      reconciliation instructions that would result in cutting      federal employee retirement benefits. Indeed, the Senate      version only includes reconciliation instructions to two      committees: the $1.5 trillion allowance for net tax cuts      under the Finance Committee's jurisdiction and a $1 billion,      10-year deficit cut instruction to the Energy and Natural      Resources Committee which could open up a portion of Alaska's      Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration.       AFGE opposes the House Budget Committee's FY 2018 budget      resolution's reconciliation instructions to the Oversight and      Government Reform Committee to cut federal employee      retirement benefits by $32 billion for the FY 2018-2027      period. We believe this budget reconciliation instruction      would help rip away any sense of financial security that      federal employees currently have.       As you know, the House Budget Committee budget report      included recommendations that would:       Require federal employees, including Members of Congress      and their staffs, to make greater contributions to their own      defined benefit retirement plans.       Eliminate the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS)      supplemental annuity payments to federal employees who retire      before age 62, such as law enforcement officers and federal      firefighters.       Transition new federal employees to a defined contribution      retirement system. (The existing Thrift Savings Plan under      FERS is a defined contribution retirement plan.)       These proposed federal retirement cuts of S32 billion over      ten years would be on top of the $182 billion in cuts to pay      and benefits that federal employees have experienced since      2011. Those pay and benefit cuts included: a three-year pay      freeze (2011, 2012, 2013), three years of reduced pay      increases (2014, 2015, 2016), unpaid furlough days because of      the 2013 sequestration, and two increases in retirement      contributions for new hires (2012 and 2013).       It is important to view the House Budget Committee's FY      2018 budget proposal to cut federal employee retirement      benefits in the proper context. The federal employee      retirement systems (FERS and CSRS) have played no role      whatsoever in the creation of the federal budget deficit. In      addition, increasing federal employees' contributions to      their defined benefit retirement plans would decrease      consumer demand and thereby adversely impact the American      economy.       Thank you for your consideration of our request.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Active and      Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), I write to ask      you to oppose the inclusion of reconciliation instructions in      any budget resolution that target federal retirement and/or      health benefits considered by the full House of            The House Budget Committee passed, and the House is      expected to consider, a budget resolution containing      reconciliation instructions calling for at least $32 billion      in cuts to mandatory spending under the jurisdiction of the      House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (OGR).      Such instructions directly target the hard-earned retirement      and health benefits of federal and postal workers and      retirees, as these benefits constitute the only substantial      mandatory spending under OGR's jurisdiction.       Proposals to meet the $32 billion in savings range from bad      to worse--from imposing a ``retirement tax'' on current      federal and postal employees by raising payroll contributions      towards retirement without any benefit increase to various      proposals that would dramatically reduce the value of federal      pensions for those nearing--or even in--retirement. These are      neither fair nor prudent policies, yet any budget resolution      containing reconciliation instructions for OGR endorses them      prior to any significant evaluation.       The upcoming budget resolution is being used to set the      stage for advancing tax reform that proponents argue provides      a break to hard-working, middle-class      Reconciliation instructions that target hard-working, middle      class federal and postal workers are diametrically opposed to      that goal and undermine a key argument as the basis of      comprehensive tax reform.       For these reasons, I ask you to oppose any budget      resolution that contains substantial reconciliation      instructions to the House Committee on Oversight and      Government           Sincerely,                                                  Richard Thissen,                                                National President  Mr.Mr.Speaker, let me just say to my colleague from Georgia, thanks for reminding us that the Republicans have been working on the budget for 10 months; but according to your own Republican Budget Committee website, the budget was supposed to be presented and finished by April 15, so you are a little late.  In any event, I also want to remind the gentleman, because I know he is on the Rules Committee, so I know he knows this, that the rule sets the agenda for the Yes, if one of the things that the Republicans want to bring up is their terrible budget, that is fine. You can do that. But the rule can also be an opportunity for us to bring up the bill that Mr.Thompson has offered, to set up this commission to deal with gun violence. We can do both.  You can walk and you can chew gum at the same time. This is not a radical idea. But this is our only way to be able to bring something to the floor, because the leadership of this House has said no to everything. They have said no to everything. We can't get hearings. We can't get votes. We can't get debates. We get nothing.  Don't be startled by us trying to defeat the previous question. It is a perfectly legitimate way to try to expand the agenda, and I hope that some of our Republican friends will vote with us to defeat the previous question. We can still do the budget, but we can also do the Thompson bill as well.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Delaware (",CREC-2017-10-04-pt1-PgH7764-3.txt,2008,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 36, PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD",2017,4,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
743,topic-id,1243,"Mr.Speaker, I would say to my friend from Massachusetts that I have no further speakers remaining. I would be happy to close when the gentleman is prepared.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.  I just want to tell my colleague from Georgia, if he hasn't read what we are trying to propose here, we are suggesting that they bring up the Thompson bill to the floor under an open rule, and even get a motion to recommit, but under an open rule. Take us up on this offer because we have had no open rules in this Try it; you might like it. It might be contagious. We might see more open rules where Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and conservatives can offer their ideas. We suggest they bring it up under an open rule.  I would urge all of my colleagues to think about that before they cast their vote on defeating the previous question.  Mr.Speaker, I began by saying the frustration I have with this place is that we either do nothing or we make things worse for people. Going back to this issue on creating a commission to deal with gun violence, there are a lot of things I would like to do, but maybe this is a way to get some bipartisan buy-in to actually try and figure out how to respond to this epidemic of gun violence.

King-Thompson Background Check Bill (closes gun show      and Charleston loopholes, not yet reintroduced)       26. No Fly No Buy (not yet reintroduced)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, people have their ideas. Some of them are maybe not so good ideas; some of them may be very good ideas. But let's begin to talk about what our response should be. That is at least doing something. That is better than a moment of silence or offering your thoughts and prayers to people who were victims in this terrible latest massacre.  We have got to do something, and nothing is no longer sufficient. We can't keep on doing that. People are horrified that Congress seems indifferent. We can't even have a hearing on this issue, never mind a debate on the floor.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can bring up the Thompson bill, and maybe we can start coming together and coming up with some ideas that might save some lives. That is the least we can do.  Mr.Speaker, to my other point that we either do nothing or you guys do things that make life worse for people, it brings us to the budget. This budget basically, in my opinion, is a cruel budget that targets, disproportionately, those who are poor and those who are in the middle class.  It is astounding to me where some of the savings are sought. The idea that you would cut SNAP by $164 billion, a program that provides food to people; a program where 67 percent of the people on the benefit are children, are senior citizens, or people who are disabled; a program where those who can work, the majority of them work, but they earn so little in the workforce that they still qualify for that program. You want to take that benefit away, a benefit that is $1.40 per person per meal.  Come on. What are people thinking when they make those kinds of suggestions?  By the way, we all know what this is. It is basically a pretext to move forward on your tax cut plan, which benefits Donald Trump, Donald Trump's family, and Donald Trump's friends.  This idea that somehow this would be deficit neutral is laughable. The OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, stated: ``If we simply look at this as being deficit neutral, you're never going to get the type of tax reform and tax reductions'' that you guys are looking for. That is the former colleague and the OMB  So we all know what is going on here. But people ought to think long and hard before they cast their vote for this Republican budget. Budgets basically indicate what we value, what we think is important.  I have got to tell you, I just don't believe that if people read this budget, that a majority of my friends, we have disagreements on lots of issues, but I just don't believe that deep in your heart you actually believe this stuff. I mean, this is offensive.  We ought to be talking about lifting people up and not putting them down. We ought to be talking about all of the citizens of this country with respect and treating them with dignity. We ought not treat people who are in poverty as if somehow they are invisible, and that is what this budget does.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote down this Republican budget. I urge them to defeat the previous question so we can bring up, under an open rule--under and open rule, which nobody in this Congress has seen--a bill that would allow us to create a commission, a bipartisan commission to examine gun violence.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

744,topic-id,1695,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, what I love most about budget day is the fact that we do get to talk about our competing ideas. I do reject some of the implications that we have heard that what we are talking about is whether we love people or not. That is actually not the debate today.  I want to stipulate that I know the men and women of this Chamber on a personal basis, and each and every one of them that I know personally loves and cares for their constituency back home. The debate that we have is not whether we love people; it is how to love people best.[[Page H7775]]  Do you love people best by giving them a check or giving them a job? That is a legitimate debate.  Do you love people best by leaving their children with them or taking their children away from them? That is a legitimate debate.  I believe in families. I believe in the dignity of work. I want to have those debates.  I think we do ourselves a disservice when we describe what is going on here today on the floor of the House as anything other than our absolute legal and governmental responsibility to pass a budget for the United States of Wherever you sit on the continuum, the political continuum, the economic continuum, the regional continuum, there is a budget for you today.  If what you believe, Mr.Speaker, is that the problems we have in this country are because taxes are not high enough, there is going to be a Democratic substitute coming out of the Budget Committee that will raise taxes about $2.4 trillion. If you think taxes are too low, we can raise them $2.4 trillion. That budget never balances. That budget never stops borrowing from our children and our grandchildren. That budget never stops mortgaging America's future. But it is a legitimate debate because folks are taking those funds and they are investing them in They are prioritizing that investment over balancing.  If you believe $2.4 trillion is not enough, Mr.Speaker, we will have a budget from the Congressional Black Caucus today that will raise taxes by $4.2 trillion. We can raise taxes by $4.2 trillion. Again, that budget never balances. It spends all that money and more, but it is a legitimate debate about where those dollars come from and where those dollars are going. I am glad we are going to be able to have it.  If raising taxes by $4.2 trillion isn't enough for you, Mr.Speaker, we have the Congressional Progressive Caucus' budget on the floor. It raises taxes by just over $10 trillion. Again, the budget never balances. It spends all of that money and more and continues to borrow from our children and grandchildren, but it is a legitimate debate and it is a conversation worth having. I am proud that the Rules Committee made that debate in order.  To describe what is happening on the floor of the House today, Mr.Speaker, as anything other than what is exactly expected of this institution is to do us all a disservice.  I talked about making taxes higher. Let me talk a second about making taxes lower.  I talked to some friends back home; I talk to constituents; I talk to folks for whom I work, and some of them might say: ``Rob, I have enough to feed my family, and if it means paying down the debt and deficit, I am willing to pay a little bit more.'' Other members in the community, Mr.Speaker, say: ``For Pete's sake, I am trying to grow a business here, I am trying to employ your friends and neighbors. I am trying to keep the community working. I am plowing everything I have back into the business. If I don't have to pay as much in taxes, I am going to be able to hire more people.''  The Republican budget, Mr.Speaker, takes a shot at once-in-a-generation tax reform--once in a generation. This isn't what we talked about last year or the year before that or the year before that. This is a conversation we have not had since Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill had it in 1986. This is a conversation that we have not had since America slipped from number one in the world to almost last in the industrialized world in terms of tax competitiveness. This is a conversation that America has longed for and that we can deliver today.  Mr.Speaker, let's have these debates about what our priorities are. Let's have these debates about whether or not we can do better. At the end of the day, let's agree that we, in fact, can do better, that our bosses back home expect us to do better, and that by supporting this rule and supporting one of the underlying budgets, we, in fact, will do better.  I encourage my colleagues, Mr.Speaker, support this rule, begin this debate. Let's pass this budget. Let's fulfill our promises. Let's make the difference that we all came here to make.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 553 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the resolution      (367) to establish the Select Committee on Gun      Violence The first reading of the resolution      shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the resolution are waived. General debate      shall be confined to the resolution and shall not exceed one      hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking      minority member of the Committee on After general      debate the resolution shall be considered for amendment under      the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions      in the resolution are waived. At the conclusion of      consideration of the resolution for amendment the Committee      shall rise and report the resolution to the House with such      amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question      shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and      amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion or demand for division of the question except one      motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the      Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to      no resolution on the resolution, then on the next legislative      day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order      of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the      Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the      resolution.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of House Resolution 367.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

218,topic-id,2443,"Mr.President, I did not get a chance to hear the distinguished Democratic leader's remarks, for Chairman Hatch and I were in the Senate Finance We managed to pass, by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Children's Health Insurance Program--a vital program for 9 million kids. So that is a bit of good news in that this important piece of legislation is advancing. I do know that the Democratic leader touched on a number of very important issues, particularly some of these comments that have been made by top advisers to the President with respect to taxes.  I am struck by the fact that Mr.Gary Cohn, the President's top economic adviser, said last week that middle-class folks were going to get $1,000 in tax relief--set aside the fact that that does not look to be true for a number of middle-class folks who have kids. I am also struck by the comment that followed. Mr.Cohn said that not only are middle-class families going to get $1,000 worth of tax relief but that they would be able to go buy cars or remodel their kitchens. You just think to yourself, with that kind of tax cut, that you would be buying a very small car or remodeling a very small kitchen. The fact is, that is not, in my view, a comment that reflects a real understanding of what middle-class folks in America are going through. I don't see very many of them buying cars for $1,000 or remodeling their kitchens for $1,000.  That comment was accompanied by the comments of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who not only said a couple of days ago that tax cuts would pay for themselves--a statement that was contradicted by Republican economists yesterday in the Senate Finance Committee--but that there would be something like $1 trillion left over. Mr.Mnuchin continues to make the case that there is somehow a magical growth fairy here in the American economy that nobody else knows about, including Republican economists.  I am one who believes that behavior does matter, and I am going to talk about a bipartisan approach to taxes in a minute--a responsible, bipartisan approach to taxes, not one that helps the 1 percent or creates a huge new deficit or that kind of thing. I think that you will generate some revenue, and Doug Elmendorf said that when he was the head of the Budget Office, but it is not going to generate hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, as in the case of what Mr.Mnuchin is talking about, which is something like $2 trillion. There is no economic support for that.  You have the President's economic team and his top advisers trying to defend the indefensible, and I will go into that more a little bit later today.  Right now, I think it is important that we have a response that I am going to deliver to the distinguished majority whip, who is a member of the Finance Committee, who made some comparisons between the Republican plan and the bipartisan legislation that I wrote--after months and months of hard work--with two of our former Republican colleagues, Senator Gregg and Senator Senator Coats is now a member of President Trump's  The comparison that somehow the Republican plan is like the bipartisan approach that I wrote--these extreme ideas in the Republican plan--is not just a bit of a stretch or a little off base; there is absolutely no comparison--none--between the bipartisan proposal and the extreme Republican plan. The distinguished majority whip, in my view, offered a complete and total misrepresentation of what the two proposals are all about, and I am going to illustrate this in two ways--first, with respect to the policy.  The Republican tax cut framework green-lights the entire wish list for major multinational corporations and the wealthy. There is a massive corporate tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits shareholders. When it comes to international taxes, there is a pure territorial system with barely a nod to[[Page S6297]]the kind of tough rules that are needed to protect workers and the middle-class folks in the center of our tax base.  There is, in the Republican plan, a brand-new passthrough loophole. It is as big as the Grand It is the Grand Canyon of loopholes in the Republican tax proposal, which invites tax cheats to skip out from paying their fair share to Social Security and  The Republican plan eliminates the estate tax, which today only touches estates worth more than $11 million or $5.5 million for a single individual. The top rate goes down, and the bottom income tax rate goes up. When doing the math on what the Republicans have on offer, we are looking at upwards of $4, $5, $6, or $7 trillion in tax giveaways to the most fortunate.  It is a different story under the Republican proposal if you are middle class. You probably have a lot of unanswered questions. All you know right now is that it virtually guarantees that, in order to pay for the giveaways to the wealthy and corporations, current middle-class tax breaks are going to be on the chopping block--the personal exemption, incentives for retirement savings, education, and home ownership, to name just a few. From everything we know, when you set up these kinds of extreme approaches, when you raise the parts of the Tax Code that are a giveaway to those at the top, what you see is the middle class getting hurt.  Instead of tripling the standard deduction, which is what we did in our bipartisan bill, the Trump people double it, but then they take away the personal exemptions for working-class folks. So unlike our proposal, where the middle class can count on hundreds and hundreds of dollars in their paycheck when you triple the standard deduction, under the Republican proposal, they give it with one hand by doubling the standard deduction and take it away with the other hand by eliminating the personal exemption. So you have a very stark difference between the bipartisan proposal that I offered with Senator Coats, a member of the President's Cabinet, and what the Republican extreme plan is all about.  The bottom line is that the Republican plan seeks to raise those parts of our Tax Code that are all about the middle class, and they are doing it to pay for the giveaways for those folks at the top. That is not what we did in the bipartisan plan at all. Any middle-class person can sit at their kitchen table and look at the bipartisan plan that I was involved with and see how the middle class wins. They get hundreds and hundreds of dollars more in every paycheck by tripling the standard deduction, and they can see how they as middle-class folks--say, who make $70,000 and have a couple of children--lose under the Trump proposal.  Now there are other differences between our bipartisan plan and what the Big 6 and the Trump administration want. The bipartisan plan was scored as revenue neutral by authoritative independent tax experts. It made the Tax Code more progressive. The fact is, what we offered--Senator Coats, Senator Gregg, and I--was an actual bill. It was the product of weeks and months of work.  Senator Gregg and I--and I think it is fair to say that all Senators may not be aware of this, but Senator Gregg was a top economic thinker with whom the majority leader consulted--sat next to each other for months in order to put together what is still the first and only comprehensive Federal bipartisan tax reform plan since 1986. It was an actual bill. It wasn't four pages of rhetoric.  In the spring we got one page. It was shorter than your typical drugstore receipt. Now I guess we are up to four pages, when you take out all this kind of white space. Our bill was an actual bill and was designed to give everybody in America a chance to get ahead, not just those in the 1 percent, not just those who have real clout and power.  I have always said that this is the heart of the difference. We have two Tax Codes in We have one for the cops and the nurses. It is compulsory. Their taxes come right out of their paychecks--no Cayman Islands deal for them. Then we have another Tax Code for the high flyers--the fortunate and well-connected. They can pretty much pay what they want when they want to. The bipartisan proposal that I wrote with Senator Gregg and Senator Coats helps the first group, the cops and nurses, but it was also fair to everybody. It gave everybody a chance to get ahead. The Republican plan is another big gift to that second group, the group that can decide what they are going to pay in taxes and when they are going to pay it. So we really couldn't have two proposals that are more different.  The fact is, the Republican framework looks less like a real effort at tax reform than a shameless attempt, in effect, to accommodate the President's boast about the biggest tax cut ever. The bottom line is that it is a giveaway to those at the top, and it robs from the middle class.  The differences don't just end with these specifics that I have described here. We took a fundamentally different approach. With Senator Gregg and Senator Coats, we were digging into the cobwebs of every dark corner of the Tax We brought together principles on which both sides had to find common ground with a lot of sweat equity.  If you are going to write a partisan bill, you can go off on your own and do your thing. The fact is, if Senators Gregg, Coats, and I had written separate bills on our own, they would have looked very different, but the bill we wrote together, starting with Senator Gregg and I, was the first comprehensive bipartisan tax proposal in a quarter century. Senator Coats, to his credit, did yeoman's work in updating it. There is no comparison from a process standpoint between that bipartisan work that was done to update the system of more than a quarter century ago and the Republican tax cut framework.  The majority leader said from day one, at the beginning of the year, that he didn't want Democratic input on tax reform. He said: We are just going to do it on the ``our way or the highway'' approach with reconciliation. Reconciliation is a rejection of bipartisanship through and through.  I note that the Presiding Officer is the tallest Member of the Senate, along with Senator Strange, and I talked fairly frequently with our former colleague Senator Bradley, who was another tall Democrat on the Finance Committee with a much better jump shot than me. He has described the bipartisan efforts of 1986, with key officials in President Reagan's administration, Jim Baker and Don Regan, who spent months talking to Democrats--months and months--before anything happened. That is not what happened here. The specifics are very different, and the process is very different.  Recently, my Democratic colleagues and I came forward with our principles for reform, and it was just a matter of a few hours before Leader McConnell rejected them in the media. One administration official actually said that tax reform would be worse if it included Democratic ideas, and the ``go it alone'' mentality is pretty obvious when you look at the framework that came out last week.  The tough questions haven't been answered. For those at the top, it is all sweet and no sour. There was not a single shred of Democratic input in the framework--not one Democratic fingerprint anywhere to be found. The administration officials in charge of selling it to the public are, in my view, executing a con job on the middle class.  So I wanted to come here today to highlight some of the recent comments that the Senate Democratic leader has made with respect to some of these out-of-touch comments we have heard recently from key administration officials, like Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, and I wanted to make sure that Senators heard--after the comments of the Senate Republican whip--that they now know that there is no comparison, none, between the bipartisan proposal that I had the honor to write with Senators Coats and Gregg, which brought the two parties together, and the framework that came out last week that forced even more polarization between the parties. The reality is that this Republican proposal, this tax cut framework, is so radically skewed toward the wealthy and the big corporations, that it makes Ronald Reagan's landmark reform look like the work of rabid socialists.[[Page S6298]]  So I appreciate the chance to set the record straight by outlining the differences between a recent bipartisan bill with two influential Republican Senators with whom I had the honor to work and the extreme Republican framework that came out last week. These plans are not just trillions of dollars apart based on the numbers. It is clear they are written with entirely different goals in mind.  Our view is that tax reform ought to be about giving everybody in America the opportunity to get ahead. What we have said is that, instead of it being an ``our way or the highway'' partisan approach, we ought to be doing--particularly in the area of tax reform--what has a storied history. The key to a successful tax reform, based on that history, is working in a bipartisan way.  I will close with the comments about the Democratic principles, which is that we are not going to give relief to the people at the 1 percent, we are not going to break the bank, and we are going to focus on the middle class. Those principles don't even go as far as ideas advanced by President Reagan, where he said that we are going to treat income from a wage and income from investment in the same way.  I close by way of saying this. 1, the distinguished Republican whip is wrong when he compares the bipartisan bill I have been a part of to what the administration's tax framework is all about. 2, the right way to do this is to focus in a bipartisan way, not through partisanship only. The principles that we have outlined on our side, when you compare them, do not even go as far as some of the ideas embraced by the late President  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

230,topic-id,2523,"Madam President, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, I followed the Senator's comments with respect to taxes and the debate over tax reform[[Page S6306]]with considerable interest. I will just tell you, my goodness, how I wish we could have what the Senator called an uninhibited process with respect to the debate over tax reform. I have written an actual bipartisan tax reform bill with our colleague who is now part of the Trump administration, Senator  Unfortunately, what our colleague laudably called for is not on offer. The Senate majority leader has said that he intends to use reconciliation--the most partisan process for considering tax reform. When we were talking about healthcare, which is one-sixth of the economy, we had the same process--reconciliation, all partisan. Now we are talking about taxes that involve the whole economy, and we are seeing the Senate majority leader say once again that it is his intent, his preference, and his plan to use that same process. I sure wish the world was like my colleague has called for because I have written a bipartisan plan.  What is so striking is that the Senate majority leader has called for 20 hours of discussion, which is essentially what you get with reconciliation, as opposed to what happened when Ronald Reagan and a big group of Democrats got together in 1986 and spent a whole month on tax reform.  So before the Senator leaves--and it is a pleasure to serve with him on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence as well--I sure wish the world was along the lines of what my colleague has called for. Perhaps he can use his intellect and energy to persuade the Senate majority leader to use that process on taxes because that is what some Democrats have called for.  I can just tell my friend, given my interest in the subject, which goes back well over a decade--we have a bipartisan proposal written, coauthored by a member of the President's Cabinet, so we would very much like to have what the Senator is talking about.  Madam President, I rise now to oppose the nomination of Eric Hargan to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Human This is the 2 position at HHS, the chief operating officer. Of course, with Secretary Price's departure, Mr.Hargan would fill the top spot if he is confirmed.  My concern is that I don't have any confidence that Mr.Hargan is going to lead the Department in a different direction than it took under Last week, the country watched as more and more details emerged about Secretary Price's travel. In my view, the flights were an abuse of office.  In my view, from the very outset, there was reason to be concerned about Secretary Price and how he would handle the public trust. Ever since our committee received the Price nomination, it was clear that he had a little trouble following the rules when it served his own personal interests rather than taxpayers. He used insider information from a fellow Congressman to get a sweetheart stock deal that made him hundreds of thousands of dollars. He frequently bought stocks in industries that he was overseeing as a Member of He pushed healthcare legislation that benefited industry insiders rather than patients.  He was confirmed on a party-line vote, and it wasn't very shortly after that that he proceeded to go forward with what I and others consider a sabotage campaign that, in effect, has been executed since day one. He was a top salesman for He came before our committee and made countless other public appearances in which he willfully misrepresented the massive scale of the harm TrumpCare would have done to American healthcare. He also appeared on national television and argued, in effect, that healthcare funding cuts aren't actually cuts. He denied that individuals would lose health coverage or see increases as a result of TrumpCare, even after there were independent analysis showing that was wrong. Then, of course, he flew about the country scaring folks who just wanted affordable healthcare.  As far as the President's promise to bring down the high prices of prescription medicine--that was a promise the American people heard stop after stop on the campaign trail in 2016. That promise is nowhere to be seen or heard from at this point. It is my hope that the President's next pick to lead Health and Human Services will follow through on what the American people were told in the campaign they were going to get--lower the cost of healthcare and get our citizens covered--but that nominee hasn't been put forward.  In the meantime, Mr.Hargan's nomination has him in line to serve as Acting I will tell you, having examined the record as closely as I could, I don't think there is any reason to believe Mr.Hargan would deviate from Secretary Price's ideological agenda that included a constant effort to undermine and in my view sabotage the implementation of the Affordable Care This campaign is driving up premiums and confusing Americans who just want to be able to see a doctor and get affordable healthcare services.  I am going to tick through some of the actions the administration has taken that would undermine the upcoming open enrollment period and the effect that is going to have on our people's healthcare costs.  First, just a few weeks into his tenure, Secretary Price cut the enrollment period. This is the period during which Americans sign up for health insurance. We are talking about a private marketplace. I am really struck by this debate about the role of government. We are talking about a private marketplace where private healthcare plans offer coverage. Secretary Price cut the enrollment period for private healthcare in the private marketplace in half. People across the country used to be able to sign up for healthcare from the beginning of November until the end of January, and now they have literally half that time. That is going to cause a whole lot of disruption for people who are working hard and living their lives rather than trying to follow every little press account from Washington,  Let's imagine for a moment a 29-year-old who just got locked out of the healthcare system because he has had a 3-year routine of signing up for health insurance around the new year. That is exactly the kind of individual the private insurance market needs to attract in order to hold costs down--a young person who is probably signing up right toward the deadline.  Then think of the single mom with two kids who marked January 30, probably with a big, bright pen on her calendar because she cut it close to the end of enrollment last year. Her life is busy enough. She doesn't read trade publications from health industry sources to see what is happening with open enrollment. Because of the early enrollment cutoff, this mom and her family, who just want affordable, private healthcare from the private marketplace, are going to be locked out.  The Department of Health and Human Services is taking the healthcare.gov website offline for maintenance on all but one Sunday during the open enrollment period. The fact is, Sunday has been one of the most popular times for well-meaning assistance groups to help folks get signed up at community centers. It is like the State Department of Transportation blocking the highways and digging up the blacktop with construction crews every Monday morning during the peak commute time. It is just the opposite of common sense.  The Department is kneecapping the programs that are designed to get highly trained people. These are folks called navigators, and what they do is get out into the communities and go to various places where they know a lot of folks aren't signed up, and they help them get signed up.  The Department of Health and Human Services has slashed the budget for getting the word out, including zeroing out the budget for TV ads. That has been a big factor in getting enrollment up in the past.  Let's be clear about what the Department has done under Secretary Price's leadership. They have been working overtime to make it harder for people to get healthcare, plain and simple.  The sabotage doesn't really end with just making enrollment a headache. The administration continues to dangle the threat of cutting off cost-sharing payments as if it were a political gain without consequences in the real world. In State after State after State, insurers have made it clear that this gamesmanship is causing premiums to go up. If the payments are cut off, families will face premium increases of[[Page S6307]]hundreds of dollars or more, and it is all because they are searching for a political trophy.  I want to talk about what this means for private sector healthcare. When you have the President and the previous Secretary of Health and Human Services pouring gasoline on the fires of uncertainty in the private health insurance marketplace, it makes it very hard for insurers to make the calculations that are involved in spreading risk and getting people signed up and pricing products.  The reality is, an administration that says they really care about the private sector--the President continually says that he is from the business community and he wants to be sensitive to private sector economic forces. The last thing you would do is pour all this uncertainty into the private healthcare landscape, which is what they have been doing with the gamesmanship in terms of whether they are going to pay these cost-sharing payments so that folks who face big deductibles and extra prices for medicine and the like would know there is going to be help in their health plan for those costs.  The Secretary was out jetting all about, spreading falsehoods about the private healthcare landscape. Sometimes he would say that it would be collapsing, and I would say: We know a lot of people who are trying to stabilize it, but you are making it harder by pouring all this gas on the fires of uncertainty.  While this was going on, they were also neglecting to work with For example, Oklahoma designed a reinsurance system intended to stabilize the private insurance market and control costs, and they sought a waiver application to the Department of Health and Human But the Department of Health and Human Services didn't get around to approving it in time to help Oklahomans in 2018, so the State just pulled their application.  I have been a strong supporter of these waivers. I authored a provision in the Affordable Care Act, the innovation waiver, 1332. For the Secretary to not work with Oklahoma in a timely way and in a way that would stabilize the private insurance market is not what those of us on this side are in favor of.  There is no reason to believe Mr.Hargan would come in and clean up the mess. In my view, many States want to see stable or reduced premiums this coming year, but so far the Department is just marching in lockstep with the status quo. The President apparently is committed to continuing this kind of mismanagement and willful wrongdoing. Mr.Hargan has made clear what his stance is on the Affordable Care Act in plenty of public statements.  Beyond this question of undermining the Affordable Care Act, we were also particularly troubled that Secretary Tom Price shared the Trump administration's abysmal record of responding to oversight letters from Congress, especially the As far as I can tell, some of this is shared on both sides.  I think this is profoundly undemocratic, and our obligation to perform oversight as Members of Congress is derived from the powers laid out in the Constitution, in article The issues we raise in oversight inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services relate directly to the well-being of people in North Carolina, in Oregon, and everywhere in between. I don't think Senators on either side, Democrats or Republicans, do it for sport. But the administration's behavior is not that of a government that sees itself as answerable to the public--either that or it just doesn't have good answers as to why it constantly, constantly is out there undermining private health insurance markets to make it harder for people to get affordable healthcare. Either way, they aren't doing their jobs, and they aren't putting the interests of the American people first.  Members on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern about the Department of Health and Human Services stonewalling important oversight issues presented by Members on both sides. Chairman Hatch and Senator Grassley are two very senior Chairman Grassley and Chairman Hatch deserve a lot of credit for calling out the Trump administration on this lack of responsiveness to basic oversight.  The fact is, what our committee has heard is basically a lot of sweet talk from nominees about how, of course, they are going to be responsive, and then they go out, and it is business as usual. We see them for that confirmation hearing, and there is not much of any kind of response when we ask the questions.  I will not support Mr.Hargan's nomination today. In my view, under Tom Price and this administration, the Department of Health and Human Services has done a miserable job of working to improve the health and well-being of the American people. The irony is, it seems that one of the objectives from day one was to set out and try to accomplish that, to make it appear that there were problems when the Affordable Care Act was being implemented. Instead of rolling up their sleeves and tackling it, the idea was to try and get an ideological trophy: Let's tell the American people that everything about the Affordable Care Act is horrible so we can get it repealed.  The Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. In fact, when we were debating it, I had an alternative plan. We had seven Senators on both sides of the aisle. It was a bipartisan plan, but that is history.  The Affordable Care Act has made an enormous difference for millions of What we ought to be doing is working together to improve it. There are plenty of ways in which this Senate and an administration that really want to accomplish that can work together in a bipartisan way.  What I have been more interested in than any other aspect of public service is to work in a bipartisan way on healthcare. That has been my 1 interest. So nothing would please me more than to be able to say: We have an official who is going to break with the past and, instead of trying to make the implementation of the Act as bad as possible, is prepared to roll up his or her sleeves and make it as good as possible.

648,topic-id,692,"Mr.President, today I wish to indulge in a bit of bragging. I know every one of us in this Chamber has that one or two staffers who are the Jacks or Janes of all trades of their operations.  My longtime loyal friend and staffer, who has served the great State of Oregon for over 20 years in my office as a fellow, a field representative, and now deputy State director, Mary Gautreaux celebrates her 70th birthday on October 17. I want to recognize her enormous and long-lasting contributions over the past two decades in my office to making Oregon a better place to live and enjoy.  Mary brings a lifetime of expertise to the natural resources issues that play such an essential part in Oregon's economy and quality of life. Not only[[Page S6354]]does she know these issues but she has lived these issues and passed on her love of them to her children, Ryder, Myria, Callie, and Lucas, as well as her five grandchildren.  Before joining my office in the 1990s, Mary served in the U.Forest In those days, Mary planted trees and fought fires to support her young family. While the work was seasonal, to start, she quickly made an impression on the U.Forest Service and became a full-time employee.  Then I was lucky enough to get her as a fellow in 1994 in my DC office when I was still a member of the House of Representatives for the proud 3rd District of Oregon and still had rugged good looks and a full head of hair.  She worked in my DC office for a year and had just moved back to Oregon when I realized my office was better for her presence, so I hired Mary to work as field rep in I may not know much about a lot of things, but I can recognize an excellent teammate, and Mary was a natural fit on ``Team Wyden.''  When I was elected to the U.Senate for the first time in 1996, I made a promise to do a townhall meeting in every county in Oregon every year I was privileged enough to represent the good people of Oregon in Washington, In the last 21 years, she has been with me at almost every one of the 800-plus townhalls I have held each year in each of Oregon's 36 counties.  At almost every one of those townhalls, I have at some junction pointed to Mary and said, ``Folks, give Mary a call about this issue. She works nights and weekends--never hesitate to call.'' It does not matter the issue; Mary always answers the phone. She has been going the extra mile with and for Oregonians in every nook and cranny of our State, both literally and figuratively.  Literally, Mary has traveled with me and solo to countless meetings in grange halls, diners, and farmhouses all across Oregon, and there has never been an issue too big or too small for her to take on.  One way to explain the praise Mary has earned is to say that Oregonians know Mary as a public servant always willing to listen and find solutions that benefit all of Oregon and Oregonians, not just the ones that vote for me. She lives by my promise to be the ``Senator for all of Oregon,'' and Oregonians know it and appreciate her for it.  My appreciation and Oregon's appreciation for Mary goes deeper than that accurate and well-deserved summation.  The deeper truth is that anybody who knows Mary knows she is an original and unforgettable force of nature--fierce on behalf of Oregonians, bold in her problem-solving, always willing to help, and just as ready with a smile to lighten any situation.  She has a gigantic heart matched only by her passion for public service and protecting the natural treasures we Oregonians all hold dear.  The bottom line is I have been very fortunate to work with her, to call her friend, to have her as an integral member of Team Wyden, and I look forward to many more years of her public service to the people of Oregon and her friendship to me and my family.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-05-pt1-PgS6353-2.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,5,October,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

86,topic-id,444,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I am going to cut to the chase: the Republican Study Committee budget is so extreme, it cannot be taken seriously. It cuts spending by $10 trillion over 10 years, which is $4 trillion more than the already irresponsible spending cuts in Chairman Black's budget.  To its credit, the RSC tells us where those cuts will come from, rather than leaving large amounts unspecified or using matching asterisks or phony economic assumptions to reduce spending.  The RSC budget cuts Social Security, Medicare, and It cuts programs that ensure basic living standards, protect the environment, and help families afford college.  For 2018, the RSC budget matches the President's level for defense, including war funding. But for nondefense discretionary spending, the RSC budget provides $394 billion, which is $122 billion, or 24 percent, below the austerity cap.  There is no way this House or any House would approve an appropriations bill that inflicted a 24 percent cut on all government operations. If just two programs--veterans' programs and NIH funding--were excluded from those cuts, everything else would be cut by more than 55 percent.  So yes, this budget claims to reach balance, but it would achieve it by making cuts that would be catastrophic. Not even Congress is that self-destructive.  I contend that the two Republican budgets actually show how dismissing the notion that revenues must be a part of any solution to restrain deficits and debt, compounded with the flawed notion that balance must be achieved in the short term, will inflict intolerable hardship on the American people.  While totally unintentional, they make a pretty compelling case that for Congress to responsibly address our debts and deficits, while funding the Federal programs and investments that the American people want and expect, raising revenues has to be part of the equation.  One of the things that amuses me, in a very kind of dark way, is that I remember so well, in 2010, when Republicans actually rode to victory in the House by claiming that we Democrats were going to cut $750 billion out of That wasn't true, but they claimed it.  Now, in this Republican Study Committee budget, they have doubled down on that. It is not exactly double, but they are going to cut it by $898 billion. I don't think America's seniors and the disabled population would feel very good about that.  I would like to thank my colleagues for bringing that important issue to the debate.

89,topic-id,721,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, it is fascinating to have this debate and speaking in such high-principled ways about the need to reduce deficits and debt. I don't think any Democrat would argue that we need to do something to reduce deficits and debt. We face a very dire, long-term fiscal future.  But we also lose sight of the fact that the American people expect something from their government. They expect our government to keep them safe, but they also expect their government to protect their drinking water, protect their air, to make sure that the food they eat is not dangerous, to provide law enforcement and help local law enforcement to do many things.  The budget, as well as Chairman Black's committee budget, would decimate all of those services that the American people expect from the Federal  I think only about what is going on right now with Houston, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands and the enormous cost that the Federal Government is going to have to bear to help restore those communities and those territories to some degree of normalcy. That is what they expect the American Government to do. These budgets would make that all but impossible.  So we look at it both ways. Later, we will propose a Democratic alternative that actually makes those kind of investments and makes sure that the notion of American security is not just a huge military, but is a foundation of investment in human capital and research and infrastructure that will allow this economy to grow. We do it with keeping debt at the same percentage of the economy, as it is now, because we are willing to raise revenues.  On the other hand, Republican budgets, both the Republican Study Committee budget and the chairman's budget, anticipate enormous tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations--tax cuts that have been proven to do exactly the opposite of what many on the other side claim they do, which is to stimulate economic growth.  We will hear claims that, yes, we can cut taxes by $2 trillion or $3 trillion over 10 years, and they are going to be paid for by this renewal of economic activity. But history tells us that is not what happens. Not only history tells us that, but virtually all the economists in the country tell us that, too.  Goldman Sachs, Steve Mnuchin's previous employer, says that the tax cuts outlined last week would maybe create an additional 0.2 percent of growth in the economy.  CBO and the Federal Reserve say tax cuts don't pay for themselves. Even Bruce Bartlett, the author of ``Reaganomics,'' says this whole notion that tax cuts pay for themselves is nonsense. He actually said bull, which is half of what he said, but you get the idea.  This is not easy. We can speak in the darkest terms of how we are imposing this debt on our grandchildren and try to use emotional arguments. But the fact is, we are dealing with a very realistic, pragmatic dilemma, and that is: how to do what the American people expect us to do without making the future impossible.  It is not done by the Republican budgets. We think it is helped along by the Democratic alternative, and we look forward to having that debate just a little bit later this morning.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I would remind my friend from Kentucky that Ronald Reagan reduced the Federal income tax rate from 70 percent down to 28 percent, and income tax revenues doubled.  He is correct that we expect things from our government. We have seen a 49 percent increase in spending in the last decade. Have we seen a 49 percent increase in the quality of education or a 49 percent increase in our infrastructure or our defense capability?  What we have seen is a 49 percent increase in bureaucracy and government.  I would remind the gentleman that when we squander the people's money, we rob them of the means to meet the disasters and unforeseen circumstances that confront our country.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: You will soon vote on several      different budget proposals for fiscal year (FY) 2018. On      behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of      the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I      urge you to support the budget resolution as reported by the      House Budget Committee and the Republican Study Committee's      (RSC) budget resolution, both of which would put the nation      back on the path to fiscal sanity and pave the way for      comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform.       Under the leadership of Chairman Diane Black (R-Tenn.),      71, as reported by the House Budget Committee,      would reduce spending by $6.5 trillion over 10 years and      balance the budget by 2027. 71 provides      reconciliation instructions for fundamental tax reform that,      if enacted, will allow Americans to keep more of their money,      simplify the filing of taxes, and allow small businesses to      boost wages and create jobs. While 71 would      increase defense spending above Budget Control Act mandated      cap levels, this legislation also calls for $203 billion in      spending cuts across various programs and a $700 billion      reduction in improper payments.       The RSC budget enacts many of the same reforms as the House      Budget Committee's plan, but it proposes to reduce government      spending by $10 trillion over 10 years and achieves balance      in six years. The RSC plan creates a pathway for tax reform;      repeals and replaces Obamacare; makes Social Security      solvent; rescues Medicare and disability insurance; and      decreases FY 2018 non-discretionary spending to $394 billion.       Tax reform presents an historic opportunity to unleash the      economic potential of the American people. While Congress is      well-positioned to enact tax reform, that cannot occur until      a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions is      adopted. I urge[[Page H7862]]     you to support both the House Budget Committee's FY 2018      budget resolution as reported and the RSC's FY 2018 budget      resolution.

The      amendment, which includes reconciliation instructions for      fundamental tax reform, is the Republican Study Committee's      FY 2018 budget alternative.       The Republican Study Committee's (RSC) FY 2018 budget would      reduce federal spending by more than $10 trillion over the      ten-year budget window, bringing the budget into balance in      FY 2023. The RSC's budget would repeal ObamaCare and enact      other patient-centered health insurance reforms, make Social      Security and Medicare solvent, and reform federal welfare      programs. It also promotes free trade, regulatory reform, and      other free market, limited government principles.       The current text of 71 and the McClintock      amendment include language that allows the House Ways and      Means Committee to produce legislation to reform the tax      code. Riddled with loopholes and special interest deductions,      America's tax code has become far too complex. According to      the Tax Foundation, Americans spent 8.9 billion hours and      $409 billion complying with the more than 74,000-page tax      code.       It has been more than 30 years since Congress passed      fundamental tax reform. Congress has a generational      opportunity to reform the tax code by consolidating and      lowering tax rates, broadening the tax base, and promoting      job creation and international competitiveness for American      businesses. This will make the tax code fairer and simplify      the filing process, allowing the vast majority of Americans      to file their taxes on a postcard.

If passed, the RSC's budget would give lawmakers a      serious conservative blueprint for reform.       Pro-Growth Tax Republicans campaigned and promised      to fix America's broken tax code. The current code has become      a significant obstacle to economic growth, job creation and      higher wages for American workers. The RSC budget would      fulfill the Republican campaign promise by enacting tax      reform that cuts taxes for families, makes American      businesses competitive around the globe, ends double      taxation, and simplifies the code.       Repealing Republicans owe their majorities to      their unwavering opposition to Obamacare, a reality that is      reflected in the RSC's budget. The budget remains committed      to fully repealing the law despite recent Republican      failures, and sends a signal to the American people that      conservatives will continue to push for free-market, patient-     centered health care reforms.       Funding Although the Budget Control Act of 2011      has put significant pressure on our military, a conservative      budget would align military spending with strategic      priorities by breaking the firewall. The RSC's budget does      not rely on the much-discussed OCO gimmick, but increases      defense spending to a total of $668 billion in FY18, which is      $119 billion above the current defense cap. Importantly, that      cost is offset by lowering non-defense discretionary spending      to $394 billion in FY18, which is $122 billion below the cap.       Reforming The RSC's budget maintains the      Medicare premium support reforms, which are widely      established and broadly supported. In addition, the budget      lays down bold markers on Social Security, Social Security      Disability Insurance and It takes a similarly      aggressive approach on mandatory program spending like food      stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP)      and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) by      building on the success of the 1996 welfare reforms and      enacting work requirements as outlined in the Welfare Reform      and Upward Mobility Act (H.2832/1290) and the      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Reform Act (H.     2996).       Other important items in the budget include: Enacting the      Financial CHOICE Act, eliminating the Consumer Financial      Protection Bureau (CFPB), holding federal agencies      accountable, reducing funding for the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA), separating food stamps and farm      programs, ending commodity subsidy programs, reforming crop      insurance, ending unconstitutional amnesty for illegal      immigrants, enforcing existing immigration laws, securing our      borders, delegating elementary and secondary education to      states and localities modeled after the Academic Partnership      Leads us to Success (A-PLUS) Act, reforming Higher Education      by passing the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO)      Act, eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, returning      transportation and infrastructure policy to the states,      reorganizing the executive branch, and protecting the life of      the unborn.       Taken as a whole, the RSC's ``Securing America's Future      Economy'' demonstrates a seriousness of purpose when it comes      to governing. If passed, this budget would provide a fiscally      responsible path forward for our nation, limit the size and      scope of our bloated federal government, and unleash economic      prosperity for all  Mr.Mr.Chairman, Just a few steps from this Hall, Thomas Jefferson addressed his first inaugural address. After listing all of the blessings that our country enjoys, he asked what more do we need to maintain a happy and prosperous society. He said: ``Still one thing more, fellow citizens. A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government. . . .''  We have it within our power to restore that wise and frugal government and the prosperity and happiness that free societies always produce the moment we summon the political will to do so. The Republican Study Committee seeks that shining city on a hill and today offers this map to get us there.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.                             recorded vote  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. =========================== NOTE ===========================     October 5, 2017, on page H7862, the following appeared: The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

REINSTATEMENT OF PAY-AS-YOU-      In the House, and pursuant to section 301(b)(8) of the      Congressional Budget Act of 1974, for the remainder of the      115th Congress, the following shall apply in lieu of      ``CUTGO'' rules and principles:       (1)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), it      shall not be in order to consider any bill, joint resolution,      amendment, or conference report if the provisions of such      measure affecting direct spending and revenues have the net      effect of increasing the on-budget deficit or reducing the      on-budget surplus for the period comprising either--       (i) the current year, the budget year, and the four years      following that budget year; or[[Page H7869]]       (ii) the current year, the budget year, and the nine years      following that budget year.       (B) The effect of such measure on the deficit or surplus      shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the      Committee on the       (C) For the purpose of this section, the terms ``budget      year'', ``current year'', and ``direct spending'' have the      meanings specified in section 250 of the Balanced Budget and      Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, except that the term      ``direct spending'' shall also include provisions in      appropriation Acts that make outyear modifications to      substantive law as described in section 3(4)(C) of the      Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.

EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING       The House adopts the provisions of this title--       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of      Representatives and as such they shall be considered as part      of the rules of the House, and these rules shall supersede      other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent      with other such rules; and       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of      the House of Representatives to change those rules at any      time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the      case of any other rule of the House of                      TITLE IV--POLICY STATEMENTS     401. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE                    COVERAGE FOR WORKING       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) Making health care coverage affordable and accessible      for all American families will improve their health and      financial security, which will make the economy stronger.       (2) Medicaid is the Nation's largest health insurance      program, providing quality, comprehensive, and affordable      coverage to more than 70 million vulnerable Americans,      including more than one in three children.       (3) Millions of low-income seniors and people with      disabilities rely on Medicaid to pay for nursing home care      and home- and community-based services that provide help with      activities of daily living.       (4) Medicaid coverage provides financial stability to      families struggling to escape poverty and to parents of      children with disabilities and special health care needs.       (5) The existing financing structure of Medicaid ensures      that Federal contributions keep pace with costs and enables      States to respond to changing needs, such as increased      enrollment in coverage during economic downturns or an aging      population that requires extensive long-term care services.       (6) Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 States and the      District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility to      low-income adults, including working parents who do not      receive coverage through their employers.       (7) Roughly 20 million previously uninsured people have      gained health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act,      reducing the Nation's uninsured rate for working-age adults      to one of the lowest levels on record.       (8) The law provides premium tax credits that vary by      income and the local cost of coverage and cost-sharing      assistance to help low- and middle-income families afford      quality insurance and pay their out-of-pocket costs.       (9) The law prohibits insurers from denying coverage or      charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions,      requires coverage of essential health benefits like maternity      care and prescription drugs, limits out-of-pocket costs, and      prohibits lifetime and annual limits on coverage.       (10) The law put in place significant cost-saving reforms      to Federal health programs that have played a part in slowing      the rate of healthcare spending growth in recent years, with      2011,2012, and 2013 experiencing the slowest growth rates in      real per capita national health expenditures on record.       (11) On May 4,2017, the House of Representatives passed      H.R.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, legislation      that would repeal provisions of the Affordable Care Act, make      deep cuts in Medicaid, and--       (A) result in 23 million Americans losing health insurance      in 2026, including 14 million people losing Medicaid;       (B) dramatically increase costs for older adults, low-     income families, and people with pre-existing conditions;       (C) reduce Medicaid spending by $834 billion over ten      years;       (D) jeopardize care for seniors in nursing homes, children      with disabilities, and families receiving Medicaid benefits      as States look to reduce coverage and services;       (E) severely undermine access to substance abuse treatment      during the nationwide opioid epidemic;       (F) shorten the life of the Medicare Hospital Insurance      Trust Fund; and       (G) provide nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts that mostly      benefit millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--       (1) Congress should build upon the progress of the      Affordable Care Act to make health care coverage more      affordable and accessible to all American families, and      reject any measures to repeal or undermine the law;       (2) the Administration and Congress should fully implement,      enforce, and fund the Affordable Care Act, and stop any      efforts to sabotage the health insurance marketplaces; and       (3) Congress should preserve Medicaid and not dismantle it      by converting Medicaid into a block grant, per capita cap, or      other financing arrangement that would limit Federal      contributions and render the program incapable of responding      to increased need that may result from trends in demographics      or health care costs or from economic conditions.     402. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON TAX REFORM THAT PROVIDES                    SUPPORT AND RELIEF TO HARDWORKING AMERICAN                          (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) Tax plans from House Republicans and President Trump      prioritize tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and      wealthy corporations, while shifting more of the burden onto      everyone else. Their plans fail to close special interest      loopholes in the tax code, and even add trillions of dollars      of new loopholes for the wealthy. These plans reflect the      failed theory of ``trickle-down'' economics, which creates      few jobs and instead leads to massive deficits. A return to      these policies would--       (A) fail to create good paying middle-class jobs;       (B) do nothing to help low-income or middle-class      households with the rising costs of health care, education,      housing, child care, or retirement; and       (C) widen the income gap between millionaires and      billionaires and the middle class.       (2) Americans today are working harder than ever, but      continue to struggle to find good jobs, get ahead, and stay      ahead. This is part of a four-decade trend of stagnant wages      for middle-class and low-income households, even as      millionaires and billionaires become richer and corporations      reap massive profits.       (3) The Obama Administration ended with 83 consecutive      months of private-sector job growth, but challenges still      remain to create more good-paying jobs and broadly shared      prosperity. The number of long-term unemployed remains      elevated, and unemployment for people of color continues to      be higher than the rest of the population. Many areas remain      in need of well-paying jobs.       (4) By almost any metric, the middle class has seen little      to no improvements in their incomes. Real median household      income in 2013 was only $7,000 higher than it was in 1979.      Median weekly real earnings for workers increased less than 1      percent from 1979 to 2014. Poorer workers have done even      worse. For workers in the lower half of the income scale,      real annual wages from 1979 to 2014 grew only $76. And the      entire lower 50 percent of the United States population holds      a mere 1 percent of total national wealth.       (5) All the while, millionaires and billionaires have seen      their incomes and wealth skyrocket. Incomes for the top one      percent of households grew five times as fast as for middle-     income workers, and now average over $1 million a year. CEOs      make nearly 300 times what the typical worker does. Ten      percent of the population owns 76 percent of the Nation's      total wealth, and the average net assets of the top one      percent now exceed $10 million per person.       (6) The top one percent of households receives a      disproportionate share--17 percent--of the benefit of major      tax expenditures. This uneven distribution of major tax      expenditures has exacerbated income and wealth inequality.      The tax code treats income from wealth more favorably than      income from work by giving preferential tax rates on unearned      income, and it contains numerous, wasteful tax breaks for      special interests.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House to responsibly      reform the tax code to provide support and relief to low- and      middle-income families, create good-paying jobs, and drive      broadly-shared prosperity, while closing special-interest      loopholes and making sure the wealthiest Americans pay their      fair share.     403. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON DEFENSE AND NONDEFENSE                    FUNDING       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:[[Page H7870]]       (1) The current spending limits set by the Budget Control      Act of 2011 are too low, for both defense and nondefense      funding. Defense and nondefense investments must be at      appropriate levels to protect both national security and      economic security. The nondefense discretionary spending      limit for 2018 is $2 billion less than it was in 2016, in      nominal terms, representing a significant cut to purchasing      power. If the inflation rate is what the Congressional Budget      Office projects, the 2018 cap represents a reduction of      nearly $30 billion compared with 2016. Defense spending faces      similar reductions.       (2) The Budget Control Act of 2011 is based on parity for      defense and nondefense spending, setting up separate caps for      both and instituting a ``firewall'' to prevent reductions in      one category because of increases in the other.       (3) Bipartisan agreement has provided a solution to the      austerity-level caps before, and can be used again to change      these arbitrary spending caps to prevent the harsh impact of      massive, irresponsible cuts to important Federal programs.       (4) Congress must begin discussions and negotiations      immediately, to raise the caps to appropriate levels, and      maintain parity between defense and nondefense.       (b) Policy on Defense and Nondefense Funding Increases.--It      is the policy of the House that Congress should enact      increases to the current defense and nondefense spending      limits, in equal amounts, without using reductions in one      category to pay for increases in the other.     404. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON IMMIGRATION       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) Fixing the country's broken immigration system will      mean safer communities, a stronger economy and lower budget      deficits.       (2) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting      the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration      Modernization Act, as introduced by House Democrats in the      113th Congress, would have reduced the deficit by $900      billion over the next 2 decades, boosting the economy by 5.4      percent, and increasing productivity by 1.0 percent.       (3) The Social Security Actuary estimated that immigration      reform will reduce the Social Security shortfall by 8 percent      and will extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund by      2 years.       (4) The United States is a Nation founded, built and      sustained by immigrants, and the Congress has a      responsibility to harness the power of that tradition by      implementing an effective and fair immigration policy.       (5) The current immigration system is broken because it      keeps families of legal immigrants and United States citizens      separated for decades, it allows for the exploitation of      undocumented workers to the detriment of all workers, it does      not meet the needs of our economy and discourages legal      immigration, and it keeps millions of hard-working, law-     abiding families who have lived in our communities for      decades hiding in the shadows, including many thousands who      came to the United States as infants or young children.       (6) Overly aggressive immigration enforcement that focuses      on individuals with deep ties to the United States hurts      State and local law enforcement efforts to establish and      maintain trust with immigrant communities. The number of      Latinos reporting crimes in big cities across the country is      lower than past years, particularly among domestic violence      and sexual assault victims.       (7) The vast majority of individuals in U.Immigration      and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody have not been convicted      of a serious crime. ICE's own statistics demonstrate that      arrests of people with no criminal record increased 157      percent in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration,      and only 6.5 percent of those arrested were convicted of      violent crimes.       (8) The number of detained asylum seekers continues to rise      dramatically and detaining asylum seekers, other vulnerable      populations, and those who do not pose risks to public safety      is unnecessary and wasteful.       (9) Increasing the use of alternatives to detention rather      than expanding immigration detention would be more humane and      cost-effective.       (10) It has been nearly four years since the Senate passed,      on a bipartisan basis, its comprehensive immigration reform      bill.       (11) Immigration reform is needed to secure the sovereignty      of the United States of America and to establish a coherent      and just system for integrating those who seek to join      American society.       (12) A successful immigration system cannot rely on border      security alone. The country needs a system that promotes the      reunification of families, protects workers and is responsive      to the needs of employers, and implements an inclusive      legalization program for those who are currently here.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress      enact comprehensive immigration reform - such as the Border      Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization      Act, introduced by House Democrats in the 113th Congress - to      boost our economy, lower deficits, establish clear and just      rules for citizenship, and make our communities safer.     405. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON SOCIAL       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) Most of the 61 million Americans who currently receive      earned Social Security benefits rely on these benefits for      the majority of their income, with nearly a quarter of them      relying on Social Security for at least 90 percent of their      income.       (2) In the past, Social Security benefits were part of a 3-     legged stool where retirees relied on a combination of Social      Security, a private pension, and personal savings to finance      retirement.       (3) Social Security benefits will be more important to      future retirees as few workers will receive traditional      pensions, and many workers cannot afford to adequately fund      their retirement through employer-sponsored savings plans or            (4) Social Security's Disability Insurance (DI) and Old Age      and Survivors Insurance (OASI) systems are intertwined both      in their benefit structure and in their revenues - DI      recipients who reach retirement age receive OASI benefits and      beneficiaries in each category have helped finance the other      category even if they will never receive those benefits.       (5) Social Security benefits are already being cut as      Social Security's normal retirement age is increasing from 66      years for workers retiring now to 67 years for those born in      1960 and later. This cut disproportionately impacts low-     earners because life expectancy continues to increase among      higher-earners but not low-earners. Thus, high-earners will      generally receive benefits for a longer time than low-     earners.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that the House      of Representatives will not adopt changes to Social Security      that involve reductions in earned Social Security benefits.     406. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON PROTECTING THE MEDICARE                    GUARANTEE FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH                          (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) Senior citizens and persons with disabilities highly      value the Medicare program and rely on Medicare to guarantee      their health and financial security.       (2) In 2018,60,0,000 people will rely on Medicare for      coverage of hospital stays, physician visits, prescription      drugs, and other necessary medical goods and services.       (3) The Medicare program has lower administrative costs      than private insurance, and Medicare costs per enrollee have      grown at a slower rate than private insurance for a given      level of benefits.       (4) People with Medicare already have the ability to choose      a private insurance plan within Medicare through the Medicare      Advantage option, yet two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries      chose the traditional fee-for-service program instead of a      private plan in 2016.       (5) Rising health care costs are not unique to Medicare or      other Federal health programs, they are endemic to the entire      health care system.       (6) Converting Medicare into a voucher for the purchase of      health insurance will merely force seniors and individuals      with disabilities to pay much higher premiums if they want to      use their voucher to purchase traditional Medicare coverage.       (7) A voucher system in which the voucher payment fails to      keep pace with growth in health costs would expose seniors      and persons with disabilities on fixed incomes to      unacceptable financial risks.       (8) Shifting more health care costs onto Medicare      beneficiaries would not reduce overall health care costs,      instead it would mean beneficiaries would face higher      premiums, eroding coverage, or both.       (9) Versions of voucher policies that do not immediately      end the traditional Medicare program will merely set it up      for a death spiral as private plans siphon off healthier and      less expensive beneficiaries, leaving the sickest      beneficiaries in a program that will wither away.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that the      Medicare guarantee for seniors and persons with disabilities      should be preserved and strengthened, and that any      legislation to end the Medicare guarantee, financially      penalize people for choosing traditional Medicare, or shift      rising health care costs onto seniors by replacing Medicare      with vouchers or premium support for the purchase of health      insurance, should be rejected.     407. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON FINANCIAL STABILITY AND                    CONSUMER       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer      Protection Act of 2010 is an important component of the      country's response to the financial crisis and recession. It      took a number of steps to protect consumers of financial      products and services as well as protect taxpayers from the      costs of another financial crisis.       (2) These steps included the creation of an orderly      liquidation process to allow regulators to close failing      institutions that some argue are ``too big to fail,'' as well      as a new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an      Office of Financial Research to monitor the stability of our      financial system, and the Consumer Financial Protection      Bureau (the Consumer Bureau).       (3) The Consumer Bureau plays a critical role in protecting      older Americans, military service members, student loan      borrowers, and other consumers, especially in minority and      low-income communities. It has implemented new rules for      mortgage markets and prepaid cards, and also successfully      recovered nearly $12 billion on behalf of more than 29      million consumers and service members.[[Page H7871]]       (4) The Consumer Bureau's funding from the Federal      Reserve's operations help give it important independence from      efforts to interfere with its vital mission and activities,      independence on par with every other banking regulator.       (5) The Consumer Bureau has already faced and overcome      efforts to obstruct its operations.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress      should continue to support the vital work of the Consumer      Financial Protection Bureau as well as its governing and      financing structures and other key components of the Dodd-     Frank legislation such as orderly liquidation authority,      FSOC, and the Office of Financial     408. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON WOMEN'S ECONOMIC                          (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) Women's contributions are critical to the economic      success of hard-working families.       (2) Not only do women play a key role in maintaining      healthy families, they also have unique health care needs and      face issues that require special focus.       (3) Every hard-working American deserves to feel safe and      supported during retirement. Yet women are more likely to      face financial risk during retirement because of their lower      lifetime earnings and disproportionate role as family      caregivers.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress      should economically empower women and protect their health      and safety. Congress must enact policies that would      accomplish the following:       (1) Help families attain better jobs, fight pay inequity,      raise the minimum wage, and enable women entrepreneurs and      small businesses to achieve their goals.       (2) Give American families control of their own lives, and      help them balance the demands of work and family. These      policies include paid and expanded family and medical leave,      paid sick days, and quality, affordable child care.       (3) Strengthen the retirement security of women and their      families by protecting Social Security, Medicare and            (4) Support caregivers, many of whom sacrifice their own      careers to provide for family members.       (5) Maintain health insurance protections for women,      increase funding for the prevention and treatment of women's      health issues such as breast cancer and heart disease, and      support access to full reproductive care.       (6) Prevent and protect women from domestic violence and      sexual abuse.     409. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON NATIONAL       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) The country faces many national security challenges and      we must continue to support a strong military that is second      to none.       (2) Those who serve in uniform are our most important      security resource and the Administration and Congress shall      continue to provide the support they need to successfully      carry out the missions the country gives them.       (3) A growing economy is the foundation of our security and      enables the country to provide the resources for a strong      military, sound homeland security agencies, and effective      diplomacy and international development.       (4) Austerity-level spending caps threaten adequate      investment in activities critical to our economy and national      security, which include activities funded by both the defense      and nondefense portions of the discretionary budget.       (5) Diplomacy and foreign aid are essential components of      our security and the President's proposal to cut these      activities by 32 percent below current levels prompted more      than 120 retired admirals and generals who have first-hand      knowledge of their effectiveness in securing our Nation to      forcefully object.       (6) The Nation's projected long-term debt could have      serious consequences for our economy and security, and that      more efficient military spending has to be part of an overall      plan that effectively deals with this problem.       (7) Reining in wasteful spending at the Nation's security      agencies, including the Department of Defense--the last      department still unable to pass an audit--such as the      elimination of duplicative programs and better controlling      delays and cost overruns on weapon systems that have been      identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO)      needs to continue as a priority.       (8) The Department of Defense should continue to review      defense plans and requirements to ensure that weapons      developed to counter Cold War-era threats are not redundant,      are affordable, and are applicable to 21st century threats;      and such review should include, with the participation of the      National Nuclear Security Administration, examination of      requirements for, and cost of, the nuclear weapons stockpile,      nuclear weapons delivery systems, and nuclear weapons and      infrastructure modernization.       (9) Nonwar operation and maintenance costs per active-duty      service member have grown at a rate well above inflation for      decades--from $59,000 per service member in 1980 to $157,000      per service member in 2015 (measured in constant 2017      dollars), and it is imperative that unsustainable cost growth      be controlled in this area.       (10) Cooperative threat reduction and other      nonproliferation programs (securing ``loose nukes'' and other      materials used in weapons of mass destruction), which were      highlighted as high priorities by the 9/11 Commission, need      to be funded at a level that is commensurate with the      evolving threat.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--       (1) the austerity-level spending caps required by the      Budget Control Act of 2011 for fiscal years 2018 through 2021      should be rescinded and replaced by a fiscal plan that is      balanced and takes into account a comprehensive national      security strategy that includes careful consideration of      international, defense, homeland security, and law      enforcement programs; and       (2) efficiencies can be achieved in the national defense      budget without compromising our security through greater      emphasis on eliminating duplicative and wasteful programs,      reforming the acquisition process, identifying and      constraining unsustainable operating costs, and through      careful analysis of our national security needs.     410. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON VETERANS       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to      face challenges meeting the needs of the next generation of      returning veterans, including sufficient funding to provide      critical services and benefits.       (2) Access to quality health care and veterans' benefits      has been an ongoing challenge for the VA, highlighted most      recently in the ongoing claims backlog and veterans waiting      months for health care appointments.       (3) Providing health care where veterans live and ensuring      a sufficient number of health care professionals, especially      in the area of mental health treatment, have also been      challenges.       (4) The VA has made progress in reducing the number of      initial benefit claims, dropping the claims backlog to less      than 94,000 from a peak of 611,000 claims just a few years      ago, but that statistic leaves out the many veterans who are      still waiting many months or even years to have their appeals      decided.       (5) The President's budget includes a 6 percent increase      over current-year funding but shifts funding away from      critical programs that veterans rely on in favor of expanded      funding that pays for certain veterans to get private health      care at the expense of care provided at VA hospitals and      clinics.       (6) The President's budget also cuts funding from other      Federal agencies that provide lifesaving programs and      services for veterans, including deep cuts to Medicaid      benefits veterans rely on, the elimination of the Interagency      Council on Homelessness, steep cuts at the Department of      Housing and Urban Development, elimination of the Legal      Services Corporation, and severe cuts to entrepreneurship      outreach programs targeted to veterans through the Small      Business       (7) The VA currently has advance appropriations for      approximately 85 percent of its discretionary budget. The      residual 15 percent, which includes funding for the day-to-     day operations at the Veterans Benefits Administration,      remains vulnerable to a Government shutdown.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--       (1) Congress should support a funding level no less than      the President's request for veterans' discretionary programs      so that the VA has the resources it needs to ensure veterans      get the health care and benefits they earned in a timely      fashion;       (2) Congress should lift the austerity-level funding cap on      nondefense programs for 2018 and beyond to ensure adequate      funding for veterans' programs;       (3) advance appropriations be expanded to cover all of VA's      discretionary budget to prevent delays in veterans' benefits      and services during a Government shutdown;       (4) the VA submit along with its annual budget a ``Future-     Years Veterans Program'' that projects its needs over five      years to help facilitate the appropriations and oversight      processes;       (5) Congress should provide sufficient resources for the      VA's Office of the Inspector General to guarantee veterans      are properly served and that resources are spent efficiently;       (6) no changes be made to the Individual Unemployability      benefit to ensure that disabled veterans, many of them      severely disabled, who are deemed unable to engage in      substantial work as a result of their service to our country,      continue to receive the full disability and social security      benefits they earned and were promised; and       (7) Congress shall provide sufficient funding and staff      resources for VA hospitals and clinics, and that any      increased funding for private and community care not provided      directly by the VA should not come at the expense of      necessary resources for VA hospitals and clinics.     411. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON DISASTER RESPONSE       (a) Findings.--The House find the following:       (1) Natural disasters such as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and      Maria require swift congressional action to help storm      survivors get their lives back on track, rebuild disaster-     stricken communities, and prevent further damage to the      economy.       (2) The Budget Control Act of 2001 provides procedural      tools specifically to respond to[[Page H7872]]     natural disasters, by allowing adjustments to the spending      caps for disaster and emergency spending.       (3) Mitigation and prevention is an important part of      disaster recovery and response, providing investments that      make future disasters less costly in terms of both dollars      and lives.       (b) Policy on Funding for Disaster Response and Recovery.--     It is the policy of the House that Congress should act      swiftly to assist with recovery from hurricanes and other      natural disasters. Such funding should be provided using the      budgetary provisions in place for this purpose: providing      adjustments to the spending caps for disaster and emergency      response, recovery, and mitigation. Congress must also      support efforts to address future disaster damage and loss,      by appropriately funding mitigation and prevention efforts.     412. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON THE FEDERAL       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) The Federal workforce provides vital services to our      Nation on a daily basis. It includes those who patrol and      secure our borders, protect us from terrorists, take care of      our veterans, help run our airports, counter cyber-attacks,      find cures for deadly diseases, and keep our food supply      safe.       (2) Veterans make up 31 percent of the Federal workforce.       (3) Many Federal workers are paid at a rate that is far      below their private sector counterparts.       (4) The Federal workforce is older than in past decades and      older than the private sector workforce. Nearly one third of      the Federal workforce is eligible to retire.       (5) Federal employee pay and benefits are not the cause of      the country's deficits and debt. The Federal workforce has      already contributed more than $180 billion toward reducing      the country's deficits in the form of pay freezes, pay raises      insufficient to keep pace with inflation, furloughs, and      increased retirement contributions. The President's budget      for 2018 continues to unfairly target the Federal workforce      by proposing an additional $149 billion in compensation and      retirement benefit cuts.       (6) Since 1975, the Federal workforce has declined 35      percent relative to the size of the population of the United            (7) Nearly all of the increase in the Federal civilian      workforce from 2001 to 2016 is due to increases at security-     related agencies, including the Department of Defense,      Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Veterans            (8) Proposals to reduce the size of the workforce at      nonsecurity agencies by 10 percent have excluded an      assessment of their impact on government services.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress      should not target Federal employees to achieve further      reductions in the deficit as they have already contributed      more than their fair share, that Federal workers should be      compensated with pay and benefits at a level that enables the      government to attract high quality people--which is      especially important during this period when more workers      will be retiring--and that no proposal to reduce the size of      the workforce should be considered without an assessment of      its impact on government services.     413. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON CLIMATE CHANGE       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) Global climate change is a threat to national security,      public health, and economic growth.       (2) The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate      Change concluded that the effects of climate change are      occurring worldwide, stating: ``The impacts of climate change      have already been felt in recent decades on all continents      and across the oceans''.       (3) The United States Government Accountability Office      described climate change as, ``a complex, crosscutting issue      that poses risks to many environmental and economic systems--     including agriculture, infrastructure, ecosystems, and human      health--and presents a significant financial risk to the      Federal Government''.       (4) In March 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, in      written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee,      stated that ``climate change can be a driver of instability      and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential      adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon''.       (5) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and      National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that      2016 was the warmest year on record, setting a new record for      global average surface temperatures for the third year in a      row. Furthermore, 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have      occurred since 2001.       (6) The United States National Research Council's National      Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee found      climate change affects ``human health, water supply,      agriculture, transportation, energy, coastal areas, and many      other sectors of society, with increasingly adverse impacts      on the American economy and quality of life''.       (7) The most vulnerable among us, including children, the      elderly, low-income individuals, and those with underlying      health conditions, face even greater health risks as a result      of climate change.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that climate      change presents a significant public health, environmental,      and financial risk to the United The United States      must continue to play a leadership role on climate change      policy and should not retreat from global commitments on      climate change. Congress must provide robust funding for      climate change science, which provides critical information      for protecting human health, defending the United States, and      preserving economic and environmental systems throughout the      world.     414. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND                    ELIMINATING       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) The Government Accountability Office (``GAO'')      identifies examples of waste, duplication, and overlap in      Federal programs, and makes regular recommendations regarding      ways to reduce costs and increase revenue.       (2) The Comptroller General has stated that addressing the      identified waste, duplication, and overlap in Federal      programs ``could lead to tens of billions of dollars of      additional savings, with significant opportunities for      improved efficiencies, cost savings, or revenue enhancements      in the areas of defense, information technology, education      and training, health care, energy, and tax enforcement.''       (3) The tax gap, the difference between taxes owed and      taxes paid, now averages $458 billion annually. Even modest      improvements in enforcing existing law could yield a boost in      revenue without any changes to the tax code.       (4) Tax expenditures, or spending through the tax code,      total $1.5 trillion per year and represent the largest      category of spending in the budget -- exceeding Medicare,      Medicaid, and Social However, unlike other types of      spending, tax expenditures are not reviewed in any systematic      way in the annual budget process.       (5) Improper payments, payments that should not have been      made or that were made in an incorrect amount, totaled $144      billion for 2016. While some improper payments are the result      of fraud, the vast majority are due to unintentional errors,      such as payments to eligible beneficiaries that were not      properly verified, or overpayments or underpayments because      of a data entry mistake.       (6) Shutting down the government, arbitrarily cutting      agency budgets, and funding large portions of the government      through stop-gap appropriations do not lead to efficient and      effective government.       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress      must continue to root out wasteful spending, make government      operations more efficient, pass appropriations bills on time,      and avoid costly government shutdowns. Congress must task      agencies with shrinking the error rate in government programs      and provide adequate budgetary resources for agencies to      develop new processes, review expenditures, and improve      information technology systems.     415. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIAN                    INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 U.PRESIDENTIAL                          (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:       (1) Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our      democracy, and foreign interference in them undermines the      public trust and casts doubt on the legitimacy of our      government.       (2) The country's intelligence agencies all agree that      Russia launched a campaign to undermine the 2016 U.     presidential election, which included cyber-attacks,      dissemination of false information, and other intelligence      operations to malign Secretary Hillary Clinton and increase      the odds of a Donald Trump presidency.       (3) Members of the Trump campaign had repeated contact with      Russian government officials and oligarchs and then failed to      report this contact in testimony to Congress and in security      clearance applications. One such meeting reportedly included      a request for a back-channel line of communications with the      Russian government using Russian facilities, which would      preclude U.Government oversight. Another involved a      Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer and a former Soviet      counterintelligence officer under the assumption that they      would provide politically damaging information about      Secretary Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's      effort to support the Trump campaign.       (4) Under the direction of Federal Bureau of Investigation      Director James Comey, the FBI was investigating whether      members of President Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to      influence the election.       (5) On May 9,2017, President Trump fired FBI Director      Comey and then made statements suggesting his dismissal was      to stop the investigation of collusion.       (6) On May 17,2017, the Department of Justice announced      the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller III      to serve as Special Counsel to investigate Russian      interference into the 2016 presidential election and any      coordination between the Russian government and individuals      associated with the Trump campaign.       (b) Policy on the Investigation of Russian Interference in      the 2016 U.Presidential Election.--It is the policy of      this concurrent resolution that to restore confidence in our      government and to preserve the sanctity of our electoral      process, Congress must ensure adequate funding for the[[Page H7873]]     Special Counsel appointed by the Department of Justice so      that he can perform a thorough and nonpartisan investigation      of Russia's campaign to affect the 2016 U.presidential      election and any individuals in the United States that may      have colluded in those efforts.

104,topic-id,430,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, Democrats and Republicans are looking at the same challenges facing our country and American families. Education, healthcare, and housing costs have all increased while wages stay stagnant.  It used to be that the two parties would debate different strategies to address the problems facing the American people. Sadly, those times are behind us.  In giving millionaires, including the majority of this Congress, the President, and wealthy donors a giant tax cut, the Republican budget does not even pretend to address the problems facing the American people. Not only does it ignore working families, it increases their challenges.  The Democratic budget alternative, in stark contrast to the Republican budget, begins to address the real challenges our country faces now and in the long term.                              {time}  1015  We are less than a decade removed from the worst economic crisis in most of our lifetimes, and we have a chance to rebound in a way that builds a foundation for our country to thrive for generations, but we have to seize that opportunity.  Rather than giving resources to people and businesses that already have them, we are calling for targeted investments in programs that grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and provide real support for working families and real security in retirement.  Rather than sending thank-you notes to the corporations that bankroll campaigns, we have an opportunity to make vital public investments that lead to a brighter future rebuilding roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure, all of which lead to good jobs now and in the long run.  Rather than giving the President a multimillion-dollar refund on taxes he refuses to disclose, we can invest in retirement security for seniors who didn't inherit millions. We can invest in affordable education so young people do not have to grow up wealthy to have a shot at earning it in their future careers.  Instead of taking healthcare away from people, straining emergency rooms, and making Americans sicker, we have an opportunity to continue investing in affordable quality healthcare for all of us, finally eliminating a great burden on American families, a burden that no other developed nation shares.  This budget is an opportunity for our country to invest in our future, and if we adopt the Republican budget plan, we will have squandered it.  Democrats believe in a government that prioritizes American families, and they should be the priorities of this I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican budget and support the Democratic alternative.

401,topic-id,1083,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, the Republican budget we are debating here today is a shockingly extreme document that gives to the rich and takes from everyone else. It calls for more than $5 trillion in spending cuts that threaten our economic progress and our national security, and it willfully ignores the needs and priorities of the American people.  This budget isn't about conservative policy or reducing the size of our debt and deficits. It is not even about American families. This budget is about one thing: using budget reconciliation to ram through giant tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations and to do it without bipartisan support.                              {time}  1415  This budget and the tax cuts it exists to support are built on a foundation of lies. They are part of a dangerous and deceptive three-step process Republicans have used before with serious consequences for our Nation and the American people.  This is what they do. First, my Republican colleagues call for massive tax cuts for the rich, claiming they will generate so much economic growth, that they will pay for themselves. Last week, congressional Republicans announced a $2.4 trillion tax cut plan that benefits the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Yes, I said trillions with a  For example, under this tax plan, millions of families making $50,000 a year would be subject to a tax increase, while millionaires get a $230,000 average tax cut. That is not tax reform. That is a shakedown.  In total, individuals will see their taxes go up by more than $450 billion, while corporations, wealthy pass-through entities, and rich estates get a tax cut totaling $2.9 trillion.  One might justifiably ask why anyone would want to do that. After all, the income disparity in the United States is greater than almost every other country on Earth, and it is getting larger. Just a few decades ago, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned about one-fourth of all national income. Today, it is close to 40 percent. Yet, once this plan is fully phased in, 80 percent of the entire tax cut in this plan goes to just the top 1 percent, while 45 percent of all households with children see a tax increase.  You could be someone who gets a $1 million salary, owns billions in corporate stock, be a partner in a hedge fund, or just the heir to a massive fortune, no matter the type of millionaire you are, Republicans make sure you will get a tax cut. No matter how many times President Trump, Secretary Mnuchin, or my colleagues across the aisle say it and how much they hope the American people will fall for it, these tax cuts won't pay for themselves.  That is not just my argument. That is the conclusion of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, and respected economists of all stripes.  Conservative economist and former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin said: ``There is just no evidence that the tax cuts actually pay for themselves.''  Even Goldman Sachs, Secretary Mnuchin's former employer, says any growth will be minimal, maybe up to two-tenths of a percent.  Bruce Bartlett, the man who wrote Reaganomics, which codified the trickle-down theory, told Congress last week that he now thinks it is: ``bull.'' Well, that is half of the word he used, but you get the idea.  The historical record is clear. We went through this in the early 1980s, the early 2000s under George Bush, and we recently saw it play out to disastrous effect in Now congressional Republicans want to try it again.  We all know the truth. The tax cuts in this plan will increase deficits and debt by approximately $2.4 trillion in the first 10 years alone and trillions more in the years after. These aren't special, supernatural tax cuts. They aren't going to magically defy expert analysis, historical precedence, and empirical evidence. This budget will[[Page H7779]]blow enormous holes in the Federal budget, which brings me to the second part of the Republican deception.  When the growth fails to happen as promised and these tax cuts keep digging our economy down deeper and deeper, Republicans will again bemoan the horrors of deficits and debt.  These cries will lead us to the third and final part of the plan. They will call for congressional action, not to roll back the tax cuts to the wealthy that caused all the damage, but for drastic cuts to important programs that the American people need and support. Education, healthcare, research, infrastructure, and veterans' benefits are already threatened in this budget. It includes an astonishing $5.4 trillion in spending cuts; $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid alone. It even assumes $49 billion in cuts to veterans' benefits.  The enormity of these cuts and the severity of the consequences for American families cannot be overstated, but more cuts will be coming if my Republicans get their way with this budget. We will see more attacks on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition assistance, on important benefits and services that help American families get ahead, and on key investments that keep our economy and our Nation strong.  To be clear, and with all due respect to my friend and colleague from Tennessee, by voting on this budget, for this budget, they are jeopardizing meals and food assistance for 515,000 hungry children in Tennessee so that the wealthiest person in that State, who has a net worth of $8.8 billion, can get a massive tax cut.  Democrats have a different budget and a far different vision for our country. Our priorities reflect the priorities of the American people.  We invest in programs that will grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and provide real support for working families; public investments that lead to a brighter future, such as rebuilding roads, bridges, and other vital infrastructure; retirement security for seniors now and for millions of Americans who fear they will never be able to afford to stop working; affordable education so that young people will be able to compete for the careers of the future; affordable, quality childcare for hardworking parents; and affordable quality healthcare for all  We believe in a government that helps individuals with nowhere left to turn and a Tax Code that helps families get ahead. Those are American priorities, and they should be the priorities of this  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the Democratic alternative.

518,topic-id,1113,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, we have had numerous letters submitted to us taking a position in opposition to this budget resolution, and I think they are pretty compelling, and I would like to read from some of them.  Here is a letter from the Main Street Alliance:       Main Street Alliance, a network of small business owners      throughout the country, strongly urges you to oppose      71, the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. This budget,      if enacted into law, would cut $3.4 trillion from Medicaid,      Medicare, Social Security, education, employment and      training, food and housing assistance, and infrastructure      spending over the next 10 years. This will significantly harm      small business owners and their employees, damage local      economies, and decimate State budgets.       We urge you to protect Main Street small business owners,      working families, communities, and economies, and oppose the      House budget resolution. Reject any budget that enables tax      cuts for the very wealthy and large profitable corporations      to lose revenue, since it will force deep cuts in vital      programs that harm small business.  This letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare:       On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the      National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare,      I urge you to oppose 71, the House fiscal year      2018 budget resolution, and the Republican Study Committee      budget. Instead, I ask you to support the Democratic Caucus,      Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Congressional Black      Caucus budgets.       The committee-passed budget resolution would slash funding      to Medicare and Medicaid, repeal the Affordable Care Act, and      make it easier for Congress to cut Social Security, all to      pay for massive tax cuts for the very wealthy and profitable      corporations.  This from the American Public Health Association:       On behalf of the American Public Health Association, a      diverse community of public health professionals who champion      the health of all people and communities, I write in strong      opposition to the House FY 2018 budget resolution,      71. This proposal does not eliminate sequestration and      would drastically cut nondefense discretionary spending. Such      cuts would devastate our Nation's public health and safety      net system and would have a disproportionate impact on our      Nation's most vulnerable citizens.       The proposal also includes the House passed repeal of the      Affordable Care Act that would force millions to lose      coverage, end the Medicaid expansion, drastically reduce      Federal funding for the Medicaid program, and lead to      increased cost and fewer benefits for millions of  This letter from the AFSCME, American Federation of State and County Municipal Employees:       On behalf of the 1.6 million members of AFSCME, I urge you      to oppose 71, the fiscal year 2018 budget      resolution approved by the House Budget Committee and      scheduled to be considered in the full       This budget would impose considerable hardship on many      Americans in order to slash taxes for the wealthy and      corporations to boost defense spending. Rather than      increasing revenues for investment that creates jobs and      spurs economic growth, the proposed budget creates a fast-     track process for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit      corporations and the wealthy.       In fact, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center,      the Trump GOP tax cut would largely benefit the richest 1      percent. The budget also relies on the gimmicks of dynamic      scoring and sham accounting, hiding the true cost of      unnecessary and harmful tax cuts.  And this, from AARP:       Proposals creating a defined contribution premium support      program, restricting access by raising the age of      eligibility, or allowing hospitals and providers to      arbitrarily charge customers higher prices than Medicare can      make healthcare unaffordable for older These      proposals do little to actually lower the cost of healthcare      but simply shifts cost from Medicare on to individuals, many      of whom cannot afford to pay for their care.       Efforts to reduce or cap Medicaid funding could endanger      the health, safety, and care of millions of individuals who      depend on the essential services provided through this      program.       Furthermore, caps could result in significant cost shifts      to State governments unable to shoulder the cost of care      without sufficient Federal support.

We will be      watching how you vote on this important issue.  This is a letter from the Coalition on Human Needs:       On behalf of the Coalition on Human Needs, I strongly urge      you to vote ``no'' on 71, the proposed FY 2018      budget resolution, and to vote for the substitute budgets      advanced by the Congressional Progressive Caucus,      Congressional Black Caucus, and the Democratic alternative      budget resolution. Our members understand that the economic      security of millions of American families depends on building      on the progress we have made in health coverage, jobs, basic      living standards, and ensuring that our children are well      prepared for productive lives.       But the majority's proposed budget does not build. It      breaks apart our engines of progress. It will make our Nation      weaker for decades to come.       The budget advanced by the House Budget Committee would be      a dangerous backwards plunge, stripping trillions of dollars      from programs that work to reduce poverty and create security      and opportunity.       Medicaid, Medicare, working family tax credits, nutrition      assistance, education, and housing assistance, these are just      some of the services the budget would massively cut.       The budget takes trillions in funding that supports      economic security and progress and hands it to the wealthy      and corporations in the form of enormous tax cuts.

524,topic-id,1163,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Chairman, this has been a robust debate. We had a robust debate in the Rules Committee yesterday, and we have had robust debates in the committee markup and during hearings, as well, over the priorities of this country.  As we close this debate tonight, recognizing there will be a few minutes tomorrow for comments, I just want to say that, since this could very well be the last time that I get to appear in Budget Committee business with Chairman Black, I have truly cherished the 9 months that we have spent working together.  The chairman is a gracious, fair, thoughtful, and very, very collegial individual, and I wish her the best in her campaign, at least through the primary. I thank her and her very, very competent and professional staff for all of the courtesies they have shown us during this year and this process.  I also want to pay tribute to the Democratic staff, people who work very, very hard every day and are brilliant in their fields and make me sound smarter than I probably am, but I would like to read their names: Jon Antista; Erika Appel; Ellen Balis, the staff director; Hayden Flanery; Jon Goldman; Elliott Grantz; Jocelyn Harris; Najy Kamal; Sam Lau; Sheila McDowell; Diana Meredith; Farouk Ophaso; Kimberly Overbeek; Scott Russell; and Ted  They do terrific work, and I want them to know how much I and all the members of the Budget Committee, the minority, appreciate their work.  I would also like to thank my personal staff, led by my chief of staff, Julie Carr, for the work they contribute to this process as well.  In closing, there are a few comments I want to make about this debate.  We heard several times during the day that it is really not fair to talk about the consequences of the tax proposal that will be the end result of this process because the details haven't been ironed out yet. That is, you know, fair enough as it goes, but there were enough details in the outline that we saw last week to make a pretty good guess as to what the impact of these tax cuts would be.  Now, we have read over and over, as Republican speakers spoke, the fact that they were willing to jeopardize the health and safety and nutrition of their citizens to give the wealthiest people in their State tax cuts. Most of these numbers that we read were in the billions of dollars: $38 billion, $16 billion. These are individuals with net worths of astounding amounts.  The outline that was publicly released last week said that the Republicans intend, under this tax proposal, to eliminate the estate tax. If they eliminate the estate tax, much of that money is not going to be taxed. They will get to keep it. I don't think that they are going to be out there creating new companies. Maybe their children will do it if they inherit it. Maybe they have given some of it away so those estates aren't quite as big. I suspect many of them have.  The point is, when you are talking about wealth, collectively, the wealthiest persons in the 50 States, collectively, have $750 billion in net worth, which means that, if they paid the estate tax, there would be over $300 billion in money that they would save if you eliminated the estate tax.  So while, yes, we may be off plus or minus 3 percent or 5 percent or 10 percent, the fact is that this is an enormous break for the people who have been the most fortunate in this country. I think it is more than fair to say, if you say you are going to eliminate the estate tax, if you say you are going to eliminate the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, and we can go look at President Trump's 2005 tax return, which said he paid $31 million in tax because of the alternative minimum tax, it doesn't take any details to know that he would have saved $31 million in that year if you eliminate the alternative minimum tax.  So, yes, the rates may vary. Ultimately, the tax bill that we have presented to us may not lower the highest rate from 39.6 to 35 percent, but if it does, we know the impact that that will have. We know who will benefit most from that. It is the wealthiest 1 percent of this country.  As I will say tomorrow when we close this debate, I am in the top 1 percent. Half of this body are millionaires. They are all going to benefit. We are all going to benefit. Meanwhile, the people who rely on many of the programs that will be slashed under this Republican budget will suffer. That is not fair.  Now, Republicans will make the argument, as they always do because this is a matter of religious faith to them, that if you give people more money, they will magically create all this growth. Well, has that really happened?  Out of the Fortune 500 companies, I think, in a recent study, 92 of them paid 20 percent or less in corporate tax. Collectively, they eliminated 300,000 jobs over a 5-year period. So they had more money than corporations paying 35 percent. Did they use it to create more jobs, more wealth among middle class and working families? They used it to pay dividends, to buy back stock, and to increase the wages of their  That is what has happened in modern history every time we lower corporate tax rates or we let them bring taxes in from overseas. They do not create more jobs with the money that they save.  So I think it is very, very fair for us to look at this entire process, the budget proposal, which does anticipate a tax cut--which they claim is revenue neutral, but it is a tax cut--and the outline that we saw last week and say: Who, really, is this going to help?  It is not going to help the people who need the help. It is going to give more money to the people who already occupy one of the strongest economic positions in a country with the greatest disparity of wealth in the world.  So as we conclude this debate, I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the alternatives that will be proposed by the Democratic Caucus, by the Congressional Black Caucus, and by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and compare the values and the priorities of those budgets to those that the Republican budget represents.  I think, on balance, anybody in good faith will say that those budgets, not the Republican budgets, are the budgets that will create a stronger, fairer society in this country, and those are the ones that we should proceed to adopt.

1263,topic-id,245,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Chairman, in closing, it is clear that we have a very different budget and a very different understanding of the challenges facing our country. We see that so many Americans are working harder and longer and can't remember the last time they got a raise.  We know families are worried about how to pay for college, or if their parents' retirement is secure, or if they will ever be able to afford to stop working. And we know that trillions of dollars in tax cuts for millionaires and large corporations will turn these fears of hardworking Americans families into reality.                              {time}  1045  Just a few minutes ago, my Republican colleague from Ohio talked about what the American people want.

1268,topic-id,499,"Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself 4 minutes.  Madam Chairwoman, I suppose I should be saying thank you. I will get a huge tax cut under the Republican tax cut plan, as well the majority of those people sitting here--the majority of our colleagues in Congress--who are, like me, fortunate enough to be millionaires already.  Forgive me if I am in no mood to say thank you, because I was elected not just to represent millionaires, but to represent aspiring millionaires, working families, seniors, and veterans. For all of them, for anyone who isn't already a millionaire, this budget is a slap in the face.  With all of the problems facing our country right now, all the people struggling to get ahead, it is unfathomable to me that this Congress could look at people like me and say: Hey, that guy, let's give him more money. In fact, let's give all millionaires hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax cuts.  Really, I am small potatoes. President Trump, according to his financial disclosure, will get hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts.  Where is all that money coming from? If you are listening to this and you are not a millionaire, probably from you.  To pay for our own tax cuts and the tax cuts for wealthy donors, Republicans are going to increase taxes on 45 percent of American families with children. That is just the start. Seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income families will see their healthcare cut.  Poor seniors will lose benefits that help them keep food on the table and their homes heated in the winter. Veteran benefits, meals for hungry schoolchildren, programs that make education affordable and job training available, investments that generate economic growth and create good-paying jobs are all at risk in this budget.  They are also cutting corporate tax rates, which we will be paying for by plunging our Nation into deeper and deeper debt, giving multinational giants another advantage over small- and mid-size businesses in the name of perpetuating the myth of supply-side economics.  Supply-side failed. They renamed it trickle-down, but nothing trickled down. Now it is job creators. When that fails, maybe they will call it ``I get mine now; you get yours later--maybe.'' But whatever they name it, it is a sham. This plan is a hoax on the American people, and it will make most people's lives more difficult.  So forgive me if I am in no mood to say thank you for the extra money in my pocket.
