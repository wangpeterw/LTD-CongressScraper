                        TRIBUTE TO NICK MONTIETH

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Nick Montieth, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Nick is a recent graduate of Black Hills State University in 
Spearfish, SD, having earned a degree in political science. After a gap 
year, he plans to attend the University of South Dakota School of Law. 
Nick is a dedicated worker who has been committed to getting the most 
out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Nick Montieth for all 
of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the 
years to come.
