                             WORLD AIDS DAY

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, December 1 is World AIDS Day, so we 
celebrate our many accomplishments in the fight against HIV/AIDS around 
the globe.
  As Americans, we can look back and be proud that our Nation has been 
a transformative force in the global fight against AIDS and a ray of 
hope for millions of lives around the world.
  Globally, our efforts through programs like PEPFAR are currently 
supporting treatments for more than 1 million people and have averted 
more than 16 million HIV infections around the world. However, there is 
still much work to be done. Currently, more than 36 million people in 
the world are living with HIV, and nearly 1,000 girls are infected with 
HIV every day.
  Mr. Speaker, December 1, World AIDS Day, reminds us to redouble our 
efforts on behalf of those suffering from this terrible disease. Now 
more than ever, it is essential that we remain committed to creating a 
future without HIV/AIDS
