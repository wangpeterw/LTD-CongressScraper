                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gene Hemrick, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  O Lord, Creator of the Sun, season of spring, and their power to 
generate light-producing life that blesses us with the fruits of the 
land, please bless our Congress with the wisdom that made this 
possible.
  May Your blessed inspiration enable its elected Members to enhance 
our country's physical and spiritual growth during this spring of 2018. 
Thank You for the life-giving rhythms of the four seasons You created 
that is the heart of our existence.
  Amen.
