      UF HEALTH SHANDS HOSPITAL PEDIATRIC HEART TRANSPLANT PROGRAM

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of 
Florida's UF Health Shands Hospital pediatric heart transplant program 
for being named one of the best in the Nation. According to the 
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, this unit has had zero 
pediatric heart transplant deaths in the last 2\1/2\ years.
  Since 2006, the UF Health Shands Transplant Center has performed a 
total of 120 pediatric heart and lung transplants, making it one of the 
most active pediatric heart transplant programs in the Southeast. In 
fact, in the last year, U.S. News and World Report named UF Health 
number one in the State and fourth in the Nation for pediatric heart 
surgeries and cardiology. This recognition speaks volumes about the 
level of care shown by the physicians and their teams at UF Health, and 
I look forward to watching them continue to be a leader in patient care 
and innovation in the coming years.
  I must end with Go Gators.
