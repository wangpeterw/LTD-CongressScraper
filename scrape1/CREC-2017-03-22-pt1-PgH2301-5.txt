                    TRUMPCARE BENEFITS THE SUPERRICH

  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, the GOP's disastrous healthcare proposal is 
really just the largest transfer of wealth to the superrich in this 
Nation's entire history. In fact, it gives the top 1 percent of earners 
a windfall of tax breaks and subsidies.
  The superrich are going to be able to buy a lot of things with this 
new money. It has been estimated they could buy: one Lamborghini, 26 
Rolex watches, or 44 sets of Super Bowl tickets.
  Thanks to this tax cut, in effect, you are shifting wealth from Main 
Street to Mar-a-Lago, from middle America to Mar-a-Lago, from my 
district to Mar-a-Lago. Forty-four thousand people in my district in 
southern Nevada will lose their health insurance according to the 
Center for American Progress.
  Our President said, well, he didn't know--not our President. He is 
not my President. Anyway, he said he didn't know health care could be 
so complicated. Well, if you look at this bill, it is really not very 
complicated. It is quite simple:
  Premiums go up, benefits go down; deductibles go up, coverage goes 
down; prices go up, healthcare for women goes down.
  Vote ``no'' on this bill.
