                             MARCH FOR LIFE

  (Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, we must never forget that life is truly a 
gift. I rise this afternoon in support of the tens of thousands of 
Americans who will be here marching in Washington, D.C., tomorrow to 
give a voice to the voiceless.
  This House consistently defends the unborn and promotes a culture of 
life. We have passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act which 
would ban late-term abortions at 20 weeks. We have passed legislation 
to prevent tax dollars from being used to pay for abortions. We voted 
to defund Planned Parenthood and have voted to increase funding for 
federally qualified community health centers that promote and provide 
women's health services while protecting life.
  This week, I look forward to joining my colleagues in voting in favor 
of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act. All of these legislative 
achievements are encouraging progress; however, our work is not done, 
and we must continue to speak for those who cannot speak for 
themselves.
  Mr. Speaker, I am here today for the same reasons that Americans will 
be marching in Washington and in west Michigan over the next few days: 
to defend the unborn, give voice to the voiceless, and promote a 
culture of respect for life from its beginning sparks to its final 
twilight.
