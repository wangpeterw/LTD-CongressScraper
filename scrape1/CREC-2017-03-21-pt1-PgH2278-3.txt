         THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF THE U.S.-CANADA RELATIONSHIP

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to illustrate the importance 
of the U.S.-Canada relationship, one that is based on shared values, 
shared hopes, and shared dreams. The United States and Canada have 
established strong partnerships to provide leadership on climate 
change, clean energy, and the environment.
  The United States and Canada share deeply connected economies and 
enjoy the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the 
United States. We trade an average of $1.3 million in goods and 
services. Nearly 9 million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Canada. In my 
State of Michigan, over 250,000 jobs depend on the U.S.-Canada trade 
and investment, making Canada the number one customer for the State of 
Michigan.
  Our two countries share the common goal of creating jobs and 
protecting workers. I am proud to call Canada a friend, ally, and 
partner.
