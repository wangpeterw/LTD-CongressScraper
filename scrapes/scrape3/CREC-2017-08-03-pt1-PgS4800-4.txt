                              NOMINATIONS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate has confirmed more executive 
branch nominees this week than all of the executive branch nominees 
confirmed this year--combined. This was an important step toward 
filling critical roles throughout the administration, including the 
Deputies of multiple Cabinet offices that had been lacking these key 
positions.
  Moving forward, I hope this agreement represents the way forward on 
confirming nominees so our government can be fully staffed and working 
for the American people.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
