                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  You have blessed us with all good gifts, and this past week, with 
thankful hearts, we gathered with family and loved ones throughout this 
great land to celebrate our blessings together.
  Bless the Members of the people's House, who have been entrusted with 
the privilege to serve our Nation and all Americans in their need. 
Grant them to work together in respect and affection, and to be 
faithful in the responsibilities they have been given.
  Much is left to be done. Bestow upon them the gifts of wisdom and 
discernment, that in their words and actions they will do justice, love 
with mercy, and walk humbly with You.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
