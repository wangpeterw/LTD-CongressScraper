                   HONORING THE LIFE OF STEVEN BERGER

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Steven 
Berger, a loving son, brother, and father of three. Growing up in 
Wisconsin, Steven was active in many sports. At 6'6", Steven was a 
standout basketball player in high school and later played in college.
  Steven lived in Minnesota where he worked as a financial adviser and 
was a loving father to his three children. His friends and family 
describe him as charismatic, full of energy, and larger than life--the 
type of man who breathed life into every room.
  He was also an avid fisherman and loved talking about stocks and 
competitive sports.
  Steven traveled to the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas 
with friends to celebrate his 44th birthday.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Steven Berger's 
family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State 
of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.
