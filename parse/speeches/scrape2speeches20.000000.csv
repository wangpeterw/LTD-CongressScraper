4824,topic-id,1092,"Mr.President, this afternoon, Senator Murray, the Senator from Washington State who is the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and I, the chairman of the committee, made a joint bipartisan announcement that the Senate's HELP Committee will hold hearings beginning the week of September 4 on the actions Congress should take to stabilize and strengthen the individual health insurance market so Americans will be able to buy insurance at affordable prices in the year 2018. We will hear from State insurance commissioners, from patients, from Governors, from healthcare experts, and insurance companies. Committee staff will begin work this week, working with all committee members to prepare for these hearings and discussions. That was the announcement Senator Murray and I made today.  Now, in my own words, the reason for these hearings is that unless Congress acts by September 27, when insurance companies must sign contracts with the Federal Government to sell insurance on the Federal exchange next year, millions of Americans with government subsidies in up to half of our States may find themselves with zero options for buying health insurance on the exchanges next year, 2018. Many others without government subsidies will find themselves unable to afford health insurance because of rising premiums, copays, and deductibles.  There are a number of issues with the American healthcare system, but if your house is on fire, you want to put out the fire. The fire, in this case, is the individual health insurance market. Both Republicans and Democrats agree on this.  Our committee, the HELP Committee, had one hearing on the subject on February 1 and will work intensively between now and the end of September in order to finish our work in time to have an effect on health insurance policies next year, sold in 2018.  I am consulting with Senator Murray to try to make these hearings as bipartisan as possible and to involve as many committee members as possible. I will be consulting with Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden so the Finance Committee is aware of any matters we discuss that might be within its jurisdiction. A number of Senators, both Democratic and Republican, have approached Senator Murray and me and said they would like to be involved. We are going to find a way for them to be involved and update them on our progress.  In these discussions--the ones I am describing--we are dealing with a small segment of the total health insurance market. Only about 6 percent of insured Americans buy their insurance in the individual market. Only about 4 percent of insured Americans buy their insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. While these percentages are small, they represent large numbers of Americans, including many of our most vulnerable We are talking about roughly 18 million Americans in the individual market. About 11 million of them buy their insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. About 9 million of these 11 million have Affordable Care Act subsidies, and unless we act, many of them may not have policies available to buy in 2018 because insurance companies will pull out of the collapsing markets. It would be like having a bus ticket and no bus coming through town.  Just as important, unless we act, costs could rise, once again, even making healthcare unaffordable for the additional 9 million Americans in the individual market who receive no government support to help buy insurance, roughly 2 million of them who buy their health insurance on the exchanges but who don't qualify for a subsidy, and roughly 7 million who buy their insurance outside of the exchanges. This means they have no government help paying for their premiums, their copays, and their deductibles.  As we prepare for these discussions, I have urged again that President Trump temporarily continue the cost-reduction payments through September so Congress can work on a short-term solution for stabilizing the individual markets in 2018. These cost-sharing reduction subsidies reduce copays, reduce deductibles, and reduce other out-of-pocket costs to help low-income Americans buy their health insurance on the exchanges. We are talking about those who make under 250 percent of the poverty level or roughly $30,000 for an individual or $60,000 for a family of four. Without payment of these cost-sharing reductions, Americans will be hurt. Up to half the States will likely have bare counties, with zero insurance providers offering insurance on the exchanges, and insurance premiums will increase by roughly 20 percent, according to the American Health Insurance  In my opinion, any solution that Congress passes for a 2018 stabilization package would need to be small, bipartisan, and balanced. It should include funding for the cost-sharing reductions, but it also should include greater flexibility for States in approving health insurance policies which should reduce costs.  Now, it is reasonable to expect that if the President were to approve continuation of cost-sharing subsidies for August and September and if Congress, in September, should pass a bipartisan stabilization bill that includes cost-sharing for 1 year--that is 2018--it is reasonable to expect that the insurance companies in 2018 would lower their rates. They have told us--in fact, Oliver Wyman, an independent observer of healthcare, has told us that lack of funding for cost-sharing reductions would add 11 to 20 percent to premiums in 2018.  So if the President, over the next 2 months, and the Congress, over the next year, take steps to provide certainty that there will be cost-sharing subsidies, that should allow insurance companies to lower the premiums they have projected they will charge in 2018. In fact, many insurance companies have priced their rates for 2018 at two different levels--one with cost-sharing and one without cost-sharing. So it is important not only that the President improve temporary cost-sharing for August and September but that we, the Congress, in a bipartisan way, find a way to approve it for at least 1 year so we can keep the premiums down.  Now, this is only one step in what we want to do about health insurance and about the larger question of healthcare[[Page S4660]]costs so we will proceed step by step. A subsequent step will be to try to find a way to create a long-term, more robust individual insurance market, but for the short-term, our proposal is that by mid-September, we will see if we can agree on a way to stabilize the individual insurance market to keep premiums down and make affordable insurance available to all  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

Where you don't have a culture of accountability in an organization, you have mediocrity; and mediocrity and excellence in service do not and cannot coexist.  We are talking about serving our veterans, the men and women who are willing to sacrifice everything for our freedom and security. These folks gave their best to our country, and they deserve the very best from our country.  Having almost half a million delinquent disability claims is not our very best; having veterans wait in line for months to see a physician, not our best; having hundreds of billions of dollars in improper payments is not our best; waiting 6 months to a year to terminate somebody for misconduct and poor performance is definitely not our best.  People all over this country, hardworking Americans, get up every day; they work hard; they perform; they deliver results; and if they don't, they lose their job. If they are small-business owners, they go out of business. We ought to have no less expectation for our Federal Government and its employees, especially those who serve our veterans.  The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act gives the Secretary the tools he needs to hold his employees accountable for serving our veterans and to change the culture from one that accepts mediocrity to one that expects excellence.  I applaud Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for helping our country take a big step towards delivering on our promises to our veterans.

The Pew Research Center reports that Christians are the world's most persecuted faith community, with Middle Eastern Christians experiencing this most severely.  In 2012, President Obama declared what is happening to Christians in the Middle East as ``genocide'', but not much has been done to respond to this crisis.  This bill will provide the dire supports and safeguards that Christians and other religious minorities desperately need. Specifically, it gives prioritized consideration to Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East for admission into the U.Refugee Admissions Program, while keeping standard vetting procedures in place.  This is so important given that less than half of one percent of Syrians chosen for resettlement between 2011 and 2016 have been  H.390 also supports entities that are conducting criminal investigations into the bad actors perpetrating violence against Christians and supports groups helping victims of genocide in the region.  Clearly, persecuted Christians in the Middle East desperately need our support. As a fellow Christian, I will keep working to bring attention to the failures of our current refugee program in helping these individuals, as well as promote efforts to provide resources and assistance to them in their time of need.

4678,topic-id,352,"Mr.Chairman, the Dodd-Frank Act is a failure, period. It is estimated to reduce economic output by nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years, and it contains more regulatory restrictions than all of the other regulations enacted by the previous administration combined, including  The Financial CHOICE Act provides an off-ramp--much-needed relief--to Dodd-Frank's growth-crushing regulations. Financial institutions like community banks and credit unions will have the choice to stay under the Dodd-Frank regulatory regime or opt for the relief that they are willing to obtain if they meet a 10 percent simple leverage ratio, a level that ensures that they can weather economic downturns without the help of taxpayer bailouts.  This legislation also reins in the primary culprit of the regulatory onslaught that has caused one in five community financial institutions in my State of Kentucky to close: the Consumer Financial Protection This is done by giving Congress the power of the purse over the Bureau for the first time, making its Director removable by the President, requiring it to conduct cost-benefit analysis, and enhancing its mission to focus on consumer protection through competition and choice.  This legislation also delivers important regulatory relief to community financial institutions, incorporating the TAILOR Act, which requires Federal regulators to tailor their regulations based on the size of financial institutions instead of using the typical one-size-fits-all Washington model.  Additionally, the Financial CHOICE Act ends stifling Dodd-Frank regulations that constrain lending for manufactured homes by including the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing It also further reduces the chances of a mortgage crisis by giving financial firms an incentive to retain 100 percent of a mortgage's risk and greater flexibility to lend by including my Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access  Finally, this legislation places the steepest penalties in history on financial firms that actually break our laws.  So it ends too big to fail, it includes tough penalties--the toughest penalties in history--for financial fraud and other misdeeds, but it preserves consumer protections through competition, choice, and access to the credit Americans need to build our economy.

I actually happen to sit on the Homeland Security Subcommittee, and I know what it is like to make sure that national security is our number one priority.  I also happen to know that I have heard testimony from experts, and I have heard bipartisan opposition to this wall in my committee. Because when we hear from experts, they tell us a wall is not going to stop a terrorist, and they tell us that the drug cartels are not going to be stopped either, they are just going to build a tunnel under the wall.  So when you talk about homeland security, I know exactly what you are talking about. The reality is that this $1.6 billion is just a waste of taxpayer dollars. It is a dubious political promise that was made, and now the American people are being asked to foot the bill.  Let me repeat.

Some of the areas we are talking about are even just areas in the Rio Grande, where it is not going to make the biggest difference.  If we are going to secure our borders, we could spend money on technology and other areas, or we could secure our borders by putting more money into port security, where there is a greater threat of terrorism.  This is just another way to bully Congress into funding a border wall that the majority of people don't want. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not be bullied by this because it is being packaged in with other bills that would otherwise get passed without the partisanship.

5367,topic-id,423,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2857, to support foster care maintenance payments for children with parents in a licensed residential facility.  Last month, when the National Foster Youth Institute sponsored Foster Youth Shadow Day, several of the youth, in a townhall meeting that we had, described their parents' challenges with substance abuse. One young lady said that both of her parents were addicted to heroin, and that she was taken into court and, in front of her, the judge said to her parents: ``If you don't clean up, we're going to take your children away.''                              {time}  1745  After she left court, she was taken away. She was removed from her parents. Ultimately, her parents continued to use, and, sadly, both of them died. This young woman grew up feeling guilty and feeling that part of the reason why her parents passed away was because she was used as leverage, and that if her parents had been kept together in drug treatment along with her maybe she wouldn't be an orphan today and her parents would have lived and she wouldn't have had to grow up in foster care. H.2857 will allow programs like SHIELDS for Families that does address parental substance abuse and keeps families together to have the resources to expand their programs.  Today, we heard five bills that addressed challenges in the child welfare system. We know that there is a lot more that needs to be done, but today we passed bills addressing substance abuse, relative caregivers, we identified and addressed barriers to placement, and I am hoping that one next step we could take would be to extend the kinship navigator programs so that organizations like Community Coalition can continue to provide support to relatives and expand their Kinship in Action program.  As we improve various parts of the system, at some point we need to address the structural problem with how the system is financed. Right now, we have to remove a child and break up a family in order to have the resources to help the child. We know much more now. We know what leads a parent to neglect the child: substance abuse, mental health issues, poverty. We need to continue to reform the system and provide the resources to prevent a crisis.

4924,topic-id,829,"The topic of today's Special Order is to recognize the importance of Armed Forces Day and Memorial  I am not going to give a history lesson here tonight, but, rather, a series of personal remembrances that started when I was about 5 or 6 years old in the early 1950s.  My father, a World War II veteran, and some of his fellow veterans organized the local VFW in Minnesota where I was born. We would spend Memorial Day in the morning visiting three cemeteries in our local town.  At each cemetery, the color guard would post the colors, the rifles would give their report, and taps would play. Everyone who attended--and when I say everyone who attended, that was really the whole town--came out in a long train of automobiles to go to these three cemeteries to honor the veterans who were no longer of this  I remember the solemnness of that day. I remember the tears for family members and friends who had passed on, those who had worn the cloth of our Nation both in peace and in war. Those kinds of memories, as I stand here and talk tonight, are very vivid in my mind.  Some years later, in the mid-1960s, we were involved in Vietnam, and I was a sophomore in college. Because of the fact that my parents had both stepped up during World War II, I felt--and with their support--it was the right thing to stand up and take the oath that sent me into the Marine Corps to serve our country.  When you go into harm's way, you don't know what the outcome is going to be, but you do know that those you serve with are going to give it their all and you are going to remember them and honor them for as long as we walk this  I was very fortunate to have absolutely spectacular commanding officers along the way that taught me what it was like to be a young leader and what it meant to take care of your marines--most notably my commanding officer in Vietnam, who, thankfully, is still with us. He was the kind of individual that made the tough calls because he understood the sacrifices needed and the outcomes that were required.  One by one, we all pass. Memorial Day is our opportunity to remember, share stories, share tears, share laughter for those who have now gone on into God's hands. The past and the present set the tone for the future.  As David French said:       Sacrifice sustains our Nation far beyond the battlefield.      As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another in times      of stress. In times when we are under great duress, that      ability to sharpen not each other's bodies but each other's      souls carries us on.  We remember on Memorial Day those who have made that effort.  In the Marine Corps, we believe a lot of things, but three words encompass them all: honor, courage, and commitment.  Tonight we honor those who fought for our country, who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives in the service of our country, and those who have passed on since their service. It is our job to make sure that their sacrifice wasn't in vain.  Courage: there is moral courage and there is physical courage. You never know until the time comes whether you have the physical courage, but you do find out. It is the moral courage that we know from the beginning, and it is set by our predecessors that sets our attitude and our mindset in stone that we know that we have that. And when it is tested, we are ready.                              {time}  2000  Commitment: Our commitment is always to the mission and to one another. We never leave anyone behind. No one is more invested in peace than our men and women in uniform. They take the risks. They make the sacrifices, and they bear the cost of the battle in full force. Those rows of white headstones across the bridge in Arlington remind us of their commitment every day, and for that we owe them more than gratitude. We owe them every effort to keep our world at peace.  On Memorial Day in 1982, President Reagan said:  ``War will not come again, other young men will not have to die, if we will speak honestly of the dangers that confront us and remain strong enough to meet those dangers.  ``It's not just strength or courage that we need, but understanding and a measure of wisdom as well.''  We owe it to our men and women who have fought and died for our country to take a stand, to prepare for peace not by ignoring the dangers we face and placating the enemies of freedom but by facing them head on.

It is no different with the Department of Veterans  Our veterans have given their all, and they deserve our all; but, unfortunately, vulnerabilities in the VA's administrative processes have led to incompetence, neglect, and even unchecked illegal activity on the part of a small number of VA employees.  Unfortunately, lack of oversight and accountability in the hiring and retention process mean that the VA is still failing our veterans. Even in the few instances where the VA has tried to discipline employees for wrongdoing or neglect, it has been foiled by a complex and lengthy administrative process that rarely yields results.  1094 addresses the VA's administrative shortcomings by providing the Secretary with the authority to remove, demote, or suspend any employee for poor performance or misconduct while, at the same time, enhancing protections for whistleblowers.  As a leader of marines and a Vietnam veteran, I know what our servicemen and -women across generations and conflicts have sacrificed for our freedoms and our country. They don't just deserve quality care; they have earned it.

My amendment simply adds $1 million to the U.Corps of Engineers' investigations account to assist with projects across the country that the Army Corps is in charge of overseeing.  Projects like modernizing the Soo Locks, the lock system located in my district in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan which connects Lake Superior to the lower part of the Great Lakes through the Marys  This is a project that has been around for a long time on the books. Projects like this that have more than 4,500 vessels and 80 million tons of cargo moving through the Soo Locks each year, this lock system plays a critical role in the transport of raw materials and other goods through the Great Lakes region to ports around the entire country.  And currently, the construction of a new lock, which is integral not only to my district, but the entire United States, is caught in a mire of uncertainty, and it all comes down to one thing: funding.  I think it is appropriate that we are considering this amendment in the context of making America secure because it might be a surprise to some to learn that modernizing the Soo Locks is a matter of national security.  A recent Department of Homeland Security report has made clear that an unexpected interruption to the Poe--the largest lock in the system--would have disastrous economic impacts across the Nation, to include a $1.1 trillion fall in national gross domestic product and a spike in national unemployment to a rate of 11.3 percent.  Again, this is the Department of Homeland Security saying this. And while Congress has authorized the construction of a new lock twice now over several years, the Soo has been tied up[[Page H6426]]in economic reevaluations and studies that have ultimately kept Congress and the Corps from spending the necessary funds to complete the project.  This amendment sends a message to the Army Corps and reminds Congress that projects like the Soo Locks modernization must be a priority.  During a time when infrastructure projects and national security are at the forefront of our policy conversations, projects like the Soo Locks should not be delayed because of funding uncertainty or limits to the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to do its due diligence in conducting the studies.  I also wanted to take a minute and thank the chairman for working with me and understanding how significant and important the Soo Locks modernization and projects like this around the country are to our economy and our national security.

I have gone from San Luis to Naco, to Nogales, to Agua I have been along the border many times, most recently just a couple months ago, and during that time, I used it as kind of a fact-finding expedition. I wanted to know what people who live right along the border talk about and think about as we in Congress consider things like a Presidential promise to build a wall, even in this bill, a partial wall, a good start.  I will tell you what I know is that the number one drug and human smuggling corridor in the United States of America is through the Tucson sector. That is right through the heart of the Arizona-Mexico border. It impacts, literally, 75 to 80 miles into the border.

So I am familiar with the area. I am familiar with the issue.  I had the privilege of talking to Border Patrol agents over the last few years, but in particular the last time I was at the border, and I talked to a[[Page H6488]]number of them. I wondered what the men and women think who actually service the border for us. I asked them whether they supported a wall. It was 100 percent, it was unanimous: they want a wall. They want additional infrastructure. They want a road that parallels that wall so they can have access to that wall and make the apprehensions that they need to.  I talked to ranchers and farmers. It was unanimous then as well. Everyone wanted that wall, all recognizing the need for additional infrastructure of a roadway.  When you go to various portions of the border now, it is a single strand of wire. You can step over it. We had one of the ranchers, an 81-year-old gentleman, demonstrate how he crawls underneath the wire at 81 years of age.  Where there are small areas of fencing outside Nogales, either side from Nogales, that has cut down the number of folks who come that way; but since that fence only goes about 3 or 4 miles onto each side of the city, what happens is there is a flood of people who come around that fence.

I had a real bipartisan amendment that had been in order repeatedly in recent sessions, gaining bipartisan support, to be able to deal with the crisis that our veterans face in terms of addiction, opioids.  The VA, sadly, has a horrible record in terms of how they deal with these veterans. They suffer suicide 50 percent higher than the general public. The opioid addiction rate is twice the general population.  Mr.Speaker, I have been working for years in the area of medical marijuana. Twenty-nine States have now legalized it. I wish my friends on the Rules Committee had taken the time to listen to the stories of veterans and their families about what difference it made for people suffering from PTSD, chronic pain, and traumatic brain injury.  Medical marijuana has helped change their lives, and it is not addictive and doesn't kill them the way the abuse of opioids has. Yet the VA, in its infinite wisdom, doesn't even allow VA doctors to talk to veterans about medical marijuana in the States where it is legal.  Our amendment is simple. It would eliminate that prohibition. It wouldn't dispense marijuana on public land. It allowed the VA doctor to work with the patients--the people who know them best.

In his book, ``Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders,'' our dear Speaker, Mr.Ryan, described the self-execution process. This is on page 98, if you are following along. But he called this process, ``legislative trickery to enact legislation that does not have majority backing.''

In short, my amendment will stop funding for painful dog experiments at the It also includes protections to ensure service dog training programs can continue unencumbered so that veterans affected by conditions from blindness to PTSD can receive the help they need.  My amendment combines three bipartisan issues: puppies, veterans, and government accountability.  Earlier this year, when my wife Laura and I read the news report about the VA's dog testing program at the Richmond VA Medical Center, we were disturbed by the descriptions of the types of experiments conducted on these puppies. From what I read, the type of work they were doing was on the level of torture. In Richmond, this included inducing heart attacks. At other labs, the VA was giving methamphetamine to narcoleptic  My family had a Doberman, and he was part of our family years back. I can't imagine conducting these tests on man's best friend.  I believe our veterans deserve to receive the highest quality of healthcare. The Richmond VA Hospital is staffed by talented healthcare professionals. However, the experiments being conducted at the Richmond dog research lab have questionable medical benefit. The resources, money, time, and space being used to conduct these experiments would be better utilized to deliver high-quality healthcare to Richmond veterans. The VA's first priority should be caring for our veterans.  A recent report by the VA Office of Research Oversight that was made public by a FOIA request found widespread lapses in adhering to protocol, failure to follow Federal animal welfare regulations, and the lack of sufficient documentation to justify the severity of these disturbing experiments. Federal taxpayer dollars are better spent directly caring for our Nation's veterans.

At the same time, one thing we also know is that the average 60-year-old in Ohio will see her premiums go up $1,600 a year.  We all know the terrible problem opioid addiction has inflicted on hundreds of thousands of people in our country. Unfortunately, my State has had more opioid deaths pretty much every month--certainly, over the last year--than any State in the United States of Today 200,000 Ohioans are getting opioid treatment who are able to get that treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care  Think about the 26-year-old who is on her mother's health insurance plan who gets opioid treatment. Think about the family with the 5-year-old with a preexisting condition who will no longer be able to get insurance and who gets insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, because we fixed the preexisting condition exclusion. If the House version were to pass, or something similar to it, that family would lose its insurance. There was example after example. That is one of the reasons the House of Representatives had so much trouble repealing the Affordable Care Act and one of the reasons that the 12 or 13 Senators are meeting--maybe tonight, for all I know; they never tell us--just down the hall, down there in Senator McConnell's office, to try to figure out how to repeal the Affordable Care Act and find a way to hold 52 Republican Senators together.  Think about that. They are meeting in secret. First, it was the House of Representatives, when they repealed the Affordable Care Act, when they voted on what is called the American Health Care I think that is what they called it, the When they voted on it, they came up with a bill at 8 o'clock at night. They sprung it on the floor the next day. Almost nobody had a chance to read it. There were no hearings, no discussions--not even reading the bill. They jammed it through by twisting arms--the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, who used to be a Member of the House, the Speaker of the House, all of them--to get this bill through. They hadn't even taken the time to hear from the Congressional Budget Office to tell how much this bill would cost and how many people would lose their insurance. It turns out they estimated that more than 20 million people would lose their insurance. That came after the vote in the  They are doing the same thing in the They are doing this meeting behind closed doors. It is a bunch of Republican leaders together. No Democrats are invited. No Democrats are asked their opinions. It is all about doing something to live up to this campaign promise that they are going to repeal and replace the Affordable Care  Listen to Governor They have no idea what they are going to do with these 20 million people, with 900,000 people in my State--900,000 people who have health insurance, most of whom are working. These are people who have jobs. They just aren't lucky enough to have jobs like we have, where their health insurance is paid for.  Think about the morality of this--200-plus Republican Members of Congress, all of whom get health insurance paid by taxpayers, by all of you in the Gallery and anybody watching this. We get insurance here paid for by taxpayers, and they are going to just snatch it away from those 200,000 families in my State who are getting opioid addiction treatment because of the Affordable Care What is the morality of that?  Then, worse than that is that they do it without reading the bill. They do it, pretty much, in the middle of the night, and they are doing the same thing here. Clearly, the American public is on to this. The public overwhelmingly thinks this is a bad idea.  But they move forward because there is a huge tax break involved for the drug industry, a huge tax break for the medical device industry, and huge help for the insurance industry. That is why they do it, because in the end so much of what happens in this body is so that the wealthiest 1 or 2 or 5 percent get their tax cuts, get their tax breaks, and the middle class gets stuck with the bill and the middle class loses the benefits it gets.

I am thankful for the work done by Chairman Hensarling to rein in this out-of-control agency.  With the United States nearly $20 trillion in debt, we must do everything possible to bring financial accountability to our Federal Spending at this rate will leave us not only financially bankrupt but morally bankrupt as well. It is immoral to spend money we don't have today and force our children to pay in the future.  Despite this, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau decided it was necessary to renovate their headquarters, estimated at more than $200 million, over $50 million more than the building is worth. Even in their initial designs, a lavish two-story waterfall and four-story glass staircase were more important than the financial prosperity of our children.  The Financial CHOICE Act makes changes to the CFPB, which will likely result in different real estate needs for the agency. My amendment is simple: it will require an assessment of whether the current CFPB building is a good use of taxpayer dollars. If not, it authorizes the General Services Administration to sell the building to the highest bidder, generating hundreds of millions of dollars by offloading a property that is unnecessary for the Federal Government to own.  Just a few months ago, my first grandchild, nicknamed Bear, was born. When he grows older, I want to tell him I did everything in my power to fight the out-of-control spending that plagues our generation.

By reauthorizing the Food and Drug Administration user fee program, we are ensuring that the Food and Drug Administration can continue to officially operate and approve new drugs for the market.  Upon becoming chairman of the Subcommittee on Health this year, I had the privilege of convening four separate legislative hearings on the policies that are included in H.2430.

To help repair dilapidated and aging military infrastructure, the bill provides a 25 percent increase in military construction funding.  Supporting our servicemembers and their families is also a high priority of this bill, as it provides for the largest military pay raise in 8 years.  That is not all it does. It also provides for our Nation's veterans, the very people who devoted their lives to protecting our country and the values we hold so dear. This bill provides the highest level of funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs in our Nation's history. This will help cut down on the claims backlog and move forward with a new electronic medical health records system.  I am also pleased that this bill will allow us to begin increasing our Nation's border security in an effort to keep bad actors out of our country. The American people sent a strong message last November that they wanted a wall securing our southern border. This bill will begin this process by providing over $1.5 billion requested by President Trump for physical barrier construction along the southern border.  Mr.Speaker, over this last weekend a lot of people in America went to see a movie called ``Dunkirk'' about the evacuation of over 300,000 British and French troops back over to Prime Minister Winston Churchill had only been in office a couple of weeks at that point in time, but he had predicted for years before that in speeches before the House of Commons that that day was coming, and they took his speeches and they put them together in a book called, ``While England Slept.'' With this bill, we are sending a strong message to the world that America is not asleep.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me just remind my colleagues here that we are debating the rule, and this is about process.  The gentleman from Oklahoma earlier talked about waivers and that the Lee AUMF language would be subject to a point of order. Well, the language that my Republican friends replaced the Lee amendment with is protected by a waiver of all points of order because it was also legislating on an appropriations bill. As I pointed out last night in the Rules Committee, you made in order amendment 19 by Mr.Griffith, which violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act, and you provided a waiver for that.  My Republican friends routinely grant waivers in bills that come before the Rules The problem is that the waivers are only granted for your amendments and never for our amendments, and that is just not fair and that is not right.  So if your policy is going to be we are going to grant no waivers, then it ought to apply not just to Democrats; it ought to apply to Republicans, too. But there is this double standard here, and voices that you disagree with always seem to end up being cut off.  So, Mr.Speaker, I just point that out because this process and the reason why so many of us are angry about this process is it is so blatantly unfair.  The gentleman from Alabama talked about how we all want to commit to upholding the national security of this I agree with him, but I would say we are not doing our jobs if this floor is not a place where we can have a free-flowing debate, where Members can offer different ideas and be able to have a vote on them.

Maybe it is to protect your Members in swing districts; I have no idea. Maybe you don't think you have the votes to do it. But if you don't have the votes to do it, it ought not to be in this bill.

I don't know if the two of you remember that period, but my recollection is every single day I was going to something regarding the healthcare policy and listening to experts and recommendations, and then, of course, we had these--I call them more roundtables than hearings. We had a lot of roundtable discussions, and we obviously went through a very formal bill process.  There is a little bit of irony that we are the ones out here today still talking about this healthcare bill. I think it is because we knew what the challenges were, and we tried to address them and were not afraid to keep addressing them. We are not afraid to be out here today talking about solutions we want to see as well.  I thank my colleague from Delaware and my colleague from Oregon for both being part of that effort because it really was an unbelievable amount of time and energy and discussion and formulation. The notion that somehow now we would take something that is one-sixth of the economy and draft something up in a dark process, then throw it out here--I am not surprised today that there aren't the votes. The thing to do now is not try to just rack up some votes in the next few days and come back in The thing to do is to sit down and have a serious discussion.  I notice a couple of my colleagues are down at the White They are positioned right there next to the Maybe they are trying to put them on the hot seat. He is sitting there talking about the individual market. He is talking about the individual market in All I am thinking is that the individual market in Alaska--we are sitting here, and the other side is proposing to cut 15 million people off of What does that have to do with the individual market?  I don't know if people are ready to focus on this the way we focused on it in that time period for more than a year--more than a year, day after day, meeting after meeting, hearing after hearing. I hope what they will do is stop this proposal and sit down and have an open process and have a discussion on these policies because they are so important.  We have been having all this discussion, and a lot of the frustration people have talked about is the individual market, where 7 percent of Americans[[Page S3788]]get health insurance. There are ways to fix and improve the individual market. I feel like I was fortunate enough to put forward one of the better ideas that worked successfully, at least it is working successfully in the State of New York, the Basic Health So 650,000 people are on the Basic Health Program as a proposal. I think they call it, in that State, the Essential Two adults in a family of four can buy a policy for about $500 in premiums, on an annual basis, instead of about $1,500 on the exchange for that population that is above the Medicaid rate that needed to have a solution in the marketplace. There are 13 different companies offering insurance to those 650,000 people, so that is obviously working.  Now, it got implemented late. New York did it in 2016 because they were off to the races, but other States should now consider this. What is so great about this and helping to address the individual market is because, where we are on this side, we are willing to allow individuals who don't work for a large company to get the same clout as if they worked for a large company. When you buy in bulk, you get a discount. Americans know that. That is why they shop at If you go there and buy in bulk, you get a discount. That is what they are doing in New So 650,000 people have been bundled up like they are a big company and saying to the marketplace: Who wants to bid on selling us insurance? The end result has been more affordable insurance in the individual market. That is what they should be discussing down at the White House today. That is what they should be discussing, not cutting 15 million people off That is not a smart idea.  I am sure my colleagues here have already gone over this notion that once you cut people off of care, they end up in the emergency rooms or have exacerbated healthcare needs. So there are longer periods of time to get access to healthcare, more complicated healthcare costs, rising premiums.  We have gone around our State and heard loud and clear from the provider community and the hospitals that they have seen downward pressure on the price of private insurance because we expanded Medicaid, and the economic numbers are out there now to show the same thing. Cutting people off of Medicaid is not the solution to the individual market. I hope somebody down there at the White House brings that up.  In 2020, when the Medicaid cap--if it did go into effect--the analysis is it would cost shift $324 million per year to my They would be cutting people off of Medicaid, and then basically the cost would be $324 million a year to our You can imagine that our State doesn't have that money and isn't interested in picking up that tab. By 2028, when the Medicaid cuts start to kick in, we would be cost-shifting $4.2 billion per year to the state of That is not smart economics for us.  Over the weekend, I visited Virginia Mason Hospital in the northwest--again, a great success in delivery system reform. They implemented the Toyota model of production. There is, literally, faster turnaround time on lab reports and better expedience of nursing care. I think there was something like a 72-percent reduction in insurance liability costs. I mean, there are huge successes by changing and improving the delivery system that helps put pressure down on price. This is what we need to be talking about.  There is much innovation that was in the Affordable Care We need to now ask the question: What further things do we need to do to make sure we drive down costs in the individual market as well? But with this Senate bill, you are not going to drive down price. There are reports now out by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities last Friday that show the price will actually go up in the individual market if you cut people off of Basically, it will just increase by several thousand dollars the actual amount of money the people in the individual market will have to pay for insurance, so that clearly is not the solution.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--I hope they come back and say that it is time to work in a discussion about these ideas in a broad way, not just another Hail Mary pass. Just get rid of this notion that cutting poor people off of Medicaid is somehow going to magically fix the individual market. It is not. I thank my colleagues from the Finance Committee who went through all of that.  Believe me; I am telling you, these discussions went on for weeks and weeks and weeks. Some people here are trying to come up with a score and get an answer in a week on this entire package. I think we debated, I would say, probably 2 or 3 weeks just on the notion of reforming--getting off of fee-for-service and focusing on a value index and getting the priorities of the delivery system focused on better outcomes at lower costs. This is something that really should be a big priority in healthcare.  I remember we had private meetings. We had the head of CBO come down and talk to us. We had hearings. We probably spent 3 weeks just on one concept of how effective that would be in the healthcare delivery system.  I see we are still here. We are still talking. We are still willing to improve this delivery system and make sure people have better access to care, and I thank my colleagues for including me in this discussion today.  I want to again thank the Senator from Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance I know he knows exactly what I am talking about when we talk about innovation. There is so much innovation he put into the Affordable Care Act, giving states discretion. They already have all the discretion they need; they have all the discretion they need to keep innovating.  Hopefully we will get our colleagues to follow suit because this is where we are going to deliver better care at lower costs and help improve the access for everybody in  I thank the Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgS3784-2.txt,172,FINANCIAL CHOICE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,June

4873,topic-id,1041,"Mr.President, I want to thank Senator Wyden for his leadership on this issue and so many issues, his position as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance He serves this body very well, and he has done that today in outlining the flaw of the healthcare bill that was presented a week ago by the Republican leadership and what it would do to our healthcare system.  I want to acknowledge that I am very proud that I was in the Congress when we passed the Affordable Care Today, millions of Americans have coverage who didn't have coverage prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care I am also proud about the quality of that coverage. That coverage has guaranteed benefits so that individuals know they will be covered for their needs--no preexisting conditions, no caps. It is affordable, and we made sure it was affordable to the people of this  I have listened to the debate from some of my Republican colleagues about how the Affordable Care Act is collapsing under its own weight. Nothing could be further from the truth. The problems we are experiencing with high increases in the individual marketplace are caused in part by the actions of the Trump administration to try to undermine the Affordable Care  Let me give an example in my own State of Maryland, where CareFirst--the largest carrier in the individual marketplace--sought about a 50-percent increase in individual rates, and they were very direct. At least half of that increase is as a result of the uncertainty of the Trump administration putting the cost-sharing payments into the budget. That raises the premiums for all of those individuals in the individual marketplace. There is also the uncertainty as to whether the Trump administration is going to enforce the requirement that people buy insurance, which means only the people who have higher risks are likely to buy the insurance, raising the price for those who want to buy insurance.  When we talk about the fact that there are increased costs beyond what we think are reasonable, recognize that it is the actions of the Trump administration that are causing a large part of that premium increase, which brings me to the bill that was unveiled last week by the Republican leadership. It moves us in the wrong direction in trying to fix the problems. It does that because it decimates the Medicaid The largest expansion of coverage has been in the Medicaid  This bill will significantly cut back--CBO has scored that a total of 22 million individuals who have insurance today will lose their coverage, but it does more than that. It does that for what reason? Not to make healthcare more affordable--it does that in order to give tax cuts to the very wealthy.  I am glad that we now have a little cooling-off period. We are not going to come back to the bill for about another 10 days, it looks like.  I want my colleagues to know that as proud as I am of the Affordable Care Act, I acknowledge that we can make it better. I hope Democrats and Republicans will work together to move in the right direction on improving the Affordable Care Let me give some examples.  We know there is a high cost on the premiums, a higher increase than we would like. Why don't we join together to make sure there is predictable cost sharing provided to the companies that are in the individual marketplace? That would remove the uncertainty and reduce the premiums significantly in the individual marketplace. Why don't we work together, Democrats and Republicans, to increase the subsidies we provide to low- and middle-income families so that the premiums will be more affordable? We intended to do that under the Affordable Care Act, but after we got the cost scoring, we had to trim that back. Let's work together, Democrats and Those two changes alone would deal with the concern that in the individual marketplace, we are seeing large premium increases. Together, we can solve that problem.  Why don't we work for more competition? I have heard my colleagues talk about the fact that some of the insurance companies are leaving, and some are mainly because of the uncertainty as to whether they are going to get their rightful payments for cost sharing. We can do something about that.  Why don't we, Democrats and Republicans, come together and say that there should be a public option with no public subsidy, so it is a level playing field of competition? That way, we are guaranteeing to every market in the country that there will be coverage for the people in your community. That encourages more competition. That gives stability in the marketplace. We could do that together.  Then, Democrats and Republicans, let's work together to bring down the[[Page S3786]]overall cost of healthcare in this country. We made proposals that--why are we paying more for prescription drugs, twice as much as our Canadian friends? Because they have an organized market, and they negotiate as an organized market. Why don't we come together and say: Let's take the entire market that we have for the government paying prescription drugs and have one negotiation? That would significantly bring down the cost of prescription medicine.  Why don't we build on efforts that we have done for collaborative healthcare, for value-based reimbursement? That would significantly reduce the cost. We have seen that in mental health and addiction. We could see the same savings in kidney care and in diabetes and heart disease.  There are ways we can improve the Affordable Care Democrats are ready to work with Republicans to get that done. What we will not do is make this current system worse. We are not going to cut the Medicaid Program in order to provide tax cuts to the wealthy. Join us in improving the law to make premiums more affordable in the individual marketplace, to bring more competition into the program, and to drive down the overall cost of healthcare in this country. That is what Democrats stand for, and we are ready to work with Republicans today in order to get that done. I would encourage our colleagues to work together, and let's improve the healthcare system.

4876,topic-id,252,"Senator Wyden is exactly right. I have met with the largest insurer in I have gone over their rate requests for this year. They told me directly that the largest amount of their premium increase request is based upon the uncertainty.  They don't know whether the cost sharing is going to be put in the budget, and they have to make their decisions on rates now. Not knowing that, they have to cover themselves, and they are asking for a rate increase under the concern that the cost sharing may not be in the payment.  That was not only envisioned, we thought it was mandated in the Affordable Care Now the President is talking about: Well, maybe I am not going to put it in. And we see some of his other activities. So if you are an insurance company and you are answerable to your board of directors and you know that this payment is how you are able to get low deductibles and copays, but you are not sure you are going to get the Federal payment, and you know that your customers are going to want the low cost sharing, you have to charge a higher premium just to cover yourself.

4878,topic-id,720,"Senator Cardin and I serve together on the committee called Environment and Public Works in the One of the issues we deal with is clean air.  This conversation about predictability and uncertainty that businesses seek is not just in health insurance, it is in all kinds of businesses across the country.  I remember being in a conversation 8, 9 years ago with--I think Senator Alexander of Tennessee was with us. We met with the CEOs of a number of utilities across the country. Senator Alexander and I were pushing legislation in response to President George Bush's proposal called Clear It was designed to reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and CO2, carbon dioxide. We talked with these CEOs from across the country for an hour in my office. We had been talking about reductions of X percent and Y percent and so forth in the emissions from these harmful pollutants from primarily coal-fired utilities. At the end of the conversation, this one older fellow who was representing a utility in the southern part of our country--he was sort of a curmudgeon-like person--he said: Senator, this is what you need to do with respect to the restraint on emissions, reduction in emissions. Here is what you need to do. You need to tell us what the rules are going to be. You need to provide us some certainty and predictability and give us a reasonable amount of time to comply and then get out of the way.  I will never forget that conversation. Tell us what the rules are going to be, provide us with some certainty and predictability, a reasonable amount of time, and get out of the way.  It is not just utilities that want certainty and predictability, so do others, and particularly, as utilities are a regulated industry, so is insurance. They do like to have predictability and certainty.  We tend to focus just on the exchanges and the marketplaces in the 50 States, which provide health insurance for maybe 5, 6, 7 percent of Americans who get healthcare coverage. Most people get their healthcare coverage from employer-provided programs. Maybe 20, 25 percent get their coverage through  I used to think Medicaid was healthcare for poor women and children. When I was elected State treasurer, I used to think Medicaid was healthcare for poor women and children and not much else, and it turns out, it is a lot more than that today. Twenty, twenty-five percent of folks get their coverage there, another 15 percent or so in Medicare, and the rest are in the exchanges. Every State has an exchange. That is for folks who can't get coverage anywhere else. The idea is to have some opportunity to participate in a purchasing pool.  When we passed the Affordable Care Act, we made a promise that we would do the kinds of things that Senator Cardin is talking about to provide certainty and predictability for the health insurance companies when they insure in these exchanges. The health insurance companies were reluctant to provide coverage to the folks who were going to get coverage through the exchanges. As my friend will recall, some of these people hadn't had healthcare for months, years, maybe even decades, and maybe some never had healthcare in their lives, so nobody really knew how much healthcare they would need, except we knew and the insurance companies knew that these people would need a lot. As my friend said, we provided some ways of reducing that lack of predictability. It is like the comic strip ``Peanuts,'' with Lucy and Charlie Brown and the football. When she pulls the football away, she always fools him. He still kicks and misses every time. We sort of did that with the insurance companies. We assured them we would help provide stability, and we took away the very mechanisms designed to do that.  I think what my friend is saying, we need to come back and provide maybe three ways to do it; one, with respect to reinsurance; two, cover the risk costs; and the third is to do something--if we don't continue with the individual mandate, we need to come up with something like the individual mandate, which is not as harmful as Republicans are suggesting.

It had the idea of establishing exchanges in all 50 Having the sliding scale tax credit brought down the cost of healthcare insurance to lower income people in the exchanges with a bigger tax credit. It had the individual mandate in there to make sure young, healthy people got coverage too. We didn't leave health insurance coverages to a pool of unhealthy young people to try to insure.

4898,topic-id,985,"Thank you, Mr. I rise to talk about an issue that some of us have talked about, but I think it is an issue that is barely breaking through now. There has been a lot of discussion in the debate so far about various aspects of the bill. We know the bill in its current form is about 142 pages, I guess, and more than 60 of those pages deal with one topic--So this is basically a Medicaid bill and a tax cut bill, and the two are not just referred to on a regular basis in the text, but I would argue they are actually in conflict with one another.  I was on the floor last night showing a chart that indicated that the top 400 households in the country would get a tax cut of $33 billion. Just imagine that. Four hundred families get $33 billion out of the bill--the House bill, but it hasn't changed substantially at all when it comes to tax cuts--and then on top of that, the Medicaid cuts in just four States add up to the same number. So we have $33 billion in cuts on Medicaid for 4 States and $33 billion in tax cuts for 400 families.  If you are within the sound of my voice and you are one of those 400 families, sorry, but I don't think you deserve a tax cut.  Here is another way of looking at it. This is the same basic information, but now, instead of looking at four States, as we did last night--those four States were Alaska, Arkansas, Nevada, and West Virginia--where the total Medicaid cut was just below $33 billion, here is just one State, the State I represent, The cuts over time come up to $35 billion. The Senate bill might move that one way or the other by a little bit, but basically that is what it is. But we still have this number we just referred to--$33 billion in tax cuts for the 400 highest income households in the country. Nothing about that is fair. In fact, I think that is obscene. There are other words we could use, but we shouldn't use those words on this floor. That is obscene.  In the same bill, they are ripping away Medicaid over time, and, as we know from the CBO report we saw last night, the House bill has a Medicaid cut of 14 million people losing their Medicaid coverage over the course of a decade. In the Senate bill, the number goes up to 15 million. So 15 million of the 22 million who lose their healthcare coverage are from  As my colleague from New Jersey just outlined, low-income folks, folks with disabilities, and folks who need to get into a nursing home--that is basically the Medicaid population. They are low-income children and adults, adults and children with disabilities, and, of course, seniors.  That is the basic inequity here. I don't think anyone around the country, if they were looking at that comparison, would really say that is fair. How could that be fair in a healthcare bill, that a small group of Americans gets a tax cut?  By the way, it doesn't end there. It is not just the top 400 Americans, it is a lot of other people as well. So if you are in any way wealthy, this bill is a bonanza for you. This is a once-in-a-lifetime injection of revenue that you are rarely, if ever, going to see. But why should a single family get millions and millions of dollars--under this scenario, potentially tens of millions for one family--why should they get that kind of a break while others are losing their healthcare by way of the Medicaid cuts or otherwise?  So if we are going to have a real process here that leads to a bipartisan conclusion, we have to get serious about the issue of healthcare. This is not a serious attempt to change our healthcare system for the better. A third-grader could rip healthcare away from a lot of people and give away the store to very wealthy people. That is an exercise anyone could do. That is simple. But to fix problems in our healthcare system, to make sure that if you are living in a rural area and there is only one insurer, that we work to create some competition--to fix that requires some work. To fix that requires bipartisan support. It is not this exercise we have been going through so far.  I hope folks on the other side can defend this and go home and say: I voted for this bill--or the updated version of the bill in a couple of days or weeks--and I am here to tell you that I not only voted for the bill, but I am asserting that it is fair to give $33 billion to 400 households and tear $35 billion out of the Medicaid Program just for Pennsylvania--just for Pennsylvania, one State, and it gets worse when you add other  I know our time is short and others are waiting to speak, but we have a long way to go to make sure we are focused on some of the real challenges we have in our healthcare system, not just ripping coverage away from vulnerable Americans in order to enrich people who need no help, need no injection of a tax cut.[[Page S3792]]  In fact, they don't even want the tax cut. I was at a townhall the other day, and a doctor stood up and said--if the House version of the healthcare bill went through, this one doctor in Pennsylvania would get $20,000 in a tax cut. He said: I don't need that. I don't want it. We want to fix the system. We want to make sure the people on Medicaid still get coverage.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.10, the Financial CHOICE Act, and I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership on this important issue.  For the last 7 years, Dodd-Frank has blocked small businesses from getting the capital they need to grow and create more jobs. As chairman of the Small Business Committee, it is no surprise that small businesses from all across the country tell me over and over again that this blocking of capital to them by Dodd-Frank is preventing them from creating more jobs which are needed in this country.  Whether to pay employees or to buy new equipment, we need to make it easier for small-business owners to gain access to capital. H.10 is chock-full of real reforms, including the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS, Act to encourage and inspire entrepreneurs across the country.

5218,topic-id,448,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment to H.3219 will help ensure that buildings such as the Capitol and the House and Senate office buildings have adequate baby changing tables.  Last year, this Congress passed into law my legislation called the BABIES Act requiring that both male and female restrooms in many public buildings be equipped with baby changing facilities that are physically safe, sanitary, and appropriate.  That legislation ensures that there are appropriate and sanitary facilities for parents and caretakers to change the diapers of infants and toddlers in publicly accessible Federal buildings controlled by the General Services  In the same vein, I was pleased that the Legislative Branch Subcommittee included report language in its fiscal year 2017 bill recognizing the importance of providing designated baby changing stations for members of the public who visited the Capitol complex and encouraging the Architect of the Capitol to take steps to provide baby changing stations at easily accessible locations.  I want to thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and Chairman Yoder for their support of these efforts. My amendment today to H.3219 would similarly encourage the construction of safe, appropriate, and sanitary baby changing stations in Federal public buildings controlled by the Architect of the Capitol such as the Capitol complex, the House, and Senate office buildings, the Botanic Gardens, and the Library of  With more than 20 million visitors coming to Washington, D.C., each year, families are often surprised by the lack of adequate baby changing facilities in public buildings. Currently, there are only nine baby changing stations in the House office buildings, none of which are in the Rayburn Building, where my office is located. That means that when Rhode Island families who come to visit my office have to try to find a changing station, they go all the way to Cannon or Longworth, or they have to decide to change their baby on the bathroom floor, which is a terrible option. It is not sanitary either for the parents or for the children.  Access to these changing stations in restrooms in Federal buildings will help in protecting the health and safety of children at a very de minimus cost, about $200 per changing station. This nominal amount will go a very long way to encouraging a family-friendly environment and ensuring the safety and comfort of our constituents who visit us.  And I want to again thank Chairman Yoder and Ranking Member Ryan for their support of this amendment, and I look forward to working with them to help ensure that our constituents are able to have a safe and enjoyable visit to our beautiful Capitol buildings.

5111,topic-id,888,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of H.3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. The rule provides for 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations  Mr.Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us represents the end product of many months of work by the Appropriations In this package, we will be considering four appropriations bills: Defense, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Together, the four parts of the bill make up the Make America Secure Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2018.  The legislation ensures that our most important government services will be funded responsibly and appropriately and that we will fulfill our most important responsibilities as legislators: funding the government and keeping it open to serve our constituents.  The bill provides a total of $658.1 billion for defense, an increase of $68.1 billion in discretionary funding above the fiscal year 2017 levels, and an increase of $28.3 billion over the President's request. It also includes $73.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations and Global War on Terrorism funding.  These funds will help us enhance our military readiness, and the substantial increase marks an end to the ongoing erosion of our national military strength that occurred during the Obama administration.  Importantly, this bill also provides an increase in funding for veterans. Over the past several years, the House has worked to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs and to ensure that all veterans receive the care and benefits to which they are entitled.  The Department of Veterans Affairs will receive a 5 percent increase in this bill, including $74 billion for the Veterans Health  The increased funding represents an important step toward fulfilling our promise to improve care, reduce wait times at the VA, and enhance benefits for our Nation's veterans.  The Energy and Water portion of this appropriations bill provides $37.6 billion in funding for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $209 million from fiscal year 2017.  The bill includes an increase in funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration that includes funds to restart the licensing process for Yucca Mountain, the national disposal repository for spent nuclear fuel. It also provides $6.16 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, a $10 million increase over fiscal year 2017.  H.3219 also provides $3.58 billion for the Legislative It does not recommend funding levels for the Senate, as per our longstanding tradition.  The bill includes a significant increase in funding for U.Capitol Police and adds additional funds for securing offices in Washington and in congressional districts. Importantly, it continues the freeze on Member pay.  The package before us represents the House fulfilling its primary responsibility: to fund the government. This package funds hundreds, if not thousands, of Member priorities, particularly on the defense side.  I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their months of working and making this bill a reality. It shows what the House can do as we move forward toward completion of the fiscal year appropriations process.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.Cole) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, it is hard to know where to begin, because this process is so lousy, but I want to rise today in opposition to this rule and the so-called underlying bill, H.3219, the GOP fiscal year 2018 so-called security minibus appropriations bill.  This rule makes in order 72 amendments for debate on the House floor, blocking 100 amendments. It continues the terrible closed process that this Republican majority has used since they took control of the House in 2011.  When Speaker Ryan took the gavel, he promised a fair and open process with regular order where both the majority and the minority would have the opportunity to have their voices heard, and I am happy to provide the full text of that speech to my Republican friends.  I guess we were misinformed, because our collective voices are repeatedly silenced in this Chamber, not just Democrats, but Republicans as well.  Speaker Ryan's broken promise was clearly on display last week when he waited until the dead of night to strip out of the Defense Appropriations bill a provision requiring Congress to debate the issue of the 2001 That provision was adopted by the full House Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan basis as an amendment offered by our respected colleague, Representative Barbara The bipartisan Lee amendment would sunset the outdated 2001 AUMF and give Congress 8 months to enact a new one, ensuring that Congress finally debate and vote on the many wars in which the United States is engaged.  If the Republican leadership doesn't like the lead provision, then the Rules Committee could have made in order an amendment to strike it from the bill. That would have given Members the chance to vote up or down either to keep or remove the provision. That would have been regular order, that would have been fair, that would have been open, but, instead, House Republican leadership took it upon themselves to replace ",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgH6313-6.txt,2259,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,July
5112,topic-id,660,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume before I go to my first speaker in order to respond to some of my friend's points. I want to begin by talking about the amendment process just very quickly.[[Page H6316]]  It is worth noting 72 amendments are made in order here; 47 of those were actually Democratic amendments. Many of the amendments that my friend referred to that had been submitted to the Rules Committee, at least a third of them, were knocked out because they were simply out of order.  But my friend is correct: it is not an open rule. I do remind him that the first people to eliminate open rules on appropriations bills were not It was actually the Democratic majority in 2009 that ended the practice and, for 2 years, allowed almost no amendments on any appropriations bills, and most appropriations bills never came to the floor. So I think my friends bear a considerable amount of responsibility for where we find ourselves today.  I do want to talk a little bit, too, briefly, about my friend's comments about the AUMF, because he has been a good friend and a close ally in an area that we have a similar concern.  I agree with my friend. We need to debate this, and we need to have an AUMF that is more in tune with the times and, frankly, reintroduces congressional power and congressional oversight. I have worked with my friend in the past on that. I am going to continue to work with him on it going forward.  But in the case of the Lee amendment, which, in full disclosure, I supported in the Appropriations Committee, the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, which is not the Appropriations Committee, made it known that he would lodge a point of order; so, in other words, that would never get to the floor.  In place, we have put something that, frankly, will at least require the administration, on the passage of this bill or the Defense Authorization Act, in which it is also found, to submit a report that justifies where the administration is legally, lays out their strategy, lays out their costs, and gives us a chance to begin a debate.  As a sign of good faith, I am happy to report that the Foreign Relations Committee, which actually does have jurisdiction here, actually had their first hearing on a new AUMF earlier this week. So I think we are trying to get to the same place. My friend may have a different way to get there, but I agree with him, we need to reexamine, redebate, and, I think, reenact a new I think we are trying to get there in a step-by-step, logical progression.  Finally, while my friend is concerned about where we will end up in this process and, I think, legitimately so, I also want to point out we have actually managed to come together here the last couple of years and, I suspect, will again.  In fiscal year 2016, we had the same series of events, and yet Congress came to an agreement on full funding that was bipartisan and passed by substantial numbers of both parties participating, a majority in each party. The same thing was true in fiscal year 2017. My hope is that it will be true again in fiscal year 2018.  But this is an important part of the process. We need to go through this. At the end of the day, and I tell this to my friends on the right and the left, we will end up with a bicameral, bipartisan appropriations bill. There is simply no other way to fund the Government of the United States, and we pledge to work toward that.

Quite frankly, this bill has a very substantial increase in spending at the VA, and that is something that I know, in committee, garnered wide bipartisan support. Let's wait and see where we go.  I just want to say I think there will be continuing discussion about this, but there is also a concern, always, on something like this that is controversial. We have seen our friends do this before. Sometimes you will put an amendment in but you won't vote for the final bill.  When you are trying to calculate whether you pass something, you can't have amendments that cost you votes, that don't get you votes. I am not suggesting that is my friend's purpose. It is not at all. I know it is not. I know he is very sincere in this. I am saying that could easily be the effect.  All I can tell you is we will continue to work through the bill.

5120,topic-id,4180,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I just want to quickly respond to my friends and remind them that it wasn't Republicans that got rid of open rules on appropriations. It was my friends. So you can't set one standard for yourself, and then say: But you now have to go back to the way it was. We now have to be treated as a minority, in contrast to the way that we treated you.  I am sorry, that is just difficult. We actually tried to do that for a couple of years, and we did come back to open rules. And I would still prefer that, to tell you the truth. I have lost this argument in my own conference.  But if my friends will recall, last year on, I believe, the Energy and[[Page H6319]]Water Appropriations bill, they slipped an amendment in. It was perfectly legitimate for them to do so. It was an open rule. They got that amendment adopted. They did not vote for the bill, even though the amendment was adopted. We lost a lot of votes, in consequence, because of the amendment.  So there is always that calculus when you put these things together. There is a difference between an amendment that is a substantive amendment, and an amendment that is unrelated and a poison-pill amendment. Our side just decided they weren't going to subject themselves to that any longer. I am not sure that I agree with that decision, but that is the reality of where we are.  There is a second consideration here, too, in terms of limitation that I think is worth noting. We are moving under an expedited situation because we began this process late. I want to take responsibility for that on our side of the aisle.  I think all of the appropriations bills could have and should have been finished for FY17 in December of 2016. Instead, we started to allow the new administration to have input. We pushed that off and did a 4-month continuing resolution. During that period, we did not negotiate back and forth. We finally passed a bill in So we are moving with exceptional speed.  I think it is pretty remarkable at this point that all 12 appropriations bills have been reported out of committee, and are preparing to go here. Our leadership made, I think, a smart decision, in that here are four that all relate to a common theme of security for the country. Let's get those done. That is sort of first things first.  Let's come back and deal with the other eight in It is my hope that that is what we will do, probably in packages again. But we are trying to move quickly.  It is also finally worth noting that, again, this process, compared to the process my Democratic friends followed, is far more open. There are far more amendments now, even under a structured rule like this, than they allowed when they were in the majority on appropriations bills.  We can go get the numbers and count, but we are at least trying to get back to getting the bills to the floor and having a pretty generous latitude for serious amendments. We will always disagree over which ones are made in order. A lot of Republican amendments weren't made in order either, but 72 amendments on an appropriations bill is a lot of amendments.  Hopefully, this process can get better as we go forward. I want to work with my friends in that regard, but I am still very proud of the product that we are presenting and very proud of the number of amendments that are being allowed.

July 25, 2017.     Re Oppose H.3219 Security Minibus--Vote No on Border wall.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of our coalition of almost      90 environmental, faith, immigration, and civil rights      organizations, we are writing to strongly urge you to oppose      funding for the continued construction of a border wall along      the U.S.-Mexico border. The construction of a border wall      serves as a symbol of hostility towards immigrants, and      undermines the civil rights of communities living along our      southern border. It also imposes environmental costs and      natural disaster threats on border communities, especially      indigenous communities, harms native wildlife and wastes tens      of billions in taxpayer dollars.       As the House moves to consider the Fiscal Year 2018      Security Minibus, H.3219, we are profoundly concerned      about the inclusion of $1.6 billion slated for border wall.      In addition to spending billions of taxpayer dollars, adding      funding for the border wall in this legislative package      undermines a fair and transparent legislative process.      Instead of allowing legislators and the public to fully      consider the impacts of funding wall construction, the      Majority is using rushed and underhanded legislative      maneuvers to circumvent the vast and legitimate opposition      that exists for this measure, even within their own party.       Including border wall funding in a Security Minibus is      based on the false premise that our borders are somehow      violent and insecure. This false premise has been used to      justify and advance anti-immigrant, anti-border, pro-     criminalization, and anti-environment legislation that has      negative economic and civil rights impacts on border      communities. The fact is that communities along the border      are some of the safest in the country. According to the FBI's      Uniformed Crime Reports, cities on the border are safer than      cities away from the border. Places like El Paso, Texas have      long topped the lists of safest cities for their low crime      and violence. Additionally, according to the American      Immigration Council, communities with more immigrants are      likely to be safer than places with fewer immigrants.       Border walls are an ineffective tool in curbing      undocumented migration between the United States and nations      south of the border. Rather than deter migration, the current      650-mile barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border has forced      vulnerable migrant populations to pursue more dangerous      routes of travel. The continued construction of a border wall      portrays an attitude of hatred and animosity towards our      neighboring nations. Additionally, construction of this wall      would undermine indigenous border communities, potentially      destroying elements of their history, archeology, and      culture. Border security measures must consider the historic      Tribal lands and families occupying the southern border.       Finally, the current proposal in Fiscal Year 2018 Security      Minibus calls for the construction of 60 miles of levee      border wall in the South Texas Rio Grande Valley; 28 miles      would be levee-border wall, with 2.9 miles slated to be built      in the Santa Ana Wildlife This Refuge is home to      diverse wildlife species, ecotourism opportunities, and rich      natural beauty. When levee border walls are constructed, they      negatively impact wildlife migration, pose severe flooding      risks, destroy natural habitats, and lead to potential      increased extinction rates. In order to construct existing      border-walls, dozens of laws protecting our environment,      public health, and sacred natural lands were waived.

July 26, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,      the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose H.3219,      the so-called Make American Secure Appropriations Act, 2018,      which includes the Defense, Military Construction and      Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water      funding bills. This package includes provisions that are      harmful to water and ocean resources, cuts funding for clean      energy innovation, undermines safe nuclear waste storage, and      attacks border communities. Furthermore, this bill continues      the House Leadership's pattern of adding harmful policy      riders into spending bills in an attempt to avoid regular      order. Lastly, the inclusion of $1.6 billion for the      continued construction of a failed, divisive, and anti-     environmental wall along the southern border of the United      States would be the latest example of inserting harmful,      controversial and even radical policy proposals onto spending      bills, which undermines the legislative process and the      already complex budget process. This bill reflects a set of      values that is not shared by the American people--one of      clean air and clean water, one of equity and prosperity, one      of safety and security.                         Border Wall Provisions       The border wall is a powerful symbol of hatred toward      immigrants and undermines the civil rights of communities      along our southern border, and it would increase the      environmental and natural disaster risks to border      communities, harm wildlife, and waste billions of taxpayer      dollars on an ineffective border security tool. The current      proposal would lead to the construction of 60 miles of new      border wall to be built in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas,      including levee-border walls and 2.9 miles built within the      Santa Ana National Wildlife This refuge is home to      diverse wildlife species, ecotourism opportunities, and rich      natural beauty. When levee-border walls are constructed, they      negatively impact wildlife migration, pose severe flooding      risks, destroy natural habitats, and can increase the risk of      wildlife extinctions occurring. In order to construct      existing border walls, dozens of laws protecting our      environment, public health, and sacred natural lands were      waived. Our nation's natural habitats, vibrant wildlife, and      healthy ecosystems are an unacceptable sacrifice to make for      ineffective security measures.                            Water Provisions       The Energy and Water Appropriations division includes      damaging policy riders and report language in contravention      of regular order. Specifically, 108(a) aims to allow the      Trump administration to disregard countless laws as it      carries out a scheme to undermine clean water safeguards. The      provision would authorize EPA and the Army Corps to repeal      the Clean Water Rule without following basic and longstanding      processes aimed at giving people a voice in their      government's actions. For instance, a repeal could ignore      Clean Water Act and Administrative Procedure Act requirements      to meaningfully consider public comment. It could also      interfere with the courts' ability to review if the      withdrawal is ``arbitrary or capricious.'' This fact reveals      the real motivation for the rider--its proponents want to      shield the Trump administration's repeal of carefully-     developed clean water protections from public scrutiny and      from independent judicial review. Without the Clean Water      Rule, the streams that help supply public drinking water      systems serving one in three Americans will remain at risk.       Additionally, 107 would exempt certain discharges of      dredged or fill material from Army Corps' permitting under      the Clean Water The Act already exempts these kinds of      activities from such permits, but requires permitting when      the impacts to waterways would be more harmful. This rider      would have the effect of nullifying Congress's direction to      subject those nonexempt discharges to pollution control      officials' review. Another rider would undermine the      restoration of the San Joaquin River, the second longest      river in 203 would prohibit spending any      funds to implement the legal settlement between the United      States, fishing and conservation groups, and Friant water      users regarding the restoration of the river. The settlement      ended 20 years of litigation and continues to be supported by      water users, conservation and fishing groups, and state and      federal governments.       Finally, the bill also includes a provision to halt      implementation of the National Ocean Policy (505), an      important planning tool to coordinate the work of dozens of      federal and state agencies with overlapping and sometimes      conflicting responsibilities for addressing ocean      development. These riders, and any further damaging policy      provisions that will be offered, undercut the public process      for determining how to implement the laws that Congress has      passed. They are bad policies that will put American's health      and safety at risk and they have no place on a funding bill.                           Energy Provisions       The bill also dramatically cuts federal clean energy      spending, which has consistently proven its worth by      directing RD&D funds that drive job creation, economic growth      and reduce health and environmental costs. The committee bill      cuts funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and      Renewable Energy by $1 billion (48% reduction) hurting      important programs that support the development and      deployment of wind energy, solar energy, advanced      manufacturing, sustainable transportation technologies, and      building technologies. Recklessly, the bill eliminates      funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy      (ARPA-E) and the Title 17 loan guarantee program. Defunding      ARPA-E cripples our ability to commercialize new technologies      that will serve to meet our future clean energy needs.      Furthermore, the Title 17 loan guarantee program has a strong      track record of lowering the risks on deploying projects that      can make cleaner and cheaper energy a reality.       The bill also includes $120 million in a continued attempt      to push the unworkable, long ago rejected proposal to dispose      of nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain, It also includes      a rider in 507 that prevents funds being used to close      the facility. Decades from now others will face the precise      predicament we find ourselves in today if Congress tries to      ram through unworkable nuclear waste solutions contentiously      opposed by States, lacking a sound legal structure of      science-based foundation, and devoid of public understanding      and consent. The current efforts to quickly open Yucca      Mountain and an interim storage facility simply will not      work.       This bill also rejects the sensible plan to cancel the      risky and enormously costly mixed oxide (MOX) program,      intended to dispose of excess plutonium from the U.nuclear      weapons program by turning it into nuclear reactor fuel.      Instead this bill mandates that the Department of Energy      waste an additional $340 million on construction of the MOX      fuel fabrication plant. Congress should reject the MOX      program and support an improved approach for disposing of      excess plutonium.       We strongly oppose this minibus package, which would put      our energy future at risk and would harm border communities,      and it includes poison pill riders that will harm our      nation's public health, air, water, lands, and wildlife. We      also urge opposition to any amendments that would harm health      and the environment.           Sincerely,       Alaska Wilderness League, Clean Water Action, Defenders of      Wildlife, Earthjustice, Environment America, Environmental      Protection Information Center, Klamath Forest Alliance,      League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense      Council, NextGen, Public Citizen, Restore America's      Estuaries, San Juan Citizens Alliance, Save EPA, Sierra Club,      Western Environmental Law Center, Western Watersheds Project,      Wildlands  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Coalition on Human Needs against this minibus.                                     Coalition on Human Needs,                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the Coalition on Human      Needs, I strongly urge you to vote against the package of      military-related appropriations bills expected to come to the      House floor this week. These appropriations bills--including      those for Defense, Military Construction and Veterans'      Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water--should not      be taken up until there is a bipartisan agreement to lift the      sequestration caps called for in the Budget Control Act in a      way that provides for increased funding for domestic and      international (non-defense discretionary, or NDD)      appropriations, not just for the military.       As you know, defense appropriations exceed the Budget      Control Act cap for FY 2018 by $72 billion. Without      legislation to raise the caps, sequestration will eliminate      that increase through across-the-board cuts to military      programs. Legislation to lift the caps requires bipartisan      support, and we expect that support will not be forthcoming      without an agreement to raise the caps for non-defense      discretionary spending as well.       The Coalition on Human Needs, which is made up of      organizations representing millions of human service      providers, faith organizations, policy experts, civil rights,      labor, and other advocates concerned with meeting the needs      of low-income and vulnerable people, strongly believes that      our national security depends on a balanced approach that      invests in our domestic needs. Our people gain economic      security from access to education and training, affordable      housing, a reliable and modern infrastructure, and child care[[Page H6321]]     and other work supports. We need public health protections      from epidemics and environmental protections to ensure clean      air and water and to protect against climate disasters.      Stopping the erosion in domestic human needs programs is      necessary for our security and our future. NDD programs apart      from Veterans Affairs will be cut by $22 billion in FY 2018,      5 percent below the previous year and 17 percent below the      level in FY 2010, taking inflation into account. This harsh      cut abandons previous congressional commitments to provide      defense and non-defense programs with equal relief from      sequestration. We urge you to vote against this package of      defense-related bills because they should not be considered      without a comprehensive agreement to lift the caps for all      the programs that contribute to our security.       We also ask you to vote against this package of      appropriations bills because it includes wasteful funding for      the border wall that will not increase our security, and to      oppose extraneous and irresponsible policy riders such as      those restricting opportunities for young people in the      Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to enter the      military or weakening the Congressional Budget       Please vote no on this package of appropriations bills, and      instead make it a top priority to achieve a bipartisan      agreement to lift sequestration caps for non-defense      programs, not solely for the military.           Sincerely yours,                                                Deborah Weinstein,                                               Executive  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to my colleagues from AFSCME opposed to this bill.                                                       AFSCME,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose the ``Minibus''      appropriations bill which packages together the Defense,      Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs, Legislative      Branch, and Energy and Water funding bills.       Congress should not craft funding bills that unilaterally      violate the Budget Control Act (BCA) and the parity      principle. In this case, defense is increased far above the      cap while non-defense discretionary (NDD) spending is      severely underfunded. In fact, passing this bill will not      promote American security; rather it charts a direct course      for deep cuts to the military. The defense funding levels      would trigger sequestration in January of 2018, requiring      cuts of $72 billion. Further, dramatically increasing only      defense funding endangers investments in essential public      services. This is evidenced by House Appropriations bills'      deep cuts of $5 billion below the current non-defense caps      and deep cuts that harm labor, health, human services,      education, housing, transportation and other important      programs. Instead of reaching a bipartisan agreement as      called for by many members of Congress, this bill makes it      harder to address urgent needs in other non-defense programs.       A budget deal remains the most likely path toward enactment      of appropriation bills that responsibly meet the nation's      national security commitments and domestic needs. AFSCME      urges Congress to focus attention on a budget solution that      provides commensurate increases for both defense and non-     defense funding. This is the best way to avoid a fall budget      showdown that would leave defense and all government      programs, including state and local governments, in the lurch      with considerable budget uncertainty and the threat of deep      and damaging cuts.       We also oppose this minibus package, because it includes      poison pill riders. This bill creates a new level of      egregious riders by air-dropping in controversial funding for      a border wall that is unrelated to any of the four bills.       It's time to address the most basic of congressional      responsibilities, which means passing clean funding bills in      a timely manner under regular order.           Sincerely,                                                       Scott Frey,                           Director of Federal Government  Mr.Mr.Speaker, finally, I include in the Record a letter sent to my colleagues in opposition to this bill from American Federation of                              American Federation of Teachers,                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of Teachers, I write to express      our strong opposition to the Make America Secure      Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.3219), the fiscal year 2018      appropriations ``minibus'' bill that bundles together the      appropriations bills for defense, energy and water      development, military construction, Veterans Affairs and the      legislative branch. We oppose this bill because it moves in      the wrong direction by failing to lift the sequester caps in      a manner that maintains parity between defense and nondefense      discretionary funding, and by including ideological poison      pill riders.       Our national security is critical, but it requires      investments that help working families seize the      opportunities they need and deserve, and appropriations bills      must invest in critical public services that enable these      opportunities. Sequester caps have unduly restricted these      kinds of foundational investments; without removing arbitrary      caps, crucial investments will suffer. Yet instead of working      toward a bipartisan deal to lift these punitive funding caps      in a way that treats nondefense discretionary funding      equitably, the speaker is moving forward with a minibus      package that promotes a strategy to drastically cut      nondefense programs as a means to increase defense funding.      This must not be an either-or choice: National security      requires strength at home and opportunities for our next      generation, not the elimination of the funding they need to      create those opportunities.       In addition, the well-being of the nation is further      undermined in this bill by the inclusion of ideological      poison pill policy riders. We particularly object to the      inclusion of funding for an ill-conceived and mean-spirited      border wall that is unrelated to any of the four      appropriations bills included in the minibus.       As the defense portion of this bill violates the Budget      Control Act, the increases in funding proposed by this bill      are imaginary. The cuts this bill proposes are not.       I urge you to reject this bill and work to raise the      sequester caps, to allow balanced funding bills--ones that      adequately invest in the health, safety and education of our      nation, and do not include ideological poison pill policy      riders--to move forward. Until this has been accomplished, we      urge you to oppose this bill.           Sincerely,                                                 Randi Weingarten,                                                         Mr.Mr.Speaker, let me just say to my good friend from Oklahoma: The Republicans presided over the most closed Congress in history in the last session. In history. And this year you are on your way to beating that record.  The gentleman talks about exceptional speed in which we are moving these appropriations bills to the floor. I am not so much impressed with exceptional speed when it comes to the spending of billions of taxpayer dollars. I want to make sure we get it right. That is why we are asking for an open process.  The gentleman talked about poison pills. Let me go back to the Barbara Lee AUMF amendment. I hardly consider that a poison pill when it was unanimously approved in the Appropriations Committee, and the gentleman even voted for it.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.Sherman).  ",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgH6313-6.txt,2259,FINANCIAL CHOICE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,June
5122,topic-id,3845,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I certainly would never expect my friend to vote for the rule. I mean, I don't think I have ever voted for a Democratic rule. I know very few Democrats have ever voted for our rules. I don't think I know any. So that is kind of a normal part of the  I want to commend the gentleman for getting that language into the bill. Again, I respect the gentleman's right to not vote for the bill. It is a big bill. There are lots of different things in it.  But I think he makes an important point, indirectly, that there are lots of overlapping things where we do agree inside this bill. My friends are certainly free to vote ``no,'' and I suspect many will.  There are many occasions in a bill like this, particularly related to defense and particularly related to veterans, where the component parts actually have enormous bipartisan support.[[Page H6322]]That is certainly true in the Veterans It is certainly true with the gentleman's provision that he has gotten in now successive bills even under Republican  I want to commend him for his work in that regard. I agree very much with his intention. My friend from Massachusetts and I may have some differences on this and that process, but that is another person that I agree with in terms of the War Powers Act and in terms of trying to get a new AUMF and reclaim congressional power.  I actually think, strangely enough, even though we disagree on this, that this bill starts us maybe down that road again by requiring the administration to submit a report to justify legally where we are at and why, to tell us the strategy, to lay out the costs.  I commend my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr.Royce, for holding a hearing on that. I see us moving back in that way toward regular order and, hopefully, toward common ground.  Again, I understand my friend's objections, even when I don't agree with him. But I also thank my friend from California for pointing out that there are parts where we do agree. They are important, and they are incorporated in this bill. Maybe we can make it better in the amendment process.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I include in the Record a letter from Amnesty International rejecting the border wall funding.                                        Amnesty International,                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2017. Amnesty International USA Urges House to Reject Southern Border Wall                                 Funding       Dear Representative: On behalf of Amnesty International USA      and our more than one million members and supporters      nationwide, we strongly urge you to reject any and all      requests included in H.3219 (Department of Defense      Appropriations Act, 2018 AKA Make America Secure      Appropriations Act, 2018) for the funding of a southern      border wall. The construction of such a wall would pose      serious human rights consequences and would violate      international law and standards in two major ways.       First, Congress should not approve funding for a wall that      will cut through tribal land unless the U.government first      obtains the free, prior, and informed consent of affected      Nations, as prescribed by Article 19 of the United Nations      (``UN'') Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous The      U.must consult in good faith with Native American Nations      who would be impacted by the construction of the proposed      wall. The National Congress of American Indians and the      Legislative Council of the Tohono O'odham, the second-largest      tribe in the United States by land holdings, have both passed      resolutions opposing the construction of the wall without      tribal consent.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the League of United      Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the nation's oldest and      largest Latino civil rights organization, I write to oppose      any legislative attempts to keep funding the construction of      a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the expansion of a Trump      deportation force, and the increase of detention beds in      immigrant incarceration centers.       As the House moves to consider the Fiscal Year 18      Department of Homeland Security Appropriation bill, and other      security related bills, LULAC is deeply concerned about      language that would provide billions for the construction of      a costly and divisive wall along the Southern border, as well      as hundreds of millions to hire a deportation force and      expand immigrant incarceration.       The continued criminalization of immigrants, militarization      of the border, and rush to build a costly, ineffective, and      destructive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border are aims of      radical politicians seeking to advance a xenophobic, anti-     Latino agenda in this Unfortunately, this      administration has failed to focus on legitimate staffing      concerns at ports of entry, rebuilding port infrastructure,      and protecting the land, water, and environment of the      border. Instead, it is looking to seize the private property      of border residents, destroy the natural habitat and wildlife      in border communities, endanger border water supplies, and      turn immigrant neighbors, families, and children into      criminals who merit incarceration and deportation.       The House of Representatives should not enable these aims      and should oppose any language seeking to advance the radical      right-wing agenda of demonizing border communities and      scapegoating immigrants. LULAC opposes any DHS appropriation      bill, or any other appropriation vehicle, that funds border      walls/levees, the hiring of Trump's deportation force and the      continued expansion immigrant incarceration.           Sincerely,                                              Roger Rocha, Jr.,                                         LULAC National  Mr.I include in the Record a fact sheet by the Washington Office on Latin America entitled: ``Key points about the $1.6 billion border wall.''                                                    July 24, 2017.       Please find below a rigorously sourced analysis of the $1.6      billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.      The border wall funding is expected to be attached to the      appropriations ``minibus'' in the Rules Committee later this      week.       As a leading research and advocacy organization with years      of field research and experience working on migration and      border security issues, WOLA (the Washington Office on Latin      America) outlines a number of reasons why this proposal will      be costly, ineffective, and divisive.       WOLA believes that these are overwhelming reasons to oppose      President Trump's request for a border wall and to vote      against its inclusion in a bill claiming to fund national      security. Regardless of party, it is clear that $1.6 billion      spent to start building the wall is money wasted.       Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any      questions or would like more information.           Best regards,                                                     Adam      [From the Washington Office on Latin America, July 24, 2017]             Key Points about the $1.6 Billion Border Wall  A Costly, Ineffective, and Divisive Border Wall Doesn't Belong in a                   ``National Security'' Appropriation       The House of Representatives is rushing to the floor four      Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 appropriations bills related to      national security, which will be combined into a so-called      ``minibus.'' In addition, the House Republican leadership is      expected to carve out the most controversial part of the      Homeland Security appropriations bill--President Trump's full      request to fund the border wall--and use a procedural      maneuver in the Rules Committee to attach it to this week's      funding bill. Along with money for our military, veterans,      and other defense-related items, the House is expected to      consider $1.6 billion to start building President Trump's      proposed border wall.                    The border wall would be costly       The bill would fund the Trump administration's full request      for $1.6 billion to build 60 miles of new border wall and      fortify 14 miles of existing wall. That comes out to $21.2      million per mile. This is more than four times the $4.84      million per mile cost of fencing built since 2011.       At the rate proposed by President Trump, building      additional fencing along the 1,317 border miles that lack it      would cost $28 billion. And that figure doesn't count the      cost of building in more difficult terrain, access roads,      maintenance, or acquiring land in Texas, where almost all      border landholdings are privately held.       Building the wall carries a huge opportunity cost. $1.6      billion could support many more important border security      priorities. These include upgrading and hiring more personnel      for ports of entry, the main vector for illegal drugs. The      ports have $5 billion in unmet infrastructure needs. They      could include more technology so that border-security      agencies have a better idea of what is happening along the      border. This would make continued National Guard deployments      unnecessary. They could include greatly increased investment      in moving costs and bonuses for Border Patrol agents who      agree to relocate from quieter border sectors to busier ones      in need of manpower.                  The border wall would be ineffective       The proposed border wall will not stop drug trafficking. To      understand drug trafficking across the U.S.-Mexico border,      it's first necessary to understand the difference[[Page H6323]]     between ``ports of entry''--the 44 official land border      crossings--and the vast spaces between them, where fencing      exists or where Trump's wall would be built. The ports of      entry are where U.border authorities seize the majority of      heroin and opioids, methamphetamine, and cocaine. ``The big      issue, really, right now on drugs coming into the United      States is the ports of entry,'' Homeland Security Secretary      John Kelly told a Senate committee in Building a wall      would have no effect on smuggling at ports of entry.       Meanwhile, in the rural border areas where the White House      proposes to build, a wall really isn't much of a barrier. It      slows individuals down for the 10 or 15 minutes it takes to      climb over. In a populated area, where authorities can      respond quickly, that 10 or 15 minutes makes a big      difference. But almost all of these areas already have high      fences, because of the hundreds of miles of building that      followed the Secure Fence Act of 2006. In emptier areas,      reducing a border crosser's head start by 10 to 15 minutes is      hardly a deterrent--and in Texas, the Rio Grande already      serves that purpose.                   The border wall would be dangerous       More wall-building could have tragic consequences.      Violence, poverty, and family ties ensure that migrants will      continue attempting the risky journey through the border      region's inhospitable wilderness zones. Every year, U.     authorities find the remains of hundreds of migrants, dead of      dehydration and exposure in deserts and scrublands. With more      fencing, migrants may attempt the crossing in even more      remote areas, where the probability of death will be even      higher.                   The border wall would be divisive       Building a wall sends a toxic message to one of our two      closest neighbors, a country on whose cooperation the United      States' national security and economic prosperity depends.      Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner.      Our common border is 1,970 miles long. Mexico collaborates on      efforts to guard against extra-regional terrorists      hypothetically using its territory to enter the United      After 12 years of steadily declining migration, more      Mexican citizens leave the United States than enter it each      year. In January, it extradited its most notorious drug lord      to the United       It makes no sense to undermine this relationship by      building a permanent barrier along our border with It      makes no sense to jeopardize badly needed cooperation by      portraying Mexico as a sinister source of threats that should      foot the bill for the wall (which, the 2018 appropriation      makes clear, it will not have to do). Mexico certainly has      problems, particularly corruption and human rights abuse. But      these are aspects of the relationship the United States must      work on, rather than push Mexico away with an aggressive      construction project.                   The border wall should be rejected       WOLA believes that these are overwhelming reasons to oppose      President Trump's request for a border wall and to vote      against its inclusion in a bill claiming to fund national      security. Regardless of party, it is clear that $1.6 billion      spent to start building the wall is money wasted. Let's stop      this now before it becomes even larger, more costly, more      counterproductive, and more divisive.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record an NBC News article on how the border wall is being planned to decimate the National Butterfly Center in the wildlife corridor of the lower Rio Grande                     [From NBC News, July 26, 2017] Border Wall Push Creates Flap in House--And at the National Butterfly                                  Center                          (By Suzanne Gamboa)       Washington.--A national butterfly preserve is the latest      flashpoint in the border wall debate as Democrats accuse the      GOP of rigging the process to slip wall funding into a pack      of House spending bills possibly up for a vote this week.       While there are not specific details on exactly where $1.6      billion proposed for President Trump's border wall will be      spent, an amendment sponsored by John Carter, R-Texas,      calls for $498 million to go to 28 miles of ``new bollard      levee wall'' in Hidalgo County in Texas' Rio Grande Valley--     home to the National Butterfly       The amendment also calls for $251 million to repair      secondary border fencing in the San Diego area and $38.2      million for planning future border wall construction. Another      $784 million is for 32 miles of ``border bollard fencing'' in      Starr County, Texas, also in the Rio Grande       The butterfly center's executive director Marianna Trevino      Wright said she found a work crew on the butterfly center's      property last week, and she worried that their efforts might      be related to construction of the proposed border wall. The      workers had chain saws and work trucks and had cut and shred      brush, trees and plants, she said. Trevino Wright said she      found surveyor stakes and ``X'' marks on the property. She      posted photos on the center's web site and Facebook page.       The 100-acre center is part of the wildlife corridor of the      lower Rio Grande Valley, which is a migratory flyway for      birds, butterflies and a host of other wildlife. The center's      property already is bisected by earthen levees. Two thirds of      the property is below the levee, Trevino Wright said.       ``The property we have acquired here used to be a      commercial onion farm and we have spent the last 15 years      fundraising for our efforts and growing plants and purchasing      materials to revegetate this area, to plant native, host and      nectar plants and provide breeding and feeding areas to      support wildlife, especially butterflies,'' she said.       ``We do have folks who come from around the state, nation,      world for the birds and butterflies and other things we have      here on the property. Sometimes people show up looking for      indigo snakes,'' Trevino Wright said.       In a previously issued statement, the Army Corps of      Engineers denied that its contractors cleared or removed      trees at the center, but acknowledged the crew placed X      markings on the ground for mapping and wooden stakes flagging      proposed locations to bore holes for possible construction.      The agency said its contractor collected two soil samples      from the levee but did so away from the butterfly center.       Neither U.Customs and Border Protection, the Army Corps      of Engineers, nor other agencies have outlined plans for the      proposed border wall on the center property.       Still, Trevino Wright and her supporters worry about what      the center called on Facebook the ``government secret      activity on our property.''       There also is angst over the possibility of border wall      construction in another refuge along the Rio Grande--the San      Ana Wildlife It is considered the ``crown jewel'' of      wildlife refuges and one of the nation's top birding spots.      The Texas Observer first reported that crews were taking core      samples, setting off a reaction among birders who flock to      the spot that boasts 400 species of birds.       The American Birding Association put out a plea to its      members to write and call their members of Congress asking      that they stop construction of the wall.       Carlos Diaz, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection,      told NBC News he did not have information on what plans or      hopes there are for putting fencing or a wall on the      butterfly center's property or the Santa Ana       In a previously issued news release following a meeting      with Rio Grande Valley mayors last week, Customs and Border      Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers said in a news      release they are conducting research activities in areas      slated for construction of new or replacement border wall,      with $20 million in reprogrammed funds approved by       Also money provided for fiscal 2017 is being used to      replace pedestrian barriers in San Diego and El Centro,      California; replace vehicle barriers and pedestrian barriers      in El Paso, Texas and install 35 new gates at gaps in border      fencing built already in the Rio Grande Valley, according to      Army Corps of Engineers information provided by       In a hearing Monday held by the U.House Rules Committee,      Jim McGovern, D-Mass., pointed out that American      taxpayers are footing the tab for the border wall work, not      Mexico as Trump had promised. That's a point that should be      debated and could be if the border wall funding was given      it's own vote, he said.       ``This is a rigged process,'' McGovern said.       With Congress closing in on a summer recess, the House is      trying to push through a batch of four spending bills the GOP      has said are critical for security. But the GOP plan to      include $1.6 million for 74 miles of President Donald Trump's      border ``wall'' means those who oppose the border wall      funding have to vote against the military spending.       Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who chairs the Rules      Committee, said Monday he made the amendment providing the      border wall money ``self-executing,'' setting up the dilemma      for opponents of the wall funding.       ``You are dadgum right I put it in there,'' Sessions said.       ``We are going to comply with allowing the president to      have things he wants also,'' he said.       Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., called the move ``sneaky'' and      said House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP House members were doing      Trump's ``dirty work.''       ``They want to make sure Trump can build his wall, but they      also want desperately to avoid a clean up or down vote on the      issue,'' Gallego told reporters in a call       Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said in an email      that House and Senate Republicans' agenda includes a      commitment to increased border security ``and we are      following through on that promise.''  Mr.Mr.Speaker, process matters. And I have come to the conclusion, after having served here for some time now, that a lousy process leads to a lousy product and lousy legislation.  I know many of my colleagues were moved, like I was yesterday, when Senator John McCain appeared on the Senate floor and not only engaged in Senate business, but actually gave a very eloquent, passionate speech.  I want to quote Senator McCain from yesterday. He said: ``Let's return to regular order. We've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.[[Page H6324]]That's an approach that's been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires.  ``We're getting nothing done.''  I agree with Senator McCain, and I believe that a majority in this House, Democrats and Republicans, agree with Senator But at some point we have to stop saying: ``Well, we will get better. We will get better. It will be better next time. It will be better next time.''  Because what is happening is, it is getting worse each time we bring legislations or appropriations to the floor. We are getting more and more restrictive. We are shutting out more and more voices, not just Democratic voices, but Republican voices as well.  This is a deliberative body. We ought to be able to deliberate a little bit. And both Democrats and Republicans have good ideas. Let us use this opportunity to change things, to go back to the regular order that Senator McCain talked so eloquently about yesterday.  There is an opportunity to do that. It doesn't stop us considering the appropriations bills, but what it says is that we will do so under an open rule. We will go back to the way we all say we want it to be, an open process.  If you like some of these amendments, you vote for them. You make this legislation better. If you don't like the amendments, then you vote against them. I mean, that is the way this body is supposed to operate; none of this underhanded, self-executing of controversial provisions that may not have the support of the majority in this  Let's go back to regular order. This is the moment. This is a defining moment.                              {time}  1330  Democrats and Republicans, if you really mean it when you say you want regular order, then you have to vote for regular order once in a while. You can't keep on making excuses. I think this is the moment that we have on these appropriations bills to send a message to the leadership that we want things done differently here. We want to open things up. I think that is what the majority on both sides really want. But the question is whether or not we all have the guts to vote for an open process. So we have an opportunity to do that.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can bring this legislation up today under an open rule. Let everybody offer their amendments. Let's bring it up. Let's do this today. No more excuses.  If you mean what you say when you say you want regular order, this is the opportunity to vote for it. So please vote ``no'' on the previous question. And I oppose the underlying bill. Maybe I won't if we can fix it through regular order. Maybe we can add a number of amendments, and even I would support some of these amendments.  Let's give it a chance. Let's work in a bipartisan way. Let's go back to the days when we did have open rules on appropriations. This is the opportunity to do it. Vote ``no'' on the previous question.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

5123,topic-id,1994,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I thank, as always, my good friend for a spirited and thoughtful debate. He always makes good points. Frankly, I always find myself more comfortable when we are on the same side--as we occasionally are--than when we are on opposite sides.  My friend has made many valuable contributions to this institution, particularly pushing us relentlessly in the right direction of reclaiming our war-making authority. Having said that, it is always great to call for a new system, a new way, or a return to open rules without admitting you are the ones that abandoned them. We actually tried to restore them. I regret we failed in that, quite frankly, but I will have to say both sides have gotten used to not doing open rules because they don't want to cast tough votes. That is why my friends abandoned the open rule process when they were in the majority in 2009, and, honestly, that is why we abandoned it last year.  I regret that. I will work with my friend probably not today but going forward in trying to reclaim that because I think when we lost it, we diminished the power of every individual Member in We thought we were protecting them, but the reality is they now can no longer come to the floor as an individual and present their own idea.  But at least in this case there are 72 amendments. The majority of them are from my friend's side of the aisle. I would hope going forward, particularly when we consider the next eight appropriations bills, we will continue to be very generous in that regard.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. H.3219 represents the first step toward fulfilling our primary obligation as Members of Congress: to fund the government.  We should all be proud of what we have accomplished in putting this bill forward.  The bill contains the provisions of four of the bills passed out of the Appropriations Committee representing the work of the Subcommittees on Defense; Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies; Legislative Branch; and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  The bill will significantly increase funding for national defense and ensure that the men and women in the Armed Forces have the tools they need. We also increase funding to our veterans to ensure our fighting men and women will be taken care of long after they leave the service of their country, and we fund key Member priorities in the areas of Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies; and Legislative  Mr.Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for their hard work.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is ENTITLED to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . . . [and] has      no substantive legislative or policy implications      whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said.      Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative      Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th      edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the      previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is      generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority      Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . . . When      the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of      the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to      ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then      controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or      yield for the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

5319,topic-id,1036,"Mr.President, each May we recognize National Police Week to honor the service and sacrifice of U.law enforcement officers and to pay tribute to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. One meaningful way for us to honor our police officers and other law enforcement officials this week is to give them the tools they need to stop the illegal firearms traffickers who threaten their lives and the lives of those they protect.  Today, I rise to join Senator Leahy in introducing the Stop Illegal Trafficking and Firearms Our bill would strengthen Federal law by making it easier for prosecutors to go after gun traffickers, while fully protecting the rights of the vast majority of gun owners who are law-abiding citizens.  Straw purchasing is intended to achieve only one result, and that is to put a gun in the hands of a criminal who cannot legally obtain one. Today, traffickers exploit weaknesses in our laws by targeting individuals who can lawfully purchase guns, which are then used to commit crimes once they are transferred to the criminal, who would be unable to pass the background check. Right now, a straw purchaser can only be prosecuted for lying on a Federal form, and that is treated as a paperwork violation. Our bill would create new criminal offenses for straw purchasing, which would help our law enforcement officials take down these criminal enterprises.  The illegal guns that we are targeting in our bill are frequently sold, resold, and trafficked across State lines, resulting in the proliferation of the illegal firearms in our communities. This practice has fueled the violence across our southern border associated with the Mexican drug cartels, as well as gang violence in our cities and, tragically, the heroin crisis that is ravaging so many families and communities and undermining public health and safety in States like  Police officers tell me they have seen a major influx of drug dealers coming from out of State, straight up I-95's iron pipeline and other interstate highways, with direct ties to gangs in major cities. They are ready to sell or trade prescription opioids and heroin for illegal guns.  Heroin flooding into our communities is reaching crisis levels. In 2016, there were 376 drug-induced overdose deaths in my State, the State of That is more than car crashes and suicides put together. It is 104 more deaths than the year before. So this crisis with opioids and heroin is getting worse, not better. The vast majority of these overdoses were caused by at least one opioid, whether pharmaceutical or illicit.  Often, drug dealers and gang members follow a similar pattern: They target addicts who have no criminal records, and then they trade or sell them drugs in exchange for guns. These gang members with criminal records cross into Maine and link up with drug addicts to be their straw buyers. These addicts are people with clean records who may legally purchase firearms. The addict then exchanges the gun for heroin to support his or her drug dependency, and the cycle is repeated time and again.  Last year I had a deeply disturbing briefing from Federal law enforcement officials about a case in Maine that fit this exact pattern. Gang members trafficked crack cocaine and heroin between New Haven, CT, and Bangor, They committed acts of violence, including assaults, armed robberies, attempted murder, and murder. They traded narcotics for firearms and then distributed them to other gang members back in This is exactly the type of criminal activity our bill aims to prevent, and it complements existing laws that target criminals who are profiting from firearms and drug trafficking.  Current Federal law makes preventing and prosecuting straw purchasing offenses very difficult for law enforcement officials, since a straw purchaser can be prosecuted only for lying on a Federal form, a relatively minor offense.  The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act would create new, specific criminal offenses for straw purchasing and trafficking in firearms. Instead of a slap on the wrist, these crimes would be punishable by up to 15 years in prison. For those straw purchasers who knew or have reasonable cause to believe that the firearm would be used to[[Page S3045]]commit a crime of violence, that crime would be punishable by up to 25 years in prison.  Our bill would also strengthen existing laws that prohibit gun smuggling. Right now, it is illegal for someone to smuggle a firearm into the United States with the intent to engage in drug trafficking or violent crime. To combat the drug cartels operating on our southern border, however, we must also prohibit firearms and ammunition from being trafficked out of the United States for those illegal purposes. In so doing, our bill would provide an important tool to combat trafficking organizations that are exporting firearms and ammunition from the United States and into Mexico where they are used by the drug cartels that are in turn fueling the heroin crisis here at home.  In a recent investigation along our southern border, ATF agents seized nearly 40,000 rounds of illegal ammunition from suspects who were attempting to smuggle both firearms and ammunition across the border and into Similarly, a large percentage of the guns used in crimes in our largest cities were trafficked across State lines.  I want to emphasize that our bill fully protects the Second Amendment rights of our law-abiding citizens. It protects legitimate private gun sales and is drafted to avoid sweeping in innocent transactions and placing unnecessary burdens on lawful private sales. It expressly exempts certain transactions that are permitted under current laws, such as gifts, raffles, and auctions. Furthermore, the bill expressly prohibits any authority provided by this act from being used to establish a Federal firearms registry--something I am strongly opposed to.  I started my remarks by reminding us all that this is National Police Let's honor our police officers and other law enforcement by giving them this much needed tool to crack down on illegal firearm traffickers who are exploiting our addicts in so many ways in order to obtain guns that they are not legally able to purchase. I urge my colleagues to support this much needed legislation.

As Vice Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, these concerns would be amplified if these provisions were applied to other contexts or across the federal government in future legislation.  A partial list of problematic provisions includes:  The bill requires a lower standard of evidence that would allow removal, demotion, and other disciplinary actions even if the majority of evidence is exculpatory.  The bill supersedes existing collective bargaining agreements.  The bill provides for the clawback and forfeiture of bonuses and pensions under a standard that is broad and susceptible to abuse.  The bill denies senior executives of the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which they have under current law.  The bill imposes unreasonable timelines on the ability of employees to respond to allegations that may lead to discipline and eliminates the ability of the Merit System Protection Board to mitigate penalties that may have been overly harsh and raise due process concerns.

This provision could also force employees to use their accrued sick or annual leave while on appeal, which Courts have considered a taking in violation of the  While 1094 is a bipartisan compromise aimed at dealing with a specific and troubled department, a number of its provisions are problematic and would not serve as an example for future civil service-related legislation.

5184,topic-id,1528,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would increase funding for the Government Accountability Office, offset by a minor decrease in the funding for the MRA accounts here in the House of  I am offering the amendment for three reasons:  First, the bill significantly underfunds the  Second, the administration is actively thwarting congressional oversight, which we need more of, not less of.  Finally, Congress, which struck an aggressive posture in oversight during the previous administration, seems to have lost its way a bit in its constitutional duty to oversee the activities of this executive branch.  The GAO is a vital resource not only for congressional overseers, but also anyone interested in studying or improving the effectiveness of Federal agencies. The GAO is often referred to as the congressional watchdog. I am sure every Member of Congress has supported or requested a GAO report with the purpose of examining broad and discrete issues of executive branch oversight at some point in their career. It is a vital institution that saves taxpayer dollars.  Every dollar we invest in the GAO, Mr.Chairman, generates a $112 return for the Federal Government and for the taxpayer. This oversight dividend amounted to $63 billion in financial benefits for the Federal Government in fiscal year 2016 alone.  Unfortunately, the bill before us provides $46.2 million less than the budget request for fiscal year 2018. This amendment would simply restore a modest $1 million of it.  I know the lack of sufficient funding for the GAO has been a topic of discussion and debate between the majority and minority on the Appropriations I would note that the ranking member raised the issue in the ``Additional Views'' section of the committee report.  In the report, Ranking Member Lowey and Representative Tim Ryan, who is with us on the floor, stated it is irresponsible to underfund the GAO, especially when administration officials have reportedly been ordered not to comply with Democratic oversight requests.  Which brings me to my second reason for offering the amendment: the indifferent and at times outright adversarial approach the Trump administration has decided to take to normal routine congressional oversight work. The administration has ignored the seven-member rule, for example, an authority enacted into law in 1928, which delegates authority to any seven members of my committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, to require any executive branch agency to submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of our committee.  The Trump administration released an opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel, arguing that agencies and departments could ignore requests for documents and other information from Members of the minority party.  On June 7, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who certainly knew the benefit of getting information requests in the minority answered, wrote a scathing letter to President Trump urging him to reject the opinion. The opinion stated that only requests from committees or their chairs are constitutionally authorized. Senator Grassley, Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, called the opinion nonsense.  In his letter to the President, he stated: ``For OLC to fundamentally misunderstand and misstate such a simple fact exposes its shocking lack of professionalism and objectivity.''  He also wrote: ``Oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability. And the opposite is true. Shutting down oversight requests doesn't drain the swamp.''  Those are the words of Chuck  As the vice ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I have witnessed firsthand the committee's volte-face on issues of oversight.  Whereas, during the Obama administration, one would have thought that, like the British Empire, the Sun never set on the jurisdiction of our committee. Now, suddenly, the majority advances a tortured and narrow interpretation of the committee's role as the primary oversight body for the House of  If the administration is going to ignore the minority in Congress and the majority is suddenly allergic to congressional oversight, the demands on the GAO are going to grow.

Mr.Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment which would increase funding for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and offset that increase with a reduction in funding for the salaries and expenses of the House of  I am offering this amendment for three reasons.  First, this bill significantly underfunds  Second, this administration is actively thwarting congressional oversight.  And finally, Congress, which struck an aggressive posture on oversight during the Obama Administration, seems to have forgotten its Constitutional duty to oversee the activities of the Executive  GAO is a vital resource for not only Congressional overseers, but also anyone interested in studying or improving the effectiveness of federal agencies and the way in which they carry out their vital missions.  GAO is often referred to as the ``congressional watchdog.''  I am sure nearly every Member of Congress has supported or requested a GAO report with the purpose of examining broad and discrete issues of Executive Branch oversight.  It is a vital institution that helps ensure taxpayer dollars are invested wisely.  Every dollar we invest in GAO generates a $112 return for the federal government. This oversight dividend amounted to $63 billion in financial benefits for the federal government in fiscal year 2016.  Unfortunately, the bill before us provides $46.2 million less than the budget request for FY 2018, which would result in the loss of 200 GAO staff by the end of the coming fiscal year.[[Page H6409]]  I know the lack of sufficient funding for GAO has been a topic of discussion and debate between the Majority and the Minority on the Appropriations  I would note that the Ranking Member raised this issue in the ``Additional Views'' section of the Committee report for the Legislative Branch Appropriations  In the report, Ranking Member Lowey and Representative Tim Ryan stated, ``It is irresponsible to underfund the GAO, especially when Administration officials have reportedly been ordered not to comply with Democratic oversight requests.''  Which brings me to my second reason for offering this amendment--the indifferent and, at times, hostile approach the Trump Administration has decided to take to Congressional oversight work.  The administration has ignored the Seven Member Rule, an authority that was enacted into law in 1928 which delegates authority to any seven members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to require any Executive Branch agency to ``submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee.''  The Trump Administration released an opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel on May 1, 2017, arguing that agencies and departments could ignore requests for documents and other information from Members of Congress other than Republican Committee  On June 7, 2017, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley wrote a scathing letter to President Trump urging him to reject the opinion issued by Office of Legal  The opinion stated that only requests from committees or their chairs are ``constitutionally authorized.''  Senator Grassley called the opinion ``nonsense.''  In his letter to the president he stated, ``For OLC to so fundamentally misunderstand and misstate such a simple fact exposes its shocking lack of professionalism and objectivity. Indeed, OLC appears to have utterly failed to live up to its own standards. You are being ill-served and ill-advised.''  He also wrote, ``Oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability. And, the opposite is true. Shutting down oversight requests doesn't drain the swamp, Mr.It floods the swamp.''  And Congress is not blameless here.  As the Vice Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I have witnessed firsthand that Committee's volte-face on issues of oversight.  Whereas, during the Obama Administration one would have thought that like the British Empire the sun never set on the jurisdiction of the Oversight Committee, now the Majority advances a tortured and narrow interpretation of the Committee's role as the primary oversight body for the House of  If the Administration is going to ignore the Minority in Congress, and the Majority is suddenly allergic to Congressional oversight, the demands on GAO are only going to grow.  And with that greater responsibility should come greater resources.  First and foremost, the House should join Senator Grassley and demand that this administration not impede Congressional oversight activities.  In the absence of the administration acceding to this demand, we must send a clear message about the importance of Executive Branch accountability by better funding  This amendment will not solve the GAO funding difficulties created by this bill, but it would send a message to our colleagues in the Senate about the premium we place on the principle of robust oversight of the Executive  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

5085,topic-id,514,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.695, the Child Protection Improvements Act, and tip my hat to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr.Schiff), the author of the bill, who we will hear from shortly.  We have a special responsibility to protect our young people and vulnerable adults. For that reason, I am pleased that we are considering this measure which would provide a robust, easily accessible, cost-effective background check system for organizations that work with youth and vulnerable adults. I support it for a number of reasons.  To begin with, it will facilitate more comprehensive criminal background checks which provide a critical layer of protection. These checks help identify individuals who could potentially harm participants in programs for children, young people, and vulnerable adults as well.  Background checks also serve to ensure the integrity and accountability of the organizations that sponsor these programs by reducing potential threats. Results from background checks that search criminal histories nationwide are more reliable than background checks that only search criminal histories in a few I think that is obvious.  Secondly, the State background checks are no substitute whatsoever for the FBI's fingerprint-based system, which is the only nationwide database that allows a search of criminal histories in every single  Currently, this database can only be accessed through the State law enforcement agencies, and many States limit the ability of organizations to access the system, with some States completely even forbidding access--no access whatsoever. As a result, organizations must navigate a labyrinth of State laws or rely on private companies to perform background checks of employees and volunteers.  H.695, on the other hand, would provide organizations with the ability to access the FBI's superior system without impacting the autonomy of States or the organizations. States would be able to continue or establish their own background check systems, and organizations would not be required to perform FBI background checks of potential applicants or volunteers.  Finally, the need for this legislation is clearly justified by the Child Safety Pilot Program, which we implemented over a decade ago. This program documented the effectiveness of nationwide background checks for youth-serving organizations. Based on a comprehensive review of thousands of criminal history records spanning an 8-year period, the program demonstrated that people who might pose a risk to the safety of children, nevertheless, attempted to work with children.  For example, the program identified applicants who, to avoid detection, used aliases, incorrect dates of birth, or wrong Social Security numbers. Some of these applicants had serious criminal histories, including even homicides, sexual assaults, child endangerment, and even rape.  More than a third of criminal history hits were from out-of-state, and more than half of the people with criminal history hits failed to disclose them on their application.  H.695 would give organizations access to the FBI's comprehensive background check system and thereby help ensure the safety of our youth and others.  Accordingly, I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this important measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We still have a lot more work to do.  I regret that the rule that we will take up tomorrow will likely include $1.6 billion for a wall.

The wall is a 14th century solution to a 21st century challenge that we have.  The border wall is not the right solution for border security. Why?  Number one, private property rights. We believe in private property rights. In fact, there are some people that, for generations, have owned land along the border. I have several veterans that own land. In fact, there is one veteran in particular that buried his father--his father who served in World War II--and his family right along the riverbank. So if you put a wall, what is he going to do?

How are they going to have access to water along the river?  Number two, we have natural barriers along the Texas border. We have the rivers. You can see how the river snakes around. And what about the cliffs? Are you going to put a wall on top of this cliff? It just doesn't make sense.  Number three, what about taxpayers' dollars? Mexico is not going to pay for this wall. We know that the American taxpayer is going to pay for this, $1.6 billion for 74 miles out of the 1,954 miles that we have. That is $21.2 million per mile for this wall, compared to $1 million of technology we wanted to put, technology cameras, sensors, aerostats for border security.  And, oh, by the way, so $1.6 billion; all I need is $100, buy myself a good ladder, and we will take care of that wall. So, again, we have got to be smart about border security.  Number four, environmental concerns, we have concerns with regard to wildlife refuges.  What about the 40 percent out of the 11 million people that we have here who did visa overstays?  So you can put the biggest wall, but people are going to fly, are going to drive across the bridge, are going to get a boat into Houston and just stay over their time.

Every day we have $1.3 billion of trade with our friends to the south--every day, 1.3. That is over $1 million of trade every single minute, 6 million American jobs that we have because of the trade that we have with our friends to the south.  We need strong, commonsense border security, and I know this because I live on the border. I drink the water. I breathe the air. I understand this very well.  The border area is very safe. Use FBI stats. The murder rate in my hometown of Laredo is three murders per 100,000. Here in Washington, D.C., it is 24.5 murders per 100,000.

Division C is exactly the same as the MILCON-VA bill reported favorably out of the full committee on June 15.  Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen from New Jersey, Ranking Member Nita Lowey from New York, and the partnership of Ranking Member Debbie Wasserman Schultz from Florida, this will provide necessary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and military construction projects. We were able to include the vast majority of the subcommittee's over 1,000 Member requests.  This division demonstrates our firm commitment to fully supporting our Nation's veterans and servicemembers. The total investment is $89 billion for Military Construction, VA, and Related Agencies, which is $6 billion above last year's level.  This division provides comprehensive support for servicemembers, military families, and veterans. We must make infrastructure investments if we value readiness. This bill increases military construction by 25 percent over last year's level, delivering on our promise to the troops in line with the President's focus on national defense.  It supports our troops with the facilities and services necessary to maintain readiness and morale at bases here in the States and overseas. It provides for Defense Department schools and health clinics that take care of our military families.  This division funds our veteran healthcare systems to ensure that our promise to care for those who have sacrificed in defense of this great Nation continues as those men and women return home. We owe this to our veterans, and we are committed to sustained oversight so that programs deliver what they promise and taxpayers are well-served by the investments we make.  The staff deserves credit for the sustained work and very long hours. I would like to recognize Sue Quantius, Sarah Young, Tracey Russell, Maureen Holohan, and Matt Washington on the committee staff, and Sean Snyder on my personal staff.  On the military construction piece, this division provides a total of $10.2 billion for military construction projects and family housing, including base and overseas contingency operations funding, an increase over last year's level and $197 million below the President's request.  This funding meets DOD's most critical needs, including priority projects for the combatant commanders and funding new mission requirements.  It provide $737 million for military medical facilities. It provides $249 million for Department of Defense education facilities for construction of renovation of four schools. It supports our Guard and Reserves through $575 million for facilities in 22  It also funds military family housing at $1.4 billion. It provides $178 million for the NATO Security Investment Program, which is $24 million over the President's request, to deal with increasing threats and necessary investments overseas. Given all that is happening by Russia's very bad behavior in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, this investment is absolutely essential.  We were able to also include an additional $439 million in the services' unfunded priorities, which are priority projects that were not included in the budget request. It is very important to many Members of this body.  On Veterans Affairs, the legislation includes a total of $78.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans That is a $3.9 billion increase, or 5 percent, above fiscal year 2017 level. It is the highest level of VA funding ever provided.  On VA medical care, the bill funds it at $69 billion, the full request, including an additional $2.6 billion beyond the advanced appropriations to cover unanticipated needs. Many Members expressed concerns about medical care issues, and were able to fully fund the budget request for mental health services at $8.4 billion; suicide prevention outreach at $186 million; homeless veterans treatment, services, housing, and job training at $7.3 billion; opioid abuse prevention at $50 million--we began that in the omnibus last year--rural health initiatives at $250 million; and caregiver stipends at $604 million.[[Page H6364]]                                {time}  1600  We repeat last year's bill language regarding improved standards for the suicide prevention hotline.

One of the elements of the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act that is particularly troublesome to me--and there are many--has to do with the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act repealing section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection  Now, people watching this debate, Mr.Chair, might find that to be just legislative talk, but it is substantively, really important. Section 953(b) was a hard-fought victory for investors, consumers, workers, and the general public. Mr.Chair, the law requires that publicly traded firms disclose the ratio between what they pay their CEO and what they pay their median worker.  I think this is important information. A CEO of an S&P 500 company makes, on average, about $331 for every $1 a typical rank-and-file worker makes. In some companies, this ratio can reach as high as $1,000-to-$1. Investors should be able to consider if a CEO provides hundreds of times more value to their employees before investing in a firm. Actually, exorbitant CEO pay, excessive CEO pay, can impact dividends. It can impact all kinds of decisions, lead to risk taking, and it is a good idea for investors and the general public to know that information.  So while executives are making critical decisions about the direction of their companies, quality employees ensure those decisions are being properly implemented.  This pay ratio information benefits investors by giving them valuable information for ascertaining whether or not a company's employees are being treated fairly and, therefore, able to retain employees; whether or not it is a stable company, and a company that values its people.  The ratio helps them to decide how to cast their say-on-pay advisory votes on executive compensation. And research shows that the higher the CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio, the more likely the CEO is to pursue the kind of risky investments that brought the global financial crisis to bear.  Institute for Policy Studies found that nearly 40 percent of the CEOs on their top 25 highest paid list over a 20-year period wound up being fired, sought a bailout, or were forced to pay fraud-related fines.  Moreover, a lower ratio of CEO-to-median-worker pay, implies more investment in human capital, and a longer-term outlook on the corporation.  According to the Center for Audit Quality's annual investor survey, 46 percent of investors say they consider CEO compensation in their decisionmaking.  The current culture of paying CEOs hundreds of times--and even thousands in some limited cases--more than typical employees hurts working families, is detrimental to employee morale, and goes against the research which shows us what is best practice.

Mr.Chair, does it make sense that, after 8 years of a piece of regulation, Dodd-Frank, that has brought us increases in GDP, increases in jobs, and stability in financial markets, that we would now repeal that piece of legislation to go back to a time when we saw that deregulation strategy bring us the Great Recession?  It just doesn't make any sense to take the position that what we need is more wide open, Wild West, you are on your own kind of financial rules and laws in our country.  The fact is, before Dodd-Frank was passed, we had an abysmal consumer protection system. We really had seven or eight different agencies that were sort of responsible, but not really. Consumer protection was not a priority of the Federal And as a result of it, we saw a proliferation of mortgages that got people who really couldn't handle that particular mortgage that they got, or the products were just fraudulent, get into a situation where they ended up going into foreclosure.  We saw the secondary market package up some of these bad mortgages. We saw rating agencies say that these were good equity products, and when these products started to fail, what we saw is that those big banks that trafficked in those equities get bailed out, and we saw citizens lose their homes.  The fact is, going back to those bad old days is just a bad idea--to bring us back to a time when we didn't have any consumer protection, when we didn't have any responsibility placed on the shoulders of management, when we didn't say that we were going to look after these rating agencies, and we didn't say that these systemically important large institutions were going to get a little bit more scrutiny.  Before the time that we did that, we saw ruin in the economy. Let me just remind the American people: we had many States with unemployment above 10 percent because of the deregulation, laissez-faire attitude that prevailed in the American financial services legal system.  Those bad old days nearly ruined so many families, and they are just now starting to recover. But under Dodd-Frank, we have seen month after month of private sector job growth. We have seen economic activity increase. Fast enough for me? I think we need much more.  But with over $170 billion in record profits from 2016, I can tell you one thing: this claim on the other side that the banks and financial services sector is being crushed simply isn't a true statement. It is just not right.

4760,topic-id,441,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment, which was filed late, should be viewed as the first admission by the Republicans that H.10 would be bad for our financial markets and our economy.  The amendment recognizes that it would be inappropriate for Members of Congress to attend nonpublic meetings of the council charged with reviewing sensitive financial information and discussing potential threats to our economy.  I agree with the sponsor that this was one of many harmful provisions in the ``Wrong'' CHOICE  Here are a few more: the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act eliminates the Office of Financial Research, which is tasked with studying emerging risks to our economy and informing the Financial Stability Oversight The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act stops the council from taking actions to prevent firms like AIG from threatening our economy. The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act allows banks to choose the regulatory system that best suits their bottom line, even if doing so is bad for the economy and taxpayers.  Mr.Chairman, the amendment also recognizes the dangers of subjecting our independent financial regulators to the partisan appropriations process, by restoring the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's and the National Credit Union Administration's independent funding when it comes to their responsibilities for unwinding failed banks and credit unions.  I agree, this is important, but do you know what is also important and needing to be independent?  The authority to supervise those entities before they fail.  The bank and credit union regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have important yet sensitive responsibilities to make sure that financial institutions follow rules that are good for the economy, good for consumers, but which some institutions would rather ignore.  Subjecting these decisions to the appropriations process will result in fewer cops on the beat, weaker guardrails, and a greater likelihood of financial catastrophe.  We have seen this happen before. One of the reasons for the failure of the housing giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was that they had a woefully underfunded regulator without independent funding.  Democrats fixed this when we created the independently funded Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2008. Since then, this agency has successfully made tough decisions to right both GSEs by putting them into conservatorship and cleaning up their businesses.  Ignoring this success and history, H.10 would once again strip away the independent funding of the GSE's regulator, as it would for all of the financial regulators.  I am pleased that this amendment has recognized the problems taking away independent funding for our regulators, but, unfortunately, it doesn't go far enough.

4763,topic-id,304,"Mr.Chairman, the late poet Maya Angelou had a saying: ``When people show you who they really are, believe them.''  So when the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association leads a pep rally before 1,500 bankers, we should pay attention. He probably means what he is saying.  In March, he told ABA members about all the opportunities for banking with a Republican Congress, he crowed: ``I don't want a seat at the table. I want the table.''  If we read this bill, we know what it looks like to give the financial services sector the whole table. We know they want the whole table.  H.10 is clever at undermining financial regulators, emboldening Wall Street, and making it incredibly easy to delay regulators at every step of the rulemaking process.  It is important for the people of America to understand that when Republicans say they want to kill regulations, usually what they are talking about is safety regulations, regulations that make the water clean, the meat safe, and that financial product that you just bought not blow up in your face. They don't like regulations because regulations mean that the people who control some of these products can't just do whatever they want to do.  But for the people in the United States, you should know that financial regulators are going to keep money in your pocket, they are going to stop people with way more resources than you have from picking your pocket.

4771,topic-id,537,"Mr.Chair, the Hollingsworth amendment seeks to insert a totally new and unvetted set of exemptions from the security laws for closed-end funds. These are the type of pooled investment vehicles that typically issue a fixed number of shares that, unlike mutual funds, are not redeemable on a daily basis by the fund, making them harder for investors to sell.  The Financial Services Committee has had no hearings, no markups, no debate on these issues until now. Perhaps that is why the amendment has been mislabeled as only benefiting closed-end funds traded on an exchange with well-known seasoned issuer status.  In fact, the amendment is much broader, as it would allow even illiquid, nontraded funds to claim multiple exemptions. This effort would make it harder for the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to police these products for investors.  This last-minute, partisan approach is not the way that Congress should proceed in making laws, but it is consistent with this bill. Although Democrats conducted 41 hearings to develop Dodd-Frank, Republicans planned only 1 hearing on this bill. It is not surprising, then, that the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act is a 600-page bill chock-full of bad partisan ideas and special interest wish lists that will harm our Nation's investors, consumers, and taxpayers.  For example, the bill would severely undermine the ability of the SEC, our Wall Street cop on the beat, to protect investors and hold bad actors accountable. Specifically, it would remove valuable law enforcement tools, burden the SEC with onerous cost-benefit analysis, and generate more and more endless litigation, tying the agency up.  Worse, the bill repeals the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule and effectively prevents the DOL or the SEC from ever moving forward to protect our Nation's investors and seniors from conflicted advice by unscrupulous financial advisers.  I will say, most financial advisers are not unscrupulous, but for the ones that are, there needs to be authority in the law to stop them. We need the fiduciary rule. The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act takes it away.  But this should come as no surprise, since the Republicans in Congress have been relentless in their opposition to the DOL's commonsense requirement that financial advisers put their clients' interests ahead of their own when providing investment advice about retirement products.  Their extreme partisan efforts to kill the fiduciary rule ignore the facts that 9 in 10 Americans reportedly agree with the rule. An overwhelming majority--65 percent--of Americans who voted for President Trump appear to support the regulation.  Tellingly, just last week, after robust bipartisan debate, the Republican Governor of Nevada signed into law a bill requiring financial advisers to act in their clients' best interests.  The ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act continues this partisan slant by also rolling back bipartisan efforts from this and past Congresses to craft legislation that helps grow small business and protect investors.  Mr.Chair, we owe it to our constituents and the American people to work together to address real problems with real solutions that are thoroughly vetted. For that reason, I must oppose this bill and this amendment.  I will add, my colleague on other side of the aisle, Mr.Chairman, said: Where is our bill?

4781,topic-id,504,"Mr.Chairman, I believe that there might be some merit to this amendment, but I still claim time in opposition.  Because it wasn't brought up in committee, I think that there is a lot of hashing out of this particular amendment that could have happened and we might have been able to agree, but at this point in the process I have to claim time in opposition and I will explain why. I will say that, if we can work on it later, we will see what happens, but as now for now, we are urging a strong ``no.''  I think the amendment is well-intentioned because it purports to address the growing problem of identity theft, something we all need to be concerned about. However, I am concerned that it may make it harder for some consumers who want to obtain their own reports, particularly those using the website annualcreditreport.com, to access their free annual consumer reports from nationwide credit reporting agencies, or  Also, the amendment purports to combat identity theft, but solely focuses on tougher authentication requirements for consumers who want to access their own files, not on all users who have access to consumer reports like landlords or employers. I think that is a weakness.  The website annualcreditreport.com and reports maintained by the big three require consumers to provide personally identifiable information and to successfully answer several questions about information on the consumer files before giving them access to reports online.  In a 2017 report, the Consumer Bureau noted that credit reporting complaints are consistently among the top three types of consumer complaints it handles. When consumers are denied online access, they have to mail copies of sensitive identifying documents in order to obtain their reports, which consumers note is time consuming as well as potentially not secure. This amendment could make that situation even worse.  I also find it a little confusing that the House is considering this amendment to a bill that will hamstring the only Federal agency, the Consumer Bureau, that has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority over most consumer reporting agencies and has actually addressed many credit reporting problems.  If Members support this amendment, then it simply does not make sense to me for the same Members to support H.10, which will gut the Consumer Bureau's capacity to effectively address problems like identity theft.  Before Dodd-Frank, the Federal Trade Commission was the only Federal agency with enforcement authority over the CRAs, but there was no entity with supervising authority. Dodd-Frank closed that gap by giving the Consumer Bureau the supervisory power to monitor CRAs' operations.  Just this year, through the good work of the Consumer Bureau's examiners, the Consumer Bureau issued enforcement orders against all of the big three CRAs for misleading practices that harm consumers.

4784,topic-id,300,"Mr.Chairman, I would like to talk about an issue somewhat related that is critical in this debate and would go a long way toward improving our economy and the chances of consumers.  I have a bill, H.435, the Credit Access and Inclusion My amendment would help solve problems the Financial Services Committee has been discussing for more than a decade. This is not an amendment that I have submitted for disposition today, but I would like to bring to the attention of the body that this Credit Access and Inclusion Act was good legislation and should be taken up. It would address a problem of access to credit that the leader of this bill says he wants to solve.

4791,topic-id,424,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment is another example of Republicans choosing to prioritize the interests of corporate insiders over consumers, which is what the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act really symbolizes. We should not prevent regulators from addressing potential conflicts of interest but, instead, let all shareholders have their voice be heard.  While Democrats stand ready to work on targeted reforms to help responsible community banks and credit unions, we will reject any ideological legislation that puts our financial system and economy at risk of another crash and that gives a leg up to Wall Street and predatory lenders to rip off consumers all over again.  Republicans like to pretend that Wall Street reform destroyed our financial system and economy, but the alternative facts have no basis in reality. Thanks to Wall Street reform and other Democratic policies, our economy has made significant gains since the depths of the financial crisis.  Since Dodd-Frank became law, we have set a record, with 86 consecutive months of private sector job growth, during which the economy created more than 16 million private sector jobs. Let me assure you, much more work needs to be done, but this record is important and must be noted.  Financial institutions are thriving since the passage of Dodd-According to the FDIC, banks are posting record profits since the crisis. Profits for community banks increased more than 10 percent in the past year. In 2010, the banking industry set an all-time record with $171 billion in profits. Business lending has increased 75 percent since Dodd-Frank became law. Credit union membership has expanded by more than 16 million members since 2010, an increase of 18 percent.  This has happened in part because we have a system that is fairer, because bad actors are held accountable. The highly successful Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established and has returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million consumers who were ripped off by unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices of bad actors. This tough consumer enforcement approach has put the entire financial industry on notice to follow the law and treat their consumers fairly or suffer the consequences.  So the economy is doing well, financial institutions are doing well, and consumers are finally being protected. The last thing we should do is go back to a failed, weak regulatory model that gave us bank bailouts and the Great But that is what the Republicans are offering the American people with this bill.

4803,topic-id,596,"Mr.Chair, let me recognize that the problem that Representative McSally is trying to address here is a legitimate problem that we think needs to be focused on.  I must oppose it because it is inadequate and simply not enough. It would be good if we could get together and try to come up with a bipartisan solution to this problem that she has, I think, identified as a legitimate issue.  But ensuring that legitimate financial transactions move freely and globally, particularly key remittance channels for vulnerable populations, is a subject of great importance and one on which I and my Democratic colleagues remain focused.  Many of us represent districts with significant immigrant populations from Central and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, all across the globe. We have heard just how critical it is for immigrants here in the United States to be able to send money that sustain their loved ones back home.  While I am pleased that there is a bipartisan recognition about the need to preserve critical remittance channels for legitimate transactions, I must say that I am deeply concerned by some of the rhetoric and proposals that we have seen from the Trump administration, which make me fear that access to remittances, particularly for vulnerable populations, may be in jeopardy.  Not only has the President been overtly anti-immigrant in his rhetoric during the 2016 campaign and since, he put out an alarming proposal about how he would force Mexico to pay for a wall on our Southern border. He proposed cutting off access to remittance transfers for anyone who couldn't document their immigration status until Mexico agreed to pay an extortion payment of between $5 billion and $10 billion.  I also note that while it is essential that legitimate financial transactions move freely and globally, it is equally important that illegitimate and illicit transactions do not.  For this reason, I am concerned that the amendment before us falls short in that it fails to call the administration to disclose how it plans to curtail the flow of illicit funds, particularly funds which may be coming from key adversaries like the Russian  One doesn't have to look far to see that, despite record fines and numerous enforcement actions, global megabanks have continued to facilitate shady transactions even when such transactions are highly suspicious, have no economic rationale, and even likely involve money laundering and tax evasion.  One example of concern, Deutsche Bank, which operates in the U.and around the globe, was found by the Federal Reserve, New York State, and the United Kingdom to have facilitated a massive fraudulent trading scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia to unknown locales.                              {time}  1545  In order to better understand the scheme, I recently joined with a number of my colleagues in writing to the Treasury Secretary to ask for any and all records of suspicious activity related to Deutsche Bank's 2011 scheme in the Department's possession, including the names and identities of all parties who participated in, or benefited from, the scheme.  But, like much of the oversight Democrats are conducting on this administration, this request has apparently fallen on deaf ears.  So, again, I do appreciate the intent of the amendment--I even commend Representative McSally for identifying this is an important issue--it should have gone further in demanding that this administration disclose how it will curtail well-known schemes being used to facilitate fraud. So I must urge a ``no'' vote, but I look forward to working with Representative McSally on this important issue.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

4807,topic-id,647,"Mr.Chairman, as if the CHOICE Act was not bad enough, this amendment piles on to the Republicans' misguided attacks on the highly successful Consumer Financial Protection  I don't understand why my Republican friends don't get--29 million people got $11.5 billion of their money back because unscrupulous financial services firms unlawfully took their money. I would think we could get together on that. I would think we could agree that that is an important thing to work on. And now we are trying to mess with their building, for the sake of the children, no less.  The Bureau's inspector general conducted a thorough investigation of the Republican's made-up suggestion that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's building renovations were inappropriate.  The inspector general released an audit back in 2015, that stated:       We determined that construction costs appear reasonable      based on comparisons to an independent cost estimate and the      costs of two comparable building renovations identified by      the U.General Services We also determined      that potential renovation costs are below the amount      previously budgeted and obligated for the renovation. . . .      Current controls for approving, managing, and documenting      renovation costs and project decisions are designed      appropriately. . . .  May we put this issue to bed that there is some nefarious plot going on with the building? It wasn't legitimate when they first raised it. It is not legitimate now. And trying to bring a big deal up about their building, which is an issue that has been resolved, is not going to benefit the children of tomorrow. I think it will benefit the children for those 29 million families to get $12 billion back. Now, that might help some kids. That might pay for some lunches, some school fees, and a whole bunch of other things to help families. But just messing with the CFPB over their building will not help anyone.  Even if the House Republicans are not willing to thank the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for all it has done, I am.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been a tough independent watchdog, has done a great job on behalf of American consumers, and has done a great job for American financial firms which do honest work. Imagine, Mr.Chairman, being a financial services firm that is actually selling a good product at a fair price and you have somebody down the street cutting corners, ripping off consumers, and you are losing your competitive advantage because you are honest. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau helps keep good financial firms good and not create this pervasive sentence to drag them in the wrong direction.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau maintains a transparent database that has collected over 1.1 million consumer complaints about financial institutions, and 97 percent of those have received a timely response.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has demystified financial transactions by requiring simple know-before-you-owe disclosures, and providing educational and comparison shopping tools so that consumers are empowered to make the right choice for them and their families.  Perhaps one of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's most notable accomplishments to date was its investigation of Wells Fargo's fraudulent account scandal. Let me tell you, Wells Fargo's fraudulent account scandal definitely hurt families and kids in those families, and the CFPB's good work helped those families.  Last September, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Wells Fargo $100 million for secretly opening up 2 million unauthorized accounts on behalf of its consumers and ordered the bank to compensate customers it harmed. This marks the largest penalty the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has imposed to date. And that, Mr.Chairman, has helped families and children.

Nearly 7 years ago, the American people were promised that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act would end Washington bailouts, protect consumers, and lead to a more prosperous economy.  Instead, the big banks and the influence of the Federal Government have continued to get bigger while smaller, local community banks and credit unions are closing up shop and our country continues to struggle with anemic levels of economic growth.  This is why the Financial CHOICE Act is so important. This legislation gives us an opportunity to return the power to the ``little guy or gal'' who wants to create a better life for themselves and, by doing so, for all of us.  It takes steps to end the failure of excessive and redundant bureaucracy, and it will give our entrepreneurs the opportunity to access the startup capital they need to grow and thrive once again.  I am especially pleased that this bill includes provisions from my Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform These three bills are important components of the Financial Services Committee's broader intent of improving opportunity and accountability for all.

5325,topic-id,1767,"Mr.President, my colleagues and I have been on this floor for the last 7 years talking about the problems with ObamaCare and the need to address them.  In the early days, when ObamaCare was still being cobbled together, we talked about individuals losing their coverage. Promises were made that if you liked the plan you had, you could keep it. That turned out to be a broken promise.  In 2009 and 2010, we talked about premiums skyrocketing. Today, we are still talking about it. Premiums are more than 100 percent higher in Wyoming today than they were when the law was passed. Our insurer has fortunately been more conservative in their approach. So premiums didn't spike the way they did in other  I usually enjoy being right, but in this case, I am very sad to have watched the worst possible scenario play out. Time after time, President Obama was faced with problems in implementation and in outcomes, and he would dismiss them by saying: ``It just needs more time,'' or, as this cartoon shows, ``it just needs a tune up.''  We and the American people gave it time and money--specifically, 7 years and hundreds of billions of dollars. We are now left trying to pick up the pieces of health insurance markets all across the country.  You can see here that this ambulance is Behind it is its engine and other key components, and they have completely fallen apart. That is the private insurance market today. The part you don't see here is that there is a patient in the back of this ambulance. This isn't just about politics. This is about real people and whether they can afford an insurance premium that is in some cases higher than their rent or their mortgage payments each month.  Even before its passage, my Republican colleagues and I talked about the danger that ObamaCare posed to private insurance markets.  Insurers have already left the market in droves. In Wyoming, we are down to one carrier. We lost the others to the economics of ObamaCare, and we will be lucky to keep the one we have. I know many people in our country are going to be in the position of having no insurers offering plans in their county.  How could this happen? It has happened because of politics being put before patients and an unwillingness to take on the hard task of fixing something that you have sold as the perfect solution.  I can tell you that healthcare isn't a simple issue. It is incredibly complex and, really, there is no one right way to tackle it. I was the ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee when ObamaCare passed. We worked hard to find common ground. When it became clear that there was not a reciprocal commitment to that from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we did work hard to try to stop it.  Now we are finally in a position to do so. We have a President in the White House who is committed to repealing and replacing ObamaCare with better care before more irreparable harm is done. Republicans have been working on an approach that attempts to address both the short-term and long-term problems caused by  We have problems to solve right now. We are proposing to stabilize insurance markets in the short term and to get insurance costs on a more manageable trajectory over the longer term. We are striking at the heart of ObamaCare by removing its mandates and taxes while putting Medicaid on a more sustainable footing.  Doing this isn't easy. You may have read a little something about the challenges of moving a healthcare bill forward, but the alternative is to do what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done for 7 years and watch ObamaCare crater. We don't think that is the right thing to do. We think we have an obligation, even if it is not an easy vote, to salvage our insurance system.  Getting something done in Washington isn't always a pretty process, but I am proud to be working with the women and men in my conference who see that there is something larger at stake than themselves and who know that sitting this out means more harm and, perhaps, harm that can't be undone later.  I will keep working. I am committed to passing the best product that we can deliver for the people of Wyoming and for our whole country. I look forward to continuing to work together to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with policies that will truly improve healthcare in I hope my colleagues will join me in this worthy endeavor.

Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.Mr.President, yesterday, several of my Democratic colleagues spoke in opposition to the nomination of John Bush to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of They were particularly concerned about his activities outside of the courtroom, especially his personal blog posts. The comments of my friend, the junior Senator from Minnesota, were representative of their concern.  He reminded us that he has been serving on the Judiciary Committee for 8 years. He said that by confirming someone to the Federal bench like Mr.Bush, who has blogged about controversial political and policy matters, the Senate would be doing something unprecedented. Specifically, my friend from Minnesota--in angst--said, ``I don't think we have been here before.''  ``I don't think we have been here before,'' he said. I would encourage my friend to think a little harder about his tenure on the Judiciary Just a few years ago, the Senate considered President Obama's nomination of Stephen Bough to be a Federal judge in Mr.Bough had been quite an active blogger himself. His blogging and online commentary were not simply confined to political satire and sarcasm. His blogging didn't use merely flippant or intemperate language. His blogging demonstrated a real and palpable animus toward conservatives and Republicans in general, toward elected Republicans in particular, and by name--by name. He insulted and impugned people from his home State, such as Senators, his Governor, the President of the United States, and a Republican nominee for President, just to name a few.  Mr.Bough's posts were truly mean-spirited. It wasn't just that he called Republicans ``knuckleheads''--which he did. That was when he was feeling especially kind. No, he said specific Republicans were ``corrupt.'' They had done ``evil things''--``evil things.'' I can go on and on about his corrosive rhetoric.  He approvingly posted an article describing how San Francisco was contemplating naming a sewage plant after President Bush as a suitable legacy for the President and posted another one that said his Governor was highly ``ignorant.''  His invective was not reserved to members of the political branches. He said that his State supreme court was the most corrupt in the history of the I am not making this up. He is an officer of the court, calling the supreme court the most corrupt in the history of his State.[[Page S4089]]  For my Democratic colleagues who now profess to care about the judgment of judicial nominees who blog, I submit that impugning the integrity of the tribunal that has jurisdiction over their professional conduct and law license, as Mr.Bough did, is more than a few tweaks shy of exhibiting sound judgment.  Mr.Bough also implied that President Bush made his Supreme Court appointments as some sort of quid pro quo. He harshly criticized sitting Supreme Court Justices by name, and he claimed that the Republican nominee for President wanted only Federal judges who would disregard the law and rule in favor of the ``religious right'' and that he was ``sucking up.''  He made a crude comment about women that I will not repeat.  Now, some of our Democratic colleagues have criticized John Bush because he said that he would try hard to be impartial as a judge. By contrast, in one of his blog posts, Stephen Bough flat-out said that he, himself, ``shouldn't be a judge.'' This is commentary on himself. But every one of our Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee at the time, including our friend from Minnesota, obviously disagreed with his own judgment about himself. They all voted for him, which is especially curious in hindsight, given the superior weight our Democratic colleagues now place on blog posts. Only one Member of the Democratic conference voted against Mr.These are many of the same Democrats, of course, who are supposedly aghast--aghast--at the Bush nomination. Mr.Bough is now Federal District Court Judge Stephen  Finally, I would like to set the record straight on the subject of the slur. Mr.Bush did not use the slur in a blog post, and he did not use it flippantly. In fact, he said he has never used this term and would never use it.  Rather, Mr.Bush quoted by name someone else--a prominent author who had used the slur. Mr.Bush quoted him to show how various authors had viewed our hometown of Louisville over time--both those who praised it and those who criticized it. In short, Mr.Bush said that he used it to show ``the good, the bad, and the ugly.''  So who was the author he quoted verbatim and by name? Why, it was noted liberal Hunter I note that Mr.Thompson's use of the slur did not prevent liberals, including Democratic officeholders, from praising him. In fact, not one but two Democratic Presidential candidates went to his funeral--George McGovern and John  The Senate has considered a judicial nominee who did use this slur in a blog posting, who actually did use the exact same slur, in fact. The judicial nominee was not quoting any literary or published work, and this judicial nominee did not use the slur for any critical purpose. The judicial nominee used it flippantly and cavalierly. Who was the judicial nominee? It was President Obama's judicial nominee and current Federal District Court Judge Stephen Bough, who sits on the bench right now for life, after being confirmed by the votes of our Democratic colleagues.  I hope I have at least refreshed the memory of my friend from Minnesota and some of my other Democratic colleagues.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

5079,topic-id,443,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 to reauthorize four important user fee programs: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Medical Device User Fee Act, the Generic Drug User Fee Act, and the Biosimilar User Fee These critically important laws have improved patient access to important therapies and expedited the FDA's approval times while upholding the most rigorous standards for patient safety.  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was enacted in 1992 when drug review times were lagging and FDA simply couldn't keep up with the flood of new drug applications. Through user fees paid by applicants, PDUFA gave FDA the resources it needed to hire and support more staff. The program has been successful in reducing review-time backlogs and expediting safe and effective therapies to patients.  My legislation created the Medical Device User Fee Act (MDUFA), which was enacted in 2002 and has resulted in significant changes to the medical device industry and within the medical device center at the Through this user fee program, the device center has improved its efficiency and reduced the time it takes to bring effective medical devices to market. This legislation builds on the progress made in previous user fee agreements and will produce important developments for the medical device industry.  The Generic Drug User Fee Agreement (GDUFA) was enacted in 2012 and takes important steps to bring lower-priced drugs to the market more quickly for the American people. Finally, the Biosimilar User Fee Agreement (BsUFA), which was first enacted in 2012 through legislation I authored, is critical to supporting the nascent biosimilar industry and will lead to meaningful progress, breakthroughs and cures for the American people.  Previous user fee reauthorizations have included significant gains for pediatric populations. Before the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), which I authored, the vast majority of drugs (more than 80 percent) used in children were used off-label, without data for their safety and efficacy. Today, that number has been reduced to 50 percent because of my legislation. Both programs were permanently reauthorized in 2012, and while this agreement includes important changes to BPCA and PREA, there remains a need for more meaningful improvements. This legislation lays important groundwork and provides the foundation for future progress.  Finally, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up this legislation swiftly. It's imperative that both houses of Congress pass this legislation and send it to the President in a timely manner for him to sign into law in order to provide essential resources to the FDA so they can continue to do their critical work.

In March of 2016, Congress declared in unequivocal terms that the persecution of Christians, Yezidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq and Syria by ISIS constituted genocide.  This was a seminal moment in the U.Congress because it's only the third time in history that Congress has declared a genocide. Unfortunately, the conditions for the tens of thousands of survivors of these crimes against humanity grow worse each day.  Mr.Speaker, we are witnessing the systematic extermination of Christians and other religious and ethnic minorities at the hands of  And despite the fact that Congress has appropriated over $1 billion in humanitarian aid to help these communities in Fiscal Year 2017, the money has not reached survivors because the only organizations focused solely on aiding survivors are religious groups, which the State Department will not provide assistance to.  For example, the Archdiocese of Erbil is currently providing food, housing, and medical care to more than 70,000 Christians who escaped death at the hands of Even though the Archdiocese of Erbil is providing assistance to survivors at the center of this crisis, the State Department will not distribute U.assistance through religious organizations. H.390 would resolve this ongoing problem.  The bill directs the Secretary of State and USAID to provide assistance directly to entities, including faith-based entities that are effectively providing assistance to genocide survivors or other persecuted religious and ethnic communities on the ground in Iraq and Importantly, the aid can only be used for humanitarian relief on the ground, not to support the general operations of the church or faith-based entity.  H.390 also includes important provisions that will help the international community document the crimes against humanity that have been committed by ISIS, hold the perpetrators accountable, and ensure we learn from the horrors we have witnessed over the last six years so that we can one day prevent the next large-scale genocide from occurring.

Seven years since its enactment, it has become glaringly apparent that Dodd-Frank has worked to advantage big banks on Wall Street; but for many of my constituents, the most detrimental aspects of Dodd-Frank to upstate New York aren't necessarily what is going on on Wall Street but, rather, the damage it has inflicted upon small community banks and Main  As has been highlighted here today, the U.is losing community banks at a rate of one per day.

It seeks to help all community banks that elect to raise capital through a mutual holding company, or an MHC, charter.  Dodd-Frank and the implementing Federal Reserve regulations came down hard on these mutual holding companies, putting onerous, expensive regulations on these mutual holding companies just for them to waive the receipts of dividends, a practice which was common pre-Dodd-Frank, and it worked very well.  In New York State, banks such as the Bank of Greene County, NorthEast Community Bank, Lake Shore Savings Bank, and many others throughout the Empire State and throughout the country have been burdened by Dodd-Frank's nonsensical dividend waiver rules.

The banks that are organized as mutual holding companies organize that way. They are owned by their depositors, and they have also been able to sell publicly traded stock, but they keep a majority position in the mutual holding company. Why? Because they want to maintain the community involvement. They want to maintain the community ownership and not have their bank taken over by a distanced series of investors. That is what is exactly happening with the Bank of Greene County, for instance, in my district.  The Bank of Greene County, as a mutual holding company, they own 55 percent of the bank. So it is owned by the depositors, the public shareholders, 45 percent; but because of Dodd-Frank and because of the change in the regulatory process that was eliminated in Dodd-Frank, every time the mutual holding company has dividends, annually, to waive, they must send a notice to every depositor. A depositor who might have $5 in the account or $50,000, they have to mail a notice to them. It costs them $150,000 a year that is simply wasted, and that money can't be reinvested in our community.  Mr.Chair, I regret that the minority is misrepresenting what we are trying to do here. We are defending the interests of small community banks organized as mutual holding companies that want to keep their ownership of their bank local.

Mr.Speaker, scandal after scandal has caused heightened distrust between veterans and the For far too long, veterans nationwide have been disrespected by those who are supposed to be advocates for them, sometimes with deadly consequences.  Be it in regional offices--like the one in Philadelphia, which my office has worked closely with--or medical centers, from Phoenix to Florida, we have seen the devastating impact of the current culture of mismanagement and distrust, and its impact on backlogged claims and lack of care for those who devoted their lives to serve our country.  The legislation before the House today institutes the needed reforms throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs by granting the authority, and the expectation, that the Secretary remove, demote, or suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct.  Rebuilding this trust between Veterans Affairs and those who had served us must be a priority. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act is crucial to reforming this trust, and I am proud to support it.

Nine years ago, I was there, in 2008, when our financial system collapsed, as a new Member of Congress, the sole scientist on the Financial Services And as we surveyed the wreckage of our economy, I wondered how we ever could have gotten into a place like that with our financial system clogged with toxic assets based on trillions of dollars of mortgages that never had any realistic chance of being repaid by their homeowners.  We saw giant banks and trading firms leveraged beyond belief, huge financial corporations so complex that they had thousands of business units that even their CEOs were unaware of, and risk management software that was being ignored, if it existed at all.  How could we have gotten there? But when I look at the CHOICE Act that Republicans are about to ram through on a party-line vote, I understand perfectly how we got there. I see all the same forces of mindless deregulation and free market ideology, an overriding mania for tax cuts for the rich, while stripping financial protection for ordinary American families; the same refusal to learn the lessons of financial history and to replace them with alternative facts that fit their ideology.

Our amendment would provide $2.5 million to revive the Office of Technology Assessment to provide Congress with unbiased, timely, and nonpartisan reports on a wide range of issues in science and technology.  This office is no less necessary today than when it was first started in 1972, or when it was defunded in 1995. As technology continues to advance at an increasingly rapid pace and our partisan divide seems to grow deeper, Congress needs this now more than ever.  The OTA did important work in a number of areas, but I would like to highlight just one of those areas in particular.  One of the last recommendations the OTA made was that the U.should move rapidly to computerized health records and that standards should be put in place to ensure what we now call interoperability.  Had we heeded this advice rather than defunding the OTA, we could have saved hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money and saved hundreds of thousands of American lives by ensuring accurate, up-to-date patient data that was accessible regardless of where the patient turned up for care.  This also could have helped slow or prevent the opioid epidemic by ensuring that patients would not be able to doctor shop to acquire numerous opioid prescriptions.  While we cannot slow down the rapid pace of technology, we can give our country back an important and proven tool.  So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to restore this vital source of credible, nonpartisan scientific expertise to the U.

5132,topic-id,867,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself 6 minutes.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today to present an amendment to H.3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations This legislative package provides critical appropriations for national security, including for the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Energy's nuclear programs, and the Legislative Branch bill.  My colleagues, this is the primary constitutional duty of the Congress: to ensure the safety of the homeland and the American people.  This legislation is carefully crafted to meet that responsibility: funding our critical military priorities, supporting veterans, and making our borders more secure.  The core of this package is full-year funding for the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. I thank Chairwoman Granger for her leadership.  In total, the Defense portion of the bill provides $658.1 billion for these functions, an increase of $68.1 billion in base discretionary funding above the fiscal year 2017 enacted levels.  There is no doubt that this is a significant increase from the current spending levels, and certainly from the last 8 years. But this increase is vitally important to continue the process we started this spring: to rebuild, repair, and re-equip our Armed Forces that we started in the 2017 appropriations package.                              {time}  1515  Mr.Chairman, Secretary of Defense Mattis has quite correctly made readiness and modernization of our forces his top priorities.  It is a fact today that we have too many aircraft that cannot fly, too many ships that cannot sail, and too many troops who cannot deploy either because they are not properly trained or there are not enough of them.  So how did we get there? Because in recent years, we have been just getting by--reducing investments in our military as the world becomes more dangerous, and avoiding tough choices.  The package before us today will sustain a much-needed rebuilding of our military after a half decade of cuts, while our troops remained in constant combat, as they do today.  We provided prioritized funding to necessary but unfunded equipment and weapons platforms. We have boosted missile defense, a program that has taken on critical importance as North Korea, unabatedly, tries to marry its nuclear warheads with new ballistic missiles.  We increased funding for the vital training that prepares our warfighter for any contingency. This legislation also supports our military families. After all, they serve, too. We included a 2.4 percent pay increase for our servicemen and -women, the largest such raise in 8 years, and they deserve it.  Within the Military Construction and Veterans portion of this bill--and I thank Chairman Dent for his leadership--military infrastructure funding has increased by 25 percent above current levels. We continue our efforts to rebuild our Armed Forces by ensuring that our warfighters have the support they need.  We cannot forget those who have served. This measure increases funding to the Department of Veterans Affairs to 5 percent over current levels to provide veterans and their families with access to medical care and other benefits they have earned and deserve.  Within the Energy and Water section of this legislation--I thank Chairman Simpson for his leadership--funding is prioritized for critical nuclear programs that will help strengthen our security and deter threats around the globe.  We also support the maintenance of our Nation's waterways and support the work of the Army Corps to also ensure the resilience and security of our electricity infrastructure.  We recommit to opening Yucca Mountain as a safe and secure location to permanently store the Nation's nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes, and we promote basic science programs, which lay the foundation for new energy technologies.  Finally, Mr.Chairman, this package also includes funding for important legislative branch functions--and I thank Chairman Yoder for his leadership--improving security to ensure[[Page H6336]]that our Members, our staffs, and visitors to this wonderful Capitol complex are always well protected.  Mr.Chairman, before I close, I offer thanks to members of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work and tough decisions over the past few months producing two appropriations bills, fiscal year 2017 and 2018, in less than 3 months.  As you know, we received the President's budget on May 23, just over 2 months ago, and since then, we have worked nonstop to put all 12 bills through the committee in record time. Each and every one of these bills deserves to be sent to the President's desk. I look forward to completing our work on all of our bills.

5084,topic-id,465,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we have spent a great deal of time this afternoon discussing legislation designed to detect and punish sexual predators. These bills are all strong, well crafted, and laudable. I urge my colleagues to support them.  However, there is another facet to this problem, which is prevention. This may be the most important action we as Congress can take in the realm of child exploitation laws. We must do all we can to prevent child exploitation from happening in the first place.  Mr.Speaker, that is why I am pleased to bring H.695, the Child Protection Improvements Act, before the House today. This legislation is extremely important in that it makes permanent a successful pilot program that allowed youth-serving organizations access to FBI fingerprint database searches.[[Page H4410]]  In 2003, the PROTECT Act created the Child Safety Pilot Program, which ran from 2003 until 2011, and provided access to FBI fingerprint background checks for a variety of child-serving nonprofits.  The pilot conducted over 105,000 background checks during its existence. 6.2 percent of potential volunteers were found to have criminal records of concern. While that may seem like a small percentage, Mr.Speaker, it works out to over 6,500 individuals.  In addition, over 40 percent of individuals with criminal records of concern had crimes in States other than where they were applying to volunteer, meaning that only a nationwide check would have flagged these individuals' criminal records.  The criminal offenses detected among some of these checks included convictions for criminal sexual conduct with a child, child endangerment, and manslaughter. Twenty-six percent of these individuals showed a different name on their record than the one they used on their job application.  H.695 allows organizations such as the YMCA to submit fingerprints to a designated entity which, in turn, submits them to the FBI for processing. The system protects privacy rights by ensuring that the specifics of a criminal record are never disclosed without explicit consent by the applicant, and it provides opportunity for individuals to correct errors in their records directly with the  Importantly, the bill does not mandate that youth-serving organizations use this process. It merely makes the process more accessible and more affordable for organizations that wish to use it.  Mr.Speaker, the harsh reality is that there are individuals who will put themselves in positions where they are entrusted with children so they can then betray that trust in the worst way imaginable. That is why bills like H.695, and other bills we have discussed today, are so important.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Schiff) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Bishop) for introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan legislation.

5182,topic-id,241,"Mr.Chair, the unique circumstances of the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rulemaking warrant an expedited repeal of the rule. In November 2016, the Committee released a staff report titled ``Politicization of the Waters of the United States Rulemaking,'' detailing the findings of more than a year-long investigation in to the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rulemaking. The investigation revealed widespread procedural violations, excessive unilateral and politically driven decision-making, and persistent failures of consultation and consideration of public comments.  The EPA's extraordinary efforts to push through this procedurally deficient and roundly disliked rulemaking created an insurmountable illegitimacy of the rulemaking that warrants immediate repeal. To facilitate this necessary action, Congress is exercising its authority to create exemptions to existing law in H.3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. Section 108 of the bill provides a single-use exemption from regulatory procedure and legal requirements to allow EPA and the Secretary of the Army to immediately withdraw the WOTUS rule. The immediate repeal of WOTUS will allow EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to start with a clean slate as they conduct a joint rulemaking, between equal partners, with full consideration of the comments and concerns raised by the American public.  In future rulemakings, including any WOTUS replacement, Congress expects federal agencies to approach their mandate to consult with state, local, and tribal governments and give full consideration to public comments with a commitment to administrative procedure and effective rulemaking.

Iran is increasing its influence in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, and they remain hostile. Just yesterday, an Iranian vessel pursued a U.Navy ship at a high speed in the Persian Gulf, forcing our ship to fire warning shots to halt the aggression.  Meanwhile, ISIS and al-Qaida terrorists continue to spread their perverted version of Islam across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle  All of our adversaries are acting in an aggressive and emboldened manner. We must ensure that the U.military is prepared to confront anyone who threatens us. This can only be done by reversing the years of budget instability, sequestration, and continuous cuts.  Since becoming chair, I have made it my priority to listen first and foremost to our defense and intelligence experts, and this bill before you reflects their expert advice. This bill provides Secretary of Defense Mattis the resources he needs to rebuild our military and form a new national defense strategy.  It has been an honor to work with my ranking member, Mr.Visclosky, who has played a valuable role in this process. I want to thank Mr.Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Lowey, and all the members of the Defense Subcommittee for their involvement and their contributions.  I would also like to thank the staff of the Defense Subcommittee: Jennifer Miller, Sherry Young, Walter Hearne, Brooke Boyer, B.Wright, Adrienne Ramsay, Allison Deters, Cornell Teaugue, Collin Lee, and Matt Bower; as well as Rebecca Leggieri, Jennifer Chartrand, and Chris Bigelow on the minority staff.

To ensure this doesn't happen, the bill includes $28.6 billion above the President's request for a National Defense Restoration We must keep this funding intact.

5209,topic-id,327,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr.Chairman, we have heard some of the problems with CBO from Mr.We heard from Mr.Perry immediately before on his amendment.  The CBO is meant to help Congress evaluate legislation. But I do not believe the agency, as currently constituted, has or can do so effectively.                              {time}  1745  Too often, predictions made by CBO turn out to be far off the mark.  We heard about the 2002 farm bill and the 2008 farm bill from Mr.That is true, but people back home may not realize that, in fact, we don't do a farm bill every year. We do one roughly every 5 years, sometimes a little later than that, so there have not been so many to score.  One of our favorites on the Energy and Commerce Committee, on which I am pleased to serve, is the fact that, in 2015, we decided we would push forward and sell, as a nation, some broadband spectrum. CBO said zero dollars would be yielded from that sale.  Now, I use this all the time when I am talking to high school students, because you don't have to be a CBO person living in the ivory tower that they must live in to understand that broadband spectrum has value in today's society, and zero is not the right score. In the end, it brought in $44 billion. When you take away the costs, it brought in a net $40 billion. CBO was wrong.  CBO has overestimated on a number of things. Mr.Perry talked about But time after time after time, they have gotten things wrong. They said it cost more or didn't save as much.  In fact, I just saw, today, a report put out by Xcenda that the per-patient oncology drug costs were 0.06 to 2.3 times lower than what CBO said they were going to be from roughly 2003 to 2013, according to that study.

Mr.Chairman, we have heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we ought to trust the CBO, that the referee should be taken at their word and that they are doing the best they can. But let's look at this amendment.  The CBO scored it, and they said:       CBO estimates that your amendment would have no net effect      on budget authority or outlays in fiscal year 2018.  No net effect. Who here actually believes that eliminating 89 positions, as the gentleman from Virginia, my friend, just said it is going to affect his people, who believes that 89 people being eliminated and $15 million in aggregate salaries has no net effect on budget authority or outlays? I don't think any of us believe that.  So here is the conundrum that my friends have on the other side of this issue: a ``yes'' vote means that you agree with me that something needs to be reformed at CBO; a ``no'' vote means that you agree with CBO's assessment that this amendment abolishing 89 employees will have no effect. Therefore, I would submit to you that the CBO has, in effect, determined that their budget analysis division has no value. Therefore, if you actually support CBO, you must vote ``present.''  Mr.Chairman, I ask my colleagues to join me with a ``yes,'' and let's start the reform at CBO so we can get accurate numbers.

Our Founders established our court system to serve as an independent arbiter that would protect the rights of every American and ensure equal justice under our laws. Unfortunately, it is clear that Mr.Bush lacks the impartiality and commitment to equal justice for every American that is needed to qualify for a lifetime appointment on the Sixth Circuit Court of  President Trump's nomination of Mr.Bush represents yet another attempt by this administration to undermine the rights of American women to make their own healthcare decisions and to control their own destinies. To fully participate not only in our economy but also in our democracy, women must be recognized for their capacity to make their own healthcare decisions, just as men are, and they must have the full independence to do so, just as men do. Mr.Bush has made it clear that he fundamentally disagrees with that principle and that he does not support a woman's constitutionally protected right to have a safe and legal abortion. Hiding behind a pseudonym on an online blog, Mr.Bush has gone so far as to compare a woman's right to make her own reproductive health decisions to slavery, saying they are ``the two greatest tragedies in our country.'' The fact that someone nominated for the bench would believe something like this is nothing short of appalling.  Mr.Bush has also criticized essential programs that women and their families depend on, referring to programs like the Women, Infants, and Children Program--otherwise known as WIC--and grants to combat violence against women as ``wasteful.''  I also have real concerns with Mr.Bush's record when it comes to the rights of LGBTQ Mr.Bush has made clear that he is vehemently opposed to marriage equality, calling it a ``no-compromise'' position. In 2011, he criticized the State Department for an announcement that led to more equal treatment of same-sex parents, and he has even used an offensive, anti-gay slur in a quote that he chose to use in public remarks.  Mr.Bush's deeply offensive public statements and his record indicate that he is an individual who is focused on extreme partisanship and who does not recognize the basic equality of all His statements and his actions tell us that he is not committed to the concept of equal justice under our laws. This is unacceptable for someone seeking a lifetime appointment to a job that requires sound judgment, objectivity, and, more than anything else, an essential commitment to fairness.

4659,topic-id,817,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, it has been 7 years since the Dodd-Frank Act was passed, a monumental triumph of ideology over compassion and common sense. All of the promises of Dodd-Frank were broken. They promised us it would lift the economy, Mr.Chairman, but, instead, we are still stymied in the weakest, slowest recovery in the postwar era.  They promised us that it would end too big to fail, but, instead, it cynically codified too-big-to-fail banks in the law and backed it up with a taxpayer bailout fund.  It promised us, Mr.Chairman--they promised us that it would lead to a more stable economy, but, instead, the big banks are bigger. The small banks are fewer. We are losing a community bank or credit union a day.  Our corporate bond market, a key component of financing of jobs, historic levels of volatility and illiquidity.  They promised us, Mr.Chairman, that it would help the consumer, but, instead, we see free checking cut in half at banks, bank fees are up. The ranks of the unbanked have increased.  For many creditworthy borrowers, they are paying $500 more for an auto loan. Have you tried getting a mortgage recently? They are harder to come by and cost hundreds of dollars more to close.  Every promise of Dodd-Frank has been broken. And, Mr.Chairman, we hear about it every day. I heard from Julieann, a banker in Massachusetts, and she wrote, `` `We have experienced a spike in loan declines to women,' for their investigation identified that women attempting to buy the family home to settle their divorce and stabilize their family were being declined at a high rate due to the Dodd-Frank Qualified Mortgage rules. . . .''  Dodd-Frank is hurting recently divorced women. I heard from Allen in New Hampshire who talked about his need for a new car, but he couldn't find a loan from a bank, and he said:       But for my local dealer's efforts on my behalf, there is no      doubt I would not be driving my current car, and this was a      desperate situation, for I am the sole income earner for my      family. My wife is ill, and we have two young children in      school. After my old vehicle broke down, I needed to find      reliable, replacement transportation so that I could get to      work and continue to provide for my family. Please ensure      that financing car and truck dealerships are not stymied by      Dodd-Frank's  I heard from Maxine in Salt Lake City, who talked about her company. She said:       Last February, we were awarded a major catering contract      for all food services in the new performing arts center. The      new contract will require us to make a major investment in      equipment in small wares. We will be able to hire 50      additional staff. Unfortunately, red tape got in the way,      turned what should have been a golden opportunity into an      unbelievable headache. Three banks informed us that our      rating, according to new bank regulations imposed by Dodd-     Frank, disqualified us from consideration.  Mr.Chairman, we have letter after letter, email after email, showing how Dodd-Frank is harming working families, harming small businesses, crushing community banks.  Fortunately, Mr.Chairman, there is a better, smarter way, and it is called the Financial CHOICE It is going to create hope and opportunity for investors and consumers, and entrepreneurs, and it stands for economic growth for all, but bank bailouts for none.  Contrary to Dodd-Frank, and what every Democrat will come here today--my friends on the other side of the aisle--and defend, we will end bank bailouts once and for all. We will replace bailout with bankruptcy. We will replace economic stagnation with a growing healthy economy. We will ensure that there will finally be pay increases, wage increases for working Americans who haven't seen a pay increase since Dodd-Frank became law.  We will replace Washington micromanagement with market discipline. We will ensure that we replace taxpayer money with private money because for every bank who will have a 10 percent simple leverage ratio, which is analogous to having a private insurance policy against bailout, we will let them have that Dodd-Frank off-ramp, and that is so important.  But, Mr.Chairman, we are also going to hold Wall Street accountable with the toughest penalties that they have seen, and no more bailouts. Perhaps that is one of the reasons they oppose the Financial CHOICE Act and support the status quo of Dodd- We will make sure that there is needed regulatory relief for our small banks and credit unions, because it is our small banks who loan to our small businesses, that create the job engine of America, and make sure that the American Dream is not a pipe dream; but, instead, it is a dream and a vision where we will only be limited by our imagination.

4680,topic-id,467,"Mr.Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), a gentleman on leave from the Financial Services Committee and one we proudly call our own.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Chair, I first want to thank Chairman Hensarling and the entire Financial Services Committee for the work they have done on this bill. They have listened to Members and they have listened to constituents throughout this country. They studied the issue and they found the very best policy.  We all know we need economic growth, but we also know that growth means little if wages will not rise, if jobs do not return, and if more businesses close than open.  If a rising tide lifts all boats, we need to make sure every American is in the boat. Repealing Dodd-Frank with the Financial CHOICE Act lifts people back in so they can participate in America's economy. It will reestablish the severed ties that link communities to the money they need to start businesses and hire employees.[[Page H4721]]  Bringing back the community banks that Dodd-Frank destroyed means that more people, not just the wealthy, will have access to credit. But if we want everyone to be part of the American economy, we don't want people to face the same risks they did before. We want people to be treated fairly.  In 2008, people lost everything. Aided by misguided Washington policies, some played fast and loose and put almost everyone else at risk. So it is only natural that people looked around and asked: Why do we have a system where, when things go wrong, banks need to get bailouts, but the American people get nothing?  It is not a fair system. Dodd-Frank made it worse. It actually codified bailouts into law and made a taxpayer slush fund. On top of all that, we all know the regulations it created were just ridiculous.  Why is it that the rich and powerful get to game the complicated rules produced by their friends in the bureaucracy while everyone else faces a mountain of paperwork and regulations that no human being has a chance of understanding?  We all know that is not fair. All this ends up boxing out small-business owners and normal Americans who can't hire lawyers to sift through it all.  The Financial CHOICE Act levels the playing field. It makes both Wall Street and Washington accountable so that their bad decisions don't cost the taxpayers money. It makes things simple so that you don't need an Ivy League law degree to understand the rules that govern our lives.  America is a nation for the people. Everyone has a shot. Everyone should be treated the same. Everyone has a chance to succeed. The Financial CHOICE Act brings us a little closer to that America one more time.

This amendment will not--not--affect the ability of the NCUA to determine the appropriate allocation of expenses between their insurance and other functions for purpose of their overall funding, but it will, for the first time, give Congress the power of the purse--our constitutional power of the purse--over many of the FDIC and NCUA's operating expenses.

Unfortunately, that is pretty well all we have heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle.  I am absolutely fascinated, Mr.Chairman, how often Members on the other side of the aisle say: I care so much about community banks; I care so much about small business.  But, Mr.Chairman, do you know how many amendments that they filed on H.10?  Let me count them. Zero amendments.  Where is their bill to help small banks? Where is their bill to help credit unions?  They don't have one, and they didn't offer any amendments, so that is all we hear.  We hear the rhetoric about Wall Street, Mr.Chairman, but it is fascinating to me--don't take my word for it, but according to The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal, three of the largest publications in our country, they all say the same thing: Large, Wall Street banks support Dodd-Frank, and they oppose the Financial CHOICE  Now, why do they do that?  Maybe it is because my friends on the other side of the aisle are only all too happy to preserve Wall Street bailouts. They wrote it into the law. They codified it into the law; and then they took[[Page H4791]]the rest of us and created this thing called the orderly liquidation authority, which is nothing more than a taxpayer-funded bailout system. Trillions of dollars can be taken from taxpayers to bail out large banks. And they defend it.

4716,topic-id,767,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the chairman for his leadership in guiding the Financial CHOICE Act through the Financial Services Committee and the  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Arkansas State Bank Department, and an article by the Arkansas Bankers Association entitled ``Disappearing Community Banks.''                                                    Arkansas State                                              Bank Department,                                                      May 1, 2017.     Jeb Hensarling,     Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, Washington,              Maxine Waters,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: I am      writing in support of H.10, the ``Financial CHOICE Act of      2017.'' As a state bank regulator, I have seen the huge      burden Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 has placed on community banks.      Since the financial crisis, several community banks in      Arkansas have curtailed or discontinued lending activities--     particularly, residential mortgages--which has been      detrimental to the consumers they serve. In addition, the      number of small community banks in our state and across the      country has decreased, primarily through mergers with larger      banks better equipped to handle Dodd-Frank's onerous      compliance regimen.       I believe the Financial CHOICE Act will address a number of      issues which will improve the business climate for community      banks. In particular, providing broad regulatory relief to      banks with an average leverage capital ratio of at least 10      percent will enhance our community banks ability to serve the      public. With fewer financial and employee resources allocated      to compliance issues, community banks will be able to      increase lending to businesses and individuals, which will      stimulate much-needed economic growth in their communities.      Additionally, I strongly believe the leverage capital ratio      is a better standard by which to assess a bank's health than      risk-based measures.       Thank you for your work in advancing the Financial CHOICE      I greatly appreciate your efforts to help community      banks.           Sincerely,                                                Candace Franks,                                      ____                 [From the Arkansas Banker Association]                      Disappearing Community Banks    (By Bill Holmes, President & CEO, Arkansas Bankers Association)       In 1994 I was working for the original Twin City We      were in a bank wide campaign to break a billion dollars in      assets. There were 260 banks headquartered in      Today, there are 103. If we continue to lose community banks      at the same pace our small businesses, home buyers and      farmers will have only a third of the bank choices they      enjoyed in 1994. This is a problem for our mostly rural      state. And it is not just a local problem, it is happening      across the country.       There are any number of reasons for this decline in      community banks. For the last ten years, the reason I hear      more than any other is the increasing cost of the federal      regulatory burden. The costs of complying with regulations      that should never have been intended for rural banks, the      costs of training more and more staff for compliance issues,      the cost of newly required software to feed a never ending      appetite for data.       I will grant you that after the financial crisis some      regulatory changes were necessary to improve financial      stability. But ten years later we've ended up with too many      regs that don't improve our banks, but do limit our bankers'      discretion and look to drive credit decisions to a score      sheet designed inside the beltway. Our community bankers have      decades of history on their customers, and have always been a      key to the economic growth in their communities. I don't      think the intent of these regulations was to limit the      growth, or limit the home buyers, in our state. But the fact      is it does. And, it is time to fix this.       Chairman Hensarling's The Financial CHOICE Act was recently      sent to the floor for a vote. It includes multiple changes      that our banking industry endorses, and we feel we need these      changes to help spur the economy. This legislation would ease      some requirements on mortgages that banks hold in their own      portfolios. This would let our bankers make many more loans      to self-employed businessmen, or entrepreneurs with unstable      incomes. The Act looks to tailor the regs and requirements      based on the risks and business types of each bank. We need      this to continue to give our customers more diversity and      more choices of where and how to bank.       The U.economy is unique. We need a healthy and broad mix      of banks to meet our customers' needs. From international      corporations, to the startup food truck, our bankers are      involved and are integral parts of our economy. If we cannot      get sensible reform in Washington, Arkansas's banking sector      will continue to shrink and become less diverse. Arkansans,      and all Americans, will pay the price in terms of less      lending and fewer opportunities for growth.

I worry, Mr.Speaker, that we are going to let this opportunity be lost in the political roil that is already consuming this idea of a week that we devote to infrastructure.  So I want to stand here, Mr.Speaker, and say, let's not let this idea go. It is too important. The improvement of our roadways and our bridges, our airports, and our railways is absolutely essential to the quality of life of every single constituent of every single Member of this  As I talk to the business leaders in my district, the fact that they have a challenge in moving their people and their goods, that sometimes getting to work is a 2-hour proposition, are the things that hold them back.  I know that the Republicans and the Democrats disagree on an awful lot, but we have to be able to agree on the fundamental notion that if we don't have a functioning transportation infrastructure, if our airplanes and ships and rails and cars don't move well, this country cannot be great, and our economy will be damaged.  These last 4 months have been pretty rough. We got--kicked off with a repeal of the Affordable Care Act; and I understand that my Republican friends had been promising that for years, but it was a brutal experience. It failed on the floor. The American public hates the bill that so many of my Republican friends were cajoled into voting for, much to their political peril.  There was an alternative start to this There was this fantasy alternative start that has the President, shortly after his inauguration, saying to the American people: I know that this campaign was tough and the rhetoric was as ugly as it ever has been in an American campaign, but we are going to come together now, in January of 2017, to restitch the Nation, literally and figuratively. Literally means we are going to work together to rebuild the infrastructure of this country.  Sadly, that is an alternate reality that did not happen, and so we are consumed in Twitter feuds and partisanship and some of the most difficult to pass legislation that ultimately is not likely to become law, but which will continue to split the parties in this  It is not too late, though, Mr.I think we can still turn this around.  I have the privilege of chairing the New Democrat Coalition, 61 Democratic Members who, as challenged as they feel by this President's positions and behavior, are hoping for that moment when we can work with Republicans, when we can get something done with this President that will be meaningful to our constituents. And I know they, and many other Democrats, will be there for that conversation.  To my conservative, even to my Freedom Caucus friends, there is nothing more conservative than the idea that you keep your house in order; that you invest so that your children can have the kind of prosperity that we were able to experience.  And to the President, I would say: Sir, you seem to be a builder. You seem to have recognized the need for this kind of program when you promised a $1 trillion infrastructure investment. And, sir, I would say, if you look at some of our highways that were built in the 1950s, at the entrance ramp to those highways you will see a sign that says the Dwight Eisenhower Interstate Highway Sir, there is no reason why those signs couldn't have your name on them.  So, Mr.Speaker, this problem is so urgent, it is so potentially bipartisan in its solution, that I want to close with the observation that we need to lift this out of the partisan maw and observe, Mr.Speaker, that yesterday we celebrated the Greatest Generation because, 73 years ago yesterday, they stormed the beaches of That is part of why we call them the Greatest But the other part and the other reason we call them that is because they came back to America and they set aside their differences and they invested in projects like the Interstate Highway System that we all use every day. That is a big part of why we call them the Greatest They built our country.  And now that generation looks at us and they have a question, and that question is: What will you do with that legacy that we built for you?

5031,topic-id,440,"Mr.President, today I wish to congratulate retiring University of Hawaii women's volleyball coach Dave Shoji on an outstanding 42-year career.  In 1975, at just 28 years old, Dave Shoji tallied his first win as head coach of the Rainbow Wahine volleyball team. Since then, he has gone on to compile one of the most decorated resumes in collegiate volleyball history. In fact, there has been no such thing as a losing season during Dave's tenure with the Rainbow In 2013, he earned the title of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's alltime winningest coach. In 2016, he became just the second coach in NCAA history to win 1,200 matches.  He departs the university with an astonishing record of 1,202 wins, 204 losses, and 1 tie, including 4 national titles, 25 conference championships, and more than 30 postseason national tournament appearances.  Coach Shoji leaves the confines of the Stan Sheriff Center with a legacy much larger than the numbers.  It is fitting that Coach Shoji's tenure began just a few short years after the enactment of title IX, a law now named for Hawaii Congresswoman Patsy Mink who championed its passage. Title IX seeks to ensure equal opportunity and prohibit sex discrimination in higher education. It is most widely known for expanding opportunities for women in collegiate athletics. Coach Shoji's tenure at the helm of Rainbow Wahine volleyball has clearly demonstrated the value of opportunity for young people--not just young women--in His teams have been examples of what can be achieved through hard work, professionalism, and teamwork. That example has led many local players to aspire to 1 day don the green and white Wahine jersey, play in front of sold-out crowds, and look to Coach Shoji in the center of the huddle during a nail-biting set. Parents were always hopeful, too, that they would witness their daughter's transition from girl to woman in the care of Coach Shoji and company.  During his tenure, Coach Shoji's has coached 86 All-American selections, 35 conference players of the year and, 175 all-conference picks. His players' successes extended beyond the court. More than 100 players have earned all-academic conference recognitions under his guidance.  Over the past 42 years, Coach Shoji has built a reputation for excellence built on hard work, integrity, and love for the game. He has helped shape countless student athletes and brought pride to their families and legions of fans. Coach Shoji has set the standard for those who follow.  Hawaii extends our warmest aloha and mahalo nui loa to Coach Shoji for his passion and commitment to not only the sport of volleyball but the State of ``Let's go 'Bows!''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgS2611-2.txt,1844,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,27.0,July
4856,topic-id,649,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to reflect on the life of the late James Louis Maxwell, Jr., a gentleman from a small eastern North Carolina county, whose innovative mind and entrepreneurial spirit helped grow his grandfather's local milling company into a thriving international agribusiness. Louis Maxwell's story is certainly one of commercial and financial success, but it is, more importantly, Mr.Speaker, about a life devoted to family and community.  On January 9, 1927, in Wayne County, North Carolina, James Louis Maxwell and his wife, Ruth Herring, welcomed the birth of a son, Louis, He was an active youngster and became involved in Boy Scouts, proudly earning his Eagle Scout badge. He would later say that scouting had a transformational impact on him, and he remained actively involved with the Scouts throughout his life.  Louis' grandfather, Hugh Maxwell, founded Goldsboro Milling Company in 1916, a family business, which is honored, Mr.Speaker, to celebrate 101 years of business this year. The company began with the production of various feeds for farm animals, along with milling cornmeal and making grits.  Young Louis, a graduate of Goldsboro High School, attended Davidson College, but left to serve his country during World War After completing his Naval service, Louis enrolled in UNC-Chapel Hill, graduating in 1950 with a degree in commerce.  Proud of, and loyal to his deep roots in eastern North Carolina, he returned home to Goldsboro and immediately began working in the family business, and he rose quickly through the ranks.  Louis was always looking at ways to expand the family business, and he began the company's efforts in raising turkeys, hoping that eastern North Carolina would be favorable to growing those large birds. Turkey production grew rapidly, and today, Mr.Speaker, Louis' vision and hard work have helped his company become the largest producer and processor of turkeys in the world, having acquired Butterball Company some years ago.  Continuing to grow agribusiness across the United States, Louis expanded his family's ventures, becoming a major swine producer, along with timber and blueberry farming. His visionary acumen has now carried through five generations of the Maxwell family and shows no signs of slowing down.  Yet, despite all of the many achievements of this good man--and I have really not even touched the surface of those achievements--he is truly a humble person. To Louis Maxwell, helping folks in his communities, by providing good jobs and many opportunities, was one of the most honorable things he thought a man could do to serve his fellow man. He expected much from himself and from those he employed, and he was pleased to reward loyalty and hard work.  His outlet, when he wasn't working hard, what he liked to do was spend his time outdoors. Louis was the ultimate outdoorsman. If it wasn't hunting season, it was fishing season. His children were right there with him, and they say that he was still out in the boat fishing even in his later years. They always stuck to one rule, though, which was: he had to clean the fish that he caught.  Louis was a born and bred Methodist and was a lifelong member of Paul's Methodist Church in No matter where he was, Mr.Speaker, he never met a stranger, never walked past someone without saying hello, and he was a proud He loved his flag, and he loved his country.  But most importantly, he spent more than 60 years married to the love of his life, Mary Ann Jeffreys, until she passed in 2014. Together, they had four children, eight grandchildren, and now a great-grandchild. Louis was very proud of his family, as they were of him. He cherished his role as a husband, father, and grandfather.  In his lifetime, Louis Maxwell enriched countless lives in ways too many to express. He will truly be missed. He was a friend.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-28-pt1-PgH6568.txt,2143,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,28.0,July

4769,topic-id,536,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I would like to commend the chairman of the Financial Services Committee for his hard work, and the entire Financial Services Committee for all the effort they have undertaken in today's debate of the Financial CHOICE  Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. This amendment would allow for certain closed-end funds to be considered well-known seasoned issuers.  Ultimately, the proposed amendment is built upon the foundation of lowering costs and increasing access for investors by allowing companies that meet certain criteria to have the same equivalence as bigger companies that also have access to capital markets by making them available to those fast lanes that allow them to issue shares.  In 2005, the SEC put in place significant reforms that sought to modernize registration, communication, and offering processes for traditional operating companies. These reforms were designed to streamline the registration process, especially those for large reporting issuers or well-known seasoned issuers. Unfortunately, the SEC excluded registered closed-end funds from those reforms.  A closed-end fund is nothing more than a pooled investment fund with a fixed number of shares that is structured, listed, and traded just like a stock on the stock exchange. Closed-end funds are crucial to retirement[[Page H4792]]savings and investment vehicles that many retail investors use. About 3 million mom-and-pop investors rely on closed-end funds to meet their investment needs. These funds serve as a long-term source of capital, which, in turn, promotes job creation--something we can all agree needs to happen more in this country.  Closed-end funds, though, are currently under attack by unfair onerous filing and offering regulations. This commonsense amendment would provide parity for these certain closed-end funds by streamlining their registration process, offering and communications processes that are currently available to other publicly traded companies. This unfair exclusion of closed-end funds has created an unlevel playing field.  Giving qualifying closed-end funds the ability to enjoy well-known seasoned issuer status would help those funds better evaluate and assess the market for their offerings and would enable them to more quickly access capital markets. Those closed-end funds, an important vehicle for retail investors, would allow them to get capital to more job creators.  There has been a steady decline in the number of closed-end funds and the number of new closed-end funds offerings because of this unlevel playing field. Since 2007, the number of closed-end funds has dropped by 20 percent.                              {time}  1500  In 2007, there were 42 new closed-end fund issuances; in 2016, there were only 8. That is an 81 percent decline.  What we can all agree on is that Americans need access to capital. They need access to the capital markets that will provide them the capital to thrive as they have created new products. Retail investors also need access to those investments in order to meet their particular needs.  These closed-end funds should not have been hamstrung in their ability to access the advantages afforded to operating companies. It is time we provide parity in this marketplace by leveling the playing field.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I was here in the 2000s. Frankly, we took the referee off the field in the 2000s, and we didn't put the referee as toughly on the field in the late 1990s as we should have.

The bill which my Republican colleagues have put forward would put the American people at risk once again of having to bail out institutions if they lose money on risky investments.  Let me say to my Republican friends: I share their view that community banks should not be treated as too-big-to-fail banks. However, having said that, this bill takes the referee off the field one more time. It would effectively eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that is now the American people's watchdog.  We have spent a lot of time this year in the last 5 months passing bills under the Congressional Review Act that have reduced consumer protections, civil rights protections, teacher protections, environmental protections.

5153,topic-id,370,"Mr.Chairman, I served actively on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years. I am still a member on leave. Never, in the 36 years that I have been here, have I seen an omnibus appropriation bill or a minibus appropriation bill brought to the floor before the August break.  Regular order is to bring each bill to the floor, debate each bill on its merit, have the opportunity to offer amendments, and debate the merits of the amendments and of that particular bill. However, the majority party has not done its job, and I do not hold accountable the members of the Appropriations I want to make that clear.  But, for whatever reasons, regular order has not been followed, and so each Member of the Congress of the United States is confronted with either voting for all of the bill with component parts, the Legislative bill, Energy and Water, MILCON-VA, Defense bill, that they may not like, but if they vote ``no,'' they will be accused of being against the security of the United That, my friends, is baloney.  In their pledge to America, Republicans said: ``We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.''  This belies that representation. The sponsors of this minibus package, Mr.Chair, claim it will make America more secure. I reject that argument.  Senior military leaders have said that the greatest long-term threat to our national security is the growing national debt and the impact of interest payments on the debt as they crowd out our ability to invest in defense and domestic priorities.                              {time}  1615  It is incumbent upon us, Mr.Chairman, to work together to pass a fiscally responsible budget agreement that lifts the sequester caps in a way consistent with the principle of parity between defense and nondefense spending.  Mr.Chairman, we were supposed to pass a budget on or before April 15. It is now July 26. We have passed no budget. There is no plan for overall spending. This, therefore, is a pig in a poke, and nobody on this House floor or in this country knows the ramifications of the passage of this bill on the eight domestic spending bills that remain unattended.

We cannot simply skip to appropriations without determining what our budget priorities are first. It is as critical for our national defense as it is for our ability to support economic growth.  Moreover, this is the earliest, as I have said before, that I can ever remember that the House considered either an omnibus or minibus appropriations bill. It is an acknowledgement by the majority that the House will not be able to move these bills through under regular order, given Republicans' internal divisions over spending bills. So instead of working with Democrats to craft individual appropriations bills that can pass the House, they are resorting to legislative tactics to push them through on partisan votes.  I will remind my friends across the aisle that they have been unable to enact a single funding bill in the past 7 years without ultimately appealing to Democratic votes. So I urge my colleagues to reject this minibus package and make it clear that we first ought to negotiate a budget agreement that provides certainty and clarity to the entire Federal Government, not just a handful of agencies. And we ought to do it through an open and transparent process, with Members permitted to offer amendments that can shape a budget and appropriations bills truly reflective of the Nation's priority as a whole.

4671,topic-id,350,"Mr.Chairman, the economic downturn in 2008 caused Michiganders and folks around the country to lose their jobs, families to lose their savings, and even some to lose their homes. Since that time, folks on the other side of the aisle have been attempting to convince the American people that the Dodd-Frank Act is ``the answer'' to the financial crisis, despite the law failing to actually address the root cause of the downturn. In reality, Dodd-Frank has made it more difficult for hardworking taxpayers to secure a future for themselves and their children by denying them the economic recovery that they deserve.  Hardworking Americans rely on capital markets to save for everything from college to retirement. We as Congress must act to eliminate the burdensome and unnecessary red tape created under Dodd-Frank to ensure U.capital markets remain the most effective in the world so that all investors can receive the greatest return on their investments.  Since Dodd-Frank, our capital markets have become less stable, less efficient, and less liquid, which has made it more difficult for small businesses and American job creators around the country to access the necessary financial resources in order to expand and create jobs. In fact, Dodd-Frank has severed access to the capital markets for Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs who are the heartbeat of the American economy.  In order to succeed, small and growing companies need capital and credit--the lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet the government has continued to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing as smaller companies are caught in a sea of red tape created by Washington bureaucrats.  Enough is enough. In order to increase economic opportunity, we must enact commonsense regulatory reform and restore accountability to Wall Street and to The House Financial Services Committee achieves this goal through the carefully crafted CHOICE Act, which we are debating here today.

We hold Wall Street accountable. We hold the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accountable, and we make it more effective to do its job. No government agency should be unaccountable to the American taxpayer.  Dodd-Frank was a larger social agenda waiting for a crisis, and I understand that from my friends on the other side; but today, small businesses and hardworking Americans continue to pay the price.

The Financial CHOICE Act is an important recognition of the many mistakes that policymakers made leading up to and responding to the financial crisis.  There is no doubt that the American people demanded changes from Washington when the financial crash led to higher unemployment, huge drops in home values, and lost hope and opportunities; but instead of reforms that would increase competition and decrease systemic risk, the Dodd-Frank Act grew government and piled new regulations on community banks and credit units and enshrined too big to fail into law.  Forty-two community banks and 106 Illinois credit unions have closed their doors since Dodd-Frank was signed in 2007. This is unacceptable.  I am grateful that regulatory relief legislation that I have championed is included in the Financial CHOICE Act, things like the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act and many other provisions that will provide great relief to our local financial institutions.

It is all of our new Members here, and Representative Khanna from California, who is going to be taking over as co-chair of this Special Order hour for the Progressive  Mr.Speaker, we have to make sure that the American people understand exactly what is going on. This is a bill that the Senate has been negotiating in private. It has been 13 men discussing healthcare for all Americans across this country in a secret room. That is really what has been happening.  Today we saw a draft of this bill, and the prevailing wisdom, when the bill passed the House, was that the Senate would completely revamp the bill. But according to The New York Times, it said: The Senate bill ``once promised as a top-to-bottom revamp of the health bill passed by the House . . . instead maintains its structure, with modest adjustments.''  It is the same bill. It is the same bill. And in fact, in some ways, it is a little bit worse because the cuts to Medicaid, while they don't take effect as quickly and they are more gradual, they are actually deeper than the House cuts to  There are other things in the bill that have been done, really, in part, to affect how the American people see the bill but don't change the basic provisions of this bill.  Part of the reason they delayed the cuts to Medicaid is so that they hope that they can get a better CBO score, Congressional Budget Office score, which the American people should know the last time around, the second time around after the first time the bill was about to come to the floor and then it got pulled from the floor because there weren't enough votes in the House, the second time when it did pass, it passed without a CBO score. It was not scored.  The reason it was not scored was because there was a belief that that very narrow passage in the House would not happen if Republicans and Democrats found out that the bill, as ``revised,'' was actually just as bad.  So the bill that passed the House still took away health insurance from 23 million This is where we are today: a bill that has been crafted in secret but is essentially the same bill.  I have received more than 9,000 calls and letters from constituents who have been very clear that Congress needs to do all it can to protect our seniors, to expand Medicaid, and to defend the gains that have been made over the last 7 years.  And you know what is really ironic about this whole situation is that, if you think about some of the things that Republicans said about the Affordable Care Act when it was being passed--here is a quote.  In 2010, Speaker Paul Ryan said: ``After months of twisting arms, Democratic leaders convinced enough members of their own party to defy the will of the American people and support the Senate health bill which was crafted in secret, behind closed doors.''  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said: ``When it comes to solving problems, Americans want us to listen first, and then, if necessary, offer targeted, step-by-step solutions. Above all, they're tired of a process that shuts them out. They're tired of giant bills negotiated in secret, then jammed through on a party-line vote in the middle of the night.''  That is what Speaker Ryan said and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said when the Affordable Care Act was being debated.  But here is the thing: When the Affordable Care Act was being debated, Democrats actually threw open the doors in They held over 100 Senate hearings. I wasn't here. This is based on actual reports and documents and files from There were over 100 Senate hearings, 25 consecutive days of consideration, and 161 amendments from Many of those amendments were accepted into the bill.  This is a completely different process. We didn't have a single hearing on this bill. The bill came to the House floor, and there was some debate, but it certainly wasn't 100 hearings. It wasn't 25 days of consideration. There weren't 161 amendments. There weren't any amendments that were accepted from Democrats because there was no amendment process.  And now, in the Senate, we are going through the same process where a bill that is about the healthcare of hundreds of millions of Americans across this country is about to come to the floor, and they are not going to accept any amendments, certainly not from the Democratic side. Maybe they will take a few amendments from the Republicans before it comes to the floor. I don't know. We will have to see. But there is no debate on this.  How can we talk about the process of democracy and even of civility and the ability to work together if we didn't offer the other side a chance to weigh in?  This bill will take away health insurance from millions of people, and it will make it less affordable for those who still have insurance because it is not very different from the House bill, and we already know that that is what the House bill does.  It would raise out-of-pocket costs for middle class families with higher[[Page H5103]]deductibles and cost sharing. It would essentially defund Planned Parenthood by blocking people with Medicaid coverage from accessing preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers for birth control, cancer screenings, and STD treatment and testing. And it would cut the essential health benefits protections.  Now, what are the essential health benefits protections? We talk about that phrase, but a lot of Americans don't know exactly what that means. So here is what it means.  It means that if you buy insurance, then you can be assured that that insurance is going to cover certain things. It will cover, for example, hospitalization. It will cover if you get cancer. It will cover some of your treatments that you need for cancer, certain things that are included in that. Mental healthcare is part of that essential health benefits coverage.  That is what it means. Otherwise, an insurance company can sell you something, and it can even say we cover, you know, X, Y, and Z, but when you get to the hospital because you are sick, you will find out that it doesn't actually cover hospitalization.  So this was an attempt to say, there is sort of an essential understanding, an essential set of things that would be covered. We will guarantee you that they will be covered if you buy insurance.  Now, I want to talk about Medicaid for a second, because this is one of the biggest travesties of the bill that is being proposed by the Republicans in the  This bill would literally decimate And between the Medicaid cut of over $800 billion in the healthcare bill in the Senate and the budget cut that is proposed of over $600 billion, let me be clear that we are talking about almost a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid through these two mechanisms.  I want to talk about what Medicaid is because a lot of people might think that Medicaid just covers poor folks, which, frankly, I think we should cover poor folks. Let's be clear about that. But I want to tell you what Medicaid actually covers.  It covers half of all the births in the United It covers insurance for one in five It covers treatment for 220,000 recovering people with drug disorders, including those who suffer from opioid abuse. It covers 1.6 million patients, mostly women, who get cancer screenings, and STD testing. It covers 64 percent of all nursing home residents. It covers 30 percent of all adults with disabilities. It covers 39 percent of all kids in this country and 60 percent of kids with disabilities.  So if you cut half of Medicaid, which is what a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid would include--it would be half of what we spend on Medicaid today--a program that covers 74 million Americans across this country, 38 million Americans would lose their coverage.  No wonder, as Mr.Raskin said, this healthcare bill has had such low approval ratings in the House, and now it is the same bill in the  Americans understand that whether you live in blue America or red America, whether you live in rural America or urban America, whether you are a man or a woman or a child, whether you are young or old, one of the great things about this country is that we are a country that believes in trying to provide for people when they get sick.  Now, we have been trying to do that for a long time, and until the Obama administration and the Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, we weren't doing that. But in Washington State, my home State, when we passed the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion allowed us to cover an additional 600,000 people across our We cut the uninsured rate in half, and we created over 22,000 jobs across the State, including in rural areas.  So what we need to do now is to stop this bill from moving forward because it would be bad for the American people. It is that simple. It is going to kick Grandma out of her nursing home. It is going to stop a kid with asthma from getting an inhaler. It is going to put a premium on being an elder If you are an older American, you are going to pay four to five times as much as anybody else. Why? You just have to ask why.  So who benefits from this bill? This bill is a transfer of wealth from middle class Americans to the wealthiest Americans, corporations in this country. So this is about tax cuts for the richest. Sheldon Adelson, who is a Republican donor, casino magnate, he will get, if the Senate bill passes, he will get a $44 million tax cut in 2017 alone.  How are they paying for that? By cutting Medicaid, taking away protections for preexisting conditions, for seniors, for average  Mr.Speaker, that is just not right.

An investment in clean energy is an investment in American jobs and our future.  The response of this bill?

These cuts cede the future to offshore competitors who are hacking into our intellectual property and the bank accounts of firms involved in these industries hundreds of times a month trying to coopt their energy technology that American taxpayers have helped to develop.  In an era where Wall Street chases short-term quarterly profits and ever-improving earnings reports, we owe it to our constituents and to our progeny to play the long game--making investments that may take decades to pay off, but they will. The longtime horizon in large initial capital investments of the energy sector for America means that, more than any other, path-breaking energy research needs Federal support until it becomes commercially viable because energy research is complex.  Though energy is an overlooked ingredient in economic supremacy, those nations that master its dimensions are leading in economic growth.  For decades, American Presidents have made statements targeting energy independence. That makes national security sense. But this year, that target is finally in sight. A recent Energy Information Administration report expects the United States to be a net energy exporter by 2026. The Department of Energy deserves great credit for bringing us to this point.  Beginning back in the old 1970s and eighties when this all got started, it took 30 years of Department of Energy support in concert with the private sector to unleash the fracking revolution that has helped change our world dramatically. Where was that technology developed? At the Department of Energy, and it didn't happen in a year or 2. It took years. The next revolution will be the clean energy revolution. We must not forfeit that game.  Finally, I would like to raise my concerns over the controversial riders that threaten not only the ultimate enactment of this bill, but also our most precious resource: water. Exempting the repeal of the Clean Water Rule from the Administrative Procedure Act cedes far too much authority to the executive branch and is something that I cannot support.  For that reason, and for the draconian cuts to clean energy, I must urge my colleagues to oppose the Energy and Water portion of this spending package. When those concerns are rolled together with busting the spending caps and building an expensive border wall that doesn't keep us safe or solve our immigration needs, I believe that there is no excuse for any Democrat to support the overall bill before us.

I want to say, with the mark that we have received, we continue to move America forward on energy independence. We know that by 8 or 9 years it is projected that America will finally be exporting more energy than we are importing, and we will be 100 percent energy-efficient and energy-independent here at home.  That is quite an accomplishment thinking back to the period of time in our Nation's history in the last century when we, as a nation, were subjected to rising oil prices because of embargoes, particularly in the Middle East, and we fell into deep recession here in our country back in the 1970s; and subsequent to that, every time gasoline went over $4 a gallon.  So when we consider the Energy and Water bill, I think we all have to pat America on the back for having had consistent enlightened leaders on both sides of the aisle who understood what was important in the Nation's best interests.  So as we consider this bill today--there were particular amendments on subjects that range as far afield as the Soo Locks and the Energy Information Administration, which we will get into in a moment, water projects that are some of the biggest job creators across this country--let's not lose sight of the big frame.  The big frame really is that this is a bill that makes America more secure and that allows us to make progress here at home from coast to coast. All of our ports and all of our water infrastructure that is so vital not just west of the Mississippi, but the Great Lakes region and our coasts, some of the challenges we face in the Everglades, these are issues that all of America cares about, particularly when it is in your own backyard.  This is a really important bill for the country. It is not the largest bill that is considered as part of the appropriations process, but it is one that is extraordinarily important. And, of course, over half of our budget deals with our nuclear weapons complement and making sure that that great asset that we have is maintained, is the finest in the world, and is the best managed. So this subcommittee has quite a jurisdiction from coast to coast.

We have over 300,000 people working in the solar energy field, actually more than work in the coal fields now. Some of those solar companies are in districts that I represent. This is a new industry. Renewables now comprise 10 percent of all the energy that the country produces, and this has been a major accomplishment in just the last few decades.

So we feel a sense of accomplishment tonight as we bring this bill to the floor and we look at the horizons ahead. We know that we have to deal with the other body, we have to compromise out any of our differences, but I have a hunch that we are going to be able to do that very well.  I thank all those who may be listening this evening, particularly those who are working in our National Labs, the finest labs in the world that are inventing the future from coast to coast. Over a dozen and a half of those labs have America's best scientists working on not just energy research, but derivative spinoffs in the commercial sector that eventually benefit the entire country.  As I mentioned, the natural gas discovery that has really been responsible for leading us toward energy independence was made possible by the fracking technology developed over many years at the U.Department of So as you look at gas prices going down at the pump and you look at the competition in the energy industry, we have a lot of people, many unsung heroes across our country in these labs who work tirelessly on behalf of the American people. Some are retired and some are still in place, but we owe them a deep debt of gratitude for serving the American people so nobly.  We are going to have several other amendments that come before us tonight.  Mr.Chairman, I yield to the gentleman if he wishes to make a statement.

Countless American families battle these daily heartbreaks and small injustices with their heads held high.

4631,topic-id,941,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman It is a real honor to be able to co-chair this Special Order hour with the gentleman. The gentleman is one of the most brilliant Members of our body on constitutional issues and constitutional law, really understanding our role in Congress as a check on the executive branch, and I look forward to working with the gentleman. I appreciate Liz Bartolomeo's and my staff's help in organizing this.  Mr.Speaker, I want to echo what Congresswoman Jayapal said about this bill and the impact it is going to have on middle class families and on jobs, because here is one of the things that Congresswoman Jayapal said that folks don't understand: this bill is going to affect almost every family that has someone that goes for eldercare, to a nursing home.  The average cost at a nursing home is about $80,000 a year. Most families can't afford that. Most middle class--most upper middle class families can't afford that.  So what do they do when their savings run out?  Medicare, by the way, doesn't cover nursing home costs. They rely on  What this bill does, in a shocking way, is say: we are going to cut Medicaid funding. Of course, we are going to conveniently cut it starting 7 years from now, coincidentally, after everyone has faced reelection, because we don't want people to know that we are going to cut these programs that they rely on. We are going to start these cuts 7 years from now, and we are going to make sure that people no longer have access to funding to be able to go for eldercare.  Now, here is what is so problematic about this from an economic perspective. One of the biggest job creators, according to McKinsey and according to every economic study, is in healthcare, is for eldercare. Medicaid creates more jobs for working class families and middle class families at a time of globalization and automation than probably any other significant government program.  So not only are we hurting middle class families and the elderly, we are eliminating the very jobs that we ought to be creating at a time of automation. We are eliminating jobs of people who are going to take care of folks who are sick or folks who are elderly, service jobs, jobs that should be paying more.  At the same time, we are coupling this with drastic cuts in a budget for Alzheimer's research and for research on diseases that are affecting middle class families.  Congressman Raskin said what the bill's motivation is. It is to really save money for tax cuts for the well-off--not for the well-off talking about people[[Page H5104]]making 70 grand or 80 grand or $100,000. Those are folks who are going to need We are talking about tax cuts for people who are making over $1 million, over $1.5 million.  Now, let's put aside the President that he said it is mean. Let's just see what is their philosophy. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Why do they want to do this? Because they think that giving these tax cuts to these multimillionaires is going to somehow fuel more entrepreneurship and more growth.  I ask people who are listening to this: Is that the problem in our country? Is that really the issue, that we think millionaires and corporations aren't making enough profits? Is that really what is the issue about why we aren't creating jobs? Or is the issue that, for half this country, their wages have stagnated for the past 30 years, and that people can't afford a decent place to live, college, and healthcare, and they are having trouble getting jobs?  If you believe that the problem is we need more corporate profits, we need more speculation on Wall Street, and we need more economic breaks for the investor class, that that is really what America needs at this moment in our economy, then I suppose you could look for the Republican bill. But if you believe that the real problem in our economy is that the middle class and the working class are getting squeezed by the economic concentration of power, by the excess on Wall Street, that ordinary folks are having a hard time getting jobs, and that what we really need to be doing is providing more jobs in healthcare for people so that they can have a decent middle class life, that what we really need to be doing is providing middle class families with basic economic security so they know that when they retire they will have some dignity for them, or their spouses when they fall sick, that they know that they won't be bankrupt because they have to bear the cost of the care for their parents; if you believe that we ought to be on the side of middle class families--working class families--then it is such a no-brainer that you would oppose this bill.  I will just end with this: People often say, Well, what can we do?  Well, I think you can speak out. I believe you should speak out and hold every Member in this body and in the Senate accountable because this bill is about our fundamental values. It is about what type of country we want to be. Are we going to be a country that gives power to the elite and believes that that is the ticket to American success? Or are we going to bet on middle class families and working class families like we have throughout our history?

5317,topic-id,661,"Mr.President, in celebration of Museum Day on May 18, we reintroduce the ``Artist-Museum Partnership Act.'' This legislation would enable our country to keep cherished art works in the United States and to preserve them in our public institutions. At the same time, this legislation will erase an inequity in our Tax Code that currently serves as a disincentive for artists to donate their works to museums and libraries. Since 2000 I have introduced this same bill in each It was also included in the Senate-passed version of the 2001 tax reconciliation bill, the Senate-passed version of the 2003 Charity Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment, CARE, Act, and the Senate-passed version of the 2005 tax reconciliation bill.  This legislation would preserve cherished art works for the public by allowing artists to take a fair market deduction for works they donate to museums, libraries, colleges and other public institutions. Under current law, artists who donate their created work may only deduct the cost of supplies, while a collector of the same work who donates it to qualified charitable institutions is allowed to take a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the donated work.  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works produced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in the Green Mountain Displaying their creations in museums and libraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters and strengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty, and its cultural heritage. Anyone who has contemplated a painting in a museum or examined an original manuscript or composition and has gained a greater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result, knows the tremendous value of these works. I would like to see more of them, not fewer, preserved in Vermont and across the country.  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a deduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work. Congress changed the law for artists in response to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of the law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Much has changed in the United States since 1969 when the tax law was amended. There has been an explosion of artistic and literary creativity in the country that is valued throughout the world. Yet, since the law was changed, artists now give far less frequently than before, harming the public by denying it the opportunity to see museum-quality contemporary art. The current tax law discriminates against those who choose to make their living as artists and writers. It also undermines the ability of public and cultural institutions, especially those in small and midsized cities and towns, to collect and preserve our Nation's cultural patrimony. With no or meager acquisition budgets, it is impossible for them to compete in the global art market.  A letter from the distinguished Librarian of Congress Emeritus James Billington stated that ``restoration of this tax deduction would vastly benefit their institution's manuscript and music holdings, and remove the single major impediment to developing the Library's graphic arts holdings. The Artist-Museum Partnership Act would once again allow artists who donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or scholarly compositions to be subject to the same new rules that all taxpayers or collectors who donate such works follow.''  This legislation is vital because it reminds us that artists have an important role in the process of engaging communities, and artists are a cultural necessity in the fabric of any community in Vermont or around the world.  The Artist-Museum Partnership Act is supported by such organizations as the Vermont Arts Council, Shelburne Museum, Association of Art Museum Directors, American Alliance of Museums, Americans for the Arts, Dance/USA, League of American Orchestras, National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, National Council for the Traditional Arts, OPERA America, Theatre Communications Group, Local Learning, Artists Rights Society, National Humanities Alliance, College Art Association, and Fractured                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgS3043.txt,1383,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,18.0,July
5318,topic-id,668,"Mr.President, for too long, criminals have exploited loopholes in our gun laws. Congress's failure to properly address this issue has had devastating consequences for families and communities across the country. We have allowed criminals to readily obtain firearms through straw purchasers, trafficking networks, and unregulated gun markets. It is past time for this body to take action.  Today, I am reintroducing bipartisan legislation to close loopholes that allow criminals to obtain firearms through straw purchases and illegal trafficking. I am proud to be joined once again by Senators Collins and The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act would make it a Federal crime to act as a straw purchaser of firearms or to illegally traffic in firearms. It sets forth tough penalties for anyone who transfers a firearm with reasonable cause to believe that the gun will be used in a drug crime, crime of violence, or act of terrorism, or for anyone who smuggles firearms out of the United This legislation would help keep guns out of the hands of those who seek to do us harm.  As the opioid crisis reached epidemic levels throughout the United States--and in Northeastern states like Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine in particular--gun traffickers stood ready to profit. Dealers who cannot pass background checks take advantage of addicts by forcing them to make straw purchases. Passing this gun trafficking bill and closing these loopholes will be a key piece of our response to the opioid crisis in so many of our communities.  This legislation will also be an important tool in preventing terrorist attacks on American soil. Terrorists have increasingly turned to guns to carry out domestic attacks, as they did in San Bernardino, Orlando, and In the case of San Bernardino, the shooters relied on straw purchasing to acquire their deadly weapons. But because straw purchasing is not a Federal crime, prosecutors only charged the straw purchaser with making a false statement--a so called ``paperwork'' offense. I have often heard from law enforcement that current law does not do enough to deter gun traffickers. This legislation answers that call.  I also want to take note of National Police This is a time when we pause to thank our Nation's law enforcement officers for their important work and many sacrifices. Earlier this week, thousands of officers gathered for a candlelight memorial. The names of 143 officers killed in the line of duty during 2016 were added to the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers It is not enough to merely pay tribute to these men and women. They deserve action. A year ago during Police Week, President Obama signed into law my legislation reauthorizing the life-saving Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant That law will ensure that more than 200,000 officers receive protective vests over the next five years.  The legislation that Senator Collins and I introduce today will also help keep our officers and our neighborhoods safe. We must not wait for another national tragedy to address this problem. Only Congress can close these loopholes. I recognize that one piece of legislation cannot prevent all gun violence, but this bill would provide a critical tool to investigate and deter straw purchasers and gun traffickers. That is why it has strong support from groups representing law enforcement officers and prosecutors around the nation, including the Fraternal Order of Police, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National Tactical Officers Association, and National District Attorneys  Like so many Vermonters, I am proud to be a responsible gun owner; and I know that Senator Collins shares my commitment to protecting our Second Amendment rights. But we also share a desire to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals, drug traffickers, and terrorists. There is broad agreement in Congress that our existing gun laws do too little to prevent gun violence in our communities. The legislation we introduce today is an important part of the solution, and I call on all Senators to support this bill and make our communities safer.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition, first, to this terrible rule, but, of course, also in strong support of this amendment to sunset funding for the 2001 AUMF, after 240 days after enactment of this act.  This important amendment would provide Congress plenty of time to do our job and finally have a debate and vote on matters of war and peace.  Mr.Speaker, last week, Republicans unilaterally decided to kill my bipartisan amendment to sunset the 2001 AUMF, which would allow 8 months to debate and vote on a new one before it would be enacted.  This amendment was adopted on a bipartisan basis in the full Appropriations It was stripped out of the bill in the dead of the night, with no debate or vote from the Rules  This undemocratic and underhanded behavior really makes me wonder: What is Speaker Ryan so afraid of?  I came to the Rules Committee this week and asked them to rectify a wrong and allow a debate and a vote on this important measure, and they refused.  I even offered a second amendment, which we have before us today, which would sunset the funding for the 2001 AUMF, 240 days after enactment--that is 8 months--which would allow ample time to debate and vote on any replacement. This would be repeal, but remain in place, allowing 8 months to debate this.  Even though this amendment was germane to the bill, Republicans refused to even allow a debate on this important measure and a vote.  I understand Speaker Ryan has said that it was a mistake to include my original amendment and that it would endanger our national security.  Initially, on June 29, according to press accounts, my colleague and friend, who supported this amendment, Chairman Cole responded and said: It is time for leadership to wake up, and the administration to wake up, and send over a recommended AUMF, mark it up, and take it to the floor. I don't know any other way to get their attention because we have been talking about it for years.  Now, instead of listening to their own party, what do they do? They stripped our bipartisan amendment.  Some Members have said that the funding would be cut immediately with this amendment, but that is furthest from the truth. That is very disingenuous. That would be irresponsible, and I would in no way offer an amendment like that.  It would allow 8 months for Congress to debate and vote on any new  Some have said that this is political, and I say it is just the opposite.  Our brave troops deserve us to come together and do this so they know their country has their back.  I voted for the 2001 authorization because I believed it opened the door for any President to wage endless war without a congressional debate or vote. Quite frankly, unfortunately, history has borne that out.  According to a Congressional Research Service report, the 2001 AUMFs have been used more than 37 times in 14 countries to justify military actions.  This report only examines the unclassified incidents. How many other operations have been conducted without the knowledge of Congress or the American people?  These authorizations have also been used to justify perpetual wars that are thousands of miles away.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

The Financial CHOICE Act makes meaningful reforms that ensure transparency, restore a rule of law, and help consumers and small businesses gain access to the credit they need to move forward towards financial independence, be the entrepreneurs they are, and be able to realize their dreams.  Mr.Chairman, we lose one community bank or credit union a day, as the chairman just mentioned, every day. These are the institutions that lend to families and small businesses across These institutions are the backbone of each of our communities and something that must be done to reverse this dangerous trend of consolidation and closure.  There has been a considerable amount of discussion on both sides of the aisle on the need to help community financial institutions. The legislation we will consider today provides every Member of Congress the opportunity to cast a vote in favor of responsible regulatory relief for credit unions and community banks across the  The Financial CHOICE Act will increase access to credit for consumers by easing rules and regulations that never should have been applied to smaller financial institutions in the first place.  H.10 also makes important reforms to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an unaccountable agency that embodies the Washington-knows-best mentality that the Nation is so tired of seeing and, instead, creates a more responsible framework that actually protects consumers instead of special interests.  The Financial CHOICE Act offers a new model for financial opportunity and responsible regulation. It is time to take steps to remove the boot from the neck of our Nation's lenders and their customers.  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said about the bill that it would have a tremendous stimulative effect on our economy. The Financial CHOICE Act is the right choice to help our communities grow their economies and our citizens realize their dreams.  Mr.Chair, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his unwavering leadership and urge my colleagues to support H.10.

The credit reporting agencies are not required to adhere to any sort of thorough data security standard. Unlike many other industries, the financial services industry has had Federal security requirements in place for nearly 20 years.                              {time}  1515  The amendment sponsor's press release last week said credit reporting agencies do not have any Federal requirements for cybersecurity practices. That is news to the House Banking Services Committee, which has authored some of those requirements. So it simply isn't the case.  Credit reporting agencies are required to adhere to numerous data and consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, along with several Federal rules and standards on data security.  I have some concerns that Congress should not be in the business of dictating specific security methodologies. The multifactor authentication procedures specified in the gentleman's amendment could be right sometimes, even many times, but circumstances, innovation, and the passage of time may indicate otherwise.  As chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, we want to spend some time on trying to look at this issue and hope that the gentleman works with our committee.

This bill basically destroys the work that we did to try to secure the banks after the financial crisis of 2008. It harms consumers, it lets off bad actors, it hamstrings our financial regulators, and I believe it will lead to the next financial crisis.  This bill will destroy the only consumer protection agency in the United States Government by handing over the ability to defund the operation to the people who were committed to opposing its very creation.  It also repeals the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule that simply requires that financial advisers put the interests of its clients first rather than its own.  And finally, it is important to emphasize that the Financial CHOICE Act rolls back the accountability and reporting standards for credit rating agencies, as Gretchen Morgenson discussed in a New York Times ``Fair Game'' column on May 7.

This is a great bill, and that is why I couldn't be more happy than to rise and speak about this bill. For a long time, our veterans have deserved better, and this bill is exactly that: It is better.  Veterans across the board--Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard--they have common experiences and common healthcare challenges as a result of certainly combat, but also as a result of just simply the austere life of being in the military. Whether it is a daily life of jumping out of planes or roping out of helicopters or kicking in doors or jumping off the back end of trucks, you live an austere life.  Oftentimes, I hear people say a year in the military can be like a dog-year. It is tough on you, and that is why the VA is so critical. It is so critical that the VA maintain an expertise in providing for our unique healthcare needs.  I get my healthcare from the I know many VA employees who are hardworking and certainly unyielding in their dedication, but I have also encountered many who are not, plain and simple, many who lack the hunger or who lack the appropriate mentality or the decorum to care for our men and women who are willing to give their last breath in defense of our country. This is the reality.  Every single veteran needs to be treated like the most important patient ever to be seen every single time they walk into the Anything less is a failure.  In the past several years, this bureaucracy of rules, it has obstructed the VA's ability to go out there and fire employees who have been charged with armed robbery, who have been accused of being drunk while performing surgeries, and this simply cannot stand.  There should never be somebody allowed to service our veterans who would receive a dishonorable discharge in the military for what their actions are. They shouldn't be allowed the honor of serving people who served this country in World War II or Korea or Vietnam or Panama, Kosovo, Bosnia, Somalia, the Gulf war, Iraq, Folks shouldn't be given that honor lightly.  It is exactly why this bill, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act is so important. The bill establishes whistleblower protections so that we can ensure veterans get the best possible care and make sure that no veteran is ever dishonored twice by the same person.

4895,topic-id,2004,"Mr.President, call me old-fashioned, but as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I still believe the legislative process matters, especially when you are dealing with matters of life and death, like healthcare.  In 2009 and 2010, we had a painstakingly open, deliberative process while drafting our healthcare reform bill.  In the Senate Finance Committee alone, we held 53 hearings, roundtables, and meetings, consulting with patients, advocates, doctors, and industry leaders.  Only after months of bipartisan negotiations and marathon markups did we bring the healthcare bill to the floor, and when we did, we spent 25 days debating it in full view of the American[[Page S3790]]people. That is how we passed a law that protected Americans withpreexisting conditions. That is how we stopped health insurance companies from dropping consumers the moment they got sick. That is how we passed a law that delivered coverage to 9 out of 10 Americans for the first time in history.  Because when you have an open, deliberative, bipartisan process, you can deliver real progress to millions of But when you have an ugly, partisan, backroom process, you get an ugly, partisan bill. And that is what we have with the Senate Republican healthcare bill.  It is an ugly bill, born out of an ugly process with ugly consequences for the American people.  And you don't have to take my word for it. Just last night, the CBO confirmed that the Republican health bill will leave 15 million more Americans uninsured next year--and 22 million uninsured by 2026.  And mind you, this is the plan that Republicans promised would be so much better than the unpopular, disastrous legislation passed by House Republicans earlier this year.  Well, if Trump thought the House healthcare bill was mean, then the Senate Republican plan is downright nasty.  It is really quite simple. Republicans want to give the 400 wealthiest families in America--the Warren Buffets and Donald Trumps of our society--a huge tax cut they do not need, paid for by taking healthcare away from those who need it the most.  For years, Republicans railed against the Affordable Care Act, and pledged they would repeal and replace it with something better. But under the plan they put out last week, the only people who are better off are millionaires and health insurance company executives.  Across the board, Americans will pay the price. They will pay higher premiums, higher out-of-pocket cost, higher deductibles--all for less comprehensive coverage. That is because the GOP plan still rolls back key consumer safeguards, like protection from lifetime limits and coverage for preexisting conditions.  It still ends the Affordable Care Act's Federal guarantee that every health plan cover essential health benefits, like prescription drugs, prenatal care, hospital stays, and more. It still defunds Planned Parenthood and saddles women with higher costs. It still imposes a crushing age tax on middle-aged  My Republican colleagues like to say that this bill gives Americans more choice over their healthcare. But I have heard from countless New Jerseyans in recent weeks who know that under the Republican health plan, they will have no choice but to go uninsured.  I have heard from older workers, like Howard in Park Ridge,  He writes: Without subsidies provided under the ACA, my 51-year-old wife and I would have no insurance. We could not afford premiums in excess of $1100 a month. . . . Without these subsidies millions will go uninsured and many of these people, myself included, will die.  If all the choices Republicans provide workers like Howard are unaffordable, what good are they? That is not choice. That is a death sentence.  Or consider the half a million low-income New Jerseyans who secured coverage thanks to the ACA's Medicaid expansion.  My Republican colleagues call them ``able-bodied adults.'' But they aren't able to even afford a trip to the doctor under this bill. Many of them have low-wage jobs that don't come with health benefits--dishwashers, cashiers, home health aides. These are the people I grew up with in Union These are the people abandoned by the Republicans' heartless healthcare plan--people like Alton Robinson of Morris He credits Medicaid expansion with saving his life.  Alton struggled with addiction for nearly two decades. Medicaid enabled him to get substance abuse treatment and the physical and mental healthcare.  Today, Alton is clean. His life is on track. And he spends his working days helping other New Jerseyans get on the path to recovery.  Republicans' cruel bill leaves millions of people who rely on Medicaid expansion with no options at all. And for what? To give health insurance executives, real estate moguls, and hedge fund managers a massive tax cut they don't need?  According to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a handful of New Jersey millionaires and corporations get a $15 billion tax cut under this terrible Republican health plan, while over half a million people lose their coverage.  And, of course, this legislation goes far beyond ending Medicaid expansion. It ends Medicaid as we know it.  Their plan fulfills a decades-old right-wing mission to shred the social safety net--forcing the most vulnerable among us to pay for tax cuts for the richest among us.  It has nothing to do with giving States more choice over how to run Because when you slash Medicaid by nearly $800 billion, you leave States with no choice but to provide less care. When you cut Medicaid funding by $60 billion in New Jersey, you leave the State with no choice but to abandon the most vulnerable--people like Leandra, the 13-year-old girl I met last week in She suffers from a rare muscle disease that leaves her confined to a wheelchair, too weak to walk and in extraordinary pain. She takes 18 medications each day. She has survived 19 surgeries.  Leandra can't speak out against this horrible, cruel Republican healthcare bill that would jeopardize her life. But we can. And we must continue to be Leandra's voice until Republicans finally hear her.  That is the kind of process we need when we talk about healthcare--a process that gives voice to the voiceless.  So today I say to Americans everywhere: don't sit on the sidelines. Don't be silenced. Make your voices heard. Tell Republicans what this heartless healthcare plan means for your families and your future.  Mr.President, I have a group of Nordic Parliamentarians I am hosting in a few minutes. Let me say that I join my Senate Finance Committee colleagues in this effort because I still think the legislative process matters, especially when dealing with matters of life and death like healthcare.  To reiterate, in 2009 and 2010, we had a painstakingly open, deliberative process while drafting our healthcare reform bill. In the Senate Finance Committee alone, we held 53 hearings, roundtables, meetings, consulted with patients, advocates, doctors, industry leaders, and only after months of bipartisan negotiations and marathon markups did we bring the healthcare bill to the floor. And when we did, we spent 25 days debating it in full view of the American people. That is how we passed a law that protected Americans with preexisting conditions. That is how we stopped health insurance companies from dropping consumers the moment they got sick. That is how we passed the law that delivered coverage to 9 out of 10 Americans for the first time in history.  When you have an open, deliberative, bipartisan process, you can deliver real progress to millions of Americans, but when you have a backroom, partisan process, you get an ugly, partisan bill, and that is what we have with the Senate Republican healthcare bill. It is an ugly bill in terms of what it does to people, it is born of an ugly process, and it has ugly consequences for the American people.  Just last night, as we all heard, the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan scoring division for all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, said 22 million people will lose their health insurance and 15 million next year if the law were to pass.  Mind you, this was a law that was supposed to be better than the House Republican version. Well, that bill was mean, this bill is downright nasty. It takes healthcare away from those who most need it, only to give tax cuts to the Warren Buffetts and Donald Trumps of the world, who, fortunately for them, don't need it.  It is amazing to me that for years I have heard my Republican colleagues rail against the Affordable Care Act--or as they call it, ObamaCare--and pledge to repeal it and replace it with something better. They had 7 years to come together and decide what that would be, and then, on a plan that was put out only late last week, we see the consequences of something that was rushed together by 13 men, no women, and nobody creating the diversity of America that relates to their[[Page S3791]]healthcare. That is fundamentally wrong, and I am not surprised that many of my Republican colleagues revolted against it--at least at this point. The question is whether they will continue to demand of their party and of all of us the type of healthcare that we want to see for each American, because under the plan as it was proposed, Americans will pay higher premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, higher deductibles, all for less comprehensive coverage--pay more for less.  It rolls back key consumer safeguards. There is a difference between a guarantee--when we hear the word ``entitlement,'' we are really talking about a guarantee against lifetime limits. You have a serious disease, and you come up to that cap in your insurance. You still have the disease, you still have cancer, you are still treating it, you are still fighting it, you are trying to save your life, but you don't have any more money because there is no more insurance coverage. We eliminated that under the law. There is no guarantee of continuing that safety under the Republican bill.  There is no guarantee that when you give States waivers, the way in which they treat those waivers--that you truly have a guarantee against preexisting conditions being a prohibition to getting healthcare.  Finally, if you are middle class and middle aged, this bill gives you nothing. If you are an older American, it costs you enormously.  Let me make my final point about Look, I am tired of hearing about Medicaid being only about the poor, as if the poor don't deserve health insurance. They certainly do. But Medicaid is about a lot more than the poor. In my home State of New Jersey, 60 percent of recipients are either seniors or those who are disabled. They didn't choose to be disabled; they either were born with or developed a disability. They deserve the full potential of their God-given potential, as anybody else does. Medicaid provides them healthcare so they can be a successful part of our society. Medicaid provides seniors with dignity in the twilight of their lives. Medicaid provides for pregnant mothers who may not have insurance elsewhere. Medicaid takes care of special education children in our schools. And, yes, Medicaid takes care of the poor.  Medicaid expansion helps those who go to work in some of the toughest jobs in my State and in our country. They have the dignity of having healthcare and being able to stay healthy so they can work. We want them to work. Yet we take away the healthcare that is the very essence of what keeps them healthy so they can work. That is not the America I know. That is not the healthcare that was promised.  We can do better, and we can do better together. What we need to do is get over the mantra of, let's just repeal the Affordable Care Act instead of improve it. If you want to improve it and improve the healthcare of Americans, you are going to find a lot of Democrats ready to do that, myself included.  With that, I yield the floor.

4900,topic-id,1413,"Mr.President, before I begin, I want to make something absolutely clear. This healthcare fight is anything but over. TrumpCare is not dead--not even close--and we cannot let up. It is no surprise that Senate Republicans needed another week to try to jam their TrumpCare bill through, given everything it would mean for families' health, their financial security, and their lives.  So, while we do not know what kind of backroom deals the Senate Republicans will cut or which Republicans will decide that they care more about toeing the party line than protecting the patients and families in their States, here is what we do know. The majority leader is not going to give up. He wants to get to yes, and so does President Trump, so the backroom deals and arm-twisting are going to go into overdrive starting now.  That is why my message is, to every patient and family, every mom and dad, adult caregiver, doctor, nurse, teacher, anyone who believes TrumpCare would be devastating for their communities: Do not let up the pressure. We saw what happened in the We need to keep fighting, and Democrats are going to keep fighting along with all of you.  One has to ask, given how mean this bill is and how clearly patients and families are rejecting it, why are my Republican colleagues pushing ahead?  It is not like this is some kind of forgone conclusion. At any moment, Republicans can drop this effort and work with Democrats on healthcare policies that will actually help patients and families and not hurt them. Yet it is clear right now that Republican leaders are not interested. In fact, they have done just about everything possible to prevent not just Democrats but anyone, including most of their own party, from being involved in this process.  As Democrats have made clear, this is unprecedented. I was here when the Affordable Care Act was debated and passed. We organized dozens of bipartisan meetings. We held hearings, and we took amendments from both sides. We certainly did not leave the fate of women's healthcare up to a few men.  Yet, with the Republican's TrumpCare plan, there have been no hearings, and there has been no scrutiny, no public input, no expert testimony. Why is that? It is that their bill is not actually about healthcare--far from it. Their bill is about giving a massive gift to the wealthy and the already well-connected on the backs of children, working families, the sick, and the elderly. It is an enormous broken promise, and yesterday's CBO report made that alarmingly clear.  Republican leaders promised to lower healthcare costs. This plan will actually raise them, especially for seniors. They promised not to pull the rug out from under patients, but this plan would take coverage from 24 million people and gut Medicaid with even deeper cuts, by the way, than would the House's version. Under their bill, they said no one would be worse off. Tell that to a woman who would have to pay as much as $1,000 extra for maternity care or who would have to see her local Planned Parenthood center closed. They said their bill would protect patients who have preexisting conditions. Read the fine print. The fine print says, this plan is a backdoor way of putting those patients' fates in the hands of the insurance companies.[[Page S3793]]  This is truly shameful.  Republican leaders promised they were committed to tackling our growing opioid epidemic, but with this plan, all of our efforts--all of the work left to be done by the States--would be at risk. That would be incredibly harmful.  Over the past year, I have met so many families in my home State of Washington who have lost a loved one to the opioid crisis--in Bellingham, in Spokane, in Yakima, in the Tri-Cities--in community after community. I know the same stories are actually being told in West Virginia, in Ohio, in Kentucky, and in Pennsylvania--in States all across our country. I have heard directly from people who are on the path to recovery who have told me how their getting treatment and Medicaid coverage changed their lives for the better.  What will they do under TrumpCare?  I would be ashamed, too, if I had to defend this cruel bill over the upcoming recess. I would be ashamed if I had to explain this bill to constituents of mine like Jennifer  Jennifer is a woman from Kent, She is a mom, a softball coach, and a cancer survivor. Because of coverage she had under the Medicaid expansion, she decided to play it safe and go to the doctor to get a lump checked out, something she told me she would not have done before. Jennifer was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. It was about to spread to her lungs and could have been deadly. Jennifer went through rounds of chemo and trip after trip to the doctor. On March 8--her daughter's 18th birthday--she was finally able to tell her daughter she was in the clear. Now Jennifer is terrified of what this bill would mean for her finances, for her family, and for her life if her Medicaid coverage goes away.  I would be ashamed if I had to defend this bill to Kelly Hill, from  I met Kelly during a recent tour of Seattle's International Community Health Services clinic. Kelly shared with me that she has been living with HIV for 17 years and has a son with a severe developmental disability. Fortunately, Kelly told me she was able to get Medicaid when she needed it the most, in graduate school, when she was first diagnosed and when she was pregnant with her son.  Today, her son Avram is 15 years old and cannot be left unattended. He is going to need expensive care and support for the rest of his life. Medicaid plays a crucial role in keeping Avram active at home, in their community, and it allows Kelly the opportunity to have a full-time job so she can support her family. Kelly knows just how important access to healthcare is and the harm and uncertainty TrumpCare will cause.  I want to be very clear. If Republicans jam through TrumpCare this month, they will own the consequences. They will have to defend this bill to people like Jennifer and Kelly in their own States, and they will be responsible for increasing families' healthcare costs, undermining protections for people with preexisting conditions, defunding Planned Parenthood, and allowing insurance companies to charge women more. They will be responsible for taking away care for seniors, pregnant women, and people with disabilities.  Again, Republican leaders can still choose to drop TrumpCare once and for all. I am not going to take any chances, though, and neither should anyone who is listening who joins Democrats in opposing I fully expect the backroom deals to continue and to get even worse now that Republican leaders have been forced to delay this week's vote. I just hope the Republicans who are rightly concerned about the impact of TrumpCare will take a close look at the facts on the table, will recognize it is time to change course, and will stand strong for their constituents.  That is what this debate should be about, making sure the people whom we represent can count on the security of healthcare when they get sick so they will not have to consider forgoing treatment for a sick child because they do not have the money and so they will be treated fairly and equally in our healthcare system.  That is what I have been thinking about these last several weeks. It is why Democrats have been holding the floor all of these nights, participating in rallies, and staying out on the Capitol steps. It is why my friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii, took to the floor yesterday and bravely talked about what this fight now means to her personally. As she said, everyone is only one diagnosis away from a serious illness, and no one should have to worry about what he will do if and when that moment comes.  In this country, healthcare should be a right, not a privilege reserved for the few. That is what Democrats are going to keep fighting for, and we will not let up.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

5211,topic-id,392,"Mr.Chairman, the previous speaker said: How could a group be so far off in their analysis? Well, they were that far off with the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. Alan Greenspan was certainly off. In his commentary about economic growth, we had the slowest growth since Herbert Hoover was President, based upon $2.3 trillion worth of tax cuts.  So this is analysis. It is an economic forecast. It is not an algorithm. When you pick up the computer, you push a button, and all of a sudden you get a score.  I am in opposition to this amendment because they play a vital role every single day, even when they are not entirely accurate, in keeping a scorecard. Members and staff on both sides, particularly at the Ways and Means Committee, rely much upon their hardworking and nonpartisan analysis for what they do every day.  I have never, in 29 years in this House, said to a member of CBO: Are you a Republican or are you a Democrat?  When we demean professional achievement from economists who try and strive every single day to come up with an accurate forecast, we do this institution no good. We should have a high regard for what these people do every single day--and let me say this, by the way, more accurate than the Office of Management and Budget, in my recollection, who work for Presidents and who, generally, didn't come up[[Page H6414]]with forecasts that Presidents might or might not like.

4933,topic-id,842,"Mr.Speaker, the House Rules Committee met yesterday and reported a rule, House Resolution 478, providing for further consideration of H.3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act of 2018. This legislation includes four individual appropriations bills: Defense, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-Veterans The rule provides for further consideration of H.3219 under a structured rule.  Mr.Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a critical measure that will prioritize funding for important components of our national security. This legislation directs funding for our troops and their families, our Nation's veterans, the legislative branch and United States Capitol Police, border and nuclear security, energy and water infrastructure investments, and vital appropriations to ensure our military has the equipment and readiness necessary to keep the Nation safe.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation is composed of the serious and essential work conducted by the House Appropriations Committee over the past many months. As an appropriator and a member of this committee, I fully appreciate and understand the hard work my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have put in to report these key measures we have before us today.  The most important job we have as Members of Congress is ensuring the safety of our By supporting this rule, we can move the national security package forward.  H.3219 includes a 2.4 percent pay increase for our troops. That is the largest military pay increase in 8 years. It keeps our military on the cutting edge of defense technology by investing in research and development and in equipment and weapons procurement. Under the legislation, we will restore readiness shortfalls and make much-needed critical investments for our troops to address ongoing threats around the globe.  We must provide support for our troops to combat terrorism and defeat With the legislation, we take a major step forward in restoring the devastating cuts our Armed Forces faced under the Obama administration. The bill also increases funding for construction of critical military infrastructure to keep our troops safe and prepared.  The bill also provides for critical safety and enhanced security functions for the United States In light of the recent horrific attack on our colleagues, on staff, and on the Capitol Police, the legislation provides increased funding for the Capitol Police toward increased training, equipment, and technology-related support.  The men and women who guard these hallowed Halls deserve to have access to every resource needed to do their job as safely and as effectively as possible. Under this bill, H.3219, we can ensure that the Capitol Police and House Sergeant at Arms are equipped with these critical enhancements.  Regarding the important Energy and Water provisions included in the bill, the underlying legislation will improve public safety, will create jobs, and will grow our economy by funding the Army Corps of Engineers, prioritizing navigation projects and studies.  H.3219 reduces regulatory red tape, including authorizing the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as well as the Secretary of the Army to withdraw from the devastating waters of the United States rule.  The bill also funds important Department of Energy programs, including nuclear cleanup efforts, such as the Hanford Site, which is located in my district in central Washington State, as well as nuclear weapons programs to strengthen our national security.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation also provides the highest level of funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs in our Nation's history, ensuring that we keep the commitment to those who have defended our It supports vital medical care for our veterans, including mental healthcare services, suicide prevention activities, traumatic brain treatment, opioid abuse prevention, and homeless veteran services.  There are some issues here in Congress that are nonpartisan. Every single one of our colleagues here in the U.House of Representatives believes we must provide the best care possible for our Nation's veterans. I am proud of the significant strides this legislation takes to support veterans across the country.  The rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of a bill that is critically important to keeping our Nation safe.                              {time}  1245  By passing this legislation, we will continue to rebuild our military, ensure we maintain our military superiority, and boost defense efforts in the face of rising global threats.  The bill will aid in supporting our troops and their families, and improve access to care for our veterans. It will increase the safety of the United[[Page H6482]]States Capitol complex for Members and staff who serve here; for constituents, as well as the tourists from around the globe who visit this campus; and for the valued Capitol Police, who protect us all.  It will also aid in important infrastructure and construction investments to move the United States towards energy independence, improve our economic competitiveness, and fund nonproliferation efforts to prevent, counter, and respond to global nuclear threats.  Most importantly, this legislation will make major strides to projects our men and women in uniform serving across the globe who are protecting our freedoms.

The measures included in this rule will provide vital resources for our national defense and for our military infrastructure. As I said, it will boost the pay of our troops, support our military families who sacrifice so much for our country; it will strengthen the care we provide for our veterans and enforce our border security to protect all of the American people.

Why would anybody come to this floor and say: I want to lower the wages for the people I represent? Why would anybody want to do that? We are here to help people raise their local standards of living.  That is what this amendment would do: it would lower the wages for the working conditions of those very men and women that we were elected to serve. It would hurt the local economy, devalue the workers' pay.  Almost 100 years ago, two Republicans, Congressman James Davis and Robert Bacon, realized there was a problem with the Federal Government and contracts. The contracts were unfair to those local economies.

It levels the playing field, ensures workers get paid a fair day's pay for a hard day's work--easy answers, very easy answers.  For my colleagues supporting this amendment, I have a few questions of you.  Do you want the Federal Government to make bad investments?  Do you want to cut those wages for the very people who elected you?  Do you want local workers to suffer, people coming into your town and your community, and cut the wages?  I don't think so. We are not here to lower the standards. We are here to raise the standards.  Speaking of President Trump, guess who used and paid prevailing wage? You have got it. Donald Trump in Atlantic He paid prevailing wages. He didn't have to. He did because he understood he wanted to help the people in that economy build a good product. This is what we are talking about: quality wages to people who go to work each and every day and play hard and work hard, follow the rules.

I firmly believe that the number one constitutional responsibility of Congress is to provide for the common defense of this Nation against all enemies, both domestic and foreign. That commitment, by increasing defense funding and restoring the cuts and budget shortfalls that threaten our military readiness and our ability to project force around the globe, is honored here today.  Our bill also honors those who serve our country in the Armed Forces by giving them a much-deserved 2.4 percent pay raise and making critical investments in equipment and training that help them perform the missions we give them and, most importantly, help them return home safely to their loved ones and their families and communities.

5039,topic-id,617,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act, a bill that would allow the FDA to continue its critical mission of reviewing and approving drugs and medical devices that save lives and improve the quality of life for many  The legislation before us today is the product of compromise and almost 2 years of work between FDA, Congress, industry, and other stakeholders. The FDA Reauthorization Act reauthorizes FDA's medical product user fee agreements, providing FDA with the resources the agency needs to continue its critical public health work and hire the necessary scientists and review staff, and improve the certainty and efficiency of the drug review process.  The sixth reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will maintain current review timelines, modernize the user fee structure, and build on the work of 21st Century Cures Act by investing resources in the development of biomarkers and innovative clinical trial designs.  The fourth reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments includes some important new policies that will help to increase the consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness of drug and medical device reviews.  The bill advances the use of the patient perspective and the risk-benefit assessment of medical devices. It establishes a system utilizing real world data for pre-market approval of new uses and post-market safety monitoring, and it improves presubmission communication with manufacturers in an effort to expedite the review process.  This legislation also reauthorizes two of our newer user fee programs for generics and biosimilars. Both of these programs strive to expedite access to high-quality, lower-cost drugs for American families.  The FDARA will also allow the agency to undertake new initiatives to create a category of over-the-counter hearing aids, advance the development of pediatric cancer treatments, and provide greater assistance and incentives to encourage additional competition for generic drugs.  Since this is a bipartisan compromise--and I want to stress that--as my colleague Mr.Walden said, it really is important and people should take note that this is a major piece of legislation that is being done on a bipartisan basis by our committee. But it does not address every issue that I would have liked. It also includes troublesome language prohibiting the FDA from making the investments the agency needs as part of future user fee agreements. It is important that the FDA maintain a work environment that allows the agency to recruit and retain the world's best and brightest. I am concerned that this final agreement preserves language advanced in the Senate bill that will make it difficult in the future for the FDA to make the investments needed to recruit personnel and meet performance goals set out in the user fee reauthorizations.  This is a concern, again, that was put in by the Senate that I hope we can address in the future. But I do want to stress, at the end of the day, that this final product represents all of the significant discussions and compromises that were made, and, of course, the legislation that is going to be effective is the result of compromise.  I am pleased that we are considering this in a very timely fashion, because, as I mentioned, we don't want the personnel who work at the FDA to be affected; and if we do this in a timely fashion, they won't have to worry about pink slips or their jobs.  Mr.Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.2430 so that we can continue to give the FDA the tools and resources it needs to continue doing the critical work of reviewing and improving lifesaving drugs and medical devices.

4756,topic-id,702,"Mr.Chair, prior to 2010, banks lending to consumers operated with too little oversight and often exploited the lack of rules to turn a profit at any cost. We saw the dire consequences in the 2008 financial crisis. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created to enforce laws and protect consumers in the marketplace. Their mission is to root out deceptive and abusive practices. And so far, the agency has returned $11.8 billion to consumers from enforcement against abusive practices from banks, lenders, and financial companies.  I challenge any member of this body to go to one of their constituents and ask whether or not they would like a consumer watchdog to stand up for them against abuses from big banks, or if they'd like us to leave them to go it alone.  The CFPB has already returned $11.8 billion to more than 29 million consumers. That is $11.8 billion dollars that went back into the pockets of 29 million of our constituents. A vote for this legislation is a vote against those 29 million consumers who have been helped by the CFPB's actions.  In my home state of New Jersey, one resident held a mortgage with Citibank, who failed to report accurately the status of a closed account and incorrectly reported it as late. A complaint was submitted to the CFPB and when they intervened, the issue was resolved and the late mark removed.  Stories like these are not uncommon. Decisions like these can impact a consumer's credit for life and cause tremendous distress. Before the CFPB, consumers facing deceptive practices could go ignored by mega-banks and lending institutions. But when a government agency with enforcement powers gets involved, these banks pay attention. They can't ignore the  When the cards are stacked against the everyday consumer, the need for the CFPB is a no-brainer.  The New York Times this morning reported that the President's pick to oversee the nation's largest banks, Joseph Otting, formerly ran OneWest, which has been criticized for ``robo-signing'' foreclosure documents in the wake of the financial crisis. If Mr.Otting didn't protect consumers when he ran a mortgage lender, why would he protect them as Comptroller of the Currency?  Especially in this Administration, we need an independent consumer watchdog that can act without the influence of politics on behalf of consumers. Some would choose to erode this bulwark of protection against the big banks but it is needed now more than ever. Mr.Chair, this vote is a clear marker of who you stand with: I stand on the side of my constituents in urging a no vote.  Mr.Mr.Chair, In 2008, Wall Street's criminal behavior drove the economy into the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, creating the grossly unbalanced playing field that is our economy today. In response, Congress passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) in 2010. While Dodd-Frank fell short on major banking reforms, I supported it because it was better than no reforms at all.  I am appalled that House Republicans pushed through the Financial CHOICE Act, which would gut major provisions of Dodd-Frank and allow Wall Street to return to the same reckless practices that occurred before the law was passed. The Financial CHOICE Act removes the watchdog from Wall Street, opening the door to destructive trading at the expense of pension funds, value investors, and average  Additionally, those on Wall Street who broke the law and used Americans' investments as a casino should be held accountable for their deceptive actions, including jail time. Yet, to this day, no Wall Street executive has seen jail time for the damage they did on our financial system. Instead, Wall Street executives are being rewarded with powerful jobs in the Trump administration.  It is outrageous that Republicans want to allow the banking sector to return to ``business as usual'' with dangerous financial products and high-speed speculation. We need stronger, not weaker, financial reforms, which is why I'm taking on reckless Wall Street trading with my `Putting Main Street FIRST Act' legislation to discourage speculative trading by imposing a tax of a fraction of a percent on stock, bond, and derivative trades.

That is, it was available until the Dodd-Frank regulation created the  In the Second District of New Mexico, 50 percent of the homes are mobile homes or manufactured housing.

Now, seniors with less income, but people who need the loans the most, have one more source of credit dried up to them.

I thank Mr.Ellison and our ranking member, Congresswoman Waters, for their great leadership on behalf of American consumers, American investors, and American taxpayers.  I rise in opposition to the amendment and to the bill.  Mr.Chair, today House Republicans are pushing a dangerous Wall Street first bill that would drag us right back to the days of the Great Eight years ago, unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited a financial meltdown that devastated families in every State in the Union: hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs every month, and the unemployment rate soared to 10 percent; more than 11 million Americans lost their homes through foreclosure; $13 trillion in wealth, including families' hard-earned retirement savings and college savings, was destroyed.  On the night of Thursday, September 18, 2008, the Treasury Secretary came to the Capitol for an emergency meeting with congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans from the House and the Senate, to inform us of the financial meltdown. Secretary Paulson described the financial meltdown, which was horrific.

But with this bill, the Republicans will undo these safeguards, eviscerate the Consumer Bureau, and take our country back to the days of massive taxpayer bailouts. We cannot let that happen.  Our Republican colleagues have named this dreadful and dangerous legislation, this Wall Street-first legislation, the Financial CHOICE The Financial CHOICE Act to prey on investors, to prey on consumers, to prey on taxpayers. That is the choice they want to give the financial institutions.  But let's look at the appalling choices it represents. Instead of protecting consumers, Republicans choose to help those who try to cheat consumers. Instead of protecting seniors, Republicans choose to help those who prey on retirement savings. Instead of protecting men and women in uniform, Republicans choose to help those who take advantage of our servicemembers' families while our heroes are defending our freedom on the battlefield. Instead of advancing an economy that works for everyone, Republicans choose to help the special interests get richer and to stick working people with a bill for a bailout when it goes wrong.  They have always been handmaidens of the special interests. We know that. But even for them, when we think we have seen it all, this really takes them to a new low.  So they call it the Financial CHOICE Act, but these are not the choices that the American people want. They are choices of the Republican Party that puts Wall Street first, that are handmaidens of special interests.  So while Director Comey testified in the Senate earlier today, on this side of the Capitol, House Republicans are feeding working families to the wolves on Wall  As I said, I don't paint all on Wall Street with the same brush. The pervasive incentives baked into the Republican bill will enable the predatory to punish the honest.  Now, here we go. Think of it. We have a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 29 million Americans benefitting from $12 billion in compensation. Oh, they don't like that. They want to do away with that.  The Volcker Rule, which would prevent the financial institutions from taking risk at taxpayers' expense, the classic Republican: privatize the gain, nationalize the risk. If we win, the private sector and these banks benefit. If we lose, the taxpayer pays the tab.

5149,topic-id,733,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, for yielding, and more importantly, for her great leadership to advance the values of our country in allocation of resources. And I always admire the work of Mr.Frelinghuysen, our distinguished chairman, as well. We may have a matter of disagreement here today, though.  Mr.Chair, all of us, Members of Congress, all elected officials, people who serve in any office, take a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution, and that is an oath to protect the American people.  Democrats, indeed all Americans, believe in a strong national defense. We believe in strong investments in our defense and in our brave men and women in uniform, in particular.  But far from strengthening our security, the falsely inflated numbers in this spending bill will create uncertainty for our military and hollow out America's communities at home.  We face serious threats in the world. We know that. Those threats demand serious consideration in We should be making serious decisions about our national security mission. What is our mission? What are the resources that we need?  We don't want to spend more than we need, but we don't want to spend less, and we should not be posturing in the Defense bill with false numbers and no real answers about the mission that these dollars would fund.  We do not give certainty to our defense or confidence to our troops when we legislate with phony numbers when we refuse to make honest choices about our Defense budget.  Instead of giving certainty to our heroes in uniform, this bill would breach the sequester spending limit by more than $70 billion, forcing a mandatory 13 percent cut to all Defense accounts.  These phony numbers in this bill not only do violence to our Defense budget, they starve the strength of America by ransacking our domestic investments.  In order to be the strongest possible America, we must measure our strength not only in our military might, but in the health, education, and well-being of the American people.  And that is what the problem is, that we are stealing from the domestic budget with phony numbers for the Defense budget, which will be because of the sequester cut to the Defense accounts by 13 percent as we starve our domestic investments.  Besides the direct danger this bill poses to our military, it is laden with poison pills. It would squander billions of taxpayer dollars on President Trump's immoral, ineffective, and expensive border wall.  The President said, during the campaign, he said: ``I promise a wall.'' He promised a wall that Mexico would pay for. He said it would cost $4 billion to $6 billion. The fact is it could cost as much as $30 billion, $40 billion, and he wants a down payment for that wall in this bill--one poison pill.  It also eliminates ARPA-E, the advanced energy research vital to our energy independence and to our national security to keep America the innovation superpower of the 21st century.  Democrats will continue to demand real leadership to strengthen our national defense.  Mr.Chair, on this day, July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman signed the executive order desegregating the U.military. How great that was for How great it is for our country to benefit from the service of so many people who had been serving all along but now with dignity and respect, which was justified.  So how sad it is on this same day that the President of the United States, 69 years ago, recognized the value of respecting our men and women in uniform, that the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, fired 15,000 courageous men and women in uniform in a vile, hateful tweet. His actions regarding transgenders in the military were unworthy of their bravery and unworthy of the American people.  Let us be thankful for the blessings of all of our men and women in uniform, our veterans who have served us, and our military families to whom we owe so much. Their courage, their service and leadership, and their sacrifice are what truly makes us the land of the free and the home of the brave, and it insists that we be serious and real and evidence-based as we make decisions about how we invest in the security of our country.

5202,topic-id,630,"Mr.Chairman, our Nation is $20 trillion in debt, and there might be $100 trillion or $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities. I am not sure we really know what the answer is there. But we have got to find a way to reduce our spending and make sure that the things we are paying for are worthy and that we are getting something--we are actually getting what we are paying for.  I am offering an amendment to H.3219 to reduce the appropriations to the Congressional Budget Office by 50.4 percent.  We all know and agree the Congressional Budget Office is tasked with determining the budget and economic impacts of proposed legislation which are critical to our everyday decisions. Oftentimes, they are late, and, unfortunately, too often they are woefully incorrect.  I don't mean to impugn the fine people who work at the CBO, but something is amiss. If we keep on accepting it, how are we ever going to get our policy right?  The CBO's fiscal analysis is consistently incorrect, and, as a result, has detrimental implications on a variety of policies.  This amendment reduces the CBO's fiscal year '18 appropriations by 50.4 percent which just happens to be the exact same percentage that the CBO was off when it predicted the enrollment numbers for the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2016.  In 2010, the CBO projected that 21 million people would enroll in the exchange plans by 2016. The actual enrollment was about 10.4 million people. That is an error of 50.4 percent, Mr. Now, maybe the CBO's projections would have improved as the ACA continued to take shape after 2010, and that seems reasonable. That is not correct. That is wrong. It didn't improve. Four years later, the CBO predicted that, from 2016, between 23 and 25 million people would receive coverage through the exchanges. In 2014, the updated CBO analysis projected that 24 million people would receive coverage through the exchange in 2016. However, the actual 2016 enrollment in the ACA exchanges was 10.4 million people.  So it is less than half. They always predict about twice as much, or costs twice as much, and the numbers always seem to be half as much. That is a big deal.  We passed the American Health Care Act in here, and I went to my townhall, and CBO is saying: well, 23 to 24 million people are going to lose their insurance because of the American Health Care  Well, yes, if you use the CBO's numbers which based the analysis on what they projected.  They don't even look at reality. We have got the reality right now. The reality is 10.4 million people, not 23 and 25 million--10.4. But that is how they view this thing, and that is what we vote on here. That is a problem.[[Page H6412]]  I also want to highlight the failure of the CBO to forecast the cost of the Medicaid expansion. In 2013, the CBO projected that 34 million people would be on Medicaid or CHIP in 2016; however, in 2016, the CBO doubled, once again, they doubled their earlier estimates to 68 million people.  I mean, who gets to be off by that much and still receive--it is not like there is no accountability; there isn't any accountability, Mr. As a result, in March of 2016, the CBO increased its projection of Federal spending for Medicaid by $146 billion. These are figures that we make decisions on around here.  Mr.Chairman, the CBO simply must be held accountable for its consistent failure to accurately or even reasonably predict budget and economic impacts of legislation. CBO is a critical contribution to our discussion and decisionmaking. We simply need to be able to depend on it as such.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

This is a solemn oath that we all have to honor. It is critically important. I will tell you, Mr.Speaker, in the State of Maine, we have about 125,000 veterans, and we love our veterans. We understand what it is like to fight for our freedom and to stand up for our way of life.  In the State of Maine, we have Togus Medical Center, which is the first veterans hospital in the country, about 150 years old. We understand this.

A few years ago, we learned that some of the folks at the veterans facility in Phoenix, Arizona, were cooking the scheduling books in order to get paid more money through a bonus program when, in fact, they did not and had not scheduled mental health appointments for some of our veterans who were at risk, and, as a result, a number of those veterans died.

Several of them will be joining me tonight to discuss what is going on in the Senate today with the GOP finally unveiling their closely guarded secret plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a plan they are unveiling that has had the legislative benefit of no hearings, no witnesses, no expert testimony, no testimony by the public, and, again, no Congressional Budget Office score so far, which is the same way that the legislation passed out of the House side.  So does all of this sound familiar? It should, because this is the same clandestine, in-the-dark process that led to the plan which emerged here in the House of Representatives on the barest of margins with every manner of power play and power ploy engaged by leadership to produce the final result.  That bill, by the way, now stands at a whopping 9 percent in the polls, which means it is even more unpopular than Congress itself. And even though my friends across the aisle rented buses and vans to take them over to the White House to go and celebrate and exult in their dubious victory and uncork the champagne and drink beer with the President and his staff after they pushed the bill through the House, today, President Trump now calls the bill that he celebrated and he campaigned for mean. He says it is a mean bill today.  And there is no question he is right about that. We said that at the time, mean as a rattlesnake, that bill, which would have thrown 24 million people off their health insurance plans and destroyed preexisting health insurance coverage for people with preexisting health conditions.  The Senate version, though, is just as mean. It is downright mean. It may even be meaner than the House version. It not only strips health insurance coverage from tens of millions of our fellow American citizens; it not only forces American families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, increasing out-of-pocket costs, all to pay for a tax cut for the wealthiest of our citizens; it forces Americans, ages 50 to 64, to pay premiums five times higher than everyone else, no matter how healthy you are.  That is right. If you are in the age bracket of 50 to 64, your premiums, under their bill, will be five times higher than everybody else in the population, no matter how healthy you are. It reduces the life of the Medicare trust fund and robs funds that seniors depend on to get the long-term care that they need. It blocked grants, Medicaid to the States, and then, astonishingly, for the first time ever, places a per capita cap on Medicaid payments for all recipients, including disabled Americans and senior citizens.  That is just unconscionable. Think about it. For the first time ever, under Medicaid, the Federal Government would not commit to pay for all of enrollees' health bills. So if your illness or your injuries are too severe or too complicated, your treatment too long, tough luck for you, buddy; you are on your own, That is the new proposal that is coming out from the Senate today.

4634,topic-id,2972,"Mr.Speaker, I want to pause from our analysis of the specific terms of the bill that was unveiled today to ask the question: What is the value that is really at stake in healthcare policy in the United States?  When we were debating on the House side, I heard a colleague get up on the floor and say something to the effect of: Under ObamaCare, under the Affordable Care Act, healthy people are having to pay insurance to take care of sick people.  It took a second for that to register with me. Then I turned to the person I was sitting next to and said: Yes, that is what insurance is. The whole point of insurance is that all of us pay money in, knowing that people get sick in the course of life.  We hope that we are not going to be one of them. We hope we won't get injured. We hope we won't get sick or ill or come down with a terrible disease, God forbid, but we know it can happen, so we all pay in. When it does happen to some people, that is what insurance is for. So the value there is one of solidarity among everybody together.  In the richest country on Earth, at its richest moment in our history, there is another value at stake here, which is the value of justice.  Forgive me, but I want to speak personally for a moment here, because I have what we call a preexisting condition. So this issue of preexisting condition coverage is important to me and my family. I understand it is important for tens of millions of families across the country.  If you are having a great day, and you have got not one, but two jobs you love--I have been a professor of constitutional law at American University for 27 years now, and I was serving in the Maryland But if you wake up and it is a beautiful day and you have got two jobs you love, a family you love, great kids, and constituents you are committed to, and a doctor tells you that you have got stage III colon cancer, that is what I immediately took to be a misfortune.  It is a terrible misfortune, but we have to remember that it happens to people across the country, all over the world, every single day, where people get a diagnosis of colon cancer, lung cancer, Alzheimer's disease, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, you name it. It is a misfortune because it can happen to anybody.  But if you are told that you have colon cancer, for example, and if you can't get health insurance because, for example, before marriage equality, if you loved the wrong person and you couldn't get health insurance through your spouse, or if you can't get health insurance because you lost your job and you are without health insurance, or if you are too poor to afford it, that is not just a misfortune. That is an injustice.  We can do something about that. Life is hard enough with all of the illness, sickness, accidents, and injuries that people receive without government compounding all of the misfortune with injustice. Life is hard enough without government doing the wrong thing. So the Affordable Care Act added more than 20 million Americans to the rolls of people who have health insurance.  The bill that came out of the Senate today wants to strip health insurance from tens of millions of Americans and jack up everybody's premiums and make healthcare more inaccessible for people. They want to compound the normal difficulties and misfortunes of life with the injustice of distributing healthcare in a radically unequal and unjust way.  We can't go back. It is too late for that. The great Tom Payne once said that it is impossible to make people un-think their thoughts or un-know their knowledge. We have come too far as a country to turn the clock back.  I know there are people on the Senate side, like Rand Paul, who I saw on TV speaking about this, who think we should get rid of all forms of public attempts to get people health insurance. Rand Paul takes a perfectly principled position. He says the government shouldn't be involved at all. I don't know how he feels about Medicare or He certainly hates the Affordable Care He just wants to outright repeal it, which is what the GOP said they would do.  So he is going to vote against that bill because it keeps the remnants of the system that we voted in with the Affordable Care I understand that. I understand his position. I disagree with it completely because I think, as Americans, we have got to have solidarity with each other and we have got to take care of each other through insurance because the misfortunes of life can happen to anybody. So we have got to stand together.  He says that is not part of the social contract. That is fine. I get it. But what I don't understand is people are saying: Well, we said we would just get rid of it, but we will get rid of some parts of it. We will throw millions of people off their health insurance. We will make insurance more expensive for everybody. We will cut the heart out of  Why? What is the public policy that is being advanced here?  It doesn't make any sense. Countries all over the world have arrived at the point of universal single-payer plans, like in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and The countries that can afford it overwhelmingly have said: healthcare for everyone.  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of a bill, which is proudly cosponsored by a majority of the people in the Democratic It is Congressman Conyers' Medicare for All bill.  I think that is where we need to go. I am convinced we are going to get there sooner rather than later. Winston Churchill once said: You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, once they have tried everything else first.  We have tried some other stuff in between, but we are on the way to taking public responsibility for the healthcare of our people. My healthcare is connected to your healthcare because my health is connected to your health. We want the families whose kids go to school with our kids to be in a relationship with a primary care doctor. We want them to get their shots. We don't want them coming to school sick.  Public health dictates that everybody be in the system. A lot of young men, for example, think that they are too tough to go see doctors. That becomes a danger for everybody else. We need everybody to be in a relationship with a doctor. We owe that not just to ourselves and our families, but we owe it to everybody.  Everybody in the system, everybody covered. That is where America needs to go. But understand that what is coming out of the Senate has nothing to do with that. The Senate plan is all about rolling back the progress that we made under the Affordable Care Act, like the ban on throwing people off of healthcare because they have a preexisting condition or denying people insurance in the first place because they have a preexisting condition.  The fact that someone has got a preexisting health condition is the reason that they need health insurance. It is not a reason to deny them health insurance. What they are doing is perfectly backwards.  The Affordable Care Act also said that young people could stay on their family's plan until age 26. Thank God we have had that provision. Even the GOP doesn't want to mess with that, at this point. We got millions of people into relationships with doctors. We could show you dozens of emails and letters and calls that we are getting from people who say: The Affordable Care Act saved my life. I would have had no access to healthcare without it.  The whole idea of turning the clock back and moving in the opposite direction is completely antithetical to the direction of American history. We are moving forward. We want universal coverage for everybody.  By the way, we spend more on healthcare than most of those countries that have single-payer healthcare. I think we may spend more than anybody else on Earth on healthcare, but[[Page H5106]]we don't get the best results because we leave so many people out and we are spending lots of money on insurance. The last I looked, it was around 30 or 31 cents on the dollar we are spending on the insurance companies, on bureaucracy and red tape, instead of getting people healthcare.  That is the direction we need to be moving in, not dismantling and savaging the healthcare protections that we have in place right now.  I want to close with some thoughts just about the process that is going on. Back when the Affordable Care Act was being debated, my dear friends across the aisle complained about how fast things were going and how they thought the legislation was being rushed.  I don't want to embarrass anybody by calling out specific statements made, but we have got voluminous statements made by people on the other side of the aisle saying: This is too fast. You're trying to sneak it through. You're trying to ram it down the throats of the American people. All of this is happening too fast.  Well, Mr.Speaker, the debate over the Affordable Care Act spanned more than 12 months. It took more than a year. The Senate bill was unveiled today with no hearings, no witnesses, no professional testimony, no opportunity for the public to testify for nurses or doctors or patient advocates or any of the groups that are interested; none of them.  In the Affordable Care Act, there were 79 hearings that I was able to find in That is 79 hearings. Not zero hearings, which is what they are proposing to do now. There were 79 hearings. There were 181 witnesses, both expert witnesses and ordinary citizens, who came to testify before Congress, in public. So far, there has been zero testimony on what the ramifications and consequences are of the bill that was unveiled in the Senate today.  We had multiple Congressional Budget Office scores that analyzed the costs and the impact of different proposals that were part of the By contrast, the House was forced to vote on the GOP healthcare repeal plan in this body with no CBO score at all, no estimate on how much the bill would cost the taxpayers, no estimate on how many Americans precisely would lose their health insurance. We have learned later the CBO estimate of $23 million, but that was after we voted on it.  So the people who were saying that the debate moved too fast back then--a year of debate, with dozens of hearings and witnesses, and so on--now seem perfectly content with a process where a bill comes out on Thursday, and then they are going to vote on it next Thursday with no hearings, very little public debate, no opportunity for people to come and testify, and no real opportunity for the public to process what is going on.  What is the urgency?  If it is such a great bill, then we should be out trumpeting it and advertising it. And everybody should have at least one townhall meeting back in their congressional districts to explain how they feel about it so that everybody's constituents can ask us about the bill.  Is it going to improve America's healthcare? Is it going to improve the health and well-being of the people, or reduce the health and well-being of the American people? Is it going to drive our premiums, copays, and deductibles even more?  Those are questions we should have to face with our constituents.  Regardless of what your political party or ideology is, everybody should tell their Member of Congress: At the very least, let's have some public discussion about it. Let's have the opportunity for townhall meetings across the country before we completely rewrite the healthcare plan for the American people.                              {time}  1815  I urge my colleagues to slow down, take a step back, and work across the aisle for the best possible results. There are things we can do together to help.  For example, I heard the President of the United States come to our body and make a speech in which he said that prescription drug prices were out of control and we needed to give government the authority to negotiate lower drug prices. I agree 100 percent with the President of the United States about that.  There has been no action on that by my friends across the aisle in the House or in the Senate, and I beseech the President of the United States, before you advance 1 centimeter further on this extremely controversial bill, which I understand four Republican Senators have already announced their opposition to today, before you go any further on this, let's get to something we can agree on for once. Let's find the common ground. And the common ground has got to be prescription drug prices are out of control for  Let us give the government the authority to negotiate for lower drug prices in Medicare the way that we have got it for VA benefits or for Medicaid prescription drugs. We have got that authority, but there was a special interest provision slipped into Medicare part D, and the government doesn't have that authority. That is authority we should have.  Mr.President, we agree with you about that. Why don't you put a pause on trying to demolish the ACA and Medicaid, and let's see if we can get some prescription drug legislation that will bring prices down for all We are ready to work with you on that.  There are reports that there is some effort to come up with a phony plan on prescription drug prices that wouldn't actually give the government the authority to negotiate lower prices. I hope that is not true, but let's have a real plan to bring people's prescription drug prices down.  There are things we can do together across the aisle. In fact, the President of the United States said repeatedly during the campaign that his plan would be a magnificent plan that would cover everybody. He said everybody would be part of it. And a lot of people, including me, took him to be invoking the single-payer universal health plans that work all over the world, that work in Canada and that work throughout Europe and so on.  Mr.Speaker, let me ask, would it be possible for us to get together with the President in order to come up with a single-payer plan, the kind that he invoked over the course of the campaign? Let's seize upon the new spirit of civility and community in this body and in Congress to come up with plans that bring us together, that don't drive us apart.  The plan that passed out of the House of Representatives is standing at 9 percent in the public opinion polls. I can't imagine that the Senate plan is going to be any more popular. If this was a mean plan, as the President said, the Senate plan looks meaner, or at least as mean as the House plan is.  But even if you doubled it and said 18 percent of the people would support it, that is still a tiny fraction of the American people. The overwhelming majority of Americans are not sold on this idea of turning the clock back and throwing millions of people off their health insurance plans.  Let us work together, and we can do it. In the societies that have universal health coverage, it is accepted now by people across the political spectrum. If you go to France or the United Kingdom or Canada, the conservatives are not agitating to throw people off of healthcare. The conservatives support a universal payer plan. And there are lots of conservative arguments for it.  For example, let's liberate our businesses, especially our small businesses, from the burden of having to figure out people's healthcare. Let's take that completely off of the business sector, and let's make that a public responsibility the way they have done in so many countries around the world. Wouldn't that be good for business? And doesn't it enhance feelings of community, solidarity, and patriotism for everybody to be covered by the healthcare system of the country that they live in?  We can do this as We are the wealthiest country that has ever existed. This is the wealthiest moment in our history. Let's come up with a real plan for health coverage that eliminates as much insurance bureaucracy and waste as possible and gets people the healthcare coverage that they need.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank you for the opportunity to have this Special[[Page H5107]]Order hour on behalf of the Progressive Caucus, which has advanced the Medicare for All plan, and I encourage everybody to check it out.  But in any event, we are not retreating 1 inch from defending the Affordable Care Act and the progress that has been made under it, and I hope that we will have maximum transparency and scrutiny of what came out of the Senate today, because we think that the only possible outcome is that bill will go down; then we can come together, find the commonsense solutions, find the common ground, and make progress for the American people.  Mr.Speaker, thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5101.txt,99999999999999,FINANCIAL CHOICE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,July

Although the Depot community has weathered a lot of changes over the years, their commitment to mission has always remained the same. On the placards inside each vehicle there are the words: ``We build it as if our lives depend on it. Theirs do.''  The Red River Army Depot is a vital job creator for northeast Texas and my district, and it is a critical component to our national defense. And as we continue our constitutional obligation to appropriate money, we have to be careful stewards of taxpayer dollars, and focus our limited resources on addressing the critical national security objectives and military readiness.  Having another round of BRAC, Mr.Chairman, won't help us achieve this goal. According to the Government Accountability Office, the last round of BRAC in 2005 actually cost the American taxpayers $35.1 billion, which is 67 percent more than the original cost estimate. At the same time, the expected savings from the last round of BRAC have been reduced by 73 percent.  Starting another BRAC would weaken our capabilities, and it would increase our vulnerability in the face of critical threats that face this Nation right now.

5106,topic-id,437,"Mr.President, today I would like to highlight the innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit that is found all across my home State of Every month, I recognize a small business owner from one of our Idaho communities who embodies the spirit of innovation and determination in delivering a product or service that makes a substantial difference in the lives of many The small business that I would like to highlight this month has done just that by having an outsized influence on the microelectronic and lighting industries. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Rohinni as the Small Business of the Month for July 2017.  The future is bright for this Coeur d'Alene based technology startup. Rohinni develops and manufactures LED lighting products. Described as ``the World's Thinnest LED lighting,'' they allow light to be printed in any shape, on any surface, and for any need. The company's products have already been applied in many different fields, including transportation and consumer electronics.  Cofounders Cody Peterson and Andy Huska first worked together creating advanced force-sensing capacitive membrane switches, touchpads, and touchscreens for the Pacinian Corporation, which Mr.Peterson founded. With their extensive experience and background in innovative technology products, they began with a new, clever concept: Using a thin slice of conductive material, they were able to disperse thousands of micro-LED diodes to create glowing surfaces. With this new direction, Rohinni was born in 2013. After further developing this innovative technique and obtaining 44 patents, including one for the world's thinnest keyboard, Cody and Andy mastered micro-LED placement. With the help of some crucial venture capital investments 2 years later, the cofounders turned their idea into a successful company and have even expanded with a branch office in Austin, Their new technology has been successfully used in many products, including fabric, television displays, mobile devices, and automotive displays.  Rohinni's creative efforts have been recognized by several business and trade publications. As one of the founders of the Semiconductor Caucus, I recognize the importance that these emerging technologies have on the advancement of our Nation's scientific progress, as we continue to move towards manufacturing products that are simpler in design, more efficient, lighter in weight, and smaller in size. The innovation displayed by companies like Rohinni help to preserve our global competitive edge in the electronic, semiconductor, and memory industries.  It is my honor to recognize Cody Peterson and Andy Huska and the employees of Rohinni who have made lasting contributions to the electronics industry. You make our State proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgS4109-3.txt,1896,FINANCIAL CHOICE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,20.0,July
4690,topic-id,239,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of the Financial CHOICE Act, a bill that will provide the much-needed relief from the harmful, complex, and excessive regulatory environment created by the Dodd-Frank  In the 7 years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, our Nation has suffered from anemic economic growth, increasingly limited financial choices for consumers, and an unprecedented level of job-killing regulations. All the while, big banks have grown larger, and small banks and credit unions have suffered. In fact, community banks are closing at the rate of one per day.  Many of my constituents in small and rural towns in the Tampa Bay area rely heavily on their community banks for financial services. When those banks are forced to close their doors or raise their fees due to excessive regulation, my constituents lose access to essential services and opportunities.

The Financial CHOICE Act represents an alternative and effective approach to financial regulation, which will protect taxpayers and bank bailouts, empower investors, and hold government bureaucracies accountable.

5021,topic-id,4198,"Mr.Speaker, Solomon, who was often noted as the wisest man in the world, said: ``A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.''  If you were to ask the average American citizen would they like their elected officials to come to Washington and to work together, they would all say: Of course. They should. That is what we elect them for.  Yet, often in our history, we see emotions override the mouth and we raise our voices, distrust builds, isolation results, we don't get to know each other, we don't get to work with one another. As we isolate, then a distrust builds, and with distrust, then we don't want to hear what either side has to say. Ultimately, when we can no longer exchange ideas with a deliberateness, then we fall short.  Solomon also said in Ecclesiastes: ``Two are better than one, for they have a good reward for their labor, for if the one fall, the other will lift up,'' and ``A three-fold cord is not quickly broken.''  As we look at our mottoes and our institutions, we have a phrase: ``Out of many, one.''  That phrase is not: Out of one idea, let's create many.  It is just the opposite.  One thing that I learned in my time as a soldier in negotiating and dealing with people groups that literally could not agree, to the point that they were shelling and killing each other and each other's women and children in their villages as they burned, that even in situations like that, they could find some overlapping circles and some common ground in between.  The events of the past week are a reminder not just to Members of Congress, who oftentimes we do know each other, we do work with one another, we do serve on committees with one another. We take great pride in developing those relationships despite our differences, but we have an obligation, because, as a constitutional representative republic, we are a reflection of the people that send us here.  It is important that the lawmakers that the American people send to Washington to do that work be those that are willing to accommodate, that are willing to assimilate the things that we agree on, because if we can't accommodate and we can't assimilate--as I have viewed in war-torn battlefields in several different places through a career as an infantry soldier, if you can no longer accommodate or be willing to assimilate certain agreed ideas, then you are left with the third choice, which is elimination.  The United States has never had that as its pretext. We got close once in a period from about 1820 to 1860. We have faced tough times before and come together. I would hope, Mr.Speaker, that not just our body, as we take and deem these responsibilities with a lot of conviction, but that the American people would take their responsibility to be mindful of the words of Solomon: ``A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.''  Our country is bigger than any of us. When we leave it, God willing, it will continue on. And the words that are said in this Chamber, although recorded, few read. As time passes and as we govern our lives and go about our business, we have to remember the very principles that brought us together as a nation and that I nearly gave my life for in defense.  So my hope is, as we move in the coming days and weeks, that we will work on the things where the circles overlap and we will not negotiate the nonnegotiables. If we just focus on those things, we will have more than enough work to do to actually get stuff done.                              {time}  1130  As a message to the American people: accommodate, listen, dialogue, be kind, and be patient. I have seen the worst thing that human beings can do to one another in my lifetime. I have watched friends die on a battlefield. I have had to take human life. I have seen horrible and horrific things that no human being should ever do. But we are not in that place. We live in freedom. We live in great enjoyment of prosperity where our ideas, our work--the sweat of our brow--can go, and we can put it to good use with great liberty. We have to tone it down.  We have to be willing to put others before ourselves and to listen. I pledge to do that as a Member, one of 435 here. I hope the American people will pledge to be as committed to the United States as we all must be if we are to secure the future for our children and grandchildren.  One of the things that we often all agree on is efficiency in government--to turn the tone and the topic of the conversation a little bit in a different direction. Efficiency in government--nothing makes us more sad and disappointed than to see hard-earned tax dollars wasted by inefficiency.  In my home State of Oklahoma, for every million dollars the government wastes, we have to have 96 Oklahomans work all year long to pay all of their taxes so that we can waste it. I have often highlighted these wasteful measures in a series called ``Waste Watch.'' We just released ``Waste Watch'' number 7 where we, sadly, highlight over $50 billion worth of waste in just one item and a total of $70 billion worth of waste on a single topic. That is something that we all care about and that we all want to pay with our taxes. That is education.  For years, Americans have been paying more and getting less from our educational system. Over the past decade, national high school student proficiency test scores in math have consistently met the minimum or were below. Reading scores for high school students, over the past 20 years, have been consistently substandard with a continued downward trend.  As test scores remain low, available funding for education is often wasted. The solution is not simply to spend more on education without correcting the habits where the waste can occur. We need to spend our dollars wisely by eliminating educational waste, as well as many other forms of waste in government, and push those dollars where they actually count--to our teachers and to our classrooms.  Additionally, we have to change the perception that more money spent always equals a better outcome. If that were the case, we would be the most efficient government on the planet.  It is my hope to create motivation to protect taxpayers and assist in educating America's children with the resources available. It is not enough to point out the problems. That is easy. Anyone can be a cynic and a critic. But we must work together to fix them so that we can make our Nation stronger. Education is vital to our children and to our future.  What are some of these things that we are talking about? Well, how about this one: researchers at the esteemed Harvard University spent $3 million to study if people were able to smell an unpleasant odor in their urine after eating asparagus, also known as asparagus pee, according to the research. The research was funded through a research grant from the National Institutes of Health with your tax dollars.  The NIH uses Federal tax dollars to fund its research and received $30 billion in 2016. The NIH's mission statement is ``to enhance health, extend healthy lives, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.''  We would all agree with that. It is good to try to fix problems with disease, fight the common cold, cure cancer, and cure Alzheimer's, all of those things.  However, the NIH has conducted lifesaving research in the past and has been given broad authority in deciding[[Page H5129]]how to spend that $30 billion, and now we see waste.  The NIH funds research grants to universities, and much of the NIH's funding is well justified and leads to lifesaving research. Funding a study that doesn't even explore the possible health benefits of eating asparagus but only if there is an odor after eating it does not fit into any mission of the It is akin to the taxpayers' money being flushed down the toilet.  This particular study was the result of a grant provided by the NIH to Harvard's T.Chan School of Public Its purpose was to discover whether people could smell an asparagus effect. The researchers at Harvard received more than $3 million in 2016, to survey 6,909 people of European-American descent to find if these people's urine smelled funny after eating asparagus, and the results were published in the British Medical  The results concluded that a ``large proportion of individuals of European-American descent cannot smell'' any effect. Sixty percent of the people surveyed, 58 percent of men and 62 percent of women, stated that they could not smell any urinary metabolites produced after asparagus consumption. However, Angus Chen, a reporter for the National Public Radio, stated in his report on this study that 4,161 people ``were confused by the question.'' Do you think? We didn't need to waste $3 million or have 260 Oklahomans work all year long to see if there was some effect in this madness.  Mr.Speaker, do you want to waste $2 billion? Then give it to the Veterans In 2008, Congress passed the post-9/11 GI Bill updating the GI Bill from 1944, creating new benefits for servicemembers like myself, such as lengthening the expiration date following separation from the Armed Forces or retirement and offering living expenses as well as tuition. Another change made the benefits paid directly to the school of choice for the veteran--and here is where it began to go awry.  Initially, benefits from the GI Bill were paid directly to the servicemember for them to decide how and where to invest in their own education. This makes sense. They were responsible enough to defend our Republic; they can probably handle the funds--as they had for decades before. This change now comes with a litany of problems.  An audit conducted from 2013 to 2014, by the Office of Inspector General, for the U.Department of Veterans Affairs found that a 13 percent error rate in payments by the Veterans Benefits Administration to the schools of choice for servicemembers had occurred.  To conduct this audit, the OIG looked into 650 payments for 225 students to 50 schools. They found $128,000 in improper payments; and eight students who withdrew from their classes still received $2,400 in stipends, and this money was never recovered for the taxpayer. Extrapolating these numbers to the full class of students, the Office of Inspector General estimated that, over 5 years, the Veterans Benefits Administration would process about $205 million in improper payments--and you see it continue to go on and waste $2.2 billion.  We can do better. We must do better. We must do better by our veterans. We must do better so that we do not allow people's insatiable appetite for nonexistent government funds to continue to be consumed. We are a nation that is $20 trillion in debt.  How many of you, if you came and I asked you: Hey, could I have $100?  And you said: sure.  And I said: okay, but great, it is going to cost you $105 because I am going to charge you $5 to take your hundred.  Wouldn't that be pretty much absurd and in your face? Yet that is exactly what we do with a very popular program called the Pell Grant The Pell grant was created in the 1970s and has since become the basic mechanism for the Federal Government to assist lower income families with higher education costs. The legislation mandates that students receiving the funds must be admitted and enrolled in an institution of higher learning.  While the Pell grant provides great opportunity for students who might not otherwise be able to attend college--something that we all think is good--the waste comes from a stipulation within the law that requires the Federal Government to pay a fee to give away their money. The $5 payment goes directly to participating schools and is intended to help offset the cost of the Pell grant. So we let institutions of higher learning charge a fee to accept your money, the taxpayers.  While it is true that there are administrative costs involved with servicing Pell grants, schools should accept these costs as a part of doing business as they would if no Pell grant were provided and it was just your hard-earned money. If you were supporting one of your children in college, those fees would be incorporated within that same $1,000.  For the 2015 and 2016 year, the maximum Pell grant available to an undergraduate student was roughly $5,775. Based on the latest reports from the U.Department of Education for the same year or the year prior, the Nation's taxpayers provided $30 billion to 8 million students. The average Pell grant received by students was roughly $3,800. That all sounds good. While $5 does not seem significant, when you put that $5 towards 8 million students, you can see where the problem is.  It is an unnecessary and arbitrary fee that should be disallowed, and we need to restore it so that colleges and institutions do not scoop something off of the top. But people say: well, we have our administrative costs. We have overhead. We have our infrastructure. We have all of these things that we have to do.  Yes, and that is why we have allowed, for decades, the tax-exempt endowments so that as the endowments accrue wealth and they grow, they use those resources to sustain the infrastructure on the university.  We are $20 trillion in debt. It would be great if we could not pay our bills to go to our next-door neighbor and say: Hey, I am a little short on my electric bill, can you help me?  Or: I need help on my house payment this month. Let me just get it from you.  Our neighbors would not take kindly to that. Yet we are allowing these institutions that have the endowed wealth and that have all of the ability to do the infrastructure. Yet what happens? They continue to waste money with administrative fees that only have increased by 300 percent since 1976.  Here is another one for you: How many of you would donate to a charity that had a 52 percent administrative overhead? No takers? I didn't think so. Yet that is exactly what you do when you have the National Science Foundation put forth research grants that were designed to help people in their health and fighting disease and many other things. The average fee that universities and institutions charge back to the Federal Government for these research grants is 52 percent. That borders on the immoral.  A practice in higher education grant making that is not widely known or understood by the American public is this practice of charging indirect cost as a part of a grant. So, for example, $1 million that is coming to a university for research--we are all excited about that, it helps our communities--did you know that that university, in turn, will scoop, on average, 52 percent off of the top?  The typical grant has direct costs, and we all understand that. As they put forth their budget, they will list it with such things as researchers' salaries--fine--travel associated with research--understood. But beyond that, universities are able to claim, under our insane laws, that additional funds in the form of indirect costs are needed for infrastructure of the institution, and it is our responsibility, as taxpayers, to support that. Never mind that tax-free endowments were designed specifically for that purpose and already exist that they could use. But they never touch that wealth. They never touch that accrued wealth. They never touch that accrued interest.  The Office of Management and Budget defines indirect costs as expenses an organization incurs indirectly--and they get to define what that is. What does it translate to? Well, rather than pick on Harvard, let's pick on the Big 12, a region I come from. We will start with the University of                              {time}  1145  Charging the government for indirect costs is expensive and, unfortunately, a[[Page H5130]]common practice among institutions of higher learning.  Here are the indirect costs for the schools in the Big 12. I am sure they are not the only ones. This is a nationwide epidemic, to the tune of $55 billion. That is billion with a Even in Washington, D.C., that is real money.  The University of Oklahoma adds a 55 percent surcharge to its research on campus; Oklahoma State University adds 45 percent, and a 54 percent surcharge for instruction grant projects.  The University of Texas, 56 percent. We have a winner.  Texas Tech, 49 percent; Texas Christian, 54 percent; Baylor, 38 percent. They are a little more economical, but it is still nearly 40 percent of waste.  The University of Kansas charges a surcharge of 51.5 percent; Kansas State, 52 percent; West Virginia, 50 percent; Iowa State, 52 percent, meeting the median average.  Higher education officials rarely talk about it. When confronted with it, they will, with straight faces and degrees of education, argue that this waste is absolutely essential for them to continue.  A recent George Washington University student newspaper article revealed a higher education official's thoughts about indirect costs when he overtly referred to them as--you have got it--subsidies. He let it slip. Maybe Freudian, we don't know.  The George Washington Hatchet quoted Leo Chalupa, vice president for research, that ``research is bringing in money to the university.''  You think? It is $55 billion worth.  However, Chalupa is not just referring to the direct dollars used to conduct research. We would all agree with needed research, but what we don't agree with is this indirect--more than half--plundering of what the dollars were designed and intended to do.  Let's switch to something that we should do to try to incentivize people to improve their educational experience. Sound confusing? It is--to the tune of $7 billion was wasted.  Few Americans will argue that the Nation's schools do not need improvement. We would all say that they do. When one looks at test scores or compares American outcomes with other nations, it is easy to see that many of our K-12 schools are languishing.  One recent report evaluated testing outcomes against other industrialized nations, and America's students finished 17th out of 34--not something to be proud of. This led President Obama to direct more money at the issue, like so many previous Presidents before him, rather than looking at the underlying systemic concerns.  It is not the amount of money; it is the habit that is being created. While increasing funding can be a component of a solution, it is often not the most vital of the components. Without proper policy driving the expenditures, the money spent can become one more example of how inefficient Federal intervention in anything can be.  President Obama's Department of Education directed $7 billion to a program known as the School Improvement Grants program, to which the Department of Energy named the 21st Century Community Learning The funds were directed to States with instructions that the funds should be directed to the poorest performing schools.  It sounds agreeable.  The measures used to identify the underperforming schools were graduation rates and readiness scores in reading and mathematics. Then-Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said, in 2009: ``We could really move the needle, lift the bottom, and change the lives of tens of millions of underserved children''--something that all of us would agree on.  The School Improvement Grant program built on the race to the top efforts undertaken during the Bush administration, and the Obama administration efforts doubled the funds for the program.  The Department of Education described the purpose of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers in the following way: ``This program supports the creation of community learning centers that provide academic enrichment opportunities during non-school hours for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools.''  Again, all of these sound laudable. However, according to a report released by the Department of Energy just a few days before the end of President Obama's administration, test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment were no different in schools that had received these funds from School Improvement Grants as those that did not--$7 billion gone.  A Washington Post article detailing the report quoted Andy Smarick, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute: ``Think of what all that money could have been spent on instead.'' Mr.Smarick is correct: $7 billion in taxpayer funds were spent without any oversight or careful oversight whatsoever.  Congress must reexamine the role of the Federal Government in education because what is being done now does not work--billions upon billions of dollars.  How about if we can't solve it through $7 billion wasted in trying to make people feel good about education and then that will improve their schools, how about we get them moving so we can fight obesity and cut down on diabetes, disease, and other things. That sounds good. Let's talk about that.  In 2010, with the assistance of First Lady Michelle Obama, the Let's Move! project began, with the hope of reducing childhood obesity in This is a real problem in We have one of the largest obesity rates of all the  The program, costing as much as $1 billion per year, focused heavily on impressing upon children the need for proper exercise as well as bringing healthier food options into schools.  At first glance, it appears that the Let's Move! program produced results. In 2008, U.childhood obesity rates nationally were around 16.2 percent. During the next 3 years, 18 States saw those rates begin a modest decline, falling in some States by 5 percent.  This reduction could be attributed to the effectiveness of the program or a cultural change in how people view health choices and how they view their eating habits. But it should be noted, regardless, that this decline was already begun by the time the Let's Move! program was even enacted. Overall, and sadly, in the latest statistics, U.childhood obesity rates did not decline and, in fact, have risen to 17.2 percent in the last statistical year.  There are many, many things that we can continue to go on and talk about in waste. Let's end with this one.  Want people to eat healthy, something that sounds good? How many of you would be influenced by people dressing up like Fruit of the Loom, in outfits like green beans, grapes, tomatoes, and going to college campuses and then just seeing the sight of these people wearing these costumes say: You know, I think I need to eat some grapes or vegetables?  That is what this program did. It wasted $14.7 million of your money. It is called the Get Fruved project.  I am not making it up.  Not only did this program waste $14.7 million; it is still being funded by your tax dollars. The U.Department of Agriculture awarded $4.9 million a year for this initiative, led by students and researchers at four American universities, which are the University of Tennessee, South Dakota, West Virginia, and the University of  The Fruved website reports that its goal is:       Our students are the best teachers. This is why Fruved has      sophomores and juniors at each school peer-monitoring first-     year students, helping them live a healthier life during      their first year of college.  That includes dressing up in these outfits. That is $14.7 million.  There are things that the Federal Government has a responsibility for and there are things that it does not. Abraham Lincoln said it best in a paraphrase where he said: The things that we can do ourselves, the government ought not to interfere. The things that we cannot do collectively, the government might have a role.  We know the government may have a role in education, certainly, with education funding and helping our facilities and our institutions. However, we do not need to waste $70 billion. Imagine what that could do.  We will never change this idea if the American people do not demand of us to stop such madness and waste. When people come with straight faces and Ph.D.s and argue for dressing up in outfits, we have to push back on that and[[Page H5131]]say: $20 trillion in debt, a weakened military, roads and bridges that are falling down and an infrastructure that needs improvement, modernization in our skies for the Federal Aviation  There are so many areas that the government truly does have a function and role. We will never get to it with asparagus urine studies and dressing up as fruits and vegetables.  Mr.Speaker, my hope is that all of us as Americans can find those overlapping circles and fight this absolute absurdity of waste in government, be responsible with American tax dollars, and sustain our great Republic for the future of our children.

4999,topic-id,316,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of 1094, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.  As we have all seen from various reports and news stories, increased accountability at the VA is long, long overdue. For far too long, the leadership in the Department of Veterans Affairs has been unable to make firing decisions that would be common sense in any other setting.  The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act gives the Secretary the authority to fire the bad actors and creates a removal process that is more in line with the private sector. It also gives the Secretary the ability to punish poor performers by recouping bonuses and relocation expenses. We must ensure that employees who fail to do their jobs are not rewarded but are, instead, held accountable.  Another part of this legislation is the enhanced protection for whistleblowers. These are employees who are doing the right thing and advocating for our veterans. They should not be faced with retribution by their leadership.  One of the most important jobs of this Congress is working to improve the lives of our Nation's veterans. When our fellow Americans bravely put on the uniform and serve, we must ensure that that sacrifice does not go unnoticed.  In my time serving on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have seen how Congress and the leadership of the VA, in partnership with veterans service organizations, are working to create the culture of service and accountability that our veterans truly deserve.

4658,topic-id,727,"Mr.Chairman, I just want to start off by thanking Chairman Hensarling and the entire Financial Services Committee for their leadership on this vital and important legislation. Job well done.  The Financial CHOICE Act answers a deep need at the very heart of our economy. We have heard about this need time and again from our constituents back home. I sure have.  Small businesses are struggling. They have been unable to hire, invest, or get the loans that they need to get off the ground. Families looking to keep their money safe are hit with fees that they cannot afford.  And why is this? Our community banks are in trouble. They are being crushed by the costly rules imposed on them by the Dodd-Frank This law may have had good intentions, but its consequences have been dire for Main  Let me put it this way: It is more than 1,000 pages long and has more rules and regulations than any other Obama-era law. The burdens created are real and deep.  These costs are unsustainable for small community banks who simply cannot afford to meet all the requirements and can't hire a team of lawyers to decipher the seemingly endless rules.  So what do they do? They hunker down. They are unable to loan out money. Or worse, they are shutting down.  The CHOICE Act reins in Dodd-Frank, and it delivers the regulatory relief these small banks so desperately need. This will change our communities because these banks are the lifeblood of our Main  Where I come from, representing towns small and medium, they are not big companies in big cities getting money from big banks. They are small- and medium-size businesses in small- and medium-size towns hoping the community banker will be able to give them the loan they need to hire some people, to take a risk, to start a small business, to expand their small business. They know the needs of their communities, and they are able to identify the people who can fill those needs successfully.  There is a reason why they handle the vast majority of small-business loans in this country: because they are the ones who are the closest to the small businesses.  Here is the difference: The people big banks may overlook thinking it is some guy with a pipe dream, the community banker is able to recognize that as a father of four with the drive to make his dream of a bicycle shop into a reality or a woman seeking to rent out retail space to open her dream restaurant using her family recipes, or maybe it is a young farmer with a new idea to integrate the latest technology into the family farm. The big banks don't pay attention to that; only community banks do.  A couple of years later, with the help of these kinds of loans from these local banks, these so-called pipe dreams in these small towns and these rural counties become successful businesses. They become job creators. These are the ultimate success stories that our communities in America are built upon.  This is why the Financial CHOICE Act is so important. It helps community banks and the small businesses that absolutely depend on them, it helps them thrive. It protects consumers by increasing accountability and transparency over the wider financial sector, and it also repeals ``too big to fail,'' the rules codified by Dodd-Frank that have left taxpayers on the[[Page H4717]]hook for too long. Ultimately, the Financial CHOICE Act is a jobs bill, and it is one that will bring hope back to Main  It is easy to talk about the economy and regulations as a series of numbers. It is easy to talk in vague terms about job creators and small-business owners.

That is what this CHOICE Act is all about. It is why we were sent here: to look out for the people who work hard and who do the right thing.  Let's get this done for them. Let's get this done for the people who take the risks, who live and breathe their work, for the people who strive and struggle every day for their families. Let's pass the CHOICE Act today.

As I said, 10 million Americans with disabilities rely on  The Affordable Care Act incentivizes States to offer home and community-based care under The Republican bill would undo that. It would make it very likely that States would eliminate that home care and community-based care.  Now, I have worked for years with people with disabilities, and I know some of them have struggled to get out of nursing homes and to be able to live in the community which, by the way, is actually less expensive than taxpayers paying for people to be in nursing homes. This has been a tremendous battle for the disability community to be able to live independently.  That ability is threatened. By the way, even the amount of money that would go to nursing homes would be cut dramatically, or could be.  Right now, one-half of the cost of nursing homes and home care and community-based care is paid for by Medicaid, and $800 billion was cut out of the House bill. I hear that the Senate bill is even worse. So this monstrosity of a bill would do a countless amount of harm to millions and millions of Just about everyone will be affected.  So, today, I want to focus on the damage it would do to two groups in particular: Americans age 50 to 64 and people with disabilities whom we saw represented by the courageous protesters today outside Senator Mitch McConnell's office.  This bill would impose a crippling age tax on people 50 to 64 years old, which means that they will be either unable to afford insurance altogether or be forced to pay thousands more for it every year.  This is the same age tax that was in the House's version of the bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office gave this example: It estimated that a 64-year-old who makes $26,000 a year could see his or her premiums rise by over 800 percent. That would be in the area of about $14,000 a year. How does that work? There is simply no way she would be able to keep her insurance.  The Senate bill would allow individual States to undermine the essential health benefits package that is in the Affordable Care Act that ensures older Americans have insurance that actually covers the services they need. Without those essential benefits, insurance companies could end coverage for prescription drugs, for cancer care, for emergency care, and much more.  On top of those attacks on Americans age 50 and older, the bill also guts--as I pointed out--the Medicaid program which is absolutely essential for people with disabilities, both young and old.  Medicaid pays for nearly half of all long-term care in our country, and that includes, as I said, not just care provided by nursing homes, but home and community-based and personal care services that allow people with disabilities to live independently, sometimes to even travel to Washington, D. We fought really hard to provide those home and community-based services. We expanded access to them in the Affordable Care This mean bill not only undoes the progress, it moves us backwards by slashing Medicaid funds and turning it into a capped program, capping the amount of money that may go to every person. The Senate bill is even meaner than the Caps would rise more slowly and cause even more damage.

It spells disaster for anyone who depends on That includes pregnant women, infants, children, people with disabilities, and adults--including low-income seniors. The bill is also devastating for women's health.

This crisis requires a comprehensive solution that increases transparency; lowers prices for patients, Medicare, and Medicaid; and ensures that every American can get access to the drugs that they need.  It is time for Congress to get serious about lowering the cost of drugs for Americans, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Child Protection Improvements I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Bishop) who has been an excellent partner working with me on this bill, the first version of which was introduced in 2007.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers for their work on the bill as well.  I volunteered with Big Brothers Big Sisters many years ago. I was paired with an extraordinary young man named David who is now himself a Big I have always said that I have learned as much or more from David and the program as he ever learned from me.  The experience also helped me understand the huge amount of trust that we put in volunteers at organizations all around the country. In the vast majority of cases, that trust is well placed. But, unfortunately, there are exceptions.  For that reason, in 2003, Congress created the Child Safety Pilot Program to demonstrate the feasibility of allowing youth-serving nonprofits to access FBI background checks.                              {time}  1800  The FBI maintains the database of criminal histories from every State in the Nation, searchable by fingerprint. An FBI search is really the gold standard when it comes to background checks, as it cannot be evaded by using a fake name, and it will find convictions from every I believe that the gold standard is what we should strive for when it comes to protecting children, seniors, and individuals with disabilities who are put in a potentially vulnerable situation.  Between 2003 and 2011, youth-serving organizations were able to run over 100,000 background checks through this pilot program, and about 6 percent of the potential volunteers were revealed to have criminal records of concern. Applicants were found with convictions for everything from murder to child abuse, to sexual assault; and frequently those convictions were from out of State, so only a national background check would have found them.  H.695 ensures that every child-serving organization in America will have access to the most comprehensive and effective background check possible. H.695 will also protect the applicant's privacy and does not allow for the individual's specific criminal record to be disclosed without explicit consent by the potential volunteer.  We have demonstrated that background checks for nonprofits working with children can be conducted quickly, affordably, and accurately. It is time to create a system that is permanent and that will protect children and other vulnerable populations while ensuring the privacy of volunteers.  I urge the passage of this bipartisan bill.

5061,topic-id,237,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FDA Reauthorization Act, FDARA as it is called.  It could not be more evident that the time has come for Congress to reckon with the growing problem of exorbitant drug prices. Every few months sees the headlines about another extreme price hike, as was just mentioned. Some unscrupulous pharmaceutical CEO buys the rights to produce drugs that have been on the market for decades, usually where there are no competitors, then, seemingly overnight, they raise the price astronomically.  In the case of Daraprim, a drug that is used by some transplant patients and people living with AIDS, the price went from $13.50 per pill to $750. That is outrageous, a price increase of 5,000 percent. For this drug and many others, the drugs have been off patent for ages and there is no generic competitor on the market.  Competition from generic drugs saves patients and the government billions of dollars on a weekly basis. Unfortunately, generic drug manufacturers who want to bring these markets to competition face a long approval process, steep costs, and uncertainty. This FDA act reckons with that.  It is time for Congress to act, also, on those unscrupulous providers. Gus Bilirakis and I introduced a bill providing competition to drive down those costs. We provide new incentives for generic drugs to come to market and reform the process.  I am in support of the bill.

I think it will do a lot of good in both directions--in the Iran direction and particularly in the Russia direction. The lack of trust of Mr.Putin on both sides of the aisle here is paramount.

(4) On July 26, 2016, President Obama approved a      Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident      Coordination, which states, ``certain cyber incidents that      have significant impacts on an entity, our national security,      or the broader economy require a unique approach to response      efforts''.       (5) On December 29, 2016, President Obama issued an annex      to Executive Order 13694, which authorized sanctions on the      following entities and individuals:       (A) The Main Intelligence Directorate (also known as      Glavnoe Razvedyvatel'noe Upravlenie or the GRU) in Moscow,      Russian       (B) The Federal Security Service (also known as Federalnaya      Sluzhba Bezopasnosti or the FSB) in Moscow, Russian            (C) The Special Technology Center (also known as STLC,      Special Technology Center Petersburg) in Petersburg,      Russian       (D) Zorsecurity (also known as Esage Lab) in Moscow,      Russian       (E) The autonomous noncommercial organization known as the      Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing      Systems (also known as ANO PO KSI) in Moscow, Russian            (F) Igor Valentinovich       (G) Sergey Aleksandrovich       (H) Igor Olegovich       (I) Vladimir Stepanovich       (6) On January 6, 2017, an assessment of the United States      intelligence community entitled, ``Assessing Russian      Activities and Intentions in Recent U.Elections'' stated,      ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence      campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential      election.'' The assessment warns that ``Moscow will apply      lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the      U.Presidential election to future influence efforts      worldwide, including against U.allies and their election      processes''.     212.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Government of the Russian Federation has sought to      exert influence throughout Europe and Eurasia, including in      the former states of the Soviet Union, by providing resources      to political parties, think tanks, and civil society groups      that sow distrust in democratic institutions and actors,      promote xenophobic and illiberal views, and otherwise      undermine European unity. The Government of the Russian      Federation has also engaged in well-documented corruption      practices as a means toward undermining and buying influence      in European and Eurasian countries.       (2) The Government of the Russian Federation has largely      eliminated a once-vibrant Russian-language independent media      sector and severely curtails free and independent media      within the borders of the Russian Russian-     language media organizations that are funded and controlled      by the Government of the Russian Federation and disseminate      information within and outside of the Russian Federation      routinely traffic in anti-Western disinformation, while few      independent, fact-based media sources provide objective      reporting for Russian-speaking audiences inside or outside of      the Russian       (3) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to      violate its commitments under the Memorandum on Security      Assurances in connection with Ukraine's Accession to the      Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at      Budapest December 5, 1994, and the Conference on Security and      Co-operation in Europe Final Act, concluded at Helsinki      August 1, 1975 (commonly referred to as the ``Helsinki Final      Act''), which laid the ground-work for the establishment of      the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, of      which the Russian Federation is a member, by its illegal      annexation of Crimea in 2014, its illegal occupation of South      Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia in 2008, and its ongoing      destabilizing activities in eastern       (4) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to      ignore the terms of the August 2008 ceasefire agreement      relating to Georgia, which requires the withdrawal of Russian      Federation troops, free access by humanitarian groups to the      regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and monitoring of the      conflict areas by the European Union Monitoring       (5) The Government of the Russian Federation is failing to      comply with the terms of the Minsk Agreement to address the      ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, signed in Minsk,      Belarus, on February 11, 2015, by the leaders of Ukraine,      Russia, France, and Germany, as well as the Minsk Protocol,      which was agreed to on September 5, 2014.       (6) The Government of the Russian Federation is--       (A) in violation of the Treaty between the United States of      America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the      Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range      Missiles, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and entered      into force June 1, 1988 (commonly known as the ``INF      Treaty''); and       (B) failing to meet its obligations under the Treaty on      Open Skies, done at Helsinki March 24, 1992, and entered into      force January 1, 2002 (commonly known as the ``Open Skies      Treaty'').     252.

STATEMENT OF       The United States, consistent with the principle of ex      injuria jus non oritur, supports the policy known as the      ``Stimson Doctrine'' and thus does not recognize territorial      changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions      and occupations of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Eastern      Ukraine, and     254.

Mr.Mr.President, I just want to say to my colleague, the Democratic leader, that I think this is a good example of the Senate at its best. We all know this has been a period of rather partisan sparring back and forth on a variety of different things, but both sides were able to put that aside and deal with two important issues in a very significant way. I think it is good for the Senate and good for the country, and I thank the Democratic leader for his comments.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgS3428.txt,1036,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,13.0,June
5017,topic-id,238,"Mr.President, first, I wish to respond to the President's latest tweets about the bipartisan, bicameral deal we just reached to fund the government through  Members of both parties worked very hard to come to this agreement. There was a real spirit of cooperation. I thank Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi, as well as Senators Cochran and Leahy and Congress Members Frelinghuysen and Lowey, all who worked together often until the wee hours of the morning to make this happen. We all spent a lot of time working on it, and I think we got a very good outcome. So when the President threw cold water on this deal and actually recommended a government shutdown, I was deeply disappointed. Here we saw Democrats and Republicans working together in the best traditions of the Senate, and the President disparages it in a way that is destructive, essentially saying: Let's have a shutdown.  The President has been complaining about the lack of bipartisanship in Well, this deal is exactly how Washington should work when it is bipartisan. Both parties negotiated and came to an agreement on a piece of legislation we each can support. It is truly a shame that the President is degrading it because he didn't get 100 percent of what he wanted. Bipartisanship is best summed up by the Rolling Stones: You can't always get what you want--or at least everything you want.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgS2660-2.txt,1036,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,2.0,June
5100,topic-id,564,"Mr.President, my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to work on their healthcare bill behind closed doors. They haven't made public a shred of bill text or even considered holding a committee hearing to debate the topic. Yesterday my friend the majority leader filed a motion to bring TrumpCare directly to the floor, skipping the committee process.  This is a party that screamed from the rafters ``Read the bill, read the bill'' when Democrats were putting together the Affordable Care We spent over a year debating that bill. We tried with a bipartisan group of six to come up with a solution.  Republicans are putting together their bill in secret, with no Democratic input, and then will rush their bill to the floor without a single committee hearing, all in the span of 3 short weeks. This is a bill that will alter one-sixth of the American economy and affect tens of millions of American lives. For many, it will have life-and-death consequences.  The way Republicans are crafting this legislation is pulling the wool over the eyes of the American people on one of the most crucial issues affecting their lives. Why? There is only one explanation: They don't want the American people to see their bill. They don't want to go home to townhall meetings and let people give their opinions. Keep it under wraps, rush it through? There is only one good reason: They are not very proud of the product that they have put together.  The Republicans know that even if they make some changes to the bill that came over from the House--they may increase subsidies a bit or lower the amount of tax breaks they give to millionaires--they will still wind up with a bill that is far worse than the status quo: higher costs, less care. That is because they are working from a fundamentally flawed premise, which is to take support away from healthcare programs like Medicaid to give a tax break to the wealthiest Senate Republicans can nibble around the edges, but they will not be able to excise the rotten core of their healthcare plan.  The House bill has the support of approximately 18 percent of A majority of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans don't like it. Don't you get the message, my Republican friends? We understand the ideologues are telling you that you must repeal. But now that people have actually looked at repeal, they realize that is not the way to go.  The right approach is not to move backward, not to undo all the progress we have made in healthcare over the past 8 years and start from scratch. The American people don't want to go back to the days when an insurance company could discriminate against you because you have a preexisting condition or jack up your rates simply because you are older. That is not the kind of healthcare system the American people want. But that seems to be what our Republican colleagues, in the dark of night, are considering.  The right approach is to keep all the good things in the existing law and work in a bipartisan way to make more progress on lowering costs for consumers and improving the quality of care.  Again, I urge my Republican colleagues to drop their repeal efforts and, instead, work with Democrats on actually improving our healthcare system.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgS3347.txt,1036,FDA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,8.0,June

5327,topic-id,1516,"Mr.President, first, on a sad note but one always of hope when it comes to Senator McCain, his cancer diagnosis sent a shock wave through the Senate last night. He is one of my dear friends, as he is a dear friend to many in this body, and from the bottom of my heart, I wish him and his family well. So does every Member of this The respect that this man has is broad and deep, both based on his service to America and on what he has done here in this  I agree with what the majority leader said earlier, in that John McCain is an American hero. There is no one who has done more to serve his country and this Chamber than Senator There is no one who is more passionate in the defense of our soldiers and in our defense than Senator  The same courage that he showed as a soldier he showed here. John McCain and I led a group to deal with immigration reform. He had to take so many tough positions to do what was right. He was fearless. His word was good. He was good at compromising, and he was good at making his views known.  With that bill, which passed this body with 67 or 68 votes--a large number of Democrats and Republicans--had it become law, our country's economy would have been better, and our security would have been better because it was so tough on the border. We would have been in a better place for it had that bill passed.  The point I want to make is not with regard to the bill but to McCain--how we were in rooms for hours and hours, day after day, and we got to see the mettle of the man. Boy, the more you knew him, the better he looked, and the better he was.  So we know that, against this new battle, Senator McCain will fight in the only way he knows how--with every fiber of his being. We wish him well. Our prayers are for him and his family. We hope that he joins us very soon because this country needs John McCain now more than ever.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, on the issue of healthcare, yesterday President Trump seemed intent on pushing forward the Republicans' failing healthcare plan with a vote sometime early next week. We have been on the topic of healthcare for 7 months, and I am still not sure which version of the Republican plan we will be voting on.  Will it be repeal and replace? Will we be voting on the Senate bill that would cause 22 million Americans to lose their coverage and that would cause costs to go up and care to go down? Will it be with the Cruz amendment, which would annihilate the ``preexisting condition'' requirement, in quoting my friend Senator Grassley? Or will it be repeal without replace, which would cause our healthcare system to implode, creating chaos, which would cause millions to lose insurance and millions more to have their coverage diminished?  The CBO confirmed last night that repeal without replace would cause 32 million Americans--that is about a 10th of the country--to lose their insurance and would cause premiums to double after 10 years.  It was a horrible idea in January and was rejected, wisely, by our Republican colleagues. We were not involved. The door was closed on us on January 4. It is a horrible idea now.  So will that be the focus next week or will it be a new bill that has more money thrown in, as some have suggested--the same core bill of devastating cuts to Medicaid, tax breaks for the wealthy and the special interests, the cruel Cruz amendment, and an extra $2 billion slush fund? Is that going to be the bill?  We Democrats do not know what our Republican friends are planning to vote on next week. I will bet that many Republicans do not know yet either. What we do know is that a $200 billion slush fund, tacked onto a bill that would gut Medicaid and other services by well over $1 trillion, is like putting an old bandaid on a bullet wound. The $200 billion in additional funding would only offset 17 percent of the bill's total cuts to coverage. It would not come anywhere close to covering the wound that the Republicans are inflicting on Medicaid, on Americans in nursing homes, on Americans in rural areas, on those who are suffering from opioid addiction. It just will not work, and repeal without replace is even worse. All of the options are horrible options for the Republican Party, but, more importantly, they are horrible options for the American people.  It is time to start over. It is time for our Republican colleagues to drop this failed approach and work with Democrats on actually improving our healthcare system. They closed the door on us on January 4 in passing something called reconciliation, which basically says: We do not need the Democrats; we will do it ourselves. Let them open the door now that they have[[Page S4090]]seen that that failed approach does not work. I outlined three specific, nonideological proposals yesterday that we could work on together, right now, to stabilize the marketplaces and help bring down premiums. I believe they would pass quickly. My Republican friends do not seem to know what to do. My suggestion is to drop these failed ideas and work with Democrats on the commonsense, nonideological solutions that we Democrats have offered.  Here is one more point. I have heard some of my colleagues say they may vote for the motion to proceed next week because they are in favor of debate. I will remind them that the rules under reconciliation only allow for 20 hours of debate to be equally divided between the parties and 1 minute of debate allowed per amendment. That is not debate. The idea that you would vote on the motion to proceed in order to have a healthcare debate is absurd. If my colleagues want to debate healthcare, they should vote no on the motion to proceed and urge their leader to hold a real debate--in committees, in public hearings, on the floor, and through regular order, which is a process that they have spurned for 7 months--not 10 hours for each party, with 1 minute per amendment, on such an important proposal. That is not a debate. It is the legislative equivalent of ``Beat the Clock.'' This is serious business--the health and welfare of the American people--not some game show.                         Trade and Outsourcing  Mr.President, just as the administration is flailing and failing on healthcare, they are failing on trade and outsourcing as well.  I read today that the administration has failed to secure any concessions from China on its dumping of excess steel and aluminum in our markets, which is killing jobs in my State and in many others. As well, today, the Carrier plant at which President-Elect Trump tweeted about saving jobs just laid off 300 workers in Indiana and moved the positions to It is exactly 6 months to the day since President Trump took office. It is a shame that we are losing these good-paying American jobs. Despite all of the President's tough talk on trade and his Commerce Secretary's ``100 days of trade talks'' plan, the loss of these jobs shows that, in 6 months, the Trump administration has been unable to actually deliver results on trade, with the exception of the first U.beef shipment to China, which was the result of an agreement that President Obama helped to broker before the end of his term. The Trump administration has made few inroads in reducing our trade deficit or in making it easier for our companies to compete abroad.  It is all well and good to tweet about a few hundred jobs saved at the Carrier plant, as the President-elect did last December--and I am glad he saved them--but as President, you have to actually take strong action, not go to one plant. You need policies that will protect millions of workers from the rapacious policies of China and other countries. Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. The 338 jobs that are leaving Carrier today are a reminder that, when it comes to actual substance and policy, the Trump administration has done very little to change the game on trade to keep jobs in the United States--another broken promise to the American worker.  Mr.President, I reiterate my remarks from yesterday on the nomination of John Bush to the Sixth Circuit Court of Many of my colleagues have been down on the floor and have expressed just how distressing and damaging this nomination will be.  His extreme record demonstrates that John Bush simply does not have the temperament to be an impartial Federal judge--the very least our system requires. Once again, I urge my colleagues to oppose his confirmation.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

I first proposed this language in 2011. It failed at first, but now it has been included in every Defense Appropriations bill since It is necessary to enforce the War Powers Act because every Attorney General since the 1970s has advised Presidents that the War Powers Act isn't binding on the President, and that the President can send unlimited numbers of troops anywhere in the world to fight any battle without a declaration of war.  That is why we need this language, because Attorney General Mukasey, a Republican Attorney General, testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that by including this language in the appropriations bill, Congress enforces the War Powers Act and its proper role in international affairs.

The bill provides strong support for the Department of Energy's national defense programs. Weapons activities is funded at $10.24 billion, up $921 million from last year's level, to keep our Nation's nuclear deterrent reliable and effective.  This increase will fully fund the ongoing stockpile life extension programs and will make substantial progress toward addressing the continued deterioration of infrastructure across the enterprise. The recommendations for Naval Reactors is $1.49 billion, and includes full funding for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, formerly referred to as the Ohio-class replacement.  Additionally, the bill provides funding increases across the Department of Energy to defend against cyber attacks and, within Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, to strengthen energy sector cybersecurity preparedness, response, and recovery.  This bill addresses the critical infrastructure work of the Army Corps of Engineers, providing a total of $6.2 billion, an increase of $120 million more than last year.  This recommendation makes full use of all annual revenues from the Inland Waterways Trust  The harbor maintenance trust fund activities are funded at $1.34 billion, which is $40 million more than fiscal year 2017, an increase of $375 million above the budget request, and the same as the WRDA target.  The bill provides $74 million more than last year for flood and storm damage reduction activities.  This is a responsibile bill, one that makes some difficult choices in order to prioritize the most critical Federal programs.

The majority has also inserted an amendment to provide $1.6 billion President Trump requested to begin construction of the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.  This is surely just the beginning of making taxpayers pay for the entire wall, which experts have estimated could cost as much as $21 billion, with nary a peso from If we are investing $1.6 billion now, I see no reason why they do not plan to go on to reach the $21 billion expenditure.  Let me put that in some perspective: $21 billion could be used to double the Federal investments in public schools. Think of that. Just the money to build that wall, it could provide 6 million people with healthcare under Medicaid, it could buy school lunches for tens of millions of low-income children. But these investments are not a priority for this majority.  President Trump's own budget director famously said that it isn't worth feeding hungry children if the nutrition does not improve their school performance, and that Meals on Wheels ``sounds great,'' but doesn't work.  I never thought I would hear either of those things come from the mouth of a Federal official. The idea that we should not feed hungry children unless their school work improves, frankly, I am baffled by that, let me say it that way.  The opposition to the wall is bipartisan. Republican Representative Hurd from Texas, a former CIA officer, sits on the Homeland Security Committee and represents the largest border district in the State of He testified before the Rules Committee late Monday night against it, saying, ``having a one-size-fits-all solution to border security makes no sense.'' Yet this amendment was included without debating the merits on the floor and without giving Members an up-or-down vote.  Let me explain that a little bit. This amendment is in the bill, but there will be no vote on it. It has been what we call self-executed to keep people from being recorded in any way, whether they are for or against the wall.  The last statistic that I saw from the American public is that 68 percent of them oppose it. They will never know whether their Representatives did or not. It is a sort of a bait-and-switch idea.  Mr.Speaker, immigration has enriched our country beyond measure. It is what has allowed our country to shape the world, rather than to fear it. A wall will lock the United States away from the rest of the world.  The President's new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, wrote online: ``Walls don't work. Never have. Never will.''  We don't know whether he is going to change his mind about that or not, but that is what he said.  One of our famous Republican Presidents that everybody knew and loved, Ronald Reagan, 30 years ago last month stood in West Berlin and demanded that another wall be torn down.  I said in the Rules Committee yesterday and I will say it again here this afternoon: if the President and the majority build this wall, it, too, will be torn down, not by someone crossing the border or by an outside force. It will crumble because the public understands in a way that this President and majority do not, that our Nation does not barricade itself away from the rest of the world.  We will not build walls to keep us in. What kind of superpower would we be if we built a wall around the outside of our Nation and crumbled from the inside because the money we put on the wall kept us from updating our infrastructure, which is in such terrible shape, and a shredded social safety net?  None of us want to find that out, but the majority is putting us on such a path.  Just yesterday, President Trump announced a ban on transgender servicemembers serving in the military. It appears today that he made that announcement all on his own and that neither the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Pentagon had any idea that he was going to do that.  The announcement came 69 years to the day that President Truman desegregated our military. Think about that for a minute. Sixty-nine years ago, on the very day that President Trump said transgender people couldn't serve, was the day President Truman integrated the military services.  This is an insult to the approximately 15,000 transgender soldiers who sacrifice for our country every day. Transgender servicemembers are being attacked from both ends of Pennsylvania  Just days ago, Republicans joined Democrats to defeat an amendment that would bar transgender servicemembers from receiving the necessary healthcare that they deserve. I will note that these same treatments would have been available to other servicemembers under this amendment. Apparently to the majority, it is not about the treatment, but the person who receives it.  The amendment is especially cruel when you consider that a Pentagon report has found that gender transition-related treatment costs between $2.4 and $8.4 million a year. That is the cost of just four of the President's trips to Mar-a-Think about that: several millions dollars to go to Mar-a-Lago would have paid for operations for transgender persons.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record an article from USA Today that details this fact.                    [From USA Today, July 26, 2017]    OnPolitics Today: Trump's Mar-a-Lago Trips Cost More Than Trans                          Soldiers' Health Care                            (By Josh Hafner)       President Trump tweeted this morning that the U.military      wouldn't allow transgender troops ``in any capacity,'' an      apparent rejection of the military's roughly 6,000 trans      troops and the Obama-era policy that embraced them.       The U.``cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical      costs and disruption that transgender in the military would      entail,'' Trump said.       Except trans troops don't really cost that much, as many      soon pointed out.       A report for the Pentagon last year found that transition-     related care would cost between about $2.4 and $8.4 million      per year--less than 0.14% of the military's medical budget.[[Page H6483]]       That's roughly the cost of four of Trump's trips to Mar-A-     Lago, GQ noted, even using a conservative estimate of $2      million per trip. And it's way less than the $84 million      spent on Viagra and similar meds by the Department of Defense      in 2014, as others also said.       It was, as John McCain noted, ``yet another example of      why major policy announcements should not be made via      Twitter.''

We want to fulfill our constitutional duties.  Yet Speaker Ryan removed it from the bill without any debate or single vote because he was afraid of it.

Not many of us believed that, but I will tell you, now that we have put in this $1.6 billion for this wall, I will bet you that we are going to finish it, and we don't know how much it costs--somewhere between $20 billion and $40 billion for a wall.  Now, if I have heard correctly what my colleagues have said over there, the walls are working already, the ones they have got. There are walls there. I[[Page H6489]]heard San Diego had three. So the idea, I guess, if one works, we will build us another one. Oh, my goodness.  This funding bill that we are talking about spending on a wall is needed to repair roads and bridges and bring down the cost of education, but the majority refuses to have debate on the AUMF, something that is critically important, life and death to many people who live in this country who are presently in the armed services. This amendment should have been included here.  And I appreciate what my colleague, Mr.Sanford, said. He is absolutely right.

4779,topic-id,391,"Mr.Chairman, I start by thanking Chairman Hensarling and the committee and the staff for all the hard work that they have done on this very important bill.  Mr.Chairman, protecting the personal information of Americans is critical to maintaining financial stability. Many of our families, friends, neighbors, and constituents have suffered from the threat of their personal information. While private industry works hard to implement strong protections for our online information, I believe that Congress has the responsibility to stay informed on the threats facing constituents in order to help protect those we represent from identity theft and IRS fraud.  As you are aware, over the past few years, consumer reporting agencies have experienced numerous breaches of information. High-profile data breaches occurred in 2017, 2015, 2013, and 2011, among others.  A recent cyber attack on a CRA subsidiary allowed thieves to access taxpayer W-2s, giving them the ability to file fraudulent tax returns. Another attack exposed the Social Security numbers of an estimated 200 million  Protecting consumers and the constituents I serve in Pennsylvania's 16th District is my duty in Congress, and this includes cyber activity.  In 2015, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent refunds to identity thieves. While it is important to clarify that that is not attributable fully to the hacks that I have already referenced, we should work to improve consumer protections and help stop the wasteful abuse of taxpayer dollars.  Our constituents rely on consumer reporting agencies to monitor their credit for theft or nefarious activities. My amendment simply encourages these agencies collecting our highly sensitive financial information to do everything they deem feasible to adequately protect our constituents from identity fraud that can wreak havoc on their financial stability and personal matters.  CRAs collect large amounts of personal, confidential data. The facts show these companies are under constant attack by cyber thieves. Therefore, this language merely encourages them to use the strongest protection for consumer data.  H.10 takes critical steps to improving our consumer protections while improving our economic and regulatory environment. My amendment is about signaling our shared desire to protect our constituents and their data.  Again, I would like to thank Chairman Hensarling for his work on this bill and for his support of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgH4716-3.txt,99999999999999,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,8.0,July

And I want to thank Ranking Member Walz and Chairman Roe for their work on the issue of accountability and their tireless commitment to our Nation's veterans.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.  Throughout the debate over accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs, I have advocated for legislation that holds VA employees accountable, without violating their constitutional right to due process.                              {time}  1500  This legislation strikes that balance far better than previous accountability proposals. This compromise respects current grievance procedures, maintains existing due process protections, and improves the appeals process by requiring managers to present employees with all of the evidence before they move on a disciplinary action.  Today we are voting to strengthen whistleblower protections. This bill codifies the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, and it mandates that its Director is a Senate-confirmed position instead of a political appointee. It also offers training on how to handle whistleblowers correctly, which will encourage employees to come forward if they witness misconduct.  Do I have concerns about this bill? Absolutely, I do. This is not the accountability legislation that I would have written. We must always remember that a third of VA employees are veterans themselves, and they deserve the workplace protections afforded to them in the Constitution as well as the respect of this But my concerns pale in comparison to the serious and numerous institutional issues raised by accountability bills previously advanced in the  Passing this bill today will accomplish several important objectives:  We will fulfill the repeated requests from veteran service organizations and the VA itself for a stronger accountability system.  We will support the VA's continuing effort to create a culture of excellence.  We will provide veterans greater confidence that the VA is prepared to meet their needs.  Finally, by passing this bill, we can shift our focus from who is fired from the VA to who is hired at the  As I stand here today, there are nearly 50,000 vacant jobs at the This is a significant and urgent challenge. Ultimately, the success of the Department of Veterans Affairs will depend on recruiting, training, and retaining the highest quality talent available.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee to streamlining the hiring process and ensuring that the VA has the staff and expertise it needs to provide veterans the care and support they have earned.  I applaud the Senate for forging this compromise, and I again want to recognize Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their important work.

In its absence, the need for OTA has only grown. Many of the issues OTA studied 20 years ago are even more pressing today.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria, electronic surveillance in the digital age, and testing in America's schools, these are the complex challenges our Nation will continue to face, and Congress should have access to the thorough and insightful analysis OTA can provide.  Investing in the OTA now will actually save us money in the future. In the last year it operated, the OTA's budget was $23 million, but its studies on the synthetic fuels corporation saved taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. Our amendment restores a modest $2.5 million to the OTA account for salaries and expenses to begin rebuilding the office.  The cost is offset by a reduction to the Architect of the Capitol's construction and operations account. This administrative account will not take resources from specific construction projects.

Too soon after the conclusion of their service in World War I, however, our country needed them once again. During World War II, when our allies in Europe and in the Pacific called for help, the brave airmen of these units answered the call. They served with distinction during the historic Doolittle Raid, a daring mission that tested the limits of the B-25 bombers that had been selected to strike a blow to the heart of the Japanese empire. While their bombers delivered payloads, their courage delivered hope to a world that longed for peace.  The 34th and 37th Bomb Squadrons went on to fly numerous interdiction and support missions during the Korean war, deployed during Operation Desert Storm, and fought in Kosovo and When terrorists attacked our homeland in 2001, both squadrons took action in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi In 2011, the 34th and 37th joined forces to launch the first ever B-1 combat mission launched from the continental United States, flying from Ellsworth Air Force base in South Dakota to hit enemy targets in Libya during Operation Odyssey During their 100 years of service, the airmen of the 34th and 37th Bomb Squadrons have assisted allies around the globe and represented the very best of who we are as a nation. I have full faith they will continue their distinguished service in defense of our country, our allies, and our freedoms.  So many times throughout the history of our republic, we have called upon ordinary men and women to become extraordinary heroes. Today we honor the legacy of the heroes of the 34th and 37th Bomb Squadrons, and I thank you for joining me in wishing them the best as they celebrate a century of service.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgS3283.txt,1534,FINANCIAL CHOICE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,6.0,July
4705,topic-id,216,"Mr.Chair, I also want to thank Chairman Hensarling for offering the legislation under consideration today.  The Financial CHOICE Act takes the necessary steps in reforming the supervision of our financial system that the Dodd-Frank Act failed to do. Among other provisions, this legislation requires financial regulatory agencies to tailor regulatory actions to fit the risk profile and business model of supervised institutions. Not only will this ensure appropriately tailored compliance obligations for banks and credit unions of various risk profiles, but it saves valuable time and resources for bank examiners.  As it stands now, community banks are facing an ever-increasing regulatory burden that they can no longer shoulder. This has had a devastating impact on small banks, forcing consolidation or failure and stifling the creation of new banks in areas that need access to credit.  In December 2015, a report by the Dallas Fed highlighted this problem, noting that the regulatory environment tends to be one-size-fits-all and concluding that the regulatory oversight should match the risk level an institution poses to the financial system and the economy at large.  The CHOICE Act will stop the trend of increasing compliance costs and decreasing financial services.  Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Hensarling) for his tireless efforts on this legislation and urge my colleagues to support it.

4723,topic-id,196,"Mr.Chairman, one of the consequences of the financial crisis is the government had to step in with taxpayer dollars and bail out the financial industry.  Once Dodd-Frank was enacted, however, we were told: Don't worry. There will never be another bailout. Rest assured, the orderly liquidation authority under title II will give the FDIC all the tools it needs to resolve a failed financial institution.  Indeed, title II does give the FDIC the ability to borrow from the Treasury all of the taxpayer dollars it needs to reorganize a failed financial institution. That kind of sounds like a bailout to me.  The Financial CHOICE Act truly ends the risk of taxpayer-funded bailout. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, a failed bank will go through bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a tested, transparent process. Judges sitting in open court instead of unelected bureaucrats sitting behind closed doors will make consistent, predictable decisions based on decades of case law.  More importantly, bankruptcy puts the risk of failure on the bank's shareholders and creditors, not the taxpayers.  I urge my colleagues to support the Financial CHOICE Act, and truly put an end to the possibility of yet another taxpayer-funded bailout.                              {time}  1415  ",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgH4716-3.txt,2250,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,8.0,July

5162,topic-id,708,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding to me.  Mr.Chairman, I, first of all, thank Chairwoman This is her first time leading the Defense Appropriations bill on the floor. She has done so under very difficult circumstances, with a steadfast commitment to maintaining the tradition of cooperative bipartisanship on our subcommittee, maintaining transparency, and taking a thoughtful approach to solving problems.  Mr.Chairman, I would also like to express my immense gratitude to Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Lowey, the members of our subcommittee, and our exceptional staff for all of their hard work.  Mr.Chairman, we have a duty to provide predictable and timely appropriations to the Department of Defense and the rest of the Federal This is a consistent request by our senior Defense leaders. However, the House bills exceed the cap of fiscal year 2018 defense spending established under the Budget Control Act of 2011 by $72.5 billion.  If enacted as written and the budget control caps remain in place, the Department of Defense would face a sequestration of roughly 13 percent. The Department has still not recovered from the rash of problems caused the last time it was forced to deal with sequestration in 2013. In the second half of that fiscal year, the Department savaged its operations and maintenance accounts to continue ongoing contingency operations and to protect military personnel accounts. This resulted in the Navy idling an aircraft carrier at a pier in Norfolk, the Army canceling training rotations, and the Air Force reducing flight times for its combat aircraft, and widespread civilian furloughs. We simply cannot allow that to happen again in fiscal year 2018.  We have avoided sequestration in the last 4 fiscal years by adjusting the budget caps for both defense and nondefense appropriations. Those modest adjustments, done in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion, provided needed funding for our military, but also for our country's economic and physical infrastructure, scientific research, public health systems, and veterans' care.  Besides my frustration with the process, I have concerns about the significant increase in funding that this bill will provide to the Department: $60 billion more than last year and $29 billion more than requested by the administration.  I support providing additional funds to the Department, as I believe we are asking too much of our brave servicemembers and their families, but, putting it mildly, the world is also an unsettled place and not trending towards stability. But that being said, I believe that the Department will have great difficulty spending so many additional dollars in a timely and efficient manner.  Vacancies continue in important leadership positions. Hiring restrictions on civilian employees and a handful of ongoing strategic reviews will all slow the decisionmaking process. It is also unlikely that Congress will complete its work in a timely manner by October 1, and that any dollars provided will have to be spent in a compressed time period.  Additionally, I am not convinced that the administration evaluates dollars being spent on the military with the same criteria as it does with the rest of the Federal  In the Office of Management and Budget's Major Savings and Reform document for fiscal year 2018, it was a page-turner. With 150 proposals to allegedly save billions in discretionary programs, there was only one recommendation in 150--one--for the Department of Defense, with a potential to save only $2 billion by 2027. With a budget of roughly $600 billion a year, representing nearly half the discretionary spending, it is beyond the pale that OMB could only come up with a single savings point for the Department of  One final point is that I am highly disappointed that the Republican leadership has watered down language during committee markup regarding the Authorization for Use of Military Representative Barbara Lee's language would have established an eminently reasonable approach to updating 2001 legislation in authorization.  Congress must stop hiding from the debate, and carry out its constitutional responsibilities to support our troops in uniform and the civilian support staff that helps them out.

5038,topic-id,726,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act--FDARA--of 2017.  While it may not be headline news, for almost a year now, the Energy and Commerce Committee has been working in a bipartisan fashion on this critical legislation which will build on the landmark 21st Century Cures The FDARA will ensure that innovative and lower cost treatments, as well as lifesaving medical technologies, reach patients sooner.  Last month we reported this bill out of committee on a 54-0 vote. Unanimously, Mr. For starters, the FDARA updates and reauthorizes four user fee programs at the Food and Drug Though they sound like just another set of wonky Washington acronyms, the UFAs, as they are called--user fee agreements--are absolutely critical to the Food and Drug Administration's timely and consistent review of brand and generic drugs, biosimilars, and medical devices. They also maintain the agency's gold standard of patient safety.  Before the generic drug user fee program was established 5 years ago, there were literally thousands of applications pending at that agency--thousands. Significant strides have been made to clear that backlog, and the FDARA will build on that progress so that generics come to market as soon as safely possible. Make no doubt about it, this bill will increase competition and it will provide lower cost alternative medications to patients.  Through a series of hearings and markups at the Energy and Commerce Committee, Members on both sides of the aisle proposed a number of additional provisions to improve the processes at the FDA and to strengthen this legislation in ways that will benefit patients, medical product manufacturers, and the agency itself.  For example, my colleague from Oregon (Mr.Schrader), who I know is on the floor, partnered with the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Bilirakis) on meaningful ways to incentivize generic entry into markets where competition was lacking and patients were being exploited by bad actors. I thank them for their work on this effort. Their work will save patients money, and their work will get new products into the market sooner.  In addition, there are a number of improvements to the regulation of various medical technologies that will expand access, that will streamline bureaucratic processes, and that will lower costs.  Further, this legislation includes provisions that have been championed by Republicans and Democrats alike in both Chambers throughout their discussions on the user fee agreements, including a range of improvements to the pediatric drug and device development process, and guidance on ways to expand patient access to clinical trials.[[Page H5478]]  Finally, this legislation includes a revised version of the RACE for Children Act that Representatives McCaul, Mullin, and Butterfield have worked tirelessly on for quite some time.  H.2430 is the product of significant bipartisan and bicameral discussions with a wide range of stakeholders that went throughout regular order at the committee after a series of substantive hearings and then received a unanimous vote. Which, Mr.Speaker, is probably why nobody will ever read about this or see it on television, because we actually worked together and did it in a bipartisan way and achieved the unanimous vote that will bring drugs and devices to patients quicker, sooner, and safer in the long run.  This legislation is yet another example of Congress getting good things done. We are working together. And it is important to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work on this legislation, particularly full committee Ranking Member Pallone, Health Subcommittee Ranking Member Green, Health Subcommittee Chairman This bipartisan work has produced a big win for patients.  The FDARA will help bring lower-cost generic drug alternatives and biosimilars to market faster, increasing competition, lowering drug costs. It will streamline the process for reviewing or approving new treatments and cures for patients, ultimately delivering new and innovative therapies, drugs, and devices to patients more quickly.  Finally, this bill is a big win for the millions of Americans working in the healthcare sector and the drug and device manufacturers that help us live better and healthier lives.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I want my colleagues and all Americans to know this is just step one in a long-term effort in our committee to help patients get access to better medicines and lower costs.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for including my bill, the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity, or RACE, for Children Act, in this FDA reauthorization. I introduced the bill with my colleague, Mr.Butterfield, to strengthen the FDA's ability to require pediatric studies of cancer drugs during development.  Despite current programs in place to require similar studies, they have never been undertaken for cancer drugs. This bill will require a study into any cancer drug that uses ``molecular targeting,'' which attacks specific cancer cells rather than the part of the body where the cancer resides. By requiring these studies, doctors can determine whether a drug is safe and effective in children and, ultimately, provide accurate labeling for pediatric use.  I founded the Childhood Cancer Caucus when I first entered Congress to give a voice to the 15,000 children diagnosed with cancer every year and the hundreds of thousands of survivors who face a lifetime of medical challenges. Passing this bill will provide these children access to the treatments they deserve.  I thank all those involved for their tireless work in bringing this bill to the House floor. As my good friend, little Sadie Keller, who is battling leukemia as I speak, once said: ``Together, we can make a difference.''  To Sadie and all the children who are in the fight of their lives, I want you to know that today we are making a difference.

4984,topic-id,1344,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to associate myself with the chairman's remarks, especially the thanks of all the people involved in this. I think, Mr.Speaker, this is the third time we have come to this body this Congress, as the chairman and the ranking member of the VA Committee, as fellow veterans, as friends and American citizens, on issues of utmost importance to our veterans. We do have a constituency. We do have a special interest group that we look out for: America's veterans.  Those 18 groups, plus millions of Americans across this country, their collective voices through their organizations, through the Disabled American Veterans, through The American Legion, articulate every Congress in front of us what their top priorities are. This year, they came in front of us and said the three things that Congress needs to get done, needs to get right, and needs to get moving as soon as possible in this 2-year period that we have is: appeals reform, choice extension of care in the community, and an accountability bill.  Well, I am proud to say this is the third of those three. The other two have moved here in a bipartisan manner.  In the climate that we are in, and the uncertainty that the American public is feeling--quite honestly, probably the frustration they feel with this body--I think it is important to note that none of those things were easy lifts, none of them were locked in, and many of them contained things that were pretty ideologically polarizing.  Chairman Roe, through his leadership and with the professional staff, was able to navigate to get to that point that the top priority and focus was care for veterans--making sure that care is delivered in a timely manner; making sure those delivering the care are the best possible; and, as the chairman said, if they are doing their job, they are afforded their constitutional rights and appeals. If they are not, I agree with the chairman, they should be removed as quickly as possible. They should certainly not be rewarded for that. That strengthens the That strengthens those good employees.  Again, keep this in mind: This is the second largest agency in the Federal It has a $190 billion budget. It has 350,000-plus employees. It is an issue that unites us and that Americans are passionate about.  So we stand before you today with an issue that is unified, as Americans, as accountability. Certainly, the examples that Chairman Roe mentioned, no one is going to defend those. I am pleased because I think the chairman clearly understands that every time one of those issues goes unaddressed in a timely manner, it hurts the morale of the entire agency and erodes trust in the system by  Those veterans who use the VA system know they are getting quality care. On any given day, tens of thousands of appointments and procedures are being carried out in the most professional manner. All of that is undermined if a bad employee is allowed to not live up to those standards.  So I am pleased to say that I am in full support of this piece of legislation. The way this was done is the way we are taught in school how it is supposed to work. We debate, we send something there, we don't agree, then we let the Senate do that. We all work together to get something. We bring back that little, I am just a bill sitting on Capitol Now it is back over here. It is not perfect in everyone's mind, but it is certainly perfect in terms of how legislation is done and reaching those goals. Everyone compromised.  I think the chairman needs to be singled out on this. I thank him for commenting about Chairman We had Mike Michaud on our side work on that, too. Others have been here and done it, but we needed someone to get it over the line.  The three pieces I mentioned--appeals, choice, and accountability--are certainly things that were on everybody's mind. All three are going to pass through this  Just a couple of notes on this. This does maintain due process protections for employees, and I support that. I hope we can come together and pass the compromise piece.  The bill promotes accountability by giving the VA the tools it needs to hold bad employees accountable, while maintaining those constitutional-mandated workplace rights.  At this point, I would say that Secretary Shulkin has earned the trust of, certainly, this committee, certainly of the veterans service organizations, and I would say, if you don't know, the American people. He has asked for some of these things. I take that very seriously. If he says this will add to accountability, if he says this will make his job better in delivering care for veterans, that weighs heavily.  He asked us for these things. He asked and was part of making that. We should be grateful that he is willing to work with  It also requires VA to evaluate supervisors based on their protection of whistleblowers. This commonsense provision aligns the incentives for supervisors to protect whistleblowers when they shed light on dangerous situations and problematic employees at the agency.  I want to be clear: we don't support collective bargaining rights just because it is a union issue that we think should be there, those of us who ideologically believe workplace protections allow for a larger voice and protect good employees who are pointing out bad behavior from being arbitrarily fired without a collective will to fight back.  One person in a manager's office with no support or no legal right is a very dangerous situation. One employee being backed by workplace guarantees and their union collectively bargained rights helps make us stronger.  The bill requires the VA to improve its training regarding whistleblower disclosures. This is a really key piece. We want to ensure there are no excuses for employees at the VA to not know how to handle protected disclosures. Proper training will be a key to ensure all employees and not just supervisors understand the importance.  No matter what this bill does, it would be hard to support if it didn't do the things the chairman said. It does protect those constitutional rights. It maintains all existing due process protections in current law by ensuring there is notice and an opportunity to respond before an employee is fired.  The bill even improves the appeals process by requiring the VA to provide an employee with the complete evidence file when they are fired, thereby empowering them to appeal sooner. If someone is wrongfully accused of wrongdoing, now they are going to see and have the entire file. We are just asking that they do it sooner.  If someone commits one of the acts that the chairman talked about, it is indefensible for it to take 6 months or a year to have it adjudicated. We certainly want them to have a fair due process, but, again, if we are waiting to get that done, that is holding a position for someone else that could be serving veterans. It also keeps an employee under the cloud of not getting it done and moving on. If they are innocent, we want to move it on as quickly[[Page H4892]]as possible. We do not jeopardize or change any of their appeal process to come back.  Now is the time to bring real, long-lasting constitutional accountability measures to the Department of Veterans I would hope we could come together to pass this. Again, the entire goal of all of the people involved with this was to improve the care for this Nation's veterans, ensuring people's rights to be heard, and a fair due process if they are accused of something, but with the intention that if you are not serving our veterans in the manner that you should, then there are other places you should work. This ensures that those tools are there.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

5006,topic-id,584,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, you heard it from a wide range of folks here on the floor. This is the way Congress is supposed to work and this is what is expected of us. This is what my constituents in southern Minnesota expect, and this is what the gentleman from Tennessee's or the gentleman from Florida's constituents expect: look at a problem, assess it, come up with some different solutions, and debate those out.  I want to be clear, as I said earlier, these are tough issues. There was debate--heated debate. We may even have raised our voices a few times doing[[Page H4896]]this, but that is the way the world's greatest democracy is supposed to function.  Again, three of the most pressing issues, three of the top priorities of this Nation's veterans, all addressed in the first 6 six months of this Congress, all addressed to the satisfaction of a wide, bipartisan VSO community that is grateful for it.  I think, in trying to find these challenges and understanding them, people are trying to get at the heart of this. I do think there are great frustrations, and I have said, totally indefensible of the examples given.  But when we had this debate before, there were some examples of bad managers inadvertently firing people who were pointing out things that the manager was doing; and the due process considerations got that person their job back, and we got rid of the manager.  I think that when we first started debating this, I made the case that this could be a right-to-work bill in disguise. This bill is not that. This bill, as the chairman said, was not the intention. The intention was accountability. The intention of the bill was to streamline the process while protecting those due process rights.  I am grateful that the chairman, as always, kept his word. He followed through and he negotiated that.  The thing that I would say before closing here, Mr.Speaker, is that I agree with the majority leader. I think the combination of many things that we are doing possesses the potential to see real reforms moving in the right direction. Something that I think hasn't been mentioned here--that the Secretary did with consultation with the chairman, myself, and others--was that he took the action of streamlining the medical record procedure between the DOD, and the VA added to that.  There is transformational, generational-type change happening at the VA, but none of this will matter. And the majority leader said he expects to see that. We must ensure that it happens. We must ensure the accountability, we must monitor, we must ask that it is happening, and we must come back at this again. If there is a glitch that was unintended, let's come back at it again in this same manner of reaching an outcome.  This is a positive day, Mr.I would hope that those folks paying attention to this and watching--certainly the veterans, but everyone--know that Congress can work together; Congress can take on pressing issues; Congress can come up with bipartisan solutions; and Congress can agree that the thing that defines us most is not Republican or Democrat--it is U.citizen, it is veteran, and it is care for them.

I can't recall in my time here in the Senate where a proposal has been as universally panned by organizations from the left, right, center, and everywhere in between.  As perhaps the President is now acknowledging with the majority leader and a number of other Republican Senators, using his own quote, that ``nobody knew healthcare [was] so complicated.'' The fact is, the vast majority of Members on both sides of the aisle have realized healthcare is extraordinarily complicated. It is why it took years to fashion the ACA and why there are many of us, again, on this side of the aisle who continue to say we acknowledge, years after implementation of the ACA, that there are many things that need to be fixed, but the only way they are going to be fixed is if we do it in a bipartisan fashion.  Instead, the legislation that we were going to vote on tomorrow would have actually made healthcare much more expensive, less affordable, and less accessible for a whole wide breadth of Don't take my word for it; don't take these other elected officials' word for it. Let's look at well-respected, bipartisan groups.  The American Cancer Society said that the bill the majority leader put forward ``would be devastating for cancer patients and survivors.'' The American Medical Association said that the majority leader's proposal violates the very first dictate of the Hippocratic oath, which says ``do no harm.'' Obviously, this bill would have done a great deal of harm. The American Academy of Pediatrics says ``The bill fails [our] children.'' The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse says the Republican proposal ``will crush efforts to end the opioid epidemic.'' And the AARP says the proposal ``would leave millions, including our most vulnerable seniors, at risk of losing the care they need.''  But it is not just these leading healthcare organizations that have come out uniformly and virtually universally against what the majority leader had proposed. I am also hearing that from On Monday of this week, I attended an opening of the new PACE Program in Fairfax, The PACE Program--I know the ranking member on the Finance Committee has been a big advocate of the PACE Program--is a program that works in an extraordinary way at keeping seniors in their homes rather than having them migrate to nursing homes. Well, folks at the PACE Program in Fairfax were more than disturbed when they heard that the majority leader's proposal cuts Medicaid by $772 billion. Medicaid allowed so many folks to get access to healthcare, particularly if they had individuals in their family who might have severe disabilities. The majority leader's proposal, the per capita caps would actually take away the amount of health insurance they could receive.  The truth is, Medicaid covers 28 percent of all Americans and covers about 40 percent of all poor adults and seniors. In my State of Virginia, for those folks in PACE or in nursing homes, literally two-thirds of seniors who receive any kind of care receive care through  The cuts in this proposed bill would devastate our seniors and their families, and the cuts will not save money because so much of this is just the old-fashioned trickle-down that trickles down this responsibility to States that, again, would have to either raise their own taxes to take care of their responsibilities or, frankly, put out seniors who receive this critical care.  Mr.President, I also want to share with you and my colleagues a meeting I had last week with a series of families who came in. They had children or adults who had devastating disabilities.  I heard in particular from Marlo Dean from Virginia Beach, who was there with her 15-year-old son Dante, who has extensive health needs because of a rare brain disorder. Dante had just received a Medicaid waiver after being on the waiting list for 10 years. ",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgS3784-2.txt,1897,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,27.0,June

4902,topic-id,1078,"Mr.President, I am deeply relieved that the majority leader has delayed a vote on the Republican's cruel bill to rip up healthcare for 22 million people. People in Massachusetts and across this country spoke out against this terrible bill, and today they proved they can make their voices heard. But let's be clear. The Republican's so-called healthcare bill has come back to life already more times than the scariest zombie in a horror movie. Despite how deeply unpopular this bill is and how hurtful it would be to families across the country, Senator McConnell says he intends to vote as soon as the Senate returns in a little more than a week. That means that Senate Republicans still stand on the brink of passing legislation that will end health insurance coverage for 22 million people in  Make no mistake, if this plan passes, the rich will get richer and other people will die. I know that is a strong statement, and I know some people don't want to hear it. I know some people will hear it, but they don't want to believe it. But facts matter, and here is the fact that Republicans simply want to ignore: People without healthcare coverage are more likely to die than people with healthcare coverage. For many Americans, health insurance is a matter of life and death. Decades of rigorous academic research back this up. The data show that people with no health insurance die earlier than those with coverage.  For example, a 2009 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that uninsured people died at significantly faster rates than those with insurance. The authors claimed that lack of health insurance was associated with nearly 45,000 American lives lost in just 1 year. So 45,000 American lives were lost in 1 year. That is more people in this country dying for lack of health insurance than from breast cancer, and the impact isn't limited to adults. Johns Hopkins researchers found that sick kids without insurance who end up in the hospital are 60 percent more likely to die than the children down the hall who had health insurance.  In 2012, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine compared States that expanded Medicaid, which provided coverage to millions of low-income Americans, to those that didn't. They found that for every hundred thousand people in States that did not expand Medicaid, nearly 20 more people die every year than in the States that expanded That is right. More people died in States that refused to expand  Now, we know a lot about this in Massachusetts, which has been one of the best test cases for understanding how insurance affects death rates. We have been working for years--long before the Affordable Care Act--to expand health coverage. Today, with the help of the Affordable Care Act, more than 97 percent of people in Massachusetts have health insurance. That is the highest coverage rate in the entire country.  Researchers from Harvard and the Urban Institute studied our health reforms to figure out the impact of expanding coverage. Their results, a 2014 study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that Massachusetts health reform was associated with a 4.5-percent drop in preventable deaths. These data suggest that, nationwide, the ACA's coverage expansions are already preventing 24,000[[Page S3794]]deaths a year, and it is in effect in only 31 of the 50  I could keep going, but the consensus is clear. A new study, hot off the press, in the Annals of Internal Medicine put it bluntly: ``The case for coverage is strong.'' The reasons are actually pretty straightforward. People who don't have access to high-quality, affordable care--people who work as hard as they can but just don't have the money--can't go to the doctor when they need to; can't get preventive care, such as breast cancer screenings and vaccinations; and can't fill the prescriptions they need to stay healthy.  When someone doesn't have coverage, they typically wait to go to the doctor until things get really bad--when the cough turns into a rattle, when the lump gets too scary to ignore or the backache makes it impossible to even to walk. This is the reason why everyone who actually works in healthcare--doctors, nurses, hospitals, patient groups, researchers, experts--is coming out against the Republican bill.  The American Medical Association--the nation's largest association of doctors--says that the Republican bill violates the most basic principle of medicine: ``First, do no harm.''  The National Council for Behavioral Health, whose 2,900 member organizations provide mental healthcare and addiction treatment to 10 million Americans, said the bill would ``cost hundreds of thousands of lives.''  National Nurses United, representing 150,000 registered nurses across the country, said the bill would ``prove to be deadly for our nation's seniors.''  The President of a leading coalition of safety-net hospitals said about the Republican bill: ``Let's not mince words. . . . People will die.''  If the Republican bill passes, ``people will die.'' That is what the healthcare professionals are telling us. The Republican plan is to kick 22 million people off their health insurance. They want to slash tax credits that help people afford their premiums. They want to open the door to insurance companies to offer plans with higher costs and less coverage.  And why? Nothing in this bill--not one thing--improves healthcare for anyone--not one thing. No, the only reason for this bill is to finance $569 billion in tax cuts for a handful of millionaires and billionaires.  There has been a lot of concern about the discussion of healthcare getting overheated. The facts do not lie. The academic studies don't mince words. If the Republican healthcare bill passes, tens of thousands of people in this country will die every year.  Republicans can ignore these facts. They can turn away from these studies. They can pretend they don't know what is going on. But the people who lose their healthcare--the babies, the women, the seniors in nursing homes, the people with disabilities, the workers who get hurt on the job, the people who get hit by heart attacks and strokes and diabetes--will suffer all the same.  Yes, if the Republicans go forward with their bill, people will die. Those are the facts. We have less than 2 weeks to make sure the Republicans hear from everyone in this country who wants them to abandon this terrible bill once and for all.  I yield the floor.

The business model of some of the Wall Street banks is to play casino poker with taxpayer money, and that is what happened.

I had the experience of serving on the HELP Committee with Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray when we did the Education bill last year.  Education is nearly as fraught a topic politically around here as healthcare is, and what we saw in a thoughtful, regular-order process that was developed under Chairman Alexander's leadership was a very considerable piece of work with real effect.  Sometimes we agree on something on both sides of the aisle in this body because there is nothing to it. It is ``National Peaches Week'' or something, and everyone votes for that. But when it is something big and something consequential, that is where difficulties begin to emerge, and what the chairman was able to work in the committee was something big and something consequential on healthcare. To the end of my days in the Senate, I am going to remember that closing vote, when the clerk of the committee called the roll, and every single member of the HELP Committee voted in favor of the measure. It came out of the committee unanimously, and with that burst of energy, it came through the floor fine, and it passed the House without too many changes. It was just a remarkable piece of work.

I just think what the chairman has said is terrific, and I wanted to say a few words of appreciation.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 17 minutes in morning business.

5331,topic-id,2843,"Mr.President, to the disappointment of the American[[Page S4091]]public, the world scientific community, and even to corporate giants like Goldman Sachs and Cargill, President Trump recently decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris He cited as justification a slew of alternative facts. Some of the most egregious of these alternative facts came from a National Economic Resource Associates--a group we will call NERA in this speech--report that was commissioned and promoted by a group that calls itself the U.Chamber of Commerce but fronts for the fossil fuel industry. ``U.Chamber of Carbon'' might be a better and more accurate name for it.  The U.Chamber of Commerce, so-called, is a heavy hitter in It was the second largest spender of anonymous outside money, or dark money, in the 2016 Federal elections, second only to the National Rifle In addition to all that political election spending, it wields the largest lobbying force on Capitol In 2015, the chamber dropped over $100 million on lobbying.  The U.Chamber of Commerce is one of climate action's most implacable enemies, as everybody here knows, despite the good climate policies of so many companies on its board. Along with Senators Warren, Sanders, and others, I examined this inconsistency between the positions of the chamber and of its board members in our recent report, ``The U.Chamber of Commerce: Out of Step with the American People and its Members.''  Mr.I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record excerpts from the report, ``The U.Chamber of Commerce: Out of Step with the American People and its Members.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:The U.Chamber of Commerce: Out of Step With the American People and                               Its Members       A Report from Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth      Warren, Barbara Boxer, Bernard Sanders, Sherrod Brown, Jeff      Merkley, Richard Blumenthal, and Edward Markey               (Select Climate Change Specific Excerpts)                           Executive Summary       The United States Chamber of Commerce (the Chamber), the      largest lobbying organization in the country, has used its      considerable resources to fight legislation in Congress and      Obama Administration actions on tobacco and climate change at      home and abroad. A series of 2015 New York Times articles      exposed the Chamber's aggressive tactics to help the tobacco      industry fight international antismoking laws, regulations,      and policies, and described the organization's systematic      efforts to undermine the Environmental Protection Agency's      work to address climate change and carbon pollution. These      activities raised questions about the Chamber's policy-making      process; one analyst concluded that ``the Chamber is at odds      with the interests of some, if not most, of its membership in      three other areas: climate change, minimum wages and      tobacco,'' and described its advocacy as ``aligned with the      small number of companies that are its largest      contributors.''       In response to the 2015 allegations, Senators Sheldon      Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, Barbara Boxer, Bernard Sanders,      Sherrod Brown, Jeff Merkley, Richard Blumenthal, and Edward      Markey examined the positions and actions of Chamber Board      members to determine the extent to which the Chamber's      activities on tobacco and climate change reflect its Board      members' views and interests. The analysis focused on the 108      private-sector members of the Chamber's Board of Directors,      which the Chamber describes as ``the principal governing and      policymaking body of the U.Chamber of . . .      [that] determine[s] the U.Chamber's policy positions on      business issues and advise[s] the U.Chamber on appropriate      strategies to pursue.'' The findings of this analysis--based      on correspondence with the Chamber's Board members and a      review of publicly available information on Chamber Board      member positions on tobacco and climate change--reveal the      following:       The Chamber's positions and actions on tobacco and climate      change are at odds with those of its Board members.      Approximately half of the companies on the Chamber's Board of      Directors have adopted anti-tobacco and pro-climate positions      that contrast sharply with the Chamber's activities. Chamber      Board member companies have acknowledged the public health      harms of tobacco and support the efforts of their employees      to quit smoking. They have also taken public positions and      actions in support of efforts to reduce carbon emissions and      address climate change. Despite the positions of its Board      members, the Chamber opposes efforts in Congress and by the      Administration to address these issues.       Not a single Board member explicitly supported the      Chamber's lobbying efforts. In response to inquiries from      several senators, 21 Chamber Board members distinguished      their actions from the Chamber's on tobacco by describing      their own positive efforts, and five respondents      distinguished their actions and positions on climate change.      Five additional companies on the Chamber's Board explicitly      disagreed with the Chamber's positions on tobacco or tobacco      lobbying activities. For example, Chamber Board member      Celgene stated that it ``[does] not support tobacco use or      policies that promote tobacco use.'' Steward Health Care      Systems elaborated on its disagreement with the Chamber's      actions, saying that it ``was the only company on the Chamber      Board that went on record to oppose the initiative.'' Other      respondents sidestepped key questions and failed to respond      to questions about how they viewed the Chamber's activities.      Not one Board member explicitly supported the Chamber's      actions on tobacco and climate.       The Chamber's decision-making process and Board policy      decisions are not transparent. Ten Chamber Board members      revealed, in their responses to the congressional inquiries,      that they had no knowledge of or input into the Chamber's      lobbying activities on tobacco or climate issues. For      example, Chamber Board member Edward Jones, Inc., indicated      that the company ``[was] not advised of any campaigns... [and      is] not aware of any processes'' to develop these campaigns.      Sempra Energy reported that ``the issues raised in [the]      letter have not been discussed during the short time [it has]      been a member of the organization.'' Despite the Chamber's      description of the Board as its ``principal governing and      policymaking body,'' not one Chamber Board member explicitly      indicated that they were fully aware of and able to provide      their input and views to the Chamber regarding its actions on      tobacco and climate.       The findings in this report raise serious questions about      the Chamber's credibility and its actions on tobacco and      climate policy, and indicate that the Chamber does not      accurately represent the positions, input, and knowledge of      its membership.                            Introduction       The United States Chamber of Commerce is the largest      lobbying organization in the country. OpenSecrets, a      nonprofit, nonpartisan research group that tracks the effects      of money and lobbying, showed that in 2015 alone, the Chamber      spent roughly $85 million on lobbying efforts, more than      twice the amount spent by the second-highest organization      (the National Association of Realtors). During the 2013-2014      election cycle, the Chamber spent $35 million on political      expenditures (through super PACs, 501(c) organizations, and/     or political party committees) that were ``outside'' or      independent of candidates' campaign committees.       The Chamber has used its considerable resources to fight      legislation and government action on tobacco and climate      change at home and abroad. A series of 2015 New York Times      articles exposed the Chamber's aggressive activities helping      the tobacco industry to fight international antismoking laws,      regulations, and policies, and described the organization's      systematic efforts to undermine the Environmental Protection      Agency's work to address climate change and carbon pollution.       While the Chamber claims that it ``reflects the grassroots      views of the entire business community'' and that it      represents the ``interests of more than three million      businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions'' when it      interacts with Congress, its positions and actions on tobacco      and climate do not appear to reflect or communicate the      positions of many of its member companies. The following      analysis shows that approximately half of the companies on      the Chamber's Board of Directors have publicly taken      positions on tobacco and climate change that are in conflict      with the Chamber's actions and positions. This calls into      question the Chamber's allegedly transparent decision-making      process, and suggests that the Chamber does not accurately      represent the positions of its member companies.       Moreover, the Chamber's lobbying is at odds with its own      public positions. The organization strongly professes that it      is anti-tobacco, saying that it ``is not in the business of      promoting cigarette smoking at home or abroad, period.'' It      also claims to support the environment, saying that it ``has      in its public documents, Hill letters and testimony,      supported efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the      atmosphere,'' and calling for a ``comprehensive climate      change law.'' Plainly, there is a broad gap between the      Chamber's stated policies, its Board members' positions, and      its actual lobbying activities.       The Chamber's Lobbying on Tobacco and Climate Issues       When the Chamber weighs in, many in Washington, D.C.,      listen. The Chamber is the largest lobbying organization in      the country and claims to represent the ``interests of more      than three million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and      regions'' when it interacts with OpenSecrets, a      nonprofit, nonpartisan research group that tracks the effects      of money and lobbying, showed that in 2015 alone, the Chamber      spent roughly $85 million on lobbying efforts, more than      twice the amount spent by the second-highest organization      (National Association of Realtors). During the 2013-2014      election cycle, the Chamber spent $35 million on political      expenditures (through super PACs, 501(c) organizations, and/     or political party committees)[[Page S4092]]     that were ``outside'' or independent of candidates' campaign      committees.       The Chamber has attacked U.climate policies with similar      zeal. According to The New York Times, in early 2014, a group      of 30 corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists, and Republican      political strategists gathered at the Chamber's headquarters      to devise legal strategies to dismantle the President's Clean      Power Plan--before President Obama had even introduced a      draft proposal of it. The Chamber has also been vocal about      its opposition to climate action when testifying before      For instance, the Chamber has testified in      opposition to the Paris Agreement, despite the fact that many      of its Board member companies have pledged to support the      goals of the Additionally, nearly all of Chamber      campaign contributions--94%--have reportedly gone to climate      change denier candidates.                              Findings       Based on the responses to the Tobacco and Climate Letters      and public positions and policies of Board members, the      report finds that:       Approximately half of the companies on the U.Chamber of      Commerce's Board of Directors have anti-tobacco and/or pro-     climate positions.       None of the respondents to the Tobacco and Climate Letters      expressed explicit support for the Chamber's activities, and      numerous Chamber Board members distanced themselves from      Chamber activities on tobacco or climate.       The Chamber's decision-making process lacks transparency,      even with respect to its Board members. A number of Board      members were unaware of key Chamber policymaking and lobbying      decisions on tobacco and climate.                        Climate Change Findings       Almost half of the Chamber Board members (52 of 108, 48%)      have taken public positions supporting efforts to reduce      carbon emissions and address climate change, including eight      of the companies that responded to the Senate inquiry on      Chamber climate policies (see Appendix V). The remaining      Board member companies appear to have no public position on      climate change as a public health or environmental issue.       These 52 companies that support efforts to address climate      change, have undertaken their own initiatives to reduce      carbon emissions, support the EPA's work on climate change,      or have publicly committed to support of the Paris       Indeed, many Chamber Board members are national and      international leaders on this issue. For example:       Allstate is a member of the Ceres Company Network, a group      of companies that have agreed to improve their environmental      and social performance, publicly report on their      sustainability practices, and continuously improve their      performance and disclosure on sustainability issues. Allstate      was also named to the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index      (CDLI) from 2008 to 2014 for its efforts to reduce its carbon      footprint and transparency on its climate change adaptation.       AT&T is one of more than 150 companies to have signed on to      the American Business Act on Climate AT&T has      committed to reduce its direct greenhouse emissions by 20      percent and reduce its electricity consumption by 2020.       BMO Financial Group stated that it is ``focused on reducing      our environmental footprint, setting clear goals and      consistently maintaining carbon neutrality across our entire      enterprise.''       Las Vegas Sands was named to the CDP's ``A list'' in 2015      for its efforts to address and disclose corporate climate      change information.       Ryder received the EPA SmartWay Excellence Award in 2013      and 2014 in recognition of its efforts to address carbon      pollution and emissions.       Sanofi ``strives to reduce [its] environmental impact, so      that [it] can contribute to decreasing the effects of climate      change. This includes a two-pronged approach to reduce [its]      carbon footprint and to combat diseases directly correlated      with climate change.'' Sanofi says that it has reduced its      carbon emissions by 60 times, cut transport costs by 50      percent, and has set a goal of reducing its water consumption      by 25 percent between 2010 and 2020.       3M is a founding member of the National Climate      In its 2015 Sustainability Report, 3M touted its ``history of      proactive leadership in addressing both the challenges and      opportunities presented by climate change and energy      conservation.''       UPS stated it was ``pleased to join 12 other firms at the      White House on July 27, 2015, in launching the American      Business Act on Climate Change . . . [W]e pledged first to      reduce our carbon intensity by 20% by 2020, from a 2007      baseline. Second, we plan for our alternative fuel and      technology fleet, which will number about 8,000 trucks by the      end of the year, to have driven a cumulative 1 billion miles      by 2017.''       No Chamber Board members that responded to the Senate      letter explicitly supported the Chamber's lobbying actions on      climate policy. Seven respondents to the Climate Letter      indicated that they do not agree with every action taken by      trade associations of which they are a member, and three      companies declined to express a position. Two of the eleven      companies that responded to the Climate Letter (Citadel and      HCSC) indicated that they were not involved in the Chamber's      climate-related activities, and the other nine did not      indicate whether they were involved in the Chamber's climate      policy decision-making process.       Despite the fact that nearly half of Chamber Board members      have acknowledged the risk of climate change or are actively      working to address the risks of climate change, the Chamber      has opposed executive action on climate and lobbied heavily      in support of legislation undermining climate action,      assembling a ``vast network of lawyers and lobbyists ranging      from state capitols to Capitol Hill, aided by Republican      governors and congressional leaders,'' to oppose President      Obama's climate change regulations.                             Conclusion       The Chamber claims that it ``reflects the grassroots views      of the entire business community when the organization      testifies before Congress or regulatory agencies,      disseminates reports or statements to the media, or sends      comments or letters to Capitol Hill and to policymakers.'' It      states that ``everyone involved in the process must help      develop positions that benefit the entire business community,      rather than any given narrow interest . . . The process must      be open and above board.''       But this investigation fmds these claims to be plainly      untrue. Despite its claims of a representative policy-making      process, the Chamber does not speak for many of its Board      members on two of the most pressing public health issues of      our time. The discrepancy between how the Chamber and its      Board members act on tobacco and climate is stark. Bloomberg      columnist Barry Ritholtz contends that it is easy for the      Chamber to ignore its numerous member companies that oppose      its stance because one third of its revenue comes from just      19 companies, many of them in the energy industry.       Indeed, based on the responses of Chamber Board member      companies, the Chamber seems to act at will, without broadly      consulting its leading members about fundamental policy      positions on which it spends millions of dollars in collected      dues.       Some American business icons have demonstrated leadership      by disaffiliating themselves from the Chamber over      fundamental policy disagreements. Apple, Exelon, and Pacific      Gas and Electric (PG&E), have left the Chamber over its      destructive climate policies. Nike left the Board for similar      reasons, and other members--Intel, Johnson & Johnson, and      Microsoft--publicly disagree with and distance themselves      from the Chamber's climate position. And CVS Health withdrew      its membership from the Chamber last year due to the group's      tobacco lobbying.       Many Chamber members do good work to address the risks of      tobacco and climate change. But too many of these members      quietly disapprove of the Chamber's positions without taking      action. As long as these Board members lend their tacit      support to an organization that spearheads systematic efforts      against policies to limit tobacco and climate change, it is      difficult to accept their claims that they are anti-tobacco      or good on climate.       We encourage Chamber Board members to stop looking the      other way where there is disagreement, and defending their      Chamber membership as supporting free speech. This      positioning makes it appear as though they're trying to have      it both ways and damages their credibility and efforts in      support of positive action. These companies should take      responsibility for the positions and actions of the Chamber,      and use their leverage as an opportunity to shift the tenor      of a powerful lobbying force away from harming public health      and towards positions that help reduce tobacco use and      address the risks of climate change.

5332,topic-id,1430,"When President Trump announced his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, he used these alternative facts from that chamber-commissioned NERA report. Here is what Trump said:       Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the      onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United      States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by      2025. . . . This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs.  End of alternative facts quote.  This was another assertion:       By 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by      the previous administration would cut production for the      following sectors: paper down 12 percent; cement down 23      percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal--and I happen      to love the coal miners--down 86 percent; natural gas down 31      percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close      to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs,      while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many      cases, much worse than that.  End quote of his alternative facts.  Countless reviewers, including PolitiFact, Scientific American--that known crazy, phony, liberal publication, Scientific American--CNBC, and Fortune magazine, fact-checked the President's speech. It did not fare well. PolitiFact warned us to ``take these statistics with a grain of salt.'' An analysis of the underlying report was done by Kenneth Gillingham, an economics professor at Yale He pointed out that the NERA study made up a hypothetical set of policy actions to reach those goals. Those policy actions may well never have been[[Page S4093]]taken by anyone to comply with the Paris Agreement, but that was what they used. Second, NERA only modeled the cost side.  You have heard the phrase ``cost-benefit equation.'' They only looked at the costs. They didn't ever look at the benefit side. This is phony accounting when you only look at one side of the ledger.  NERA, of course, has a history of producing misleading reports for its industry sponsors. In 2015, it released a report for the National Association of Manufacturers on the proposed ozone standard, claiming it would cost as much as $140 billion per year. On the cost side, EPA estimated it would cost a fraction of what NERA estimated, less than 12 percent. The economic consulting firm Synapse analyzed the NAM report and found it ``grossly overstates compliance costs, due to major flaws, math errors, and unfounded assumptions . . . these assumptions and other flaws led NERA to overstate compliance costs by more than 700 percent.''  That is just on the cost side. Once again, they didn't even bother to look at the benefits. It is a one-side-of-the-ledger-phony analysis. Of course, the chamber commissioned NERA to do the same thing for it on climate: overestimate the costs and ignore the benefits. In this world of climate denial, this is a classic maneuver.  Senator Ted Cruz cited the NERA report in his CNN op-ed urging President Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement a day before President Trump cited these stats in his withdrawal speech.  Cruz, Trump, and the chamber ignored more than 1,000 companies that supported the United States remaining in the Paris Agreement, including several chamber member companies. Some of these have publicly distanced themselves from the chamber as a result of the President's decision. A recent Bloomberg news article was headlined, ``Paris Pullout Pits Chamber Against Some of Its Biggest Members.''  Citigroup said: ``We have been outspoken in our support for the Paris agreement and have had a dialogue with the Chamber about how its views and advocacy on climate policy are inconsistent with Citi's position.'' Similar distancing came from Dow and  Over the weekend, the Washington Post ran a piece, ``Is the most powerful lobbyist in Washington''--that is the so-called U.Chamber of Commerce--``losing its grip,'' exploring this tension around climate in more detail. The article said: ``[P]erhaps the most nettlesome issue for the Chamber has been climate change.'' It calls out the chamber's claims to be neutral on the Paris Agreement, while actually providing ``ammunition for foes of the agreement.''  The article highlights the chamber's climate denial efforts, including its 2009 proposal to hold a public trial on climate science--what it dubbed ``the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century.'' New Mexico-based utility PNM Resources actually quit the chamber because that idea was so preposterous.  The Washington Post identified 8 of the 25 companies that signed an ad in the New York Times supporting the Paris Agreement as chamber members, including GE, Microsoft, and Walt The CEOs of these companies publicly criticized President Trump's decision.  Microsoft's Brad Smith said:       We're disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris      Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to      achieve its goals.  GE's Jeff Immelt said:       Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris      Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend      on government.  Walt Disney's Bob Iger said:       As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the      President's Council over the #Paris Agreement withdrawal.  The chamber is out of step with its own members on climate change, maintaining a scientifically untenable position as every one of our State universities knows. Who is pulling the chamber's chain? It is hard to tell since the chamber hides from the public who its donors are, but I suspect the answer is the same as to why the Republicans continue to revive the hated, zombie healthcare bill despite huge public distaste for it.  Mr.President, that brings me to the nomination of John Bush to the U.Court of Appeals for the Sixth The chamber's rigid anti-climate stance is part of a fossil fuel political program that holds this Chamber in a state of intimidation and inaction on climate change. As Congress cowers before this fossil fuel political presence, we are now advancing the nomination of a climate denier to the Federal bench.  John Bush was not nominated because of any track record of distinguished performance or demonstrated commitment to public service. To the contrary, his most notable achievements seem to be a series of wildly offensive blog postings and public statements, denying that climate change is real and mocking it, comparing a woman's right to choose to the evil of slavery, casually using vile slurs against gay people. On and on goes the list.  Bush has written a number of posts dealing with environmental issues in which he insists on placing the terms ``global warming'' and ``climate change'' in quotation marks, insinuating that they do not really exist. Tell that to your home State universities.  With this appalling track record, why was he nominated? It is not hard to figure that out. He is here because through those offensive blog posts and by flagging himself as a loyal climate denier, he signals himself as a willing foot soldier of the big special interests. These big special interests are intent on capturing our courts, just as they have captured so much of  Judicial nominees like Mr.Bush are exactly what these special interests want, to make sure they can, first, maintain their dark money influence. That is their most particular key. That is the mother ship off of which all the other special interest mischief they perform comes from and of course to see to it that these big interests are never held accountable to the American people. That is the signal he sends.  Bush has flagged that he will rule the right way for the big special interests that fund the Republican Party, and the special interests' big reward is his nomination and confirmation. He has shown that he is familiar with the recipes when it comes time to cook the decisions.  My Democratic colleagues and I respect any President's desire and prerogative to fill the vacancies in the executive and judicial branches.

Jews have lived in Oregon for more than 165 years. Many immigrated here to escape the horrors of the Holocaust; others came with the hope of finding a new life in a new land. I am the son of immigrants who fled Nazi Germany, so this history is especially personal. As a proud American Jew, I know that for each dark chapter in our history, there is a story of perseverance, of hope, of triumph. The rich traditions and culture within the Jewish community must be preserved and taught for generations to come. That is why I am so proud of the work done by the community in Oregon and by the Portland museum staff and board to bring this museum to an even grander scale.  The museum has come a long way from its initial beginnings when it was known as the museum without walls. From the first exhibition, ``Jews of Greece,'' at the Multnomah County Central Library in 1990, interest grew-and so has the museum's footprint.

4872,topic-id,1230,"Mr.President, the last few days have proven, once again, that political change in America doesn't start in Washington, DC, and then trickle down. It is from the bottom up.  Because millions of Americans called and texted and tweeted their opposition to an abomination of a health plan, that plan is not going to be on the Senate floor this week, thanks to grassroots It is so appropriate at this hour. I also want to make clear we have a bottom line for the next 2 weeks. We have an incredible amount of heavy lifting we have to do to make sure working families and seniors get a fair shake from the American healthcare system.  I say that because, as we speak, Senate Republicans are at the White House strategizing with the The horse-trading has already begun, and the Senate Republicans have a slush fund paid for by working families that contains hundreds of billions of dollars that can be used for sweetheart deals that would get them the 51 votes needed to pass this horrendous healthcare bill in the U. Now I will turn to what we need to focus on in the next 2 weeks at townhall meetings, civic group lunches, discussions with rural healthcare providers. That focus has to be to highlight what this flawed Republican bill really means and how it can't be fixed no matter how much money the Republican leadership throws at these problems. This bill is a healthcare smash-and-grab, designed to benefit the fortunate few, and is paid for by hundreds of billions of dollars in reductions from Medicaid--tax breaks for the wealthy that Senate Republicans are so anxious to dole out, they are willing to make them retroactive. Contrary to what Senate Republicans say, their tax changes don't create jobs. They do create tax windfalls.  Exhibit A, under their bill, you have a $1 million capital gain in February, and, if this bill passes, that lucky person would get a $38,000 tax break. Many of these gains go directly into the pockets of America's 400 most affluent families, while disabled kids, those with opioid addictions, and families where a baby boomer has the misfortune of having a stroke and needs nursing home care face the prospect that the crucial health services they need--services that are life and death for them--will not be there because of this flawed healthcare bill.  Next, I want to point out that over the next 2 weeks, we are going to lay out how this legislation would send costs into the stratosphere for millions and millions of Start with older people who are about to get hit by what I call a double-age tax. If this bill goes through, insurance companies will have a green light to charge older Americans more than they charge younger people. As if that doesn't raise their costs enough, older Americans are also going to be forced to pay a higher share of their income on healthcare costs because the Senate Republican bill shrinks their tax benefits as they age. Older Americans need more healthcare. They can't afford to skimp out on bare-bones insurance. So many of our older people are going to see their premiums nearly quadruple.  It is not just older Americans who are going to see their costs jump. Right off the top, hundreds of thousands of middle-class families across the country are going to lose tax cuts for healthcare because the Republican bill snatches away their eligibility.  When it comes to the private insurance market, this bill is centered on a plan to push Americans into bargain-basement healthcare coverage. After all the talk about deductibles and out-of-pocket costs being unaffordable, this[[Page S3785]]Republican proposal ties middle-class benefits to high-deductible, low-value insurance plans. It is a sleight of hand to make it look like consumers are getting a better deal and lower premiums.  Here is the reality. Of course you can make premiums go down if you force people into insurance that only covers bandaids and a bottle of aspirin. When people get sick or suffer an injury, they are going to read the fine print on their insurance. With this legislation, if it were to pass, they would see sky-high deductibles and cut-rate coverage. For working families, they would face the prospect they would get buried under medical debt because their insurance doesn't cover the care they actually need.  Finally, not even people who get their insurance at work--those folks probably thought they were home free in this debate--not even folks who get their insurance at work are safe from the Senate Republican healthcare plan. Four million Americans are going to lose their employer-sponsored insurance coverage just next year if this bill goes through. Tens of millions of Americans could once again face some of the worst insurance company abuses--annual and lifetime limits on coverage. Those are limits the Affordable Care Act banned, but Republicans are proposing to bring them back.  Let's be real clear. If you bring them back and don't protect people from skyrocketing costs, it means that if they develop cancer, they could bust through their coverage limit, and, once again, we would go back to the days in America where those folks were forced into personal bankruptcy because millions of people without coverage will be unable to pay for the care they need. People with employer-based insurance are going to get hit with a hidden tax in the form of higher premiums.  So if an American listening to this is considering early retirement, think again. The cost could well be too high. If you were thinking of leaving your job, becoming an entrepreneur, and starting your own business, you can think again. Your costs could be higher under this plan, especially if you have specific medical needs.  Then there is the generation of adults in the workforce today--people who are middle class, who are doing everything they can to support their families and save whenever possible. They may not be thinking about the expense of long-term care, but the fact is, growing older in America really costs a lot.  Because of this bill, millions of people will no longer be able to count on Medicaid being there to cover their long-term care in a nursing home or at home where they are most comfortable later in life.  I want to close by way of saying that what we have to do now is make sure that--to beat this destructive Republican bill; this is the only way to do it--Americans keep tweeting, keep sending letters, keep finding rallies to attend, tell your stories about how you are going to do worse with this bill. And then tell your friends' stories and your family's stories. It is a virtual lock that this bill is going to come back around.  I close today by way of saying that grassroots America, by speaking out--the fact that they did that and did all that work I have described is why this flawed bill is not going to be voted on in the Senate this week. We need everybody over the next 2 weeks, seniors and working families and people all across this country--my message is that we need you to stay loud because that is the only way we will finally stop this bill in its tracks.

4899,topic-id,813,"To wrap this up, Mr.President, I was struck when Senator Menendez talked about the Senate Republican health bill being more for less. I think millions of Americans might say it is a classic bait-and-switch. After the horrible House bill was passed, Senate Republicans and the Trump administration promised something new. It would have more heart. It would be less mean. But essentially what they have done is doubled down on exactly what the American people rejected in the House bill--the secrecy, the fact that the breaks went to the fortunate few and the pain went to millions of Americans who needed nursing home care, who have youngsters with special needs, or who are disabled.  The fact is that the process Senate Republicans have used on this health reconciliation bill hasn't gone well. That is why they can't go forward with consideration of their healthcare bill this week. And it looks as though--I heard remarks from one of our senior colleagues early this afternoon--it looks as though the same darn thing is going to be used for tax reform. Once again, a bill processed behind closed doors, without any input from the other party--it looks as if that is the route that is going to be taken on tax reform. I think that is unfortunate.  I have made it very clear--very clear--to the Trump administration that the history of successful tax reform is bringing both sides in early and finding ways to secure principles that each side feels strongly about that the other can live with. There has been no such consultation--zero--with respect to this administration and Democrats on the Finance  I am struck, because I wrote, over the last decade, what are the only two bipartisan Federal comprehensive tax reform bills--first with our former colleague, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and most recently with the new head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Senator Coats, and we have had no consultation on the substance of tax reform. That is a prescription for trouble. It is, in effect, walking away from the history that the only way to get a sustainable, bipartisan tax reform plan is to get both sides together, not do what is being discussed now openly in the media: that the Republican leadership and the Trump administration are going to write a tax bill and then just pop it on the American people in the fall. And I anticipate it will be more of the same in terms of stacking the deck dramatically in favor of the fortunate few.  I say this because we heard again what appears to be the plan of the Senate Republicans to kind of double down on the flawed strategy of healthcare, which is just to do it in secret and then expect to see if maybe they can get a couple of Democrats to go along. Then they can say: Oh, that is a bipartisan bill.  That is not a bipartisan bill.  A bipartisan bill is the kind of work that was done in 1986 with my predecessor, Senator Packwood, and Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who was another tall Democrat on the Finance A big group got together and worked out a bill that made sense, broadened the tax base, and gave everybody in America the chance to get ahead.  My hope is that over the next 2 weeks, in terms of defeating a flawed healthcare bill and showing that there needs to be a different path for tax reform, the American people will keep making those calls, keep tweeting, keep texting, keep going to rallies, keep going to meetings where healthcare providers get together and say: Look, this healthcare bill that Republicans are talking about does not work for us, and it does not work for our parents and our grandparents and youngsters and the disabled folks and those who need opioid services.  Again, I thank my colleagues from the Finance We have had something like eight colleagues participate in this over the last hour.

It was all of that citizen involvement that caused the Republican leadership to put this bill off, but it is a lock--an absolute lock--that it is going to come up again in a couple of weeks.

For more than 40 years, the CBO has steadfastly fulfilled its mission providing impartial analysis and expertise to inform our decisionmaking.  The CBO Director and all personnel are appointed to their positions without regard to their political affiliation, solely based on their ability and qualifications. They show no allegiance or deference to any political ideology or party when preparing their analyses.  It is all too easy these days to take refuge in information that tells us only what we want to hear. But that does not lead to sound policy.

Steve Scalise, Matt Mika, and Zack Barth, who were also injured that day, and everyone else on that baseball field, are alive today because of those Capitol Police officers, and we continue to wish a speedy recovery to everyone who has been injured.  We, as a Congress, owe it to the Capitol Police to ensure they have the necessary resources to meet their mission in an increasingly polarized climate. And after working with Mr.Ryan, we believe we have appropriately prioritized those needs, taking a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safety and security of not only Members of Congress, but our staff, visitors, and the constituents we serve.  We provide resources and make structural changes that will address security concerns both here at the Capitol and in our home districts, including $29 million in new resources to the Capitol Police for increased security, $5 million to the House Sergeant at Arms for district office security, and support for House Administration's authorization to increase $25,000 per MRA account to address Members' physical security when they are away from the Capitol complex. We also invest new resources in cybersecurity measures to protect attacks on our digital information.  After more than 20 hearings, briefings, and tours of various portions of the Capitol complex since January, we have included $581 million in total for the Architect of the We recognize the continuing challenge of preserving and maintaining our infrastructure and prioritizing critical projects in the current fiscal climate.  We have included funding to restore and renovate House office buildings, upgrade the Capitol Power Plant, and several other projects. We fund a Revitalization Fund to finance major repairs and renovations to facilities in the House for future years, and we are planning ahead to try and save costs.  Overall, we provided $648 million for the Library of Congress, with new funding going to IT improvements library-wide, as well as specific copyright modernization initiatives.  In total, we provided $48.5 million for the Members of this body on both sides of the aisle have their differences in opinion with CBO estimates and how it arrives at those conclusions. In some cases, frankly, the CBO is wrong, but, at the end of the day, it serves an important purpose and needs the appropriate resources to do its job.  We also increased funding for the Government Accountability Office to ensure that they root out fraud, waste, and abuse in government.  Mr.Chair, in crafting this project, Ranking Member Ryan and I sought the thoughtful feedback of Members throughout this committee and this body. There are various initiatives we can all be proud of, initiatives that serve our constituents and produce efficiencies and transparency in the way that Congress operates, including increasing openness and transparency and producing efficiencies by publishing nonconfidential CRS reports online, expanding the Wounded Warrior Project, which helps Members hire veterans. We increased total slots by more than 57 percent.  In conclusion, in all, this bill represents a frugal approach at funding the basic operations of We do so in a fiscally responsible manner, keeping House budgets historically low and prohibiting pay increases in We are improving transparency and accountability at the same time.  I would like to thank Ranking Member Ryan and his staff, Anne Sokolov and Adam Berg, as well as my staff, Tim Monahan, Liz Dawson, Jenny Panone, and Joe Eannello, and to all the members of the subcommittee for their work and participation in the process this year.  Mr.Chair, I urge this body support this legislation.  ",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgH6335.txt,2021,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,26.0,July

5186,topic-id,510,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his amendment to add $1 million to the already $545 million that we spend on the Government Accountability  The GAO plays an important role in being a government watchdog. They are the sort of watchdog of what happens in this city. And we are all certainly concerned, whether it is a Democrat or Republican President, that we want a GAO that can do its work and to root out fraud, waste, and abuse, provide economic data for Congress, help us to do our job in holding our government accountable, and help the American people hold our government accountable.  That is why we work on this bill, to keep funding steady for the GAO and to help centralize IG reports to make them ultimately public and online to increase transparency. But we have tight constraints on our budget.  Even so, while we work to fund additional security needs, critical infrastructure projects that need to be funded, and much-needed cybersecurity improvements, reducing the amount of money that goes to MRAs from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle would weaken our ability to represent our constituents, weaken our ability to effectively communicate with our constituents. I don't think that is the gentleman's intent here, but that would be the ultimate result.  We actually have a slight increase in what the GAO can spend in our budget, getting up to $545 million. So there is a slight increase here, and that is at a time in which many budgets are being decreased across Many of our constituents are tightening their belts and learning how to do more with less in the challenges they face putting food on the table for their families and really working in a family budget. We have to do the same thing here in Congress, Mr. The GAO actually gets slightly more money this year, and they have the ability to continue to carry out their function at $545 million. And I don't believe going to $546 million is going to achieve the significant changes that maybe Mr.Connolly would like to see.  Ultimately, we are not able to accommodate this request, Mr.Our Member budgets are already 12 percent below what they were when the Republicans took over the House in 2010.                              {time}  1715  We are 12 percent below, even with this expenditure, and many Members are concerned that they don't have the resources to provide what they need to for their constituents. So cutting these budgets by $1 million more would only exacerbate those problems.  Mr.Chairman, we would have to oppose this amendment. We want the GAO to remain strong, and that is why we slightly increased their funding, but we can't really rob the MRA budgets to add to that with the many challenges we have and many priorities in this  Mr.Chairman, I would oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

5199,topic-id,491,"Mr.Chair, I want to thank Mr.Kildee for his leadership in bringing this to this body's attention.  I think the work of our men and women in service defending our Nation is the highest priority for this Congress, and our support for them in services, in healthcare, in helping them find work, in education, in training, all the things they need when they come home, I think we are unified in our support that they should be recognized as the heroes they are when they come back and leave service.  Some of these men and women, in putting themselves in the field of battle have become wounded, and sometimes very severely. They have stood in the field of battle. They have stood up to our enemies. They have protected freedom around the globe and here at home, keeping us and our allies, our children, our families safe, keeping freedom and democracy safe; yet, when they come home, all too often, they don't have everything they need. All too often, they don't feel that the promises this government has made have been kept. So each and every day I think we are working on legislation to improve that.  We have passed bills in recent weeks here to continue and improve veterans' programs, but the House Wounded Warrior Program is a great example of how this Congress is leading by example by creating 2-year fellowships for disabled veterans.  The unemployment rate is higher for these men and women than it is for nonveterans, and disabled veterans in particular, and so this fellowship program provides a valuable job, a valuable experience, an opportunity for these men and women to help serve their country, which is in their It is who they are.  When they are done serving on the battlefield, they can come serve in our congressional offices, and it provides a great service for us. They provide the opportunity for us to have an expert on not only veterans' issues and military issues, but many issues. They can cover a whole range of things, providing better services for us and our constituents.  In our legislation, the underlying bill, we increased the total number of fellowships to 85 from 54 because there is a waiting list. This is a 57 percent increase over the previous number. And 79 Member offices are on the waiting list right now to participate in this program, so the demand is there.  We certainly know that there are many veterans who would love to serve in this capacity, and so we are excited to support this amendment putting more resources into this program, and we are going to work with the gentleman from Michigan to make sure that we can open up slots in a timely manner to help make sure we get these men and women into the offices so they can serve.

5225,topic-id,474,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate my good friend and colleague and co-chair of the Deaf Caucus, Mr.Takano from California, for bringing this amendment, and unfortunately, I cannot support it, Mr.Chairman, and we would ask that the body reject it.  You know, Congress terminated funding for the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995, so some 22 years ago, but it is back from the dead to be here on the floor today to be reestablished.  At one point, funding totaled over $20 million for the Office of Technology Assessment, but Congress did one of the things it has attempted to do in many areas, which is try to consolidate government, make government more efficient, make it do more with less, and so they transferred the functions from the Office of Technology Assessment over to the  We have heard debate on this floor within the last hour about the value of the GAO and the great work they do and how the GAO is a trustworthy organization and how it is important that we continue to fund them, yet, in this instance, they want to take these responsibilities away from the  In fact, in fiscal year 2008, a permanent technology assessment function within the GAO was established by a recommendation from the Senate Committee on They allocate at least $2.5 million per year to technology assessment, and they have established the capability to produce technology assessments in many areas.  They have hired scientists, engineers, and other technical specialists to respond to congressional requests. They produce three to four technology assessment reports each year. The GAO uses its technical staff to support other reports for Congress that have technology implications, such as privacy and vulnerability of computer components in cars.  The GAO receives three to four requests per year specifically for technology assessments, and many others have a technology as an aspect.  They have been able to testify on these topics recently on the Zika virus and on transfer of technologies developed with Federal research funds to the marketplace. They provide thorough and balanced analysis of critical technological innovations that affect our society, the environment, and the economy.  And so creating another Federal agency that is going to require additional resources and to have it offset from investment in capital projects, to me, is the wrong direction. I think, in current law, we have more than enough resources heading in this direction. Taxpayers are counting on us to find ways to spend less money, to keep programs efficient, and so the idea that we create a new agency that has been gone for 20 years today and fund it for millions of dollars, to me, is inconsistent with the values we all, I think, espouse about making government more efficient, more effective.

Mr.Chair, $1 million is big money in States like Kansas and Oklahoma and across the country. It is real dollars to the people who get up and pay their taxes to this country.
