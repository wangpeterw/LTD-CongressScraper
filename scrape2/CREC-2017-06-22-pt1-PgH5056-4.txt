            RECOGNIZING THE NORA SANDIGO CHILDREN FOUNDATION

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Nora 
Sandigo Children Foundation, a nonprofit organization in my home city 
of Miami, working around the clock to serve kids in our community who 
have been separated from their parents by deportation.
  I have known Nora, the founder of this organization, for many years, 
and I have seen firsthand her true passion for ensuring the well-being 
of these children. Through the support of donors and volunteers, this 
organization is able to provide assistance in the form of food, 
clothing, educational programs, legal advice, and many other vital 
services.
  This week, Nora will be visiting our Nation's Capital, with a 
delegation of 50 children from Florida, to advocate for the 
restructuring of our immigration policies so that the kids for whom she 
cares, who are as American as you and I, don't have to grow up apart 
from their parents.
  Mr. Speaker, our Nation must do right for these children, and I urge 
my colleagues in Congress and the administration to work together so 
that we can have an immigration system that reflects our Nation's 
compassion and provides a solution that is fair and just to everyone.
