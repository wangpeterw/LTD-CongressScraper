    CUTTING TAXES FOR THE SUPERRICH AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong 
opposition to the Republican deal to cut taxes for the superrich at the 
expense of everyone else.
  Apparently, Republicans believe the American people are just too 
distracted to recognize a con game when they see one. But make no 
mistake, the Republican plan is about giving tax breaks to the largest 
corporations and the superrich. It is not about the middle class or 
people who have to go to work every day. If working families had an 
opportunity to read the fine print, they would see that this bill has 
nothing to do with them.
  Don't be fooled. The money needed to make this plan work has to come 
from somewhere. It will hurt working Americans and will cause our 
deficit to explode.
  The strength of our country requires investing in people: so our 
children can have a better future, so their parents can have better 
jobs, so small businesses can thrive, and so seniors can retire with 
dignity. That is the America that we want, and that is the American 
promise we must keep.
