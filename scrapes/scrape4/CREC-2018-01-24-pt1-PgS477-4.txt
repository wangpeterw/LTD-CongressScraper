                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father, the center of our joy, we thank You that You are in the 
midst of life's battles with us, bringing good even from the 
abnormalities of our pilgrimage. Lord, we are grateful that through the 
struggles and tears, You stand within the shadows, keeping watch over 
Your people.
  Lord, even though our lawmakers may not always know how the pieces 
fit together, we are grateful that they can still strive with thankful 
hearts to do Your will. May they remember Your command in 1 
Thessalonians 5:18: ``In everything give thanks, for this is God's will 
for your life.''
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
