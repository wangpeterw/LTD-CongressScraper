                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God Almighty, may our lawmakers take refuge in the shelter of 
Your wisdom and providence. Remind them that You are the potter and 
they are the clay. As they trust You to make the vessel You desire, 
fill their hearts with willingness to know and do Your will.
  Lord, give them the wisdom to trust You to open doors that no one can 
shut, and close doors that no one can open. Do for them more than they 
can ask or imagine. In all they do, may they live for Your glory.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
