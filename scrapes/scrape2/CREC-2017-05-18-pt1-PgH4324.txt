                            CHANCE FOR PEACE

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, President Eisenhower's most 
famous speech was his farewell address in which he criticized the 
military industrial complex.
  However, 7 years earlier, in April of 1953, he gave a speech, 
entitled, ``The Chance for Peace,'' with these words: ``Every gun that 
is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the 
final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who 
are cold and are not clothed. . . .''
  ``The cost of one modern heavy bomber,'' Eisenhower added, ``is this: 
a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power 
plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. . . . We pay for a 
single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a 
single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 
people. . . .''
  Eisenhower concluded: ``This is not a way of life at all, in any true 
sense . . . it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.''
  President Eisenhower loved the military, but he hated war. He would 
never have gone along with a 16-year war in a place like Afghanistan, 
especially since it is one mainly done for personal glory for generals 
and more money for defense contractors.
