                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Eternal Lord, the fountain of wisdom, thank You for Your mighty love. 
Give our lawmakers the will and strength they need to meet the 
challenges of these times. May they bend their ear to Your Spirit's 
voice and follow Your leading. Lord, activate their conscience as You 
motivate them to live with honor. Keep them vigilant to look for 
redemptive possibilities in each of life's seasons, finding wisdom in 
Your precepts. May they hear the murmur of Your truth so they will not 
deviate from Your path.
  Father of life, fill the precious hours of this day with Your 
presence.
  We pray in Your majestic Name. Amen.
