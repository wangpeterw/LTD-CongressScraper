              DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON MILLIONS OF FAMILIES

  (Ms. TSONGAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, since the Affordable Care Act was signed 
into law, millions of Americans have gained access to valuable 
healthcare services, and every American has seen their health insurance 
benefits improve.
  While there are ways the Affordable Care Act can be improved, we 
cannot afford to go back to the days when big insurance companies had 
the power to decide what care Americans could receive, deny coverage to 
children with diagnosed conditions, cancel coverage

[[Page H247]]

when people got sick, and place limits on the amount of care people can 
receive.
  Last week, Carol Lodi from Harvard, Massachusetts, in my district, 
called and told her story. She and her husband gained healthcare 
coverage under the Affordable Care Act. She is 61. Her husband is 63. 
They are self-employed. She said: ``If we lose the insurance, we don't 
know what we'll do.''
  Mr. Speaker, please listen to the Lodi family and millions of other 
families like them. Don't turn your back on them and make America sick 
again.
