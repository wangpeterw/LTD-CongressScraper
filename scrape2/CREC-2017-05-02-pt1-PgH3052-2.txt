                   OPPOSE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to speak in 
opposition to the Republican healthcare bill that is once again under 
consideration in this House.
  Mr. Speaker, it feels like Groundhog Day all over again. The bill is 
back, and rather than coming to the table to discuss ways we can all 
work together to improve health care for every American, Republicans 
are again trying to jam through a misguided bill that would threaten 
the health care of thousands of Granite Staters and literally millions 
of Americans.
  Just a few weeks ago, I joined with my colleagues to highlight a 
particularly egregious provision of this bill that would jeopardize 
access to health care for 7 million veterans. Weeks later, these 
provisions remain in the bill, and this is unacceptable. We had the 
time, and the Republicans failed to fix this.
  It is wrong for America, and it is wrong for millions of veterans. I 
urge Members to oppose the bill.
