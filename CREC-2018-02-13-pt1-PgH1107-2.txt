                     HONORING THE LIFE OF RAY BAUM

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I come to pay tribute to the life of Ray 
Baum, the Republican staff director of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee.
  Ray passed away on Friday after a courageous fight against cancer.
  I will always remember Ray as an optimist. During our ongoing 
committee negotiations on an autonomous vehicles bill, Ray was always 
pushing us, looking for a solution that both Democrats and Republicans 
could support. He was always optimistic about our prospects. Thanks to 
his prodding, we were able to pass a bipartisan bill out of the 
committee.
  Ray was also extremely committed to being a public servant. When we 
marked up the Republican's ACA repeal bill, the markup went on in 
committee all night. Ray was sick at that time, but he refused to leave 
the markup. Finally, Chairman Walden, his staff, and mine convinced Ray 
to go home. But that did not stop him from watching the lively debate 
all night long on C-SPAN from home. In fact, my staff was still getting 
emails throughout the night.
  My thoughts and prayers go out to Ray's family, Mr. Speaker, the 
staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and everyone else who knew 
Ray. He is going to be sorely missed.
