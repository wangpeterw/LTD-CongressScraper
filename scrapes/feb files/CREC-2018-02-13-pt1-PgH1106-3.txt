                      PHOENIX-MESA GATEWAY AIRPORT

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I recognize the incredible expansion 
of Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport.
  After originally serving as an Air Force base for over 50 years, and 
closed due to the BRAC process, Gateway reopened in 1994 and now 
provides commercial airline service to more than 35 destinations. This 
airport is a significant economic asset to Arizona's economy, 
contributing $1.3 billion every year.
  Each month, Gateway sets new records. Last year, the airport saw a 9 
percent increase in passenger traffic, making 2017 the second busiest 
year in the airport's history. I fully expect Gateway to shatter 
expectations in 2018.
  The construction of SkyBridge Arizona will help facilitate trade 
between the United States and Mexico. We anticipate this project will 
create thousands of jobs and unleash millions of dollars for our 
economy.
  I thank the board of directors, staff, employees, and East Valley 
residents who are committed to Gateway Airport's success. Gateway 
Airport would not be the pride of the East Valley without their 
dedication.
