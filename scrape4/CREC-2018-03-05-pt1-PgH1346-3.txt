                      RECOGNIZING MADIGAN McGRATH

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent 
of mine from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Her name is Madigan McGrath, 
an honor student who works two jobs, volunteers with the Big Brothers 
Big Sisters, takes three dance classes per week, has an active social 
life, and happens to have type 1 diabetes.
  When Madigan was 13 years old, she was diagnosed with type I 
diabetes. Madigan took it in stride, much quicker than expected. Before 
she even left the hospital, she asked if there was a brochure that she 
could give her friends to explain type 1 diabetes. Learning that one 
did not exist, Madigan made one herself.
  Madigan takes every opportunity to educate others about this disease 
and has spread awareness of it. Through her fundraising, Madigan made a 
video about her illness and lifestyle. One of the quotes she used was: 
``Diabetes doesn't define me; I define diabetes.''
  She now wants to pursue a career in the medical field, specifically 
in pediatric endocrinology, so that she can help other kids with type 1 
diabetes.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to join my colleagues in thanking Madigan for her 
commitment to helping others with this disease and educating the 
community and the country about type 1 diabetes.
