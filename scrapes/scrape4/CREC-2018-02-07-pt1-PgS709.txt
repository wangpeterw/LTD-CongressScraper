SENATE RESOLUTION 399--CONGRATULATING THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ON THEIR 
                       TRIUMPH IN SUPER BOWL LII

  Mr. TOOMEY (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 399

       Whereas, on February 4, 2018, the Philadelphia Eagles 
     became champions of the National Football League by defeating 
     the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII;
       Whereas, with this victory the Philadelphia Eagles won 
     their first Super Bowl in franchise history and fourth 
     National Football League Championship;
       Whereas the Eagles, a franchise born in the depths of the 
     Great Depression, forged in the furnace of South 
     Philadelphia, has come to represent the resiliency, 
     ingenuity, and fortitude of the great people of the ``City of 
     Brotherly Love'';
       Whereas the fans of the Eagles, whose devotion and 
     enthusiasm is renowned throughout sport, have waited for this 
     moment for 58 years;
       Whereas this Eagles team, written off by the rest of the 
     world after suffering numerous injuries to key players, took 
     the field in Minneapolis as the underdog, as they had been in 
     every previous playoff game, despite having the best record 
     in the National Football League;
       Whereas quarterback Nicholas Edward Foles, stepping in for 
     injured star quarterback Carson James Wentz, commanded the 
     field with an uncanny precision, calmness, and leadership 
     that earned him recognition as the Most Valuable Player of 
     the Super Bowl;
       Whereas head coach Douglas Irving Pederson displayed an 
     emotional intelligence, creativity, and aggressiveness 
     exemplified in the ``Philly Special,'' a fourth down play 
     call that involved undrafted rookie running back Corey Joel 
     Clement taking the direct snap and pitching the football to 
     undrafted tight end Trey Burton, who threw the football to 
     the backup quarterback Foles for a touchdown in the last 
     minute of the first half;
       Whereas the play of the dominating offensive line, anchored 
     by veterans David Lane Johnson and Jason Kelce, provided 
     peerless protection for the passers, enabled multiple clutch 
     catches by the acrobatic receiving corps and tight ends, and 
     paved the way for hard earned rushing yards by the trio of 
     talented tailbacks;
       Whereas the vaunted Eagles defense, engineered by 
     coordinator James John Schwartz, led by All-Pros Fletcher Cox 
     and Malcolm Damari Jenkins, took charge in the waning moments 
     of the fourth quarter when Brandon Lee Graham forced the 
     opposing quarterback to fumble the football into the waiting 
     hands of rookie Derek Anthony Barnett;
       Whereas the consistent play of the special teams, led by 
     rookie Jake Daniel Elliot and 14-year veteran Donald Scott 
     ``Bag O'Bones'' Jones, helped seal the fate of the game;
       Whereas the ownership of Jeffrey Robert Lurie and the 
     management of Howard Roseman have truly built a franchise 
     that should be recognized as the ``gold standard''; and
       Whereas sports talk radio in southeastern Pennsylvania may 
     never be the same: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) congratulates the entire Philadelphia Eagles 
     organization on their triumph in Super Bowl LII;
       (2) commends the Philadelphia Eagles fans for their 
     devotion, enthusiasm, and persistence over the past 58 years; 
     and
       (3) requests that the Secretary of the Senate prepare an 
     enrolled version of this resolution for presentation to--
       (A) the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, Jeffrey Robert 
     Lurie; and
       (B) the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, Douglas 
     Irving Pederson.
