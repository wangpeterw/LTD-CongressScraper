                           BUDGET RESOLUTION

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with millions of 
middle class Americans, to oppose the Republican budget resolution.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support tax reform. Unfortunately, this 
budget resolution is a partisan tax reform package. I support tax 
reform, which will help lower taxes for low-income Americans, I support 
tax reform that will rebuild our middle class, and I support tax reform 
that simplifies the Tax Code for small businesses. I will not support a 
tax plan that disproportionately gives advantages to the rich.
  But, Mr. Speaker, this tax plan will raise our deficit by $2.4 
trillion over the next decade. Mr. Speaker, this tax plan will take 
away critical dollars from an infrastructure bill that our Nation so 
desperately needs.
  We still have time. Let's work together to do what is right for all 
Americans. Let's work together and do what is right for our country.
