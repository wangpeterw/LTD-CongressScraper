                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

                Government of Greece--CH-47D Helicopters

       The Government of Greece requested the possible sale of 
     five (5) CH-47D helicopters, seven (7) Common Missile Warning 
     Systems (CMWS) (one (1) for each aircraft plus two (2) 
     spares), and twelve (12) T55-GA-714A turbine engines (two (2) 
     for each aircraft plus two (2) spares). Also included are 
     mission equipment, communications and navigation equipment, 
     ground support equipment, special tools and test equipment, 
     spares, publications, Maintenance Work Order/Engineering 
     Change Proposals (MWO/ECPs), technical support, and training, 
     and other associated support equipment and services. The 
     total estimated cost is $80 million.
       This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and 
     national security objectives of the United States by helping 
     to improve the security of a NATO ally that has been, and 
     continues to be, an important force for political stability 
     and economic progress. Greece intends to use these defense 
     articles and services to modernize its armed forces by 
     increasing its rotary-wing transport capability. This will 
     contribute to the Greek military's goal to upgrade its 
     capability while further enhancing greater interoperability 
     between Greece, the U.S. and other allies.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       There is no principal contractor as the systems will be 
     coming from U.S. Army stocks. There are no known offset 
     agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S. 
     Government or contractor representatives to travel to Greece 
     for equipment de-processing/fielding, system checkout and new 
     equipment training.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile 
     (AARGM) weapon system is an air-to-ground missile intended to 
     suppress or destroy land or sea-based radar emitters 
     associated with enemy air defenses and provides tactical air 
     forces with a lethal countermeasure to enemy radar directed, 
     surface-to-air missiles, and air defense artillery weapons 
     systems. Destruction or suppression of enemy radars denies 
     the enemy the use of air defense systems, thereby improving 
     the survivability of our tactical aircraft. It uses a 
     multimode seeker that incorporates global positioning system/
     inertial measurement unit (GPS/IMU) midcourse guidance, a 
     radio frequency (RF) radiation homing receiver, an active 
     millimeter wave seeker, an Integrated Broadcast Service 
     Receiver (IBS-R) and a Weapons Impact Assessment (WIA) 
     transmitter. The AARGM AGM-88E when assembled is classified 
     SECRET. The AARGM Guidance Section (seeker hardware) and 
     Control Section with the Target Detector is classified

     weapon system is an air-to-ground missile intended to 
     suppress or destroy land or sea-based radar emitters 
     associated with enemy air defenses and provides tactical air 
     forces with a lethal countermeasure to enemy radar directed, 
     surface-to-air missiles, and air defense artillery weapons 
     systems. Destruction or suppression of enemy radars denies 
     the enemy the use of air defense systems, thereby improving 
     the survivability of our tactical aircraft. The AGM-88B HARM 
     when assembled is classified CONFIDENTIAL. The HARM Guidance 
     Section (seeker hardware), and Control Section with the 
     Target Detector are classified CONFIDENTIAL.
       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements of 
     this possible sale, the information could be used to develop 
     countermeasures which might reduce weapon system 
     effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with 
     similar or advanced capabilities.
       4. A determination has been made that the Government of 
     Australia can provide substantially the same degree of 
     protection for the technology being released as the US 
     Government. The sale is necessary in furtherance of the US 
     foreign policy and national security objectives as outlined 
     in the Policy Justification of the notification.
       5. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     Australia.

                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

           New Zealand--P-8A Aircraft and Associated Support

       New Zealand has requested the potential sale of up to four 
     (4) P-8A Patrol Aircraft. Each includes: commercial engines, 
     Tactical Open Mission Software (TOMS), Electro-Optical (EO) 
     and Infrared (IR) MX-20HD, AN/AAQ-2(V)1 Acoustic System, AN/
     APY-10 Radar, ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures. Also 
     included are eight (8) Multifunctional Information 
     Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS); 
     five (5) Guardian Laser Transmitter Assemblies (GLTA) for the 
     AN/AAQ-24(V)N; five (5) System Processors for AN/AAQ-24(V)N; 
     thirty (30) AN/AAR-54 Missile Warning Sensors for the AN/AAQ-
     24(V)N; ten (10) LN-251 with Embedded Global Positioning 
     Systems (GPS)/Inertial Navigations Systems (EGIs); support 
     equipment; operation support systems; maintenance trainer/
     classrooms; publications; software, engineering, and 
     logistics technical assistance; foreign Liaison officer 
     support, contractor engineering technical services; repair 
     and return; transportation; aircraft ferry; and other 
     associated training, support equipment and services. The 
     total estimated cost is $1.46 billion.
       This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and 
     national security of the United States by strengthening the 
     security of a Major Non-NATO ally which has been, and 
     continues to be, an important force for political stability 
     within the region. New Zealand is a close ally in the region 
     and an important partner on critical foreign policy and 
     defense issues.

[[Page S2607]]

       The Government of New Zealand intends to use these defense 
     articles and services to continue its Maritime Surveillance 
     Aircraft (MSA) capability, following retirement of its P-3K 
     maritime patrol aircraft. The sale will strengthen collective 
     defense and enhance New Zealand's regional and global allied 
     contributions.
       New Zealand has procured and operated U.S. produced P-3 MSA 
     for over 40 years, providing critical capabilities to NATO 
     and coalition maritime operations. New Zealand has maintained 
     a close MSA acquisition and sustainment relationship with the 
     U.S. Navy over this period. The proposed sale will allow New 
     Zealand to recapitalize, modernize and sustain its MSA 
     capability for the next 30 years. As a long-time P-3 
     operator, New Zealand will have no difficulty transitioning 
     its MSA force to the P-8A and absorbing these aircraft into 
     its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The prime contractor will be The Boeing Company, Seattle, 
     WA. Additional contractors include:
       Air Cruisers Co LLC.
       Arnprior Aerospace, Canada.
       AVOX Zodiac Aerospace.

  Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 
                36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The P-8A aircraft is a militarized version of the Boeing 
     737-800 Next Generation (NG) commercial aircraft. The P-8A is 
     replacing the P3C as the Navy's long-range Anti-Submarine 
     Warfare (ASW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW), Intelligence, 
     Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft capable of 
     broad-area, maritime and littoral operations. The overall 
     highest classification of the P-8A weapon system is SECRET. 
     The P-8A mission systems hardware is largely UNCLASSIFIED, 
     while individual software elements (mission systems, 
     acoustics, ESM, EWSP, etc.) are classified up to SECRET.
       2. P-8A mission systems include:
       a. Tactical Open Mission Software (TOMS). TOMS functions 
     include environment planning, tactical aids, weapons planning 
     aids, and data correlation. TOMS includes an algorithm for 
     track fusion which automatically correlates tracks produced 
     by on board and off board sensors.
       b. Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) MX-20HD. The EO/
     IR system processes visible EO and IR spectrum to detect and 
     image objects.
       c. AN/AAQ-2(V)1 Acoustic System. The Acoustic sensor system 
     is integrated within the mission system as the primary sensor 
     or the aircraft ASW missions. The system has multi-static 
     active coherent (MAC) 64 sonobuoy processing capability and 
     acoustic sensor prediction tools.
       d. AN/APY-10 Radar. The aircraft radar is a direct 
     derivative of the legacy AN/APS-137(V) installed in the P-3C. 
     The radar capabilities include GPS selective availability 
     anti-spoofing, SAR and ISAR imagery resolutions, and 
     periscope detection mode.
       e. ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures (ESM). This system 
     provides real time capability for the automatic detection, 
     location, measurement, and analysis of RF-signals and modes. 
     Real time results are compared with a library of known 
     emitters to perform emitter classification and specific 
     emitter identification (SEI).
       f. Electronic Warfare Self Protection (EWSP). The P-8A 
     aircraft Directional Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM) suite 
     consists of the ALQ-213 Electronic Warfare Management System 
     (EWMS), ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System (CMDS), and 
     the AN/AAQ-24(V)N Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure 
     (LAIRCM) Guardian Laser Transmitter Assemblies (GLTA) 
     processor, and AAR-54 Missile Warning Sensors (MWS). The AN/
     AAQ-24(V)N LAIRCM is a self-contained, directed energy 
     countermeasures system designed to protect aircraft from 
     infrared guided surface-to-air missiles. The system features 
     digital technology and micro-miniature sold state 
     electronics. LAIRCM system software, including Operation 
     Flight Program is classified SECRET. Technical data and 
     documentation to be provided are UNCLASSIFIED.
       g. Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint 
     Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS) is an advanced Link-16 
     command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) 
     system incorporating high-capacity, jam-resistant, digital 
     communication links for exchange of near real-time tactical 
     information, including both data and vice, among air, ground, 
     and sea elements. The MIDS JTRS terminal hardware, 
     publications, performance specifications, operational 
     capability, parameters, vulnerabilities to countermeasures, 
     and software documentation are classified CONFIDENTIAL. The 
     classified information to be provided consists of that which 
     is necessary for the operation, maintenance, and repair 
     (through intermediate level) of the data link terminal, 
     installed systems, and related software.
       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     access of the P-8A specific hardware and software elements, 
     systems could be reverse engineering to discover USN 
     capabilities and tactics. The consequences of the loss of 
     this technology, to a technologically advanced or competent 
     adversary, could result in the development of countermeasures 
     or equivalent systems, which could reduce system 
     effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with 
     similar advanced capabilities.
       4. A determination has been made that the recipient 
     government can provide substantially the same degree of 
     protection for the technology being released as the U.S. 
     Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. 
     foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in 
     the Policy Justification.
       5. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     New Zealand.

     capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those 
     objectives. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign 
     policy and national security of the United States by helping 
     to improve the security of a strategic regional partner that 
     has been, and continues to be, an important force for 
     political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.
       The proposed sale will improve Israel's capability to meet 
     current and future threats in the defense of its borders and 
     territorial waters. The naval guns will be installed on 
     Israeli Navy SA'AR 4.5 and SA'AR 6 Missile Patrol Boats. One 
     gun will be located at an Israeli Naval Training Center to be 
     used for training maintenance personnel. Israel will have no 
     difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.
       The proposed equipment and support will not alter the basic 
     military balance in the region.
       The potential principal contractor will be DRS North 
     America (a Leonardo company). There are no known offset 
     agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the 
     assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor 
     representatives to Israel.
       There is no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a 
     result of this proposed sale.


                         Transmittal No. 16-87

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) Of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The naval gun system proposed in response to this 
     request is a modem variant of the MK-75 naval gun system. The 
     naval gun system is mounted aboard the ship and supports 
     multiple missions while deployed at sea and at home port 
     stations. The missions include ship's surface to air defense 
     and surface to surface defense or attack modes. It also can 
     be used for sea surface to land surface for bombardment or as 
     offshore artillery to support troops on the ground. This gun
