                            LGBT PRIDE MONTH

  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, after 18 years of a loving 
partnership, my friends, Tim and Mike, were finally allowed to do what 
billions of men and women have been doing for many centuries, enter a 
legal commitment called marriage.
  Yesterday, I had the joy of celebrating LGBT Pride Month on the 
National Mall with Tim and Mike and hundreds of thousands of people of 
all genders and sexual orientations. We rejoiced our common humanity 
and the right for each person to be their true self. Miley Cyrus, the 
festival headliner, said it best: It was a party in the USA.
  And, yes, our country has come a long way from the Stonewall riots of 
June 1969. The thing is, there is more work to be done.
  Today, we remember the horrific Orlando Pulse Nightclub shooting 1 
year ago. We must keep striving for a world where all people can live 
away from violence and free to love who they want to love without 
recrimination.
