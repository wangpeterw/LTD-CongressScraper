                        PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with great disgust that I 
rise in condemnation of President Trump's withdrawal of the United 
States from the Paris climate accord.
  Despite his promise to make America great again, the President's 
pullout from this agreement does exactly the opposite. It puts America 
behind 194 other countries that have placed truth and reality over 
ignorance.
  Climate change is real and it is manmade. It is a threat that must be 
addressed, and it is extremely frustrating that this administration has 
chosen to withdraw from the global fight against global warming. This 
pullout sends a message that the United States is no longer interested 
in leading the efforts to stop global warming, and it is a self-
inflicted wound and undercuts trust in American leadership.
  Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will not save the coal industry, 
it won't make America great again, and it is another impulsive and 
destructive decision by this administration that hurts our future.
