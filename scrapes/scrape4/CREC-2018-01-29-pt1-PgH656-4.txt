                               KANSAS DAY

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Kansas Day, a 
recognition of my home State's 157 years of statehood.
  Kansas was accepted into the Union as a free State in 1861. Kansans 
remain resilient, and we work hard to meet the challenges of today; 
after all, our State motto, ``Ad astra per aspera,'' means to the stars 
through difficulties.
  The Sunflower State has long been known for its wheat product, but 
today our agriculture industry is more diverse than ever. Kansas is 
home to the fastest growing dairy herd and is second in the Nation in 
the number of cattle and calves.
  From the farms to our universities, Kansas is leading the charge on 
research and innovation in agriculture, biosecurity, aviation, 
medicine, and basketball.
  Mr. Speaker, the proof is in the pudding. Kansans are leaders, and we 
have a long history of producing innovators. Walter Chrysler, Amelia 
Earhart, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Bob Dole are just a few of the many 
Kansans who helped shape our Nation and advance our society.
  As I travel through my district and the State, I see the economic 
hardships our farmers and producers face, but I also see optimism and 
hope. I am proud to celebrate my home State today and every day as I 
represent the people of the big First District of Kansas.
