                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father, God, as we bow our heads in Your presence, may we also 
lift our hearts to the guidance of Your Divine Providence.
  Remind our lawmakers that they will seek and find You when they have 
passionately pursued You. May Your Holy Spirit bring them new life and 
hope, making them equal to their experiences and responsibilities. 
Lord, lead them on the upward way to a higher plane of unity and peace 
as they strive to hold aloft Your banners of truth, justice, and love.
  Lord, we will continue to rejoice in You, for You are the God of our 
salvation.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
