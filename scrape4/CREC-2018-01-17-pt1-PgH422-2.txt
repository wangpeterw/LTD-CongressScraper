          NORTH TEXANS ARE BENEFITING FROM HISTORIC TAX REFORM

  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, Texas businesses are putting more money in 
their employees' pockets because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Companies that employ tens of thousands of my constituents in north 
Texas are giving bonuses to their employees, increasing investment in 
their operations, and donating millions of dollars to charities.
  These Texas companies are joining thousands of others across the 
country and doing the same for their workers. They are growing the 
American economy because of tax reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
reforms an unfair and uncompetitive Tax Code, and that is being fixed 
in this Tax Code. It provides tax relief at every income level and 
helps Americans and American businesses to succeed in the future.
