  PAKISTAN IS A MENACE TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND A SUPPORTER OF TERROR

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the State Department has announced 
that it is adding Pakistan to a special watch list for severe 
violations of religious freedom. The long overdue decision recognizes 
that Pakistan's shameful policies target and encourage violence against 
religious minorities, primarily Christians. Pakistan's blasphemy laws 
declare open season for attacks on these already persecuted 
communities.
  Pakistan also lets radical Islamic terrorist groups like the 
Afghanistan Taliban Network, Haqqani Network, and al-Qaida go 
unchallenged in Pakistan. This makes Pakistan one of the most dangerous 
places in the world for Christians. Just last month, ISIS suicide 
bombers struck a densely packed church in Pakistan, killing nine and 
wounding dozens.
  I applaud the President's decision to reexamine our relationship with 
Pakistan and freeze military aid. Pakistan has played the United States 
for too long. We cannot continue to provide billions of dollars to a 
country that fosters terrorism and hate.
  And that is just the way it is.
