                                 PRAYER

  Dr. George Dillard, Peachtree City Christian Church, Peachtree City, 
Georgia, offered the following prayer:
  Almighty God, we humbly come before You as leaders in a nation that 
seems to have lost its way. We seek Your help this day and in the 
future, Your guidance to help us return to a place where liberty and 
justice is for all. Remind us that liberty and justice go hand in hand 
and that liberty cannot exist if there is not justice for the innocent.
  Teach us to protect life, to be a refuge for immigrants, the unborn, 
the aged, the orphaned, the widows, the homeless, the family, the 
oppressed, those in danger, every race, and our veterans.
  Help us to see that unity is stronger than division.
  Remind us that consensus without truth is confusion and that power 
without control is destructive. Remind us again that out of the many 
should come the one. Give us compassion, strength under control, 
humility and grace.
  Lead us, Father, through this valley that we might stand on the 
mountain proclaiming with one voice that we are the united people of 
America.
  In Jesus Christ's name.
  Amen.
