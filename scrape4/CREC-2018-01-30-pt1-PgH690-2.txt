                  HONORING THE LIFE OF AYDEN O'MALLEY

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a 
heavy heart to honor Ayden O'Malley. Ayden is the daughter of Denny and 
Rosalind O'Malley of Nokomis, Illinois.
  Along with many of her friends and hundreds of other young people 
from Illinois, Ayden traveled here to D.C. earlier this month to attend 
the March for Life. During their trip, Ayden was hospitalized after she 
experienced a serious medical episode.
  After countless prayers and 5 days of fighting, Ayden gained her 
angel wings. As her mom said: ``So often answered prayers may not be 
the answers we want.''
  Ayden was an eighth grader at St. Louis Catholic School, where she 
was on the honor roll, played volleyball and softball, and volunteered 
in her community as often as she could. Everyone who knew Ayden said 
she had a bright, vibrant spirit that brought joy to everyone around 
her.
  While they were here in D.C., I met with Ayden's group, but, 
unfortunately, I never had the honor of meeting her. I admire Ayden's 
convictions and willingness to be a voice for those who cannot speak 
for themselves.
  I ask this House to join me in praying for strength and healing for 
Ayden's family, friends, and the Nokomis community during this 
difficult time.
