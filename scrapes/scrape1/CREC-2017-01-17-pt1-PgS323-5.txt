                  COAL MINER RETIREES' HEALTH BENEFITS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the days since President Obama took 
office, too many coal miners have lost their jobs, including well over 
10,000 in Kentucky, and more than 25 coal mining companies have filed 
for bankruptcy. This means that there are fewer active workers 
available to pay into an expanding retirement pool, leaving health 
benefits in jeopardy for thousands of retired miners.
  Last year, I was proud to be able to secure an extension of these 
benefits past their year-end expiration date. While I advocated for a 
longer term solution, we did secure a 4-month plan. I made a commitment 
at that time to work with my colleagues on a long-term health care 
solution for these retired miners.
  Today, I plan to introduce legislation to protect and permanently 
extend those benefits for thousands of coal miner retirees and their 
dependents. Recognizing the damage that has been done over the past 8 
years, my legislation also calls on Congress to work with the incoming 
Trump administration to repeal regulations that are harming the coal 
industry and to support economic development efforts in coal country.
  I highlighted those goals in a letter I sent to President-Elect Trump 
earlier in the year regarding ways in which I hope we can work together 
to provide relief to coal country. I look forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues and the incoming administration on these important 
issues.
