                    NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of National School 
Counseling Week and in honor of the many dedicated school counselors in 
Rhode Island and across the Nation, every day, school counselors are 
out on the front lines helping our students navigate their educational 
and career pathways. They provided advice and support during the most 
formative years of students' lives, helping them develop the skills to 
succeed in school, in the workforce, and in life.
  Unfortunately, in too many schools across the country, students do 
not have access to school counselors and counselors do not have the 
resources they need to do their jobs.
  Mr. Speaker, it is Congress' responsibility to provide schools and 
counselors with the funding that they need to properly educate and 
guide our Nation's youth.
  In recognition of National School Counseling Week, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in renewing our promise to fulfill that 
responsibility. Our students, Mr. Speaker, are depending on us.
