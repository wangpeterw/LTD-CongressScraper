                     CONGRATULATING DR. RORY COOPER

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an Army veteran 
and University of Pittsburgh engineer, Dr. Rory Cooper, for his 
achievements and impact on society.
  While serving as a soldier, Rory was injured in an accident that left 
him paralyzed from the waist down. Despite the challenges presented by 
his disability, Dr. Cooper earned his Ph.D. in electrical and computer 
science from the University of California, Santa Barbara. His education 
and passion for helping others with disabilities led him to found the 
Human Engineering Research Laboratories at the University of 
Pittsburgh.
  Along with his team of researchers, Dr. Cooper is credited with 25 
patents that have significantly advanced wheelchair technology and 
benefited tens of thousands of veterans.
  Mr. Speaker, this week, Dr. Cooper will be presented with the Samuel 
J. Heyman Service to America Medal. I
