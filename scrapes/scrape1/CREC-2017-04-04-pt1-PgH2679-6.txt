     RECOGNIZING ZACH MAIORANA AND HIS BATTLE WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my 
constituent, Zach Maiorana, and his ongoing battle with cystic 
fibrosis. At birth, Zach was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and has 
been courageously battling this condition for the past 2\1/2\ years.
  Cystic fibrosis is a complex, genetic disease that primarily affects 
the lungs and digestive systems. Those diagnosed with CF require 
intensive daily treatment and regular physician visits to maintain a 
healthy lifestyle.
  Despite this diagnosis, Zach and his family have channeled their 
determination into becoming advocates for those impacted by cystic 
fibrosis--a true testament to their perseverance and will to live their 
lives to the fullest extent possible.
  Now it is up to us. This Congress can be the one to prioritize 
research and

funding to combat this disease and continue making progress. In 1955, 
children born with CF likely would not make it through elementary 
school. Today, more than half of those living with CF are older than 
age 18, and many are living into their thirties, forties, and beyond. 
Investment into new therapies for this disease and continuous focus on 
improvement have made promising gains for those suffering with CF.
  I commend Zach and the entire Maiorana family for their strength, and 
I hope that my colleagues will stand up to cystic fibrosis and advocate 
for all those who are affected in this country.
