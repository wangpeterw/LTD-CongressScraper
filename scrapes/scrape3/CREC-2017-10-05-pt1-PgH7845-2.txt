                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Timothy Kesicki, Jesuit Conference, Washington, DC, offered 
the following prayer:
  God of all consolation, from whom human sadness is never hidden, we 
turn to You to be our strength this day.
  The psalmist proclaims that You are close to the brokenhearted and 
that You save those crushed in spirit.
  We pray that You lift the spirit of our Nation this day, and guide 
those who represent and lead Your people.
  Help our leaders to find good counsel and give ear to Your holy 
words. The Book of Proverbs teaches us that: ``For lack of counsel a 
nation fails, security lies with many advisers.''
  May all who advise, guide, and help to direct our government do so 
with selfless care. May they put the needs of others before their own 
cares and lift the burden of those who suffer most.
  Grant our leaders discerning minds and hearts, so that ``Your will be 
done'' today and every day with which You bless us.
  We pray this with great faith and hope.
  Amen.
