        RECOGNIZING PERRY TECHNICAL INSTITUTE AND TYLER ANDRINGA

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Perry 
Technical Institute for receiving the Accrediting Commission of Career 
Schools and Colleges' 2017 School of Excellence Award.
  Perry Tech has continually provided high-quality education and 
technical training for students in the Yakima Valley of central 
Washington, and this award is well deserved.
  On top of that, I would like to recognize Tyler Andringa, who 
received the commission's 2017 Outstanding Graduate Award. Tyler 
graduated from Perry Tech in December 2016 with a certificate in 
information technology and communication systems.
  Tyler has cerebral palsy and has overcome many challenges to obtain 
his certificate. He has served as a role model and a leader among his 
classmates.
  Applying the resources and guidance he received at Perry Tech, Tyler 
is currently employed with Continuant, a telecommunications service 
provider, where he is succeeding in advancing his career goals. His 
achievements are commendable, and I wish him the best in his future 
endeavors.
  Please join me in congratulating Perry Technical Institute on their 
achievements as they continue to provide excellent education and job 
training to equip students just like Tyler Andringa.
