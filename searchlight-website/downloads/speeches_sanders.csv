17482,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,17482,topic-id,2457,"Madam President, I rise this afternoon to supplement some remarks I made on the floor last evening about the Affordable Care Last night, I talked about my own experience as a young staff member in the U.Senate 43 years ago when, because I had an insurance policy provided by my employer--that policy had preventive care as part of the policy, just as Affordable Care Act policies do today--I had a routine physical checkup. It was the first I had in a number of years, which caught malignant melanoma, a particularly virulent form of cancer. Because it was caught early and because I was treated, here I am today.  As I mentioned last night, it has always haunted me that someone who didn't have insurance, a young man or a young woman somewhere in the country who was in exactly my situation, because they didn't have insurance, they didn't have preventive care, didn't get the checkup, the disease wasn't caught, and they are gone.  I find it very hard to justify that, to understand that. It doesn't seem fair. It doesn't seem ethical. It doesn't seem moral. Today I wanted to also bring to the attention of the Senate some stories from today about the effect of the Affordable Care Act in Maine, where we have over 80,000 people enrolled, many of whom had never been able to have insurance before.  A young woman, Whitney, who graduated from college in 2013, said:       I graduated . . . with a degree in wildlife ecology, [but      it was very difficult to find a job.]       Thanks to the ACA, I was able to stay on my family health      insurance plan through this period of unemployment. I did      finally get employed in my field, but permanent, year-round      jobs with benefits are the equivalent of winning the lottery.[[Page S194]]  Many young people are in that situation. It even has a name. It is called the gig economy, people who work gigs, who work short periods of time, several months here, several months there, but there are no benefits attached to those jobs. She said:       Many of us work seasonal jobs, building trails on the      Appalachian Trail, rescuing lost hikers, managing volunteers,      and running programs for veterans to reconnect with Maine's      woods. We do good work in this state. Before the ACA we      worked dangerous outdoor jobs that only provided minimum      worker's comp. . . . But with the ACA and the tax credit, I      could afford a silver plan, I could get dental for my teeth,      could go to the doctor again, get flu shots and get my joints      looked at.  It is important to realize that without the ACA, this young woman would have literally no options. A health savings account is unrealistic for somebody who is making $15,000 to $20,000 a year. Buying insurance across State lines isn't going to help this young woman.  She said getting the ACA coverage ``was life changing. I know it is not perfect but I am terrified of going back to [where we were] before, where health and financial ruin was one wrong step away.''  Another letter from an older adult:       My wife is sixty-three years old she is no longer able to      work full time. She has had major back surgery and has      arthritis in her neck. Because of these health issues she had      to reduce her work hours.  Here is the catch-22. She had to reduce her work hours. Therefore, her employer dropped her from her health care coverage.       We were fortunate [enough] to obtain coverage for her      through the Affordable Care It is expensive and is not      the best coverage--  Nobody in this body says it is best possible result and that the law is perfect. We all agree it needs to be repaired and fixed and modified. The writer goes on to say--     but it is good enough for us to know that a major health      issue will not bankrupt us.       We are appealing to you as our representative to insure      that a reasonable replacement will be put in place when the      Affordable Care Act is ended. Better yet, improve it, don't      destroy it.  I couldn't have said it better myself. Donald, in his letter to me, says: ``Better yet, improve it, don't destroy it.'' That is what we ought to be talking about.  This letter is from a fellow named Ryan in North Central He also makes an important point about the Affordable Care The term that I refer to is ``job lock.'' There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in this country who are locked into the jobs they have that they don't really like, that isn't giving them the satisfaction they want because they can't afford to leave their health care.  One of the hidden benefits of the Affordable Care Act is it has allowed those people to follow their dreams, to start a business and not have to worry about having health insurance. This is an entrepreneur in Maine, a small business person. He said:       Affordable healthcare is a major roadblock to those      calculating whether they can take the leap to become self-     employed. As we prepare for next year's ice cream season, I      am about to leave my benefit-providing job in order to commit      to making the volume of ice cream we need. This is a scary      and questionable decision given our financial situation and      the fact that we are raising our two small children of four      and seven years old. The first comment I hear from everyone      who finds out I am leaving my job is, ``Are you sure? What      are you going to do about health insurance??''  The answer is, the Affordable Care It enables this young man, this gentleman, to follow his dream, to start his business, to commit to his business, and this is good for the country. This is a hidden benefit that is rarely discussed about the Affordable Care Act to allow people to give vent to their dreams and their innovation and their contribution to the economy.  Here is how he ends his letter. He says:       Please don't let me down. Please don't let my family down.      Please don't let down the millions of families who really are      on the bottom of this country and are the very ones that all      of you from every party claim to support. I don't care about      the details of how it gets done, whether the ACA is thrown      out, or just revised, or what compromises have to be made by      either party, but please make sure there is a health care      option available and that it is at an affordable price for      those of us with the guts to take a stab at our own small      business. The key is ``Affordable Care.'' It matters.  As in my own case, health insurance also saves lives. There was a study done by the Journal of Public Health in 2009, which basically concluded that for every million people without health insurance, there are a thousand premature deaths. It is pretty easy math. Before the Affordable Care Act, we had 45 million people without health insurance in this country. The calculation in this extensive study was that 46,000 deaths were attributable to not having health insurance. I am living proof of that. If I hadn't had health insurance, I would be gone. With the disease that I had, either you catch it in time or you are a goner. That is why I am so passionate about this.  We would not let people die in our front yards. If we saw somebody who was in danger of losing their life, we wouldn't stand by. Nobody in this body would stand by and say: Sorry, we can't help you. But not providing health insurance to people is a death sentence to 10, 20, 30, 40,000 people.  The Affordable Care Act is now covering something like 25 million people. That is 25,000 lives saved. If we take it away, it will be 25,000 lives lost.  Here's the letter:       I am a Maine woman in my late 30s, who works 2 part-time      jobs and also run my own business.       Because we were on [ACA] health insurance that had an      affordable deductible, after not feeling well for a while, my      husband went to a doctor and had a CT scan of his lungs. . .      . It turned out he had a very rare form of an illness, even      though he was only 38 at the time. Had we not had this      insurance and such an affordable premium and deductible, he      would never have gotten that CT scan done. This insurance      saved his life and covered every expense we've had over the      last 2 years with multiple stays at MidCoast Hospital and      Maine Med, 2 surgeries, pick-lines, medications, therapies,      the list goes on. There is no cure for what he has but he's      doing better now, thanks to the  Another person from Maine:       My sisters and I watched my mom die. We were physically in      the room when it happened. We cried for probably half an hour      straight.       Before the Affordable Care Act, most of her illnesses were      considered pre-existing conditions. She survived cancer three      times . . . but had to pay exorbitant monthly premiums just      to have to pay most of her treatment out of pocket.  He said:       I don't care about the ACA because of some theory or      ideology. I watched my mom die, sooner than she needed to,      because she couldn't afford to get preventative care early      enough. I watched my mom die because market solutions refused      to solve her problems. An open insurance market actively      refused to compete to cover my mom. The insurance market      before the ACA is one of a number of factors that led to my      mom's death.       This is a real, physical, immediate memory for me whenever      someone talks about healthcare, and it always comes to mind      when people talk about it in vague terms and market forces. I      am crying even as I write this, and it has been years.  He writes to me:       I am begging you, as a son who watched his mom who was      younger than you--  Than me--     die in a hospital because she couldn't afford the care she      needed, please protect the Affordable Care Protect it as      a legislator, protect it by recognizing how appointments you      choose to confirm or deny will affect my family's ability to      stay healthy and alive. Through grants and research, you've      worked to improve access to health care. Please, protect the       Another one--one more. This is a letter I received just back in the fall, a little before Christmas:       I have an incurable, generally non-lethal form of bone      cancer and have been under treatment for over 12 years. The      multiple surgeries [and costs] . . . I cannot afford to pay      for ongoing treatment without insurance. I am very pleased      the current ACA does not allow for ``preexisting      disqualification'' and I would hate to see that removed.      Having this condition is naturally stressful, debilitating      and undesired. I do not want or need the added stress of      having to worry about the details of coverage.       Additionally I have two boys, aged 23 and 26, both of whom      have benefited from remaining on our family insurance policy.      That is a great policy and my boys are healthier as a result.       Finally, access to quality health care is and must be a      right as it benefits both the individual and society. Health      is key to happiness and success and happy successful people      pay taxes, support the government, [and] give back to the      community.  I understand the debate that surrounded this. I understand the emotion. I understand the pressure that people feel in order to maintain a campaign promise or to meet promises[[Page S195]]made over the last several years. But we are not talking about maybe what will happen; we are talking about real cases, real people. I am talking about real people in Maine, in small towns and cities. I am talking about rural hospitals that are on the verge of being rendered financially incapacitated because if this law is repealed, it will take away a significant part of their support. I am talking about seniors having to pay more for drugs. But mostly, I am talking about people's lives.  These cases are people who can give specific examples. There are thousands, tens of thousands, and millions that we can't articulate--people who are saved who don't even know it because they went in to get that checkup, who are saved the stress of wondering how they are going to pay for some kind of treatment.  As a parent, I remember having to stress about whether to take my child to a doctor because I didn't know whether I could afford to pay that bill. Yet we all know that is the proper course. We shouldn't have to make those kinds of choices. We have a vehicle, imperfect as it is. Imperfect as it is, we have a vehicle for providing that care.  Let's slow down. Let's take a breath and say: We talked about repeal, but it isn't really practical. We can't harm that many people. Let's talk about what we are going to replace it with. The idea that we are going to repeal it today and replace it 3 years from now is just cruel. That is what I am hearing from people: Don't put us through that. People who finally got insurance after preexisting conditions, who have insurance and have a condition now--they depend upon that insurance. Let's not make them go through that pressure, the financial anxiety added to the health anxiety. We have an opportunity to rise above politics. This really shouldn't be political or a policy or something that divides us.  There is nobody in this body who wants to see people suffer, who wants to unnecessarily put people through the pressure of both health problems and financial problems. We ought to be able to find a solution. Every other industrialized country in the world has found a solution. It is not like this is some impenetrable box.  I realize that part of the solution has to involve controlling costs and facing the fact that we pay twice as much for health care per capita as anyone else in the world. That is an issue the Affordable Care Act does not sufficiently address, in my view, and we have to talk about that.  In the meantime, let us remember those people who are counting on us for their very lives. That is a commitment I believe we can respect and should meet.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

25161,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25161,topic-id,2460,"Mr.President, I ask to have printed in the Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest conducted by my office.  The material follows:   ZOE HOULIHAN, NORTH COUNTRY UNION HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)       When you think of America, do you think of McDonald's, big      cities, high-tech phones and computers, or do you think about      violence, fear, and hatred amongst people? Although America      seems like a great place full of opportunities and freedom,      it is quite the opposite if you are not a white, straight,      cisgendered male. There are many problems in America that      need to be fixed.       Racism has been ongoing for hundreds of years. Blacks,      Hispanics and many other[[Page S538]]     non-white groups have faced discrimination and hatred because      of the color of their skin. Blacks are thought as more      violent and lazy than whites. African Americans now      constitute 1 million of the 2.3 million imprisoned      population. They are also incarcerated at six times the rate      of whites. NAACP says that 5 times as many whites are using      drugs as Blacks, but they are being sent to prison at 10      times the rate of whites. Moreover, Blacks are getting shot      at higher rate than whites. Although more whites are getting      shot, there are about 160 million more white people than      there are black people. While Whites make up 49% of those      fatally shot by police officers, Blacks make up 24%, despite      only being 13% of the US population. More than 250 blacks      were killed in 2016. Furthermore, 47% of hate crimes have to      do with race. Racism is such a big problem in America it's      hard to say what an effective solution would be. One solution      to this could be to get media stars that are POC to talk      about racism. This could cause their fan base (which can be      quite large) to change their ideas about African      Another solution is to educate people on racism. Teaching      young children in school about how racism started could      lessen the number of people in each generation that feel      negatively about people of color. Lastly, the government      should make the policies about racism in schools and      workplaces stricter. Telling kids ``That is not appropriate''      when they make a racist comment isn't doing anything. People      need to be punished for making these comments because if they      aren't it makes it seem like it isn't a big deal.       Another problem in America is sexism and sexual assault.      Sexism makes it harder for women to get jobs and be well-off      in life. According to the Huffington Post, well-off white men      are three times more likely than women to be offered a job      interview. Moreover, women that work 41-44 hours per week      earn 84.6% of what a man working that same time would earn.      Women that work more than 60 hours a week earn only 78.3% of      what a man would earn. Similarly, in the House of      Representatives only 19.3% are women, and in the Senate only      20% are women. In addition, when a woman claims to have been      sexually assaulted, men usually blame the women. They ask      what they were wearing, how ``revealing'' it was, and if they      were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. One in four      women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Also,      683,000 adult women are forcibly raped each year. This is      equal to 56,916 per month, 1,871 per day and 78 per hour. One      solution to women not getting payed as much as men could be      to make a policy that both women and men are to be paid      equally. Furthermore, a solution to sexual assault is to      teach kids about consent and to give longer sentences to      people that have committed sexual assault. Another solution      to sexism is to have more women representation in media and      politics. This could help eliminate the thought that women      are only made to have children, clean and cook. It would also      give young girls more role models to look up to.       Finally, the last issue that needs to be fixed is hate and      discrimination against the LGBT+ community. According to an      analysis of data collected by the FBI, lesbian, gay,      bisexual, and transgender people are the most likely targets      of hate crimes. An example of a hate crime against the LGBT+      community is the Orlando nightclub shooting. 49 were killed      and at least 53 were injured. This shooting is considered the      worst mass shooting in the United States and the nation's      worst terrorist attack since 9/11. Additionally, LGBT+ people      experience discrimination in the workforce. They actually      have a higher unemployment rate than African Americans (15%      versus 12%). People of color that are also apart of the LGBT+      community face the most discrimination. A solution to this      problem could be to educate young children about the      different sexualities and explain that it's okay to feel      attracted to whomever. Another solution is to create policies      that would help protect people in the LGBT+ community.      Lastly, there should be stricter rules about when a teacher      hears a homophobic comment. Many kids say ``That's so gay''      when something that they don't like happens and i could make      other kids feel unsafe.       In conclusion, America has many issues with equal rights      that need to be fixed. One of the main solutions to every      problem is education. When people are educated, they can use      their knowledge to base their opinions off instead of going      with what the popular opinion is or what they are hearing      around them.        GRAHAM JANSON, MONTPELIER HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       Whenever you ask someone the question, ``What is the most      pressing issue facing our nation today?'' you will most      likely get a different answer every time. An environmentalist      might say, ``Carbon emissions and global warming.'' A      conservative activist might say, ``The increasing national      debt.'' There are many answers to this question. But there is      only one answer that addresses an issue that lies at the      center of our nation's existence. That answer is that the      fundamental democratic principles on which the United States      is based are being eroded by voter suppression and      gerrymandering.       Efforts to suppress voting rights for many people have been      around since the Constitution was adopted as the supreme law      of the land, when only property-owning white men could vote.      We have come a long way since then, with African Americans,      Native Americans, and American women gaining the right to      vote, but we still have a long way to go. Similar to during      Reconstruction, when literacy tests were used to deny African      Americans the right to vote, a now-overturned North Carolina      voter ID law was in effect that, according to the federal      appeals court that dealt with the case, deliberately      ``target[ed] African-Americans'' in an attempt to suppress      their voter turnout. Other states, such as Ohio, Kansas, and      North Carolina, have had voter ID laws that have been      overturned after being ruled discriminatory by a federal      appeals court. The overturning of these laws is already a      step in the right direction. A way to address voter-     suppression efforts is to require a federal court review for      every voter ID law to make sure that there is no      discrimination or infringement of American rights. Another      way is to restore the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of      1965.       Additionally, the repeal of some of the key aspects of the      Voting Rights Act in 2013, which allowed nine states to alter      their election laws without the approval of the federal      government, demonstrates how gerrymandered elections can      serve to undermine basic democratic principles.      Gerrymandering involves altering the areas of electoral      districts to favor one party or another, and both Democratic      and Republican politicians have engaged in gerrymandering in      the past. There have been many cases in which a political      candidate has won an election because of gerrymandering. This      clearly undermines our nation's democratic principles because      now a candidate can carry the minority of an electorate and      win an election, and it needs to change now. Furthermore,      because these same elected officials appoint and confirm      federal judges, voter suppression and gerrymandering can also      undermine the judiciary's vital role in protecting democratic      voting rights.       In conclusion, the restoration of equal voting rights and      the elimination of gerrymandering would allow the United      States to remain a true democracy. Indeed, the other pressing      issues that face our nation today, such as global warming,      economic development, immigration, healthcare, and      gender equity, cannot be fairly addressed while our nation      continues to utilize this flawed system that does not      reflect democratic values.   IRA RICHARDSON, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       When George Washington delivered his farewell address, he      stated that ``The alternate domination of one faction over      another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party      dissension . . . is itself a frightful despotism.'' Our first      and only president who was not a member of a political party      attempted to warn us of the threats they can pose to      democracy. Today, however, the Democratic and Republican      parties have become so powerful that one can hardly imagine      the American democratic system without them. In a sense, this      is one of the sources of their overbearing power: many      Americans see them as an intrinsic part of our democracy      rather than two organizations that were created long after      the union to organize like-minded voters. Political parties      are not inherently bad, but a system which creates a forced      dichotomy by only giving voters two realistic choices for any      given position has unquestionable negative effects on our      nation. Firstly, it forces citizens who care deeply about      specific issues to routinely vote for candidates whom they      may not agree with in any other capacity so as to not violate      their personal moral code. This, in turn, allows parties to      cynically align themselves with these single-issue voters to      win their votes without truly sharing their values.      Additionally, two diametrically opposed political parties      give rise to an us-versus-them mentality among citizens,      eroding the mutual trust that is intrinsic in the formation      of a nation.       To reduce the near-hegemonic power that the parties      currently hold, it is imperative to make it more clear to the      American public that both parties are private organizations,      operating within their own processes and promoting goals that      are not necessarily those of their constituents. The      intention is not to cause Americans to stop supporting the      party they belong to, but rather not to follow any party      blindly, and to understand their complex histories and role      in American democracy. Another step towards a system in which      people could more consistently vote for politicians they      truly support would be the implementation of an instant run-     off (aka alternate or ranked) voting system. In such a      system, a voter does not select a single candidate to receive      a position, but rather ranks the order in which they support      each candidate. If no candidate has over fifty percent of the      vote, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and      every citizen who selected them has their votes moved to      their next choice, and the votes are tallied again. This      process is repeated until a candidate has a majority. This      alternative would allow people to vote their conscience      without fear of handing the election to a candidate on the      opposite side of the political spectrum. It would not destroy      the existing political parties (which would be destabilizing)      but rather allow third-party and independent candidates to      speak for portions of the population who cannot identify with      either existing party. By reducing the power of the two major      parties, the environment necessary to address the many      problems facing America could be created.[[Page S539]]       JULIA STERGAS, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY FAIRFAX SENIOR (FINALIST)       Nearly 260 years ago our country endured a war over the      rights of our states and the rights of its peoples. From this      war came the first legislation to protect African Americans      living in the United One-hundred years later, our      country faced another revolution, resulting in new      legislation that enhanced the ability for African Americans      to participate in political and social life. Since then, many      Americans have believed that racial equality has been      achieved.       But here we are, fifty years later, struggling through yet      another conflict over the divide between black and white.      Tensions are high between African Americans and white      authority figures in the United Distrust and anxiety      separates black Americans from their government and onlooking      citizens. In 2014, Michael Brown was shot and killed by a      police officer in Ferguson, That same year, a      barrage of negative media emerged from an originally peaceful      protest in Baltimore, Maryland, depicting unlawful rioters      who looted and set fire to business, injuring six police      officers. Now, we continue to watch video clips on nightly      news highlighting the struggle between black and white.      Through this our attention has been distracted from the true      cause of continued racial conflict: the lack of recent      successful intervention.       White authority figures are perpetually distrusted by the      black community, and groups such as Black Lives Matter still      believe inherent biases against African Americans are      abundant in society. We must rebuild this connection. To      achieve comprehensive change we must redirect our nation's      path. The first step toward action is awareness. This issue      must be introduced into schools, universities, and community      centers. If we can enlighten young adults they will share      their knowledge and work to obtain equality nationwide.       Educators would lead discussions on current and historic      racial tensions in a non-partisan, open environment. Focusing      on historic and current events and their social and political      ramifications, these open debates would promote civic      engagement and thoughtful problem solving. Prompts regarding      the government's involvement and the responsibilities it      should assume, the action we as the nation's youth should      assume, and opportunities to develop individual solutions      would be considered during discussion. Our young population      is critical to the future of our nation, so it is necessary      that we provide them with opportunities to immerse themselves      in their political and social world.       Today's generation and the ones to follow will be our      leaders and our visionaries. Incorporating awareness into      education programs would introduce these leaders to the      nuances of the world they will come to inspire, and allow      them to develop an understanding of their political efficacy.      Raising consciousness of this racial strain would encourage      young leaders to take charge of their futures, and ours, and      incite change. It is critical to the well being of our nation      that we cultivate a generation of educated young adults who      possess the skills to maneuver themselves in their political      and social world. Addressing our nation's imperfection and      coaching our youth will only be the start to a nationwide      revolution of change and acceptance.

25162,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25162,topic-id,1758,"Mr.President, a few moments ago, my friend from South Dakota was speaking about the bill. He made one statement that I do agree with, and that is, just because you say something over and over again does not make it true. Unfortunately, much of what he said is just not accurate. The truth is that what we are seeing today, in an unprecedented way, is the looting of the Federal  Today marks a great victory for the very wealthy campaign contributors who have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to the Republican These billionaires will see a huge tax break for themselves at the same time as the deficit of this country is driven up by about $1.5 trillion.  Today is also a victory for the largest, the most profitable corporations in America, companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, and General Electric, which, despite recordbreaking profits, will now see hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks.  At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where the people on top are becoming wealthier while the middle class shrinks and 40 million live in poverty, this legislation--according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center--will provide 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent, while increasing taxes on 92 million middle-class households by the end of the decade. Let me repeat that. By the end of the decade, this legislation will provide 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent and, incredibly, 60 percent of the benefits to the top one-tenth of 1 percent, while, at the end of the decade, 92 million middle-class households will be paying more in taxes.  Does anybody really believe that when we have such a massive gap in income and wealth inequality, we should be giving 60 percent of the benefits in this bill to the top one-tenth of 1 percent?  It says a lot about the priorities of the Republican Party when the tax breaks for corporations in this bill are permanent, while the tax breaks for working families expire at the end of 8 years.  Furthermore, I hope that every American is listening to what Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is saying, and other Republicans, when they talk about how they are going to offset the $1.5 trillion in deficits they just created by giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations. What Ryan is saying and many other Republicans are saying is that they are going to come back and offset that $1.5 trillion in deficits by cutting Social Security, Medicare, and And if I am wrong on that assertion, I would hope that some of my Republican colleagues would come down to the floor and say that I am wrong, but I do not suspect that will be the case.  During his campaign for the White House, Donald Trump said over and over again to the American people, quote after quote, day after day, that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Well, I say to the President: For once in your life, keep the promises that you made, and tell the Republican leadership now that you will veto any legislation that cuts Social Security, Medicare, or I suspect we will not be seeing a tweet from the President on that issue.  Moving toward passing this very unfair piece of legislation, the Republican leadership--which controls the House and the Senate--will move soon to shut down the Congress and head home for a holiday break. After massive tax breaks for the rich and large corporations, they believe their work is done, and they are ready to head home.  Well, I respectfully disagree. Maybe, just maybe, before Congress adjourns for the holidays, we should start paying attention to the needs of the working families of this country, to the middle class of this country, and not just the billionaire class.  We need to address the crisis that faces some 800,000 young people who are currently in the DACA Without the legal protections afforded by the DACA Program, these young people today are living in constant fear and anxiety that they may lose their legal status and, in fact, be deported from the only country they have ever known.  Imagine somebody who is 20 or 25 years of age, has lived in the United States virtually his or her entire life, went to school here, now has a job, now is in college, now is in the military, and because of Trump's disastrous attack on DACA, repealing DACA, 800,000 young people are worried about whether they are going to be able to even stay in this country.[[Page S8100]]  The American people are very clear about how they feel about this issue. I believe just today there was a Quinnipiac poll that appeared on this very issue, and this was the question:       Which comes closest to your view about undocumented      immigrants who were brought to the U.as children? A) They      should be allowed to stay in the United States and to      eventually apply for U.citizenship. B) They should be      allowed to remain in the United States, but not be allowed to      apply for U.citizenship. C) They should be required to      leave the U. That was the question asked of the American people.  Here is the answer. Seventy-seven percent of the American people--77 percent--say that these young people should be allowed to stay in the United States and move toward citizenship. Seven percent say they that should stay in the United States but not gain citizenship. Twelve percent say that they should be forced to leave the United  Republicans, by overwhelming numbers, say that these young people, these Dreamers who have spent their entire lives in this country, who know no other country, should be allowed to stay in America and apply for citizenship. Ninety-one percent of Democrats say that, and 81 percent of Independents say that.  As we speak, young people are losing their legal status. We have to act on that and act on that now, before we adjourn for the holidays. Put yourself in the place of a 20-, 25-year-old person living in extraordinary anxiety. We have to act now to address those concerns. We have to do what the American people want us to do.  As I think most people know, the Koch brothers are the major funders of the Republican They have probably given billions of dollars over the years. Even Charles Koch acknowledges that the right thing to do is to provide legal status for the  Let me quote from a recent op-ed in the Washington Post by Charles Koch and Tim Cook, the head of Apple:       The United States is at its best when all people are free      to pursue their dreams. Our country has enjoyed unparalleled      success by welcoming people from around the world who seek to      make a better life for themselves and their families, no      matter what their backgrounds. It is our differences that      help us to learn from each other, to challenge our old ways      of thinking and to discover innovative solutions that benefit      us all. To advance that prosperity and build an even stronger      future, each successive generation--including, today, our      own--must show the courage to embrace that diversity and to      do what is right.       We have no illusions about how difficult it can be to get      things done in Washington, and we know that people of good      faith disagree about aspects of immigration policy. If ever      there were an occasion to come together to help people      improve their lives, this is it. By acting now to ensure the      dreamers can realize their potential by continuing to      contribute to our country, Congress can reaffirm this      essential American ideal.  This is from Charles He funds the Republican They might want to listen to him as well.  But it is not just the need to address the crisis facing our As you know, community health centers providing health insurance, healthcare, for 27 million people have not been reauthorized or refunded. We have to address that issue, and we have to address it now.  Nine million children are in the Children's Health Insurance While we are busy giving tax breaks to billionaires, we have not had time to reauthorize a health insurance program for the children of this country. We should be ashamed of ourselves.  We have disaster relief out there. Folks in Congress will go home to celebrate the holidays, and will light up our homes. In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, they can't light up their homes because many of them still don't have electricity as a result of the recent disasters they have experienced. We need to do disaster relief. We need to do it now for the people of Puerto Rico, for the people of the Virgin Islands, for the people of Texas, and for the people of  There are 1.5 million workers who are about to lose the pensions they were promised, and those pensions, after a lifetime of work, will be reduced by 60 percent if we don't address the multiemployer pension plan crisis. We have to do that.  Over 40 million people in this country are dealing with student debt. They leave college deeply in debt. Many of them are in despair because of their financial situations--because of their outrageous levels of student debt. We have to address that.  We have an opioid epidemic that is killing people from coast to coast. We have to start investing in treatment and prevention.  We have 30,000 vacancies in the VA today. Our job is to make sure that every veteran in this country gets the quality healthcare he or she needs. They don't get it with 30,000 vacancies in the We have to invest in the  There were 10,000 people on disability who died last year while waiting for the Social Security Administration to act on their applications; 10,000 people died last year because the Social Security Administration is greatly understaffed--massive cuts to the Social Security The elderly and the disabled in this country are entitled to have prompt process when they apply for benefits. They are not getting that. We have to pay attention to that, and on and on it goes.  The bottom line is that the U.Senate should be doing more than providing 83 percent of the benefits in a tax bill to the top 1 percent. We cannot go home unless we address the very serious crises facing the working families and the middle class of this country.  With that, I yield to my colleague from  ",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8088-2.txt,CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8088-2.xml,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,19,December
25163,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25163,topic-id,2344,"Mr.President, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or  Like many of President Trump's other nominees, my opposition to Congressman Mulvaney has less to do with his extreme rightwing economic views than it has to do with the hypocrisy and the dishonesty of President The simple truth is that Congressman Mulvaney's record, in many respects, is the exact opposite of the rhetoric that then-Candidate Trump used in order to get votes from senior citizens and working families. Now, if Candidate Trump had run his campaign by saying: I am going to cut your Social Security benefits if elected President, well, you know what, Congressman Mulvaney would have been the exact person that he should bring forth as OMB If President Trump had said: I am going to privatize your Medicare; vote for me because I am going to privatize your Medicare--if that is what he had campaigned on, then Congressman Mulvaney would have been exactly the right choice for OMB If Candidate Trump had said: I want to devastate Medicare, I want to make it harder for poor people to get the healthcare they need, and I want to threaten the nursing home care of millions of senior citizens--if that is what Candidate Trump had said, Mick Mulvaney would have been exactly the right and appropriate leader for the job.  But those are not the words, that is not the rhetoric, and those are not the ideas that Candidate Trump raised during his Presidential race. In fact, Candidate Trump said exactly the opposite on May 7, 2015. We are all familiar with Mr.Trump's tweets. Here is a tweet that he made on May 7, 2015:       I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state      there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare and      Huckabee copied me.  So you have Candidate Trump making it very clear that there would be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and  On August 10, 2015, Trump said:       [I will] save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security      without cuts. [We] have to do it. . . . People have been      paying in for years, and now many of these candidates want to      cut it.  On November 3, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       I will save Social I'll save medicare. . . .      People love . . . I'm not going to cut it.  On March 10, 2016, Mr.Trump said:       I will do everything within my power not to touch Social      Security, to leave it the way it is . . . it's my absolute      intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not      increase the age and to leave it as is.       It is my absolute intention to leave Social Security the      way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.  It can't be much clearer than that.  On May 21, 2015, Mr.Trump tweeted:       I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know      where to get the money from. Nobody else does.  On January 24, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       I'm not a cutter. I will probably be the only Republican      that doesn't want to cut Social  Those are pretty strong statements. What he just told you, in no uncertain terms, can't be clearer than that. He doesn't want to cut Social He doesn't want to cut Medicare and doesn't want to cut And you know what, millions of people actually believed what he said. They actually thought that Candidate Trump was telling the truth.  But now that the election is over, President Trump has nominated a budget director, Mr.Mulvaney, who would cut Social Security, would cut Medicare, would cut Medicaid, and would threaten the entire security of millions of  We just heard the exact quotes coming from candidate Donald Let's now hear the exact quotes coming from Congressman Mick Mulvaney about his views on these very same issues.  On May 15, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said on FOX Business News:       We have to end Medicare as we know it.  On April 28, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said:       Medicare as it exists today is finished.  On August 1, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said:       You have to raise the retirement age, lower a pay-out,      change the reimbursement system. You simply cannot leave      [Social Security] the way it is.  On May 17, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said: ``I honestly don't think we went far enough with the Ryan plan'' because it did not cut Social Security and Medicare ``rapidly enough.''  Just 2 years ago, Congressman Mulvaney voted against the budget proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price and House Speaker Paul Ryan, opting instead to vote in favor of an even more extreme budget by the Republican Study The budget that Congressman Mulvaney supported would have cut Medicare by $69 billion more than the Price-Ryan budget. It would have cut Social Security by $184 billion more, and it would have cut Medicaid by $255 billion more than the budget proposed by Chairman Price and House Speaker  In fact, Congressman Mulvaney made it clear during his confirmation hearing in the Budget Committee that he would advise President Trump to break his promises not to cut Social Security, Medicare, and During that hearing, Senator Corker called President Trump's campaign promises ``totally unrealistic'' and said that they ``make no sense whatsoever.''  When Senator Corker asked Congressman Mulvaney if he would advise the President not to follow through on the campaign promises he made to seniors, this is what Congressman Mulvaney said:       I have to imagine that the President knew what he was      getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to      think it is why he hired me.  Whoa, what we have been discussing is precisely why so many people have contempt for what goes on here in Congress and what goes on in Washington, in general. What is going on here is that a candidate for President of the United States says one thing in order to get votes, but the day after he is elected, his tune dramatically changes, and he nominates a number of people to his Cabinet and to high-level positions within his administration who intend to do exactly the opposite of what he campaigned on. Once again, Congressman Mulvaney--and I believe he is exactly right--said:       I have to imagine that the President knew what he was      getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to      think it is why he hired me.  So the President hires somebody who has been one of the most vigorous proponents of cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, and of cutting Medicaid after he ran his entire campaign telling the American people he would not cut Social Security, cut Medicare, and cut  Outside of Capitol Hill, where real people live, it turns out, not surprisingly, that the overwhelming majority of Americans--be they Democrats, Republicans, or Independents--are opposed to cutting Social In fact, according to an October 2016 survey by Public Policy Polling, 72 percent of the American people, including 51 percent of Republicans, ``support increasing, not cutting, Social Security benefits by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay more into the system.''[[Page S1207]]  As it happens, that is exactly the heart and soul of the legislation that I will soon be offering. Legislation that I will be offering will expand Social Security benefits, not cut them. It will do so by asking the top 2 percent to pay more in taxes, which, it turns out, is not only the right thing to do, but it is precisely what the American people want us to do. Various other polls have reached similar results. The people of our country--once you get outside the Congress and outside of the Republican caucus, in particular--the American people know that when millions of seniors, disabled veterans, and people with disabilities are trying to get by on $13, $14, $15,000 a year, you do not cut their benefits, while at the same time give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent. That is not what the American people want.  In my view, we don't need a budget director like Congressman Mulvaney, who believes that Social Security is a ``Ponzi scheme.'' We don't need a budget director who once voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.Department of Education unconstitutional. He was in, I believe, the South Carolina State Legislature, State He actually voted on a vote--which got very few votes--in the South Carolina State He voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.Department of Education unconstitutional. This is the person whom President Trump has nominated to become the head of  So if you believe Social Security is unconstitutional, if you believe it is a good idea to cut benefits for people who will be living on $13,000 or $14,000 a year, I guess Mr.Mulvaney is your choice. If that is whom my Republican colleagues want to vote for, that is their business, but my job and the job of everybody is to make it clear to the American people that the Republicans are far more interested in cutting Social Security and in giving huge tax breaks to billionaires than they are in taking care of the needs of the American people.  We need a budget director who understands that we have a retirement crisis in America today. Today, more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings. That is just an extraordinary reality. Over half of older workers in this country have zero in the bank. Think about what they are feeling when they hear people like Congressman Mulvaney saying: Hey, you got nothing now. You are going to try to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year in Social Security, and we are going to cut those benefits.  Today, more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings. More than one-third of senior citizens depend on Social Security for all of their income. One out of five senior citizens is trying to make ends meet on income of less than $13,000 a year. I will tell you, I hope people are able to sleep well, people who think it is appropriate to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut benefits for people who are trying to get by on Social Security checks of $13,000 a year.  In my view, we don't need a budget director who believes that ``we have to end Medicare as we know it,'' nor do we need a budget director who has said that ``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' Let's remember for a moment what things were like before Medicare was signed into law back in 1965. At that point, about half of all seniors were uninsured and millions more were underinsured. Today, thanks to Medicare, about 45 million seniors have health insurance, and the senior poverty rate has plummeted. Seniors are living healthier, longer lives. Thank you,  In my view, we do not need a budget director who supports cutting Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, threatening not only the healthcare of low-income people but also the nursing home care of millions of vulnerable senior citizens and persons with disabilities. There are millions of not just low-income families but middle-class families who today are getting help with the nursing home payments for their parents through If you make devastating cuts in Medicaid, you are not only going to take away health insurance from low-income Americans, you are going to put enormous economic stress on middle-class families who will now have to pay the full tab for the nursing home care of their parents.  Finally, there is another issue; that is, Mr.Mulvaney's taxes. After Congressman Mulvaney was nominated to become the next OMB Director, it was revealed that he failed to pay over $15,000 in taxes for a nanny he employed from the year 2000 through 2004. Here is what Congressman Mulvaney wrote in response to a question I asked him on January 11:       I have come to learn during the confirmation review process      that I failed to pay FICA and Federal and State unemployment      taxes on a household employee for the years 2000 through      2004. Upon discovery of that shortfall, I paid the Federal      taxes. The amount in question for Federal FICA and      unemployment was $15,583.60, exclusive of penalties and      interest which are not yet determined. The State amounts are      not yet determined.  This is a very serious issue. As you will recall, 8 years ago Senator Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination as Secretary of Health and Human Services after it was discovered that he failed to pay taxes for one of his domestic workers.  On this issue, I agree wholeheartedly with Minority Leader Schumer, who said:       When other previous Cabinet nominees failed to pay their      fair share in taxes, Senate Republicans forced those nominees      to withdraw from consideration. If failure to pay taxes was      disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same should      be true for Republican nominees.  Mr.President, here is the irony: Over and over again, Congressman Mulvaney has sponsored and cosponsored legislation designed to prohibit people from serving in the government if they fail to pay their taxes. In 2015, Congressman Mulvaney voted for a bill in the House that stated: ``Any individual who has a seriously delinquent tax debt should be ineligible to be appointed or to continue serving as an employee'' of the Federal Congressman Mulvaney cosponsored three bills when he was in the South Carolina State Senate that would have prohibited tax cheats from serving in the South Carolina State government. In other words, it looks like there is one set of rules for Congressman Mulvaney and another set of rules for everyone else.  In light of this information and in light of Congressman Mulvaney's extreme rightwing record of attacking the needs of the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor, I would urge all of my colleagues to vote no on this nomination.  With that, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.xml,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017,15,February

25167,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25167,topic-id,2201,"Mr.President, I come before my colleagues in the Senate to urge in the strongest possible terms that the Republican leadership here accept its responsibility and not allow the Government of the United States of America to shut down. Republicans control the They control the U.And a Republican is in the White Please do not shut the government down.  A government shutdown will be extremely distressing and difficult for millions of people in every State in our country who utilize government services. A government shutdown will be extremely painful for millions of Federal employees who depend upon their paychecks to provide for their families. A government shutdown will make it much more difficult for U.military personnel, the men and women who are putting their lives on the line to defend us, to do their jobs.  The American people do not want a government shutdown. I do not want a government shutdown, and I believe that most of my Republican colleagues do not want a government shutdown. It is imperative that President Trump understand that despite what he said in May, that statement is wrong. When he said our country needs a good shutdown, that is wrong. Our country does not need a good shutdown. What we need is an annual budget that addresses the many needs of the American people.  Just last night, this is what a spokesperson from the Pentagon stated:       We have been working under a Continuing Resolution for      three years now. Our current CR expires tomorrow, 19      This is wasteful and destructive. We need a fully-funded FY18      budget or face ramifications on our military.  This afternoon, I say to Senator McConnell, the Republican leader here in the Senate: Please do not shut the government down. You know, Senator McConnell, the political reality as well as anybody in our country. In the Senate, you need 60 votes to pass this budget agreement. You don't have 60 votes. Please, sit down with Democrats, and start negotiating in good faith. Please, do not shut the government down.  More and more Democrats are sick and tired of kicking the can down the road, tired of our not addressing the major crises that are facing this country, tired of running a $4 trillion operation, which is what the U.Government is, on a month-to-month basis.  Yet it is not just the Democrats who are demanding that we finally have an annual budget. It is the Republicans as well. My understanding--what I have heard from the news media--is that there are now five Republicans who are prepared to vote against this continuing resolution and even more who have voiced deep concerns about the lack of an annual budget. They know and I know that just passing another temporary budget is totally irresponsible and is abdicating the job that we were elected to do.  What the American people understand--what every businessperson in this country understands, what every family in America understands--is that you cannot run a government, given the many crises that we face, on a month-to-month basis. We cannot continue to abdicate our responsibility. Finally, we must address the problems that are facing the American people.  Last night, the Pentagon told us correctly--and I state again that this is what was said: ``We need a fully-funded FY18 budget or face ramifications on our military.''  Let's not forget that we are 3\1/2\ months into the fiscal year. There are 3\1/2\ months that have come and gone, and the Republican leadership here has still not given us an annual budget.  It is not just the military that faces a crisis situation because of the lack of an annual budget. Today, 27 million Americans get their primary healthcare, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs through the community health center program. In my State of Vermont, one out of four Vermonters gets his primary healthcare through a community health center. There are 3\1/2\ months that have come and gone since the beginning of this fiscal year, and the Republicans have not yet reauthorized funding for the community health center program, which is now facing a severe crisis in terms of recruiting and retaining the doctors, nurses, and other medical staff it needs to maintain the quality of service it must maintain.  What doctor or what nurse is going to go to a community health center when he or she doesn't even know if that facility is going to receive funding? There are 27 million Americans who depend upon community health centers. As I understand it--and I am glad--the Republicans are now prepared to reauthorize the CHIP program. There are 9 million kids who need that program. In the 3\1/2\ months that have come and gone, finally, they are talking about reauthorizing That is good, but you cannot forget the community health centers.  The community health center program in this country is 50 years old. It was developed in the 1960s. It is supported by virtually every Democrat and, I think, the vast majority of the Yet it has not been reauthorized. This is a crisis that cannot be kicked down the road. It has to be addressed and addressed now.  On Veterans Day, everybody here goes running all over the country, giving great speeches about how much they love the veterans, but the Veterans Health Administration cannot continue to provide decent, quality care to those of our veterans who put their lives on the line to defend us when they have over 30,000 vacancies. In Vermont and around the country, the VA provides good, quality care, but you cannot provide care in a timely manner when you have 30,000 vacancies at the This issue cannot be kicked down the road. It must be addressed now, not next year.  As everybody knows, in Louisiana and in Vermont and all over this country, there is a horrible, horrific opioid and heroin epidemic that is sweeping this country. It has hit my State of[[Page S324]]Vermont hard. It has hit States all over Last year, 60,000 people in our country died as a result of opioid or heroin overdoses. We need to help State governments, local communities, families, and police departments to address the opioid and heroin epidemic. This is a crisis that cannot be kicked down the road. It must be addressed now, not through a continuing resolution that absolutely ignores this crisis. It must be addressed now.  Last year, unbelievably, some 10,000 people with disabilities died while awaiting decisions for the applications they made to the Social Security Administration for their disability benefits to be approved. People with disabilities apply for benefits. They wait, they wait, and they wait. Last year, 10,000 people with disabilities died while waiting for decisions. Many of them died because the Social Security Administration is, today, grossly underfunded, understaffed, and simply not able to deal with the volume of claims they have received.  It is not just people with disabilities. In my State of Vermont--I hear this every day--there are older Americans who are not getting the quality of service they need from the Social Security Our job is to adequately fund the Social Security Administration so it can protect the needs of senior citizens and people with disabilities in our country. This is a crisis that cannot be kicked down the road. It has to be addressed now, and this continuing resolution, which I presume we are going to vote on later today, does not deal with it.  Mr.President, 1\1/2\ million Americans are in danger of seeing their pensions cut by up to 60 percent. These are truckdrivers, construction workers, machinists, and others who have worked their entire careers with the expectation that they would receive a decent pension when they retired. We have a responsibility to protect the pensions of these hard-working Americans and keep the promises that were made to them. This is another crisis that cannot be kicked down the road. It has to be addressed now, and the continuing resolution that is going to come before us has not one word to say about that.  Then we have a child care crisis in this country. Millions of working families can't find quality, affordable child care. We have a student debt crisis in this country--40 million people, many of them deeply in debt, unable to get on with their lives for the crime of having gone to college. That is a crisis that we have to deal with. We have an infrastructure crisis in this country. All over America, roads, bridges, water systems, waste water plants are collapsing. How do we continue to ignore those crises? At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the rich are getting richer and everybody else is getting poorer, our job in Congress is not just to give tax breaks to billionaires. Our job is not just to try to throw 32 million Americans off the health insurance they have or deny the reality of climate change or to end net neutrality or make racist comments about countries throughout the world. Our job is to represent the needs of ordinary We cannot continue to ignore these problems. We cannot continue to kick the can down the road.  Once again, I say to the majority leader: Let us begin to negotiate in good faith. Let us reach decisions that will improve life for the American people, not simply ignore their needs.  When we talk about the crises facing this country, we are also talking about a crisis precipitated by President Trump in September of last year. As a result of President Trump's rescinding of President Obama's Executive order on DACA, some 800,000 young people in our country are today living in fear, uncertainty, and anxiety. If we do not act--and act now--it is possible that many of these young people will lose their legal status and be subjected to the possibility of deportation. This must not be allowed to happen.  This issue to my mind is one of the great moral issues of our time. These young people, who were brought into this country, some at 2 years of age, 3 years, 5 years of age, are people who have lived virtually their entire lives in the United States of They are working, they are in school, they are in the military, and 20,000 of these young DACA people are now teaching in schools throughout the country.  It would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history or our history in general if we said to these young people, who know no other country but the United States of America, that they could be deported from our shores. It would be an unspeakable crime, and we must not allow that to happen. That is not just the opinion of Senator Bernie Sanders; that is the overwhelming point of view of the American people, of Democrats, Republicans, and  A poll just came out last night from The poll showed that 87 percent of the American people believe that we should protect the legal status of the Dreamers--87 percent--and that poll is consistent with poll after poll after poll. The people of the United States across the political spectrum are saying that we cannot turn our backs on these The vast majority of people believe we must provide a path toward citizenship.  There is now bipartisan legislation that has been written by Senator Durbin, Senator Graham, and others, and I say to Senator McConnell: If 87 percent of the American people think we should provide legal status to the Dreamers, let us do our job. Let us pass this legislation. This is not a profile in courage. This is what the American people want, and let us do what the American people want.  As we well know, terrible, terrible hurricanes struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands months and months ago, and people there are still suffering. Many people in Puerto Rico today still do not have electricity. Then there are devastating wildfires and mud slides that have taken place in How long does it take for this Congress to respond to the crises facing our fellow Americans?  What I say is, we were elected to do our jobs in representing the American people. That is what we are paid to do. We cannot run a government on a month-to-month basis. Senator McConnell does not have the 60 votes he needs, and now is the time for him to sit down with the Democratic leadership and negotiate a serious agreement on the budget situation, on parity between defense and nondefense spending. Negotiate a serious agreement on DACA, providing legal status and a path toward citizenship for our 800,000 young people; negotiate a serious agreement on disaster relief.  The truth of the matter is, we can do it. We can do it. The differences of opinion are not that wide, but we cannot do it and will not do it unless we finally sit down and start negotiating in a serious manner. That is what I implore Senator McConnell to do.  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2018-01-19-pt1-PgS316-3.txt,CREC-2018-01-19-pt1-PgS316-3.xml,FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017,2018,19,January

It is called ``The health care crisis no one is talking about.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, 31, 2017]       The Health Care Crisis No One Is Talking About                          (By Bernie Sanders)       The United States faces a major crisis in primary health      care, and unless Congress acts immediately it is likely to      become much worse.       Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their access to      health care because Congress did not renew funding for the      community health center program at the end of the fiscal      year, 30. Unless we renew funding immediately, 70      percent of funding will be cut, the doors of 2,800 community      health centers will close, and 9 million patients will lose      access to quality health care. That is unacceptable.       Our nation's community health centers provide affordable,      high-quality health care to more than 27 million people. This      includes not only primary health care, but also dentistry,      counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs. For the 13      million rural patients served, community health centers often      are the only health care provider for hundreds of[[Page S6933]]     miles. And they provide good jobs in communities that need      them the most.       Community health centers not only save lives, they also      save money. Instead of people ending up in expensive      emergency room care, or in the hospital, they get the primary      care they need, when they need it, at high quality medical      centers. Compared to other providers, community health      centers save on average $2,371 per Medicaid patient and up to      $1,210 per Medicare patient. What's more, community health      centers have played a pivotal role in generating more than      $49 billion in savings to the entire health care system.       Not only do we have to renew funding for the community      health center program, we must also improve and expand the      National Health Service Corps--the program that provides debt      forgiveness for young doctors, nurses, dentists, mental      health providers, and pharmacists who are prepared to work in      our nation's most underserved areas. Without debt      forgiveness, it is very hard to get new doctors to choose      primary care--an area of medicine that does not pay the big      bucks. It is also difficult to attract medical professionals      into the underserved areas of our country where they are      needed the most.       It is widely acknowledged that we currently have the most      wasteful, inefficient, and expensive health care system in      the world. Despite spending almost $10,000 per capita on      health care, twice as much as any other country, 28 million      Americans have no insurance, even more are underinsured, with      high copayments and deductibles, and we pay the highest      prices in the world for prescription drugs. The rarely      discussed truth is that thousands of Americans die each year      because they cannot afford to get to a doctor when they      should.       We must not allow a bad situation to get worse.       We cannot tell millions of low-income and working people in      every state in this country that they will no longer be able      to access the health care, dental care, mental health      counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs they desperately      need.       We cannot tell pregnant women that they will not be able to      get the necessary prenatal care they require in order to have      healthy babies.       We cannot tell the young person addicted to opioids or      heroin that there is no treatment available.       We cannot tell chronically ill senior citizens that they      will have to survive without the prescription drugs they have      used for years.       We cannot force community health centers, which provide      some of the most cost-effective health care in the country,      to lay off the doctors, nurses, dentists, and administrators      who keep these centers going.       Historically, the community health center program has      enjoyed widespread bipartisan support, and that support      continues. Today, along with almost all Democrats, there are      a number of Republicans who fully understand how important      these centers are to the well-being of their states and want      to see the program refunded.       The time for delay is over. Congress must act immediately      to fully fund the community health center program and the      associated workforce programs that provide them with the      well-trained staffing they need.

25178,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25178,topic-id,1292,"Mr.President, it is no secret that our country faces a major healthcare crisis and, in fact, a dysfunctional healthcare system.  We have some 30 million people who have no health insurance, and that number is going to go up in the coming year. We have even more people who are underinsured, with high deductibles and copayments. Our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, which means that millions of people who go to the doctor to get a prescription are simply unable to afford the bill. In fact, the description of that is the definition of a dysfunctional, failing healthcare system.  In the midst of all of that, there is another particular crisis dealing with primary healthcare, and that is that even when people do have health insurance in many parts of our country, they are finding it very hard to go to a doctor and to get in to a doctor to treat the ailments that they have. We fall behind many other countries in terms of our lack of emphasis on primary healthcare, which should be the heart and soul of any strong healthcare system. The bottom line is that when you get sick, you should be able to get to the doctor when you need to and not have to wait weeks and months in order to do so.  In the midst of a failing primary healthcare system, there is one very strong bright spot, and that is that for many decades now, in every State in this country, we have had community health centers run by the people themselves--democratically run--addressing the healthcare needs of those given communities. Today, in America, we have about 27 million people--27 million men, women, and children--who are accessing community health centers. In my own State of Vermont, one out of four Vermonters gets their primary healthcare through a community health center.  These centers do more than provide primary healthcare. They also provide dental care, an issue that is too often ignored when we talk about the healthcare crisis. They provide mental health counseling, which is more important now than perhaps it has ever been because of the opioid and heroin epidemic our country is experiencing. Equally important, they provide low-cost prescription drugs at a time when so many Americans cannot afford the medicines they need. That is what community health centers do, and they[[Page S629]]do it well, and they do it cost effectively.  To my mind, there is no question but that there is strong bipartisan support here in the Senate and in the House for community health centers. Yet now we have gone over 4 months into the 2018 fiscal year, and we still have not reauthorized funding for community health centers. Frankly, I do not understand how it happens that when we have strong bipartisan support in the House and the Senate for programs that are working extremely well in every State in this country, the Republican leadership still has not reauthorized the community health center program. There is good bipartisan legislation right here in the Senate that has, I think, the support of virtually everybody in the Democratic caucus. Seven or eight Republicans are supporting it. It is the Blunt-Stabenow bill. It is a 5-year extension of community health centers reauthorization with a modest increase in the budget. If that bill came to the floor today, my guess is that it would get 70, 80 votes--maybe even more. We have gone 4 months into the fiscal year, and we still have not seen that bill reauthorized.  What is happening all over this country is that community health centers, which often struggle with recruitment and retention, are finding it harder than ever to retain the doctors, nurses, and other medical staff they need because applicants are looking around and saying: Why should I work at a community health center if I don't even know if it is going to be there next year? Why should I stay at a community health center if I can get a better job offer and I don't know if this community health center will be funded?  As a result of 4 months of inaction, community health centers all over this country are hurting. I say enough is enough. Right now, as soon as possible, we need to reauthorize the community health center program for at least 5 years, and we need to make sure there is adequate funding so that they can continue to do the excellent work they are doing all over this country.                            Opioid Epidemic  Mr.President, there is another issue that I would like to briefly touch upon. There has been a lot of discussion--appropriately so--about the opioid epidemic that is sweeping the United We have lost some 63,000 Americans as a result of opioid overdoses in 2016 alone. Families by the millions are being impacted.  I was in Brattleboro, VT, a few weeks ago, and they talked to me about what is happening to the children whose parents are addicted to opioids. They need to find foster homes for those children.  This is clearly an epidemic that has to be dealt with. We have to increase funding for prevention to make sure young people don't get swept up into the epidemic and also for treatment for those people who are addicted.  There is an issue that we have not touched upon enough, and that is holding the drug companies responsible and accountable for the products they brought into the market. As some people may recall, in April of 1994, the CEOs of the seven largest tobacco companies testified before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment in a historic hearing. What that hearing was about was, under oath, demanding to know what the executives from the tobacco industry knew and when they knew it. Did they know that their product was addictive? Did they know that tobacco caused cancer, heart disease, and other medical problems? They were asked to hold their hands up and under oath tell the committee what they knew.  I think it is now appropriate for the Senate to do the same with those drug companies that are producing opioids. I think we need to know what the drug companies knew in terms of the addictive qualities of those drugs. There is some evidence out there that suggests that drug companies, in fact, did know that the product they were selling was in fact addictive, but they forgot to tell the doctors--and certainly not the patients.  It is one thing for somebody to do something in ignorance, not knowing the impact of what you produce. That happens all the time. It is something very different if, in fact, the manufacturer of a product understands that the product causes addiction, that the product causes death. We need to get to the root of that issue. We need to know what the drug companies knew and when they knew that.  I would hope very much that in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over this issue, we could bring the executives of those drug companies that produce these opioids before us, because not only are we talking about 60,000 people a year dying as a result of overdoses, but what we are talking about also is the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars in healthcare and law enforcement associated with opioid addiction.  I hope that we can move forward and have those executives come before us and tell us under oath what they knew and when they knew it, because I think the time is long overdue for us to hold them accountable.  With that, I yield the floor.
