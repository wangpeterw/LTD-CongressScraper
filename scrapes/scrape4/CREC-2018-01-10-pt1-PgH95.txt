                    PAYING TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP LYONS

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a member 
of the Greatest Generation, a Montanan whose service to our Nation and 
Montana stretched across eight decades.
  Born and raised in Butte, Phillip ``Herk'' Lyons answered the call to 
serve following the attack on Pearl Harbor. He joined the Navy and 
served as a submariner in both World War II and the Korean war.
  Phil became active with military service organizations in the 1950s, 
serving in leadership roles in the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, and Disabled American Veterans, among others.
  Phil was known as ``Mr. DAV.'' He logged more than 50,000 miles, 
16,000 hours, and carried more than 1,700 fellow veterans to 
appointments.
  On behalf of all Montanans, I honor the memory of Phil, and I extend 
my condolences to his daughter, Debbie, his family, his friends, and 
all those whom his service touched.
