                          REPUBLICAN TAX BILL

  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, at least Robin Hood stole from the rich and 
gave to the poor, but my Republican colleagues, with this Republican 
tax bill, are stealing from the poor and the middle class and giving to 
the rich. It is absolutely disgraceful. The tax bill boosts the rich 
and burdens the middle class.
  I can say I have been here a long time, and this is one of the worst 
bills I have ever seen in all my years in Congress.
  What happened to the Republican Party talking about fiscal 
responsibility? This blows a $1 trillion hole in the Federal deficit 
and puts the burden on our children and grandchildren.
  So let's not look at this tax scam. People should be getting together 
on both sides of the aisle. Tear up this one-sided bill, and let's put 
our heads together and come up with something good.
  It was done during the Ronald Reagan years in a bipartisan way. Why 
can it not be done that way now?
  My particular State of New York, my home State of New York, gets 
really attacked by this. High cost-of-living States get really 
attacked.
  It is not right to play political games. You take a look at this, and 
you notice that blue States get attacked with this terrible bill.
  Tear it up. Let's work together and come up with something good.
