                 CONGRATULATIONS TO GERING HIGH SCHOOL

  (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Gering High School, one of three national winners of the 2017 Samsung 
Solve for Tomorrow contest. The team of 19 Gering students took top 
honors out of thousands of entries and 10 national finalists.
  It is exciting to see young innovators from western Nebraska, 
especially my alma mater, recognized nationally for their ideas on how 
to advance agriculture. The students designed a drone-powered system to 
reduce herbicide quantity by allowing farmers to directly target 
specific areas rather than spraying entire fields. I applaud each of 
them for their hard work and the dedication they put into their winning 
project.
  Congratulations go to Curtis Anderson, Jonathan Blanco, Dakota Boles, 
Blake Brunner, Gabriele Castro, Cody Catron, Eric Crane, Jeremy 
Forella, Michael Haworth, Xavier Horst, Elexus Johnson, Kaiden 
Reinmuth, Trevor Satur, Tyler Smith, Joel Torres, Carson Wallace, 
Skylier Ward, Payton Welfl, Joshua Wilson, and their teacher, Mr. 
Justin Reinmuth.
