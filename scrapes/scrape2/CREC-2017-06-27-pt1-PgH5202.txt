    ADJUSTING THE AMOUNT OF THE MEMBERS' REPRESENTATIONAL ALLOWANCE

  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a resolution, and I ask 
unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Mississippi?
  There was no objection.
  The text of the resolution is as follows:

                              H. Res. 411

       Whereas on June 14, 2017, an armed gunman opened fire at a 
     practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for 
     Charity, wounding five individuals;
       Whereas Members of the House are understandably concerned 
     about the security of their staff and the constituents they 
     serve, as well as their personal security;
       Whereas the Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) is 
     available for ordinary and necessary expenses associated with 
     security measures; and
       Whereas heightened security concerns necessitate an 
     adjustment in the MRA to provide Members with additional 
     resources: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That pursuant to section 1(b) of House Resolution 
     1372, Ninety-fourth Congress, agreed to July 1, 1976, as 
     enacted into permanent law by section 101 of the Legislative 
     Branch Appropriation Act, 1977 (2 U.S.C. 4314), the Members' 
     Representational Allowance applicable as of the date of the 
     adoption of this resolution for each Member of the House of 
     Representatives (including the Delegates and Resident 
     Commissioner to the Congress) is increased by $25,000, to be 
     available through January 2, 2018.

  The resolution was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
