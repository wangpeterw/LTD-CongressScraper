     ground ambulance services made by suppliers or a category of 
     suppliers (as specified by the Secretary) of such services,

       (ii) Whether all such services and supports are provided on 
     a capitated basis or if any of such services and supports are 
     carved out and provided through fee-forservice.
       (E) As practicable, how the availability and variation of 
     integration arrangements of such specialized MA plans offered 
     in States affects spending, service delivery options, access 
     to community-based care, and utilization of care.
       (F) The efforts of State Medicaid programs to transition 
     dually-eligible beneficiaries receiving long-term services

     Medicare reimbursement is being received for those services, 
     and, if so, through which codes those services are being 
     reimbursed.
       (2) Whether, and the extent to which, longitudinal 
     comprehensive care planning services would overlap, and could 
     therefore result in duplicative payment, with services 
     covered under the hospice benefit as well as the chronic care 
     management code, evaluation and management codes, or other 
     codes that already exist under part B of the Medicare 
     program.

     hospice programs, home health agencies, and other applicable 
     providers working with a Medicare beneficiary to engage in 
     the care planning process and complete the necessary

     beneficiary and provide such documentation to other providers 
     and the beneficiary or the beneficiary's representative.

     furnishing longitudinal comprehensive care planning services, 
     accessing the care plan and associated documentation for use 
     related to the care of the Medicare beneficiary.

     providers are notified of a patient's existing longitudinal 
     care plan and that applicable providers consider that plan in 
     making their treatment decisions, and what the challenges 
     might be in implementing such options.

     quality metrics with respect to longitudinal comprehensive 
     care planning services, such as measures related to--

     and support that is free from discrimination based on 
     advanced age, disability status, or advanced illness.

     provide information on--
       (A) the goals, values, and preferences of the beneficiary;
       (B) the documentation of the care plan;
       (C) services furnished to the beneficiary; and
       (D) outcomes of treatment.
       (8) Stakeholder's views on--
       (A) the type of training and education needed for 
     applicable providers, individuals, and caregivers in order to 
     facilitate longitudinal comprehensive care planning services;
       (B) the types of providers of services and suppliers that 
     should be included in the interdisciplinary team of an 
     applicable provider; and

     would be most appropriate to receive longitudinal 
     comprehensive care planning services, such as individuals 
     with advanced disease and individuals who need assistance 
     with multiple activities of daily living.
       (9) Stakeholder's views on the frequency with which 
     longitudinal comprehensive care planning services should be 
     furnished.

     SEC. 2652. ASSESSMENT AND DOCUMENTATION OF THE NEED FOR 
                   PLACEMENT IN A QUALIFIED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT 
                   PROGRAM.

       Section 475A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 675a) is 
     amended by adding at the end the following:
       ``(c) Assessment, Documentation, and Judicial Determination 
     Requirements for Placement in a Qualified Residential 
     Treatment Program.--In the case of any child who is placed in 
     a qualified residential treatment program (as defined in 
     section 472(k)(4)), the following requirements shall apply 
     for purposes of approving the case plan for the child and the 
     case system review procedure for the child:
       ``(1)(A) Within 30 days of the start of each placement in 
     such a setting, a qualified individual (as defined in 
     subparagraph (D)) shall--
       ``(i) assess the strengths and needs of the child using an 
     age-appropriate, evidence-based, validated, functional 
     assessment tool approved by the Secretary;
       ``(ii) determine whether the needs of the child can be met 
     with family members or through placement in a foster family 
     home or, if not, which setting from among the settings 
     specified in section 472(k)(2) would provide the most 
     effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the 
     least restrictive environment and be consistent with the 
     short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the 
     permanency plan for the child; and
       ``(iii) develop a list of child-specific short- and long-
     term mental and behavioral health goals.
       ``(B)(i) The State shall assemble a family and permanency 
     team for the child in accordance with the requirements of 
     clauses (ii) and (iii). The qualified individual conducting 
     the assessment required under subparagraph (A) shall work in 
     conjunction with the family of, and permanency team for, the 
     child while conducting and making the assessment.
       ``(ii) The family and permanency team shall consist of all 
     appropriate biological family members, relative, and fictive 
     kin of the child, as well as, as appropriate, professionals 
     who are a resource to the family of the child, such as 
     teachers, medical or mental health providers who have treated 
     the child, or clergy. In the case of a child who has attained 
     age 14, the family and permanency team shall include the 
     members of the permanency planning team for the child that 
     are selected by the child in accordance with section 
     475(5)(C)(iv).
       ``(iii) The State shall document in the child's case plan--
       ``(I) the reasonable and good faith effort of the State to 
     identify and include all such individuals on the family of, 
     and permanency team for, the child;
       ``(II) all contact information for members of the family 
     and permanency team, as well as contact information for other 
     family members and fictive kin who are not part of the family 
     and permanency team;
       ``(III) evidence that meetings of the family and permanency 
     team, including meetings relating to the assessment required 
     under subparagraph (A), are held at a time and place 
     convenient for family;
       ``(IV) if reunification is the goal, evidence demonstrating 
     that the parent from whom the child was removed provided 
     input on the members of the family and permanency team;
       ``(V) evidence that the assessment required under 
     subparagraph (A) is determined in conjunction with the family 
     and permanency team;
       ``(VI) the placement preferences of the family and 
     permanency team relative to the assessment that recognizes 
     children should be placed with their siblings unless there is 
     a finding by the court that such placement is contrary to 
     their best interest; and
       ``(VII) if the placement preferences of the family and 
     permanency team and child are not the placement setting 
     recommended by the qualified individual conducting the 
     assessment under subparagraph (A), the reasons why the 
     preferences of the team and of the child were not 
     recommended.
       ``(C) In the case of a child who the qualified individual 
     conducting the assessment under subparagraph (A) determines 
     should not be placed in a foster family home, the qualified 
     individual shall specify in writing the reasons why the needs 
     of the child cannot be met by the family of the child or in a 
     foster family home. A shortage or lack of foster family homes 
     shall not be an acceptable reason for determining that the 
     needs of the child cannot be met in a foster family home. The 
     qualified individual also shall specify in writing why the 
     recommended placement in a qualified residential treatment 
     program is the setting that will provide the child with the 
     most effective and appropriate level of care in the least 
     restrictive environment and how that placement is consistent 
     with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as 
     specified in the permanency plan for the child.
       ``(D)(i) Subject to clause (ii), in this subsection, the 
     term `qualified individual' means a trained professional or 
     licensed clinician who is not an employee of the State agency 
     and who is not connected to, or affiliated with, any 
     placement setting in which children are placed by the State.
       ``(ii) The Secretary may approve a request of a State to 
     waive any requirement in clause (i) upon a submission by the 
     State, in accordance with criteria established by the 
     Secretary, that certifies that the trained professionals or 
     licensed clinicians with responsibility for performing the 
     assessments described in subparagraph (A) shall maintain 
     objectivity with respect to determining the most effective 
     and appropriate placement for a child.
       ``(2) Within 60 days of the start of each placement in a 
     qualified residential treatment program, a family or juvenile 
     court or another court (including a tribal court) of 
     competent jurisdiction, or an administrative body appointed 
     or approved by the court, independently, shall--
       ``(A) consider the assessment, determination, and 
     documentation made by the qualified individual conducting the 
     assessment under paragraph (1);
       ``(B) determine whether the needs of the child can be met 
     through placement in a foster family home or, if not, whether 
     placement of the child in a qualified residential treatment 
     program provides the most effective and appropriate level of 
     care for the child in the least restrictive environment and 
     whether that placement is consistent with the short- and 
     long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency 
     plan for the child; and
       ``(C) approve or disapprove the placement.
       ``(3) The written documentation made under paragraph (1)(C) 
     and documentation of the determination and approval or 
     disapproval of the placement in a qualified residential 
     treatment program by a court or administrative body under 
     paragraph (2) shall be included in and made part of the case 
     plan for the child.
       ``(4) As long as a child remains placed in a qualified 
     residential treatment program, the State agency shall submit 
     evidence at each status review and each permanency hearing 
     held with respect to the child--
       ``(A) demonstrating that ongoing assessment of the 
     strengths and needs of the child continues to support the 
     determination that the needs of the child cannot be met 
     through placement in a foster family home, that the placement 
     in a qualified residential treatment program provides the 
     most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in 
     the least restrictive environment, and that the placement is 
     consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, 
     as specified in the permanency plan for the child;
       ``(B) documenting the specific treatment or service needs 
     that will be met for the child in the placement and the 
     length of time the child is expected to need the treatment or 
     services; and
       ``(C) documenting the efforts made by the State agency to 
     prepare the child to return home or to be placed with a fit 
     and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive

       ``(5) In the case of any child who is placed in a qualified 
     residential treatment program for more than 12 consecutive 
     months or 18 nonconsecutive months (or, in the case of a 
     child who has not attained age 13, for more than 6 
     consecutive or nonconsecutive months), the State agency shall 
     submit to the Secretary--
       ``(A) the most recent versions of the evidence and 
     documentation specified in paragraph (4); and

     requirements imposed by the amendments made by this chapter,

     Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 as being included in an 
     appropriation Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 727, the motion 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.
  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, for the fifth time since last fall, I rise today to 
present another continuing resolution, the House amendment to Senate 
amendment to H.R. 1892, to fund the operations of the Federal 
Government through March 23, fund the Department of Defense for the 
rest of fiscal year 2018, and extend critical healthcare programs, 
including funding for community health centers.
  Our current continuing resolution expires on Thursday, and without 
this legislation, large segments of the Federal Government will shut 
down again. Of course, all of us are keenly aware that more time is 
needed for our leaders in the House, the Senate, and the White House to 
negotiate overall funding levels for the 2018 fiscal year. This bill 
should allow that to happen.
  Mr. Speaker, this continuing resolution also makes a very limited 
number of technical changes in funding levels for only the most 
essential needs, including:
  To prevent delays in preparation for the 2020 Census;
  To ensure that the judicial branch is able to pay jurors;
  To provide $225 million in emergency funding for the Small Business 
Administration to provide emergency loans to those whose lives and 
livelihoods were destroyed by last year's historic natural disasters.
  This legislation also includes the full fiscal year 2018 Department 
of Defense Appropriations bill, totaling $659 billion for our Armed 
Forces.
  And I don't have to remind my colleagues that this bill has already 
passed this House three times on a bipartisan basis--most recently, 
last week.
  Mr. Speaker, we ask a great deal of our men and women in uniform, and 
we have an obligation to provide them and their families the resources 
they need to be safe, to complete their missions successfully at home 
and abroad. Governing from CR to CR just creates more unpredictability, 
more instability, and has real-life consequences for both our troops 
and civilians who support them.
  Mr. Speaker, the challenges we face around the world cannot be met 
under this Federal CR stop-and-go process. While we delay doing the 
Nation's business, our military and economic competitors are 
consolidating their gains.
  Finally, I would add, this legislation includes necessary funding 
extensions for bipartisan health priorities like community health 
centers and other public health programs. It also funds important 
Medicare extenders and includes commonsense reforms and improvements in 
the program.
  But let no one doubt our position on continuing resolutions. They are 
bad fiscal policy. They do not allow programs to grow, to be reduced or 
eliminated, if that is needed. They maintain outdated policies and stop 
new, critically important programs from ever starting, including 
programs that enhance national security and protect our Armed Forces 
from our enemies.
  Continuing resolutions are fiscally wasteful and prevent the 
executive branch and Congress from planning and preparing, and this is 
true for the private sector as well.
  Most importantly, they undermine congressional oversight that is 
constitutionally mandated for our appropriations.
  While I am pleased that we are here to include the Defense 
Appropriations

[[Page H889]]

bill in this continuing resolution, we must still pass all 12 
appropriations bills for the 2018 fiscal year, as well as our third 
emergency disaster supplemental.
  As soon as congressional and White House leaders reach a bipartisan 
agreement, which could and should happen at any moment, our committee 
will get to work immediately to finish negotiations on all 12 year-long 
funding bills.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Since President Trump's draconian FY 2018 budget was released last 
year, Democrats have warned Republicans that a bipartisan budget 
agreement was needed to adequately invest in American families and 
communities. Without a budget agreement, programs as diverse as Head 
Start, job training, and terrorism prevention grants are in danger of 
inadequate funding, at best.
  Instead of engaging with Democrats to reach a budget agreement, the 
majority is seeking to advance a full year of funding for only the 
Department of Defense, busting budget caps, while punting every other 
Federal service and investment to an uncertain future.
  Mr. Speaker, the most powerful country in the world now being 
completely run by a Republican government can't keep the lights on more 
than weeks at a time. How did we get here?
  Democrats will not go along with any plan that neglects critical 
national security and domestic needs. If this bill were to become law, 
the majority would have no workable plan to make the investments that 
are necessary for priorities, including biomedical research, 
infrastructure projects, Pell Grants, homeland security, assistance for 
local communities, veterans health, opioid funding, job training, the 
FBI, and other Federal law enforcement and more.
  This is not a serious bill. We know that it will be quickly rejected 
by the Senate. It is the furthest possible cry from regular order that 
the majority so frequently discusses yet rarely follows. It is nothing 
more than a political ploy that will place us on the brink of another 
shutdown.

                              {time}  1730

  It is well past time to increase budget caps and enact responsible 
spending bills. The majority displays a lack of urgency regarding 
reaching a budget agreement and enacting appropriations law, choosing 
instead to advance partisan measures that fail to lift unmanageable 
budget caps for both defense and nondefense.
  Republicans must abandon these partisan short-term bills and work 
with Democrats to fund the entirety of government for the remainder of 
the fiscal year to serve the American people.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, today, as the House takes up the fifth 
continuing resolution for FY18, it seems all too appropriate to quote 
President Reagan where he says: ``Here we go again.''
  I rise here on the floor of the House this afternoon to urge my 
colleagues to support the CR, which, of course, runs through March 23.
  As the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations' Subcommittee on 
Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies, our Nation's farmers and ranchers will find it hard 
to access credit during the upcoming planting season. And those 
recovering from disastrous weather events will not be able to access 
essential programs in order to help them if we do not finalize a full-
year funding agreement right away.
  These are just a couple of examples of the hardships that are faced 
by our citizens here in the U.S. that depend on this legislation.
  As I say, this is the fifth CR for this fiscal year. My colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle must come to the table willing to negotiate 
on these budget caps.
  As Members know, the House has passed each of the 12 appropriations 
bills. We have done our job. Of course, the other body continues to be 
the weakest link in all this, as it needs to seriously reform their 
process in order to do the work of the people.
  Finally, I appreciate that this bill includes full-year funding for 
the Department of Defense. To quote President Reagan once again: ``We 
have no choice but to maintain ready defense forces that are second to 
none. Yes, the cost is high, but the price of neglect would be 
infinitely higher.''
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.
  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, 
and I commend her for her extraordinary leadership on the 
Appropriations Committee, where important decisions are made about how 
to allocate the resources of our country to invest in the aspirations 
of the American people, to respect the sacrifice of our men and women 
in uniform, and to honor the vows of our Founders for a country that is 
making the future better for every generation to come.
  The distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Frelinghuysen, 
opened his remarks by saying he came to the floor to introduce the 
fifth continuing resolution. And the gentleman who followed him talked 
about this being the fifth continuing resolution.
  The more is not the merrier. It is like golf: the lower the score, 
the better. To have five continuing resolutions is a statement of 
incompetence and ineptitude.
  The Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House; 
yet they are pressing forward on their fifth stopgap, short-term 
spending bill, demonstrating their failure to govern.
  Since President Reagan was mentioned, I will mention our very first 
President, our patriarch, George Washington. President Washington, when 
he was leaving office, cautioned against political parties who were at 
war with their own government.
  Does that sound familiar to you?
  Here we are again, 2 days from another shutdown, careening toward 
another manufactured Republican crisis, demonstrating the Republican 
failure to govern.
  We don't want to go to that place. As Members of Congress, we take a 
solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States 
and to protect the American people.
  Democrats support a strong national defense. We, too, want our men 
and women in uniform to have the resources they need to keep them safe 
and to keep the American people safe as they accomplish their mission.
  But we will not allow Republicans to use this continuing resolution, 
the fifth time they had to come to the floor because they could not 
govern, to hollow out our Nation's commitment to the health, education, 
and economic security of America's working families.
  We all know that our military might is part of our Nation's strength, 
but the health, education, security, and well-being of the American 
people is also a source of that strength.
  Instead of working constructively with Democrats to meet the needs of 
the American people, Republicans are trying to starve the domestic 
budget. I just want to remind our colleagues: One-third, 34 percent--
one-third--of the nondefense domestic budget goes to national security. 
When you starve the domestic budget, you are not making us stronger. 
One-third of the domestic budget is about security; Homeland Security, 
Veterans Affairs, the State Department, and antiterrorism activities of 
the Justice Department.
  But Republicans refuse to give our patriots funded on the domestic 
side of the budget the resources they need to do their job, just the 
chaos and uncertainty of yet another stopgap extension.
  As Defense Secretary Mattis said, stopgap CRs ``just create 
unpredictability. It makes us rigid. We cannot deal with new and 
revealing threats. We know our enemies are not standing still, so it is 
about as unwise as it can be.'' And here are, as unwise as can be for 
the fifth time.

  And while their continuing resolution seeks to ransack every other 
commitment to the health of the American people, Republicans hide 
behind a fig leaf of a 2-year extension of community health centers.

[[Page H890]]

  We all support community health centers. It was a very important part 
of the Affordable Care Act. A very important part. Our colleague, 
assistant leader Mr. Clyburn from South Carolina, was one of the great 
champions of all time of Congress on expanding funding for programs for 
care and for bricks and mortar for our community health centers. This 
is a very important piece for us. We should be extending it in a fuller 
bill to 5 years, except it is used here to hide from the fact of so 
much other domestic investment that we are not making.
  Republicans are eliminating the Home Visiting initiative that is 
vital for maternal and child care, and cutting off workforce training 
for low-income Americans seeking good-paying jobs in healthcare.
  The sole purpose of this Republican bill is to destroy our leverage 
to achieve parity in the caps, to eliminate any need for bipartisan 
compromise, to eliminate any need to invest in working families.
  Why?
  Because if they get their defense number, then they don't have to 
negotiate about the domestic number. And as I said, we support our men 
and women in uniform having what they need to be safe and to keep us 
safe. But the strength of our country is measured in other ways as 
well.
  They don't believe that and they can't pass that, so they have to put 
the defense bill there. But we cannot support that because, again, it 
comes at the expense instead of as a source of strength to our country.
  Democrats simply want action on the critical overdue and bipartisan 
priorities of the American people so beautifully spelled out by our 
ranking member, Congresswoman Lowey.
  Again, we need funding for the opioid epidemic. The President talked 
about that. Show us the money. The opioid epidemic claims the lives of 
115 Americans every day, and it is getting worse every year in every 
district in the country. Bipartisan support is there to fight the 
opioid epidemic. Let's do it.
  We need more funding for veterans, to meet our responsibility and 
ensure that no veteran is denied the care they deserve upon returning 
from the battlefield.
  We need emergency disaster funding for all communities ravaged by 
hurricanes and wildfires.
  We need to save millions of hardworking Americans' endangered 
pensions.
  We need to pass the bipartisan Dream Act immediately. This is a moral 
priority for us. This is about the character of our Nation, who we are 
as a country. A nation, over time, constantly invigorated by people 
coming to our country to seek the American Dream; a dream that is 
predicated on every generation working to make the future better for 
the next; a dream that takes determination, optimism, hope, and 
courage. And when these newcomers come to America with that 
determination, that courage, that optimism, that hope, they associate 
themselves with the values of our Founders to make the future better 
for the next generation. These newcomers to America make America more 
American.
  So we asked to bring the Hurd-Aguilar bill to the floor. It is 
bipartisan. It has bipartisan support on the floor. It would pass. Have 
the courage to bring a bill that protects the DREAMers to the floor of 
the House.
  These priorities that I mentioned are all bipartisan. They would pass 
if brought to the floor for an up-or-down vote. The GOP squandered all 
their time, energy, votes, and enthusiasm on tax breaks for 
corporations and the wealthiest, with 83 percent of the tax bill going 
to the top 1 percent. And now Republicans need to get serious and get 
to work on a budget that funds both the military and the domestic 
investments that keep our Nation strong.
  I just want to make one point about that tax bill again. Did you see 
that the Speaker of the House sang the glory of the tax bill because a 
woman was getting $1.50 a week more in her paycheck? Did you see that? 
Do you believe that that is a good thing when the top 1 percent were 
probably getting $1,500 a week compared to her $1.50 a week in their 
paycheck?
  Thank God, after millions of people objected, the Speaker withdrew 
that tweet. But I don't think he withdrew that sentiment, because it is 
the same sentiment that haunts all of these negotiations about 
investing in the American people.
  Republicans must stop governing from manufactured crisis to crisis, 
and work with Democrats to pass many urgent, long-overdue priorities of 
the American people. As our distinguished ranking member, Mrs. Lowey, 
said earlier in her remarks, ``We must abandon these short-term 
bills.'' She spelled out very clearly why. I associate myself with her 
remarks.

  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Committee on 
Appropriations' Subcommittee on Homeland Security.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our fine Secretary of Defense this 
morning testified before the Committee on Armed Services. He remarked 
that if the military is forced to continue to operate under a 
continuing resolution for the rest of the year, it will be unable to 
provide pay to our brave men and women in uniform, unable to recruit 
personnel we need, unable to maintain our naval ships, unable to 
maintain our aircraft, unable to supply our troops in the theater of 
combat, and unable to strike contracts critical toward modernizing our 
force. Unable, unable, unable.
  As Congress, it is our responsibility to make our military force the 
most able in the world; able to keep our country safe and able to 
promote the ideals of freedom across the globe.
  It would be deeply irresponsible for Members of this House to vote 
against providing full-year funding to the Defense Department, which 
addresses the needs of today and tomorrow, not last year.
  The Secretary was on the Hill to discuss something very important: 
The Department's National Defense Strategy, which seeks to address the 
significant challenges we face with rising adversaries in China and 
Russia, along with enduring threats of a nuclear-armed Korea, a 
terrorist state in Iran, a terrorist network like ISIS. And he said: 
``I regret that, without sustained predictable appropriations, my 
presence here today wastes your time because no strategy can survive 
without funding necessary to resource it.''
  Mr. Speaker, this bill funds our military for the year with funding 
that addresses the challenges we face today and separates this critical 
funding from the political fights here in Washington, D.C. Our troops 
need our support for this bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the gentleman 
has expired.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, they need what this bill provides. 
Because of that, I support the bill and I urge its passage.

                              {time}  1745

  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the 
Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, the first observation I would make is: 
When I was raised by my parents, I was taught not to whine and not to 
blame others for problems that arose, but, rather, to work hard to 
solve them.
  I think it is long past time for people in this body to blame people 
in another body for the collective inability of the Congress of the 
United States to make a decision about something so important as the 
budget of the United States of America.
  It is a leadership issue for the Democratic leadership and the 
Republican leadership of the House to come to an agreement to overturn 
the caps of the Budget Control Act. It is time for the Democratic and 
Republican leadership of the Senate to do the same and for those two 
bodies to come to an agreement collectively to meet our constitutional 
responsibilities.
  A few days ago, I was on this floor and said that we were confronted 
with a number problem. That is, what is our total spending for this 
fiscal year? We are in the 129th day of it for the Department of 
Defense. What is the total budget number for all of our domestic 
spending so that we can have a strong and vibrant economy and people?
  We still have a number problem. For the sake of the country, for the 
sake of

[[Page H891]]

this institution, for the sake of our committee and the good work that 
Chairman Frelinghuysen, Mrs. Lowey, and the members of our committee 
have done repeatedly, please let us have some leadership.
  Lewis Carroll wrote ``Through the Looking Glass,'' and there was an 
interchange in that story:
  `` `Well, in our country,' said Alice, still panting a little, `you'd 
generally get to somewhere else--if you ran very fast for a long time, 
as we've been doing.' ''
  `` `A slow sort of country!' said the Queen. `Now, here, you see, it 
takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.' ''
  In September, we did the first CR to December 8 because it was going 
to be different then, but we are in the same place. Then we did a CR 
for December 22 because it was going to be different then, but we are 
in the same place. Then we did a CR for January 19 because it was going 
to be different and a new year, but we are in the same place.
  Today, we have February 8 because it was going to be different on 
February 8, and now it is going to be the fifth time we have done a 
continuing resolution to March 23 because it is going to be different 
next month. That is fine.
  We did our Defense Appropriations bill. We did it in July; then we 
did it in September; then we did it in December; then we did it in 
February--four times between CRs, repeatedly doing the same Defense 
Appropriations bill. We have done it nine times. If we go through this 
sequence one more time, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to be able to keep 
track of my numbers anymore.
  This is a numbers problem, and I would conclude by noting that I, for 
one, did not vote for the Budget Control Act, and I would note that an 
independently elected Congress set it aside for 2 years because they 
knew a mistake had been made. Then a subsequently elected Congress did 
away with the Budget Control Act because they had a 2-year deal because 
they knew they had made a mistake.
  There are negotiations--apparently taking place as we meet here 
today--to set it aside for another 2 years because they know we made a 
mistake within our legislation, because Chairman Frelinghuysen, Mrs. 
Lowey, my chairwoman, Ms. Granger, and I, everybody has been honest. We 
are going to set aside sequestration because we need to spend 
additional moneys on defense.
  How many times does Congress have to hit its head with a hammer to 
not fix this problem permanently? Three different independently elected 
Congresses have overturned a really rotten bill, and we are still in 
the same place. It is time to stop for the sake of this country.
  Give the chairman, give the ranking member, give the committees in 
both Houses numbers so we can complete our bills. The last time I 
looked, every department of this country has completed their work on 
fiscal year 2019, are going to present us with their budgets next week, 
and they don't know what we are doing this year.
  Mr. Speaker, this is unbecoming of a great nation.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his 
leadership and hard work on this effort.
  For over a year, the Ways and Means Committee has been leading 
efforts to advance smart, focused solutions to improve Medicare for the 
American people. A number of these solutions are included in the bill 
before us today. These policies take action on three primary goals:
  First, expanding access to high-quality care;
  Second, increasing efficiency in the way we deliver care--a key goal 
that will help patients better receive the care they need when they 
need it; and
  Third, incorporating healthcare technologies that are focused on 
patients, such as telehealth, and eliminating barriers to coordinating 
care.
  This means providing new tools to patients that healthcare providers 
can use to better access care and deliver it and, at the same time, 
reducing red-tape burdens that now make it harder for our local doctors 
to provide the high-quality care our Americans deserve.
  So many of these provisions have support from Republicans and 
Democrats, and for good reason. These are smart, targeted improvements 
that will go a long way in helping Medicare patients in Texas and, 
frankly, throughout the country.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the members of our committee and 
throughout the House who have worked on these provisions. Improving and 
strengthening Medicare for the long term is a major priority for the 
American people. With this bill, we have an opportunity to take 
meaningful steps toward this important goal.

  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting its 
passage.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the 
Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, 
and Related Agencies.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lowey and rise in 
opposition to this bill.
  Our Nation really needs to be on an even keel to produce steady 
economic growth in this country. This bill doesn't help that.
  I agree, America must have a strong defense, but a nation has to be 
strong at home to be strong abroad. You can't shortchange the home 
front. A nation at home must be secure, without wild stock market 
swings, to be strong abroad.
  A nation at home must be strong, without a massive drug epidemic here 
at home, to be strong abroad.
  This bill can't produce a steady economy with consistent job growth 
because it fails to dedicate sufficient resources here at home: to 
education, to healthcare, to employment and retraining, for Head Start, 
for energy independence, for law enforcement, and for localities 
savaged by the drug epidemic and shortchanged on treatment.
  Our ship of state needs to be on an even keel, not the wild 
fluctuations in this resolution. This bill tilts in the wind far, far 
starboard, and that is not a setting that can assure a steady ship of 
state to maintain a steady growth economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Human Resources of the House Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
continuing resolution package.
  While I appreciate this legislation will keep government open, fund 
community health centers for 2 years, and fully fund our military while 
we continue to work toward a broader budget agreement, I would like to 
focus on the various Ways and Means Committee provisions included in 
the bill.
  This legislation includes numerous Medicare provisions important to 
rural health providers and patients, including permanently repealing 
therapy caps and extending the floor on geographic payment adjustments 
for rural providers and add-ons for rural ambulance providers.
  Just as importantly, these health provisions are paid for without 
cutting swing bed reimbursements to critical access hospitals, 
including the 55 critical access hospitals in Nebraska's Third District 
as originally proposed.
  I am particularly pleased that two important programs within the 
jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Human Resources--which I chair--are 
included today. We have much work to do to lift Americans out of 
poverty and into prosperity, and each of these bills will play an 
important part in this effort.
  The Family First Prevention Services Act reforms our child welfare 
system to reinforce the importance of keeping children with their 
families whenever possible. We know children who stay with their 
families have better long-term outcomes than those who move to 
nonfamily settings, and our goal for every program in this space to 
demonstrate results through empirical evidence.
  I want to thank the sponsor of Family First, Mr. Buchanan, for 
working with me to address my concerns about nurse staffing 
requirements which would have been costly to implement for entities 
like Omaha-based Boys Town, while providing no tangible improvements to 
their family driven model of care.

[[Page H892]]

  The other H.R. item in this package, the supporting Social Impact 
Partnerships to Pay for Results Act, also moves our family support 
programs to a more results-driven model by incentivizing States and 
local governments to pilot new ideas and reserving Federal funding 
until they demonstrate outcomes through rigorous data-driven 
evaluation. We still have more work to do in this space, starting with 
completing the work begun by this Chamber last September when we passed 
a paid-for 5-year MIECHV reauthorization.
  But like the rest of this legislation, these provisions are a 
downpayment on the work we are committed to completing.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Nebraska.
  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the 
time, and I certainly urge passage of this bill.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the 
Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose this continuing 
resolution. I cannot support a bill that flies in the face of 
responsible governing. This is pure incompetence.
  How many times are we going to do this? This is our fifth short-term 
spending bill since September. How many times will we punt our 
priorities, lurching from one self-inflicted wound to another?
  That is exactly what the continuing resolution represents: a failure 
to govern. It is shameful that, yet again, we neglect our core 
obligation as a Congress, which is to fund government programs. We 
should be voting on new top-line spending levels for 2018, that 
alleviate sequestration from both nondefense and defense spending.
  We should have spent the last few months fulfilling our 
responsibility as legislators by writing bipartisan bills to fund 
programs that help the middle class and the vulnerable, support 
evidence-based scientific research, and help working people get the 
skills they need to find good jobs and get good wages.
  Instead, the majority forced through their tax scam for millionaires 
and billionaires. They became the first party to ever control both 
Chambers of Congress and the White House, and, yes, they shut down the 
government. And today, the President of the United States says that he 
supports a government shutdown.
  The Republican majority has failed to respond to the needs of the 
American people. Instead of working with Democrats to set budget 
numbers and ensure parity, equal for defense spending and nondefense 
spending, they have put the government on autopilot.

                              {time}  1800

  They put services and investments that are critical to our families 
and to our communities at grave risk from apprenticeships to education 
for students with disabilities, childcare, after-school programs that 
help working families make ends meet, and financial aid for students 
who are attending college. Instead, they are forcing through another 
continuing resolution, this time cutting almost $3 billion from the 
Prevention Fund over the next 10 years on top of the $750 million that 
they cut in December.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut an 
additional 1 minute.
  Ms. DeLAURO. We are talking about cuts to programs that improve our 
public health immunization infrastructure at a time when the flu is 
rampant in this country, as well as cuts to lead poisoning prevention 
programs that seek to prevent and ultimately eliminate childhood lead 
poisoning.
  Programs like these and dozens of others in the Prevention Fund save 
billions of taxpayer dollars by preventing illness and disease before 
they occur.
  You cut the Prevention Fund and you cause millions of Americans to 
suffer for no reason. You pit community health centers against the 
Prevention Fund.
  Take the money, the $1\1/2\ trillion that you give to the richest 
people in this country: the millionaires, the billionaires, and the 
richest corporations; don't take it from children's health, don't take 
it from the healthcare centers, and don't take it from the Prevention 
Fund. It is unacceptable, because here we are talking about people's 
lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: Reject this continuing resolution. 
It fails to meet our obligations to the American people.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Barton), who is the vice chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee.
  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Appropriations 
Committee chairman for yielding me time.
  I rise in support of this continuing resolution. Obviously, we would 
rather fund the government for the entire year before the start of the 
fiscal year, but that is in a perfect world, and one thing that the 
Congress has never been accused of is being a perfect world. So we are 
here dealing in the real world.
  To my good friend from Connecticut who just spoke, and she is my good 
friend, I would point out that the bill before us doesn't cut money 
from the Prevention Fund. It directs money from the Prevention Fund to 
spend on healthcare programs. In other words, it is taking some 
discretion from the executive branch and directing that spending that 
Congress thinks it should be spent for.
  One of the programs that we are going to fund for 2 years is the 
community health centers. Twenty-four million people each year get 
their healthcare from these community health centers, and one of them 
is in my home county, the Hope Clinic. Its main facility is in 
Waxahachie, Texas. But in my hometown of Ennis, we have the Nell Barton 
Hope Clinic Annex. These two facilities in Ellis County this year are 
providing healthcare for over 10,000 Ellis Countians.
  This is not exotic care. It is checkups, screenings, mammograms, and 
all the odds and ends that you have in your basic healthcare 
facilities. If they need more specific treatment, they are referred to 
specialists in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
  But for the 10,000 citizens of Ellis County who depend on the Hope 
Clinic for their healthcare, this is a big bill. In fact, the executive 
director of the Hope Clinic was in my office today, saying: We want to 
expand, but we don't know if we are going to have the funds. We really 
need to get some certainty.
  That is what this bill is all about. So I rise in strong support, and 
I urge a ``yes'' vote on the CR later this evening.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Lee), who is a senior member of the Appropriations 
Committee.
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and, once again, for her tremendous leadership on so many issues as our 
ranking member.
  As a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee, 
I rise in strong opposition to this continuing resolution. This bill 
kicks the can down the road for the fifth time--mind you, fifth time--
since October. It also shamelessly includes the stand-alone defense 
spending bill of $659 billion to an already out-of-control Pentagon 
budget.
  This bill breaks the budget caps. It includes $75 billion for wars 
that Congress has never debated or voted on. It also includes more than 
$1 billion in funds to increase troop levels in Afghanistan by 3,500, 
not to mention the millions--the billions, actually--in waste, fraud, 
and abuse that taxpayers have already lost by irresponsible Pentagon 
spending.
  This is outrageous. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and 
the White House. The least they could do is keep the government open. 
Yet here we stand, once again, with no deal on DREAMers and no 
agreement on a long-term spending bill.
  Clearly, Republicans have no strategy on funding the government. They 
would prefer to pass CR after CR after CR after CR. This is beyond 
irresponsible, Mr. Speaker.

[[Page H893]]

  How long will Republicans govern from crisis to crisis? Nobody can 
manage their household or their business like the Republicans are 
managing our government spending.
  This short-term resolution once again ignores urgent bipartisan 
priorities the Democrats have been fighting for for months with 
Republicans, the most urgent of which is passing a clean Dream Act. 
DACA recipients are American in every way except on paper, and right 
now their lives are hanging in the balance. We have less than 1 month 
until DACA expires, a deadline that the President, himself, created.
  This continuing resolution is really irresponsible, and it is morally 
bankrupt.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an 
additional 1 minute.
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, this continuing resolution fails to honor the 
temporary protective status for immigrants.
  It fails to raise budget caps for defense and nondefense spending, 
and it neglects to provide desperately needed funding for hurricane- 
and wildfire-impacted communities, the opioid crisis, and our veterans.
  This bill underscores the majority's complete lack of regard for 
everyday Americans and struggling families.
  Continuing resolutions leave the American people out on a limb with 
no confidence in their Federal Government. This resolution makes it 
clear that that is just what Republicans want to do.
  The American people sent us to Congress to govern in their best 
interest. Now we have spent the last 4 months passing short-term 
spending bills one after another, and for what? Because Republicans 
refuse to do their job.
  Instead of wasting more time on this terrible CR, we should deal with 
our bipartisan priorities and fund the government for the long term. It 
is the right thing to do for our communities and our country.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who is a member of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for doing an 
outstanding job this year passing all 12 appropriations bills.
  Mr. Speaker, I support passage of this CR which includes three 
provisions of mine. It will reauthorize the Community Health Center 
program, providing $3.6 billion per year for the next 2 years.
  Community health centers have a proven track record of providing 
high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare to approximately 25 million 
Americans and have long enjoyed bipartisan support because they are a 
prime example of what is working in our healthcare system.
  The CR updates the civil and criminal penalties in the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs. Many haven't been updated in over 20 years.
  It also repeals the Medicare therapy cap. This will ensure that 
patients who need physical, speech, or occupational therapy services 
can receive them without fear of losing their benefits if they hit an 
arbitrary cap. This is so important to our seniors, Mr. Speaker.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the ranking member of the Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member for yielding me 
the time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation, a misguided 
bill that ignores the urgent needs of the American people.
  The Federal Government's fiscal year started October 1, 2017--128 
days ago. Instead of using that time to get their work done, 
Republicans have focused solely on partisan politics. When it comes to 
the essential responsibility of funding the Federal Government, the 
Republicans can't be bothered.
  Now we are asked, today, to vote for a bill that funds the Pentagon 
for the rest of the year while funding our schools and our hospitals 
for just 43 days.
  Mr. Speaker, our national security begins at home with investments in 
the future that keep our families and our communities safe, strong, and 
moving forward. This bill ignores those needs. It provides no certainty 
for our law enforcement professionals, no long-term funding for urgent 
repairs to our crumbling infrastructure, and no confidence for 
investments in lifesaving medical research. It doesn't even provide a 
full year of funding for veterans' healthcare.
  While it is encouraging that Republicans are finally reauthorizing 
vital healthcare programs like our community health centers, paying for 
these programs with cuts to the CDC's Prevention and Public Health 
Fund, which is currently providing lifesaving vaccines in this severe 
flu season, is the height of irresponsibility.
  Discord and delay is no way to run a government, but under Republican 
control, that is exactly what we are getting.
  Mr. Speaker, unlike the President, I do not want a government 
shutdown. We need a budget agreement that keeps our government open, 
protects our national security, and meets our commitments to 
hardworking families. So let's stop playing games, get to our work, and 
get to it now.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is a member of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee.
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this 
spending measure under consideration and what it means for our country 
and our constituents.
  This continuing resolution we are considering includes a number of 
extremely important health provisions that are desperately needed.
  Under this legislation, we will see a 2-year extension of federally 
qualified health centers that employ nearly 190,000 people and serve 
over 24 million people across the country.
  There is also a 2-year extension of public health programs such as 
the National Health Service Corps, the Teaching Health Center Graduate 
Medical Education, Family-to-Family Health Information Centers, and the 
Sexual Risk Avoidance Education Program.
  Additionally, this helps hospitals by eliminating the $5 million in 
reductions for Disproportionate Share Hospitals that were included in 
the ACA.
  Many of the good bills my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee have worked on are included in this legislation to improve 
public health and make reforms to Medicare.

  Finally, this legislation pushes through a permanent repeal of the 
Medicare payment cap for therapy services, meaning that patients will 
have better access to important medical devices.
  All of these efforts wouldn't be possible without the work of 
Chairman Walden, Chairman Burgess, and my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle in the Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Mr. Speaker, now is the time to work together to ensure that these 
bills are passed into law, and that is why I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is the ranking member of the 
Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee.
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding and for her leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing 
resolution which, yet again, is a complete and total abdication of our 
responsibilities as Members of Congress.
  For the fifth time so far this fiscal year, Republicans are asking us 
to fund the government for just another flip of the calendar. The last 
time Republicans dragged us down this path of budgetary incompetence, 
we had the first ever complete government shutdown when one party held 
the House, Senate, and the White House. Yet here we are again, left 
with this ludicrous approach of funding the U.S. Government month to 
month while ignoring so many of the pressing issues Americans want us 
to address.
  Today we have heard Republicans pay endless lip service to their 
devotion to military spending--and that

[[Page H894]]

funding is certainly vital--but what Republicans have not mentioned is 
that this latest stopgap gimmick is going to rob from crucial 
nondefense budgets that also keep Americans safe. That means veterans, 
homeland security, counterterrorism, and State Department programs will 
be neglected and ignored.
  That is why Democrats are asking for a simple compromise to raise the 
spending caps that are unreasonable and uncompromising. That is because 
we all want a strong national defense, but we also need equal increases 
in our domestic budget so that hardworking families can feel safe and 
financially secure.
  We also want Republicans to join us in confronting the dire shortfall 
at the VA so no veteran is denied care upon returning home.
  We want Republicans to work with us to ensure urgently needed 
recovery funds go to Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, and all areas impacted by wildfires.

                              {time}  1815

  We want Republicans to truly help us fight this opioid scourge, 
protect America's pensions, and do what the vast majority of Americans 
want us to do: pass a clean Dream Act.
  Don't tell me we don't have the funds to support those needs. This 
Congress just gave a huge handout to billionaires and giant 
corporations that exploded the deficit by $1.5 trillion.
  But this cynically crafted continuing resolution fails to address 
those real needs, the needs of the people who actually sent us here to 
stand up for them. We must end this cycle of budgetary neglect.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. Dunn).
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, our troops comprise the most professional, 
highly trained, and dedicated military force that the world has ever 
seen. They have pledged their lives, the well-being of their families, 
and their sacred honor to serve and protect this Nation.
  Yet here we are, over a month into 2018, and our military and 
national security are being held hostage by our colleagues across the 
aisle over unrelated issues.
  It is time for the Senate to get its act together. The House has 
passed the full defense funding three times this year. Tonight, we will 
pass it a fourth time.
  It is wrong for us to send our best young men and women into harm's 
way without the resources they need, asking them to make up with their 
efforts, and their risk, for our shortcomings.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this funding legislation 
and to prove to our troops that we have their backs.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1892.
  Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that, once again, my Republican 
colleagues are playing politics with important health programs.
  Rather than bringing a stand-alone, bipartisan health extenders 
package to the floor, the Republicans have once again delayed any 
action on these extenders so that they could attach them to a CR that 
Democrats could not support.
  The strategy may hide their inability to pass a final funding bill 
for a fiscal year that began on October 1, but it has also created 
uncertainty for the millions of Americans who rely on these programs 
every day.
  I am glad that Republicans have dropped some of the harmful offsets 
that have led to months of delay and uncertainty for these health 
programs. However, our main concern is that the package excludes 
important health priorities, including the Maternal, Infant, and Early 
Childhood Home Visiting Program; the Health Profession Opportunity 
Grants program; and the increased funding that is desperately needed to 
combat the ongoing opioid crisis.
  The CR poses a serious threat to public health because it cuts $2.85 
billion from the Prevention Fund. These funds are critical to keeping 
Americans healthy. The Prevention Fund funds vaccines for children, 
lead poisoning prevention, opioid prevention, diabetes, heart disease, 
and other prevention programs.
  I am also concerned with the Medicaid cuts in this package. 
Republicans have included over $10 billion in Medicaid cuts, including 
new money from the Medicaid Improvement Fund.
  We should also reject the prioritization of funding for the Defense 
Department at the expense of all of our domestic needs.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' It is the only way we are going 
to guarantee that, ultimately, these health programs are funded and 
that we don't rely so much on the Prevention Fund.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, it is so interesting to listen to this 
debate. I just want to make three points.
  First, on the military funding, I represent Fort Campbell. When you 
walk on that post and talk to the men and women in uniform and talk to 
them about their readiness training, their redeployment training, do 
you know what they tell us?
  They say: Give us certainty in funding.
  That is exactly what we are doing, is providing that certainty that 
they need to defend us, to protect us. They deserve it and they deserve 
our best efforts. So I find it so curious that there would be 
opposition to funding our military.
  The second point is the community health centers. Many of my 
colleagues may come from urban areas. I have a rural district. 
Community health centers are vitally important to my constituents, to 
Tennesseans who want the access to care and seek the education to know 
how to take better care of themselves and their families. Let's give 
them this funding for the 2 years of certainty that is necessary.
  Third, legislation that I have authored and worked on is included in 
the Medicare therapy cap provisions.
  Have you ever talked to a senior, as I have, who had a stroke, who is 
seeking speech therapy or physical therapy from a hip replacement or a 
fall?
  There is an arbitrary cap that runs out and they can no longer seek 
that medical attention that is necessary for a full and complete 
recovery and the quality of life that they desire and that they 
deserve. This is something that our committee has worked on to provide 
for seniors.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Tennessee.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. This is something that allows them to have that 
quality of life.
  Why would you vote against lifting these caps and giving seniors what 
they deserve?

  They have paid for Medicare through their working life. What they are 
seeking is to be able to have a full recovery. It is not only the 
appropriate thing to do, this is something that adds to the quality of 
life, just as keeping these community health centers funded enriches 
our communities. It enriches rural America.
  I close with reiterating the point that, out of fairness, out of 
respect, out of loyalty to those who put on the uniform to defend us, 
let us join together and vote to fund the military and to support their 
efforts to defend this Nation.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee and his great staff who have worked diligently 
all year, month after month after month. Five months ago next week, 
they approved all 12 appropriations bills, one after another, regular 
order, through the House of Representatives. But there they sit over in 
the Senate and the Democrats block them.
  What brings us here today is really important work. What brings us 
here today is that we are taking care of significant public healthcare 
issues. We are fully funding for the next 2 years community health 
centers.

[[Page H895]]

  I have heard from my colleagues about the things that aren't in this 
bill that they wish were, so that is why they are going to vote ``no,'' 
or some other thing that is not even before us and that is why they are 
going to vote ``no.''
  But let's talk about what is actually before us.
  What is before us is taking care of our men and women in uniform and 
their needs, especially when they are in harm's way, and fund really, 
really important public health programs that used to always be 
bipartisan.
  Let's talk about those. Valley Family Health Care Outreach Center in 
Ontario and Winding Waters Clinic in Wallowa County. I have visited 
both of these recently. They are on the front lines of healthcare 
prevention. They are on the front lines of saving lives and helping 
children and adults. Or La Clinica down in the Medford-Ashland area.
  In fact, in my district, we have 12 federally qualified health 
centers and 63 delivery sites that give care for 240,000 Oregonians. 
Twenty-four million nationwide are served by this.
  On November 3, this House had the opportunity to fully fund those 
community health centers for 2 years and take care of children's health 
insurance and a lot of these other programs. It was a separate bill 
brought to the House floor, and a handful of Democrats broke with their 
party and voted with us. But, unfortunately, when it got to the Senate, 
they couldn't be freed up to support it. So we had to come back in the 
last continuing resolution and fully fund the Children's Health 
Insurance Program. I am not sure many Democrats voted for that here, 
unfortunately.
  But here we are today, same process, same situation to fund community 
health centers. So we are going to do that. Your choice when you vote 
is ``yes'' or ``no,'' you want the community health centers funded or 
not, you want to shut the government down or not, you want to take care 
of our military or not.
  Then there is the disproportionate share hospitals.
  What are those?
  Those are the hospitals in our districts and States that take care 
disproportionately of more poorer people than other hospitals. Under 
the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare, however you want to describe it, 
there was prescribed in law automatic cuts to these hospitals that take 
care of the poorest of the poor in our communities. Those cuts totaled 
$2 billion.
  In this legislation, as in the legislation we brought from the Energy 
and Commerce Committee on November 3, we turn off those cuts. We say: 
Don't do that to our DSH hospitals.
  If you are at Saint Alphonsus in Ontario, Oregon, that is the most 
affected hospital, I am told, and they will lose money and have to 
decide how they cope with that. We solve that here for 2 years at $6.8 
million in my State.
  Then we extend the special diabetes programs. For heaven's sake, we 
should be able to come together in this Chamber and in this Congress to 
take care of people with diabetes. My grandfather lost both legs due to 
diabetes. They were amputated. I have other relatives and good friends 
whose kids have dealt with diabetes and still do to this day.
  For our Native Americans and others, we have two separate programs. 
We fully fund them and tie them together. That is done in this 
legislation. Fifty thousand people in my district have diabetes. My 
hunch is all of our districts are not dissimilar from that. We take 
care of those people in this legislation.

  Then we take care of therapy caps. Since 1997, when this law was put 
in place, people who needed physical therapy--my colleague from 
Tennessee talked about it--stroke victims, seniors who need therapy, 
rather than the physical therapist or the speech therapist saying, 
``Here is the program you need to get well, get on your feet, recover 
from whatever it is that afflicts you,'' the government put an 
arbitrary cap, and that was it. You were done whether you were done or 
not.
  Everybody is different in terms of recovery. We repeal the therapy 
caps in here.
  By the way, we have heard about all these things that now won't get 
funded because a part of this funding comes out of the Public 
Prevention Fund. Mr. Speaker, $2.85 billion is not insignificant, it is 
true, but we are applying that money to help prevention and community 
health centers, as we did before for the Children's Health Insurance 
Program.
  We are providing it for diabetes health. We are removing the physical 
therapy caps so that people can get well. That seems to me to be pretty 
good use of the Prevention Fund.
  By the way, during the same period we are spending $2.85 billion out 
of that, there will still remain $12 billion left, and the talented 
folks at the Appropriations Committee will decide how that money is 
spent on vaccines and all these other issues, all these things we care 
about. There is still $12 billion left. So we are using discretionary 
funds that were set aside for that very purpose here.
  Then we heard about some Medicaid cuts. Let me tell you what those 
are. We said: If you are a big lottery winner, maybe now that you have 
won a big prize, you shouldn't be on government-funded Medicaid 
because, by the way, you won a bazillion dollars.
  So we are taking lottery winners and saying you have got to treat 
that big windfall when you calculate whether that person is poor or not 
anymore. So that is in here.
  Then, on third-party liability, we said that if insurers actually are 
responsible for the cost, insurers should pay the cost rather than the 
taxpayer. So we make a little reform here that puts the insurers first 
to pay rather than the taxpayer.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the marvelous work he has done.

                              {time}  1830

  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This is the latest example of Republicans being completely incapable 
of governing. We must finish our work.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am in receipt of the Statement of 
Administration Policy, which indicates that the administration supports 
this continuing resolution and that the President's advisers would 
recommend his signature on the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration 
Policy dated February 6, 2018.

                   Statement of Administration Policy


     House Amendment to H.R. 1892--Further Extension of Continuing 
           Appropriations Act, 2018--Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ

       The Administration supports the House Amendment to the 
     Senate Amendment to H.R. 1892, the Further Extension of 
     Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018. This bill funds most 
     Government programs at current levels through March 23, 2018, 
     while incorporating the text of the House-passed fiscal year 
     (FY) 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which 
     provides the resources the military needs to keep the Nation 
     safe. As the Administration has noted previously, the House-
     passed Department of DefenseAppropriations Act is consistent 
     with the President's pledge to undo the looming defense 
     spending reductions that are harmful to America's national 
     security and military readiness.
       The House-passed Department of Defense Appropriations Act 
     incorporated in the bill includes a total of $659 billion for 
     the Department of Defense (DOD), including $584 billion in 
     base spending and $75 billion for Overseas Contingency 
     Operations. These amounts are consistent with a total funding 
     level for DOD similar to that authorized by the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which was 
     signed into law by the President. It includes $1.2 billion 
     requested by the Administration to support increased troop 
     levels in Afghanistan, special operations forces 
     capabilities, and other urgent needs.
       The United States military's greatest asset is the men and 
     women who volunteer to serve. This bill keeps faith with 
     service members by providing a 2.4 percent military pay 
     raise. It increases end strength across the military services 
     for active duty, reserve, and National Guard personnel, and 
     includes funding for training and maintenance to ensure that 
     United States troops are properly equipped and ready to 
     fight.
       In addition to supporting the defense bill, the 
     Administration supports language in the House Amendment to 
     H.R. 1892 that provides for an extension of a variety of 
     healthcare provisions, including Community Health Centers. 
     The Administration is also appreciative that the bill 
     includes language requested by the Administration to ensure 
     continuity of operations for the 2020 Decennial Census 
     Program and the Small Business Administration's Disaster 
     Loans Program.
       The Administration supports continuing discussions over a 
     two-year budget agreement that ensures funding for national 
     defense and other priorities. As those discussions continue, 
     however, it is dangerous to

[[Page H896]]

     hold defense funding for the current fiscal year hostage to 
     arbitrary demands for lower-priority domestic programs.
       If the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 
     2018, were presented to the President in its current form, 
     his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.

  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues in the 
House to support this continuing resolution to keep the government open 
for business until March 23 and to support our men and women in the 
armed services who do the work of freedom each and every day.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 727, the previous question is ordered.
  The question is on the motion by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
Frelinghuysen).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-
minute vote on the motion to concur will be followed by a 5-minute vote 
on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 219, if ordered.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 245, 
nays 182, not voting 3, as follows:

                             [Roll No. 60]
