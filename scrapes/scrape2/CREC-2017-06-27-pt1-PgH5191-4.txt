                           OPPOSING TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office confirmed that the Senate version of the Republican 
healthcare bill, TrumpCare, is even meaner and more heartless than the 
House-passed version. It is so mean that already some Republican 
Senators have come out opposing even bringing this bill to the floor 
for debate. But, of course, that won't be the end of it. We should 
beware of the backroom deals that will be attempted to get Republican 
Senators on board to move this terrible bill forward.
  But any amount of window dressing or backroom deals won't change the 
basics. This bill will require Americans to pay higher costs. Don't 
just look at premiums. Look at the out-of-pocket expenses that 
Americans will have to pay. It will go up for worse care and for less 
coverage.
  If you are age 50 to 65, get ready, because you will see an age tax. 
You will have to pay up to five times what younger, healthy Americans 
will pay.
  Of course, this bill, because it rewards those at the very top, 
steals from Medicare. It makes Medicare less sustainable. We ought to 
reject this legislation. We ought to do it now, and we ought to send 
that message to every Member of the U.S. Senate.
