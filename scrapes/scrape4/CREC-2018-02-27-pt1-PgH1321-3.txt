                 MAKING ENDING GUN VIOLENCE A PRIORITY

  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, we don't want to go to 
school in a prison. That was the message I heard today from five 
incredible students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 
Parkland, Florida.
  As they get ready for their school to reopen, what kind of school 
will we be sending them and all of our children back to? It should not 
be one of armed teachers. They should be there to teach. What they need 
are real solutions.
  Military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines are 
designed for the sole purpose of killing as many people as possible. 
They have no place on our streets.
  No matter what gun you are buying, nobody should be able to complete 
a purchase without clearing a background check. That is common sense.
  But Republicans are refusing to act because the NRA and gun 
manufacturers value profits over safety. That is not right.
  The students told me today that they want to make ending gun violence 
a priority for their generation, and that means acting today.
