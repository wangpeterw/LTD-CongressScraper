              RECOGNIZING CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS

  (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our critical public 
health programs. Months ago, the House passed a bundle of 
reauthorizations for key health programs. Amongst them are funding 
extensions for the community health centers, CHIP, and the National 
Health Service Corps.
  Today, we will vote for CHIP reauthorization for a third time. I will 
be voting ``yes'' for a third time, and it appears that most of my 
Democratic colleagues will be voting ``no'' for a third time. Programs 
like these help ensure that millions of Americans and hundreds of 
thousands of Nebraskans receive the care they so desperately need. It 
is abhorrent that these programs have become a political football, and 
it is unacceptable that the healthcare that so many depend on has been 
put to the side.
  This upcoming spring, Nebraska will run out of funding for community 
health centers and CHIP. While a contingency plan may be in the works, 
these lifesaving programs should not require a fallback. I count on my 
colleagues in the Senate and the House to pass legislation, to vote 
``yes'' today on CHIP and community health centers and many other key 
programs in the future.
