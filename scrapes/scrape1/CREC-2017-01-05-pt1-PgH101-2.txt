                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of Heaven and Earth, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  Lord, You know our capabilities as a nation. You know our limitations 
better than we know ourselves. You see clearly the needs of our day and 
the steps that must be taken.
  For the Members of the people's House, be a gentle light. Lead them 
forth day by day along the path of consistency and integrity, that the 
knots of contradiction would be unraveled and together Your people will 
walk with clarity of vision, determination of purpose, and a new depth 
of human understanding.
  Bless all the people of our Nation, especially those in most need of 
Your mercy.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
