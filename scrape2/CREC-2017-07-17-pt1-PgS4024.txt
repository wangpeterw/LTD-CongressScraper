                     TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN RANDY DOPP

 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I wish to honor an outstanding 
American, Captain Randy Dopp, on his retirement from American Airlines.
  Captain Dopp distinguished himself with over 31 years of safe 
commercial airline flying for Piedmont, USAirways, and American 
Airlines. He has been well-known for his commitment to airline pilots 
and to the flying community.
  Over the years, I have relied on Captain Dopp's knowledge and 
insights on issues relating to airlines, pensions, and aviation safety. 
I know that his wisdom and service will be greatly missed.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Captain Dopp on his 
accomplishments and congratulating him on his retirement.
