                       TRIBUTE TO ALEC DiFRUSCIA

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of 
my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Alec 
DiFruscia. Alec hails from Tewksbury, MA, and is a senior at George 
Washington University.
  During his internship, Alec assisted the committee's press office. He 
is a dedicated worker who has been committed to getting the most out of 
his internship. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Alec for 
all of the fine work he did for the committee and wish him continued 
success in the years to come.
