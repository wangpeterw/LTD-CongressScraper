                      BIG TALK AND BROKEN PROMISES

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, today we have a new Trump budget and more 
broken promises. If you recall on May 7, 2015, the President said: ``I 
was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be 
no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.''
  Broken promise number one. His budget cuts Medicaid, it cuts 
Medicare, it cuts Social Security.
  In The Washington Post on January 15, 2017, the President said: ``We 
are going to have insurance for everybody. Much less expensive and much 
better.''
  This broken promise number two is that he cuts $1.4 trillion out of 
healthcare and covers 24 million less people, jacking up insurance 
rates for countless others.
  Broken promise number three to the Farm Bureau at ag.com on April 24, 
2017: ``I support a strong safety net for our Nation's farmers.'' Yet 
he cuts $50 billion over 10 years from farm subsidies, including 
critical citrus greening research dollars for central Florida, where I 
represent.
  Then on September 28, 2016, The Washington Times, he says: ``I will 
be the greatest President for jobs that God's ever created.'' He is 
cutting the National Institutes of Health, critical research dollars by 
$5.8 billion, cutting NASA by $200 million, cutting National Science 
Foundation by $776 million. We see big talk and broken promises.
