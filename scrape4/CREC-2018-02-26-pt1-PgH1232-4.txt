          RECOGNIZING THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF SALLY HARRISON

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary 
work of Sally Harrison.
  Sally is the president and CEO of the Mesa Chamber of Commerce. She 
has worked in this role since 2013. Mesa's business environment is 
thriving with her at the helm.
  Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, Sally led the meeting at Arizona 
State University Polytechnic campus with Congressman Jim Bridenstine 
and the Mesa Industry and Defense Council. Under her leadership, this 
unique council continues to highlight the tremendous technological and 
manufacturing capabilities we have in my district. There have been 
positive reports of the discussion she facilitated, and I am confident 
that she will continue to create these opportunities for my 
constituents.
  These conversations between local officials, Federal office holders, 
and business leaders are paramount to ensuring that our constituents 
receive the best possible representation. Sally understands this and is 
working every day to facilitate enduring success in Mesa and our 
region.
  I thank her for her service to our great city.
