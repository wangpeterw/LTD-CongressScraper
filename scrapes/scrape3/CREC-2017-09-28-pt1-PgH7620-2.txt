                 LETTER CARRIER DONTE COTTON IS A HERO

  (Mr. TURNER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I first want to welcome Steve Scalise back 
to this House floor. The strength of his message shows why he is such a 
hero to us all.
  I also want to tell the story of another hero, one from my 
congressional district in Dayton, Ohio.
  On April 5, 2016, letter carrier Donte Cotton saw an overturned car 
that had collided with a pole. The driver told Donte her child was 
inside the car. Acting on immediate instinct, Donte crawled through 
broken glass to rescue the baby from the car. Both the mother and the 
child were taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries.
  In August of last year, Donte again found himself in the right place 
at the right time; again, on his letter carrying route.
  While on his normal mail delivery route, an elderly woman, whose home 
had just been invaded, ran up to Donte seeking help. Donte drove the 
woman to a nearby police cruiser, ensuring her safety.
  His courage is being rewarded this week by the National Association 
of Letter Carriers, which has given Donte its 2017 Central Area Hero 
Award.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Donte for his acts of true heroism 
in our community.
