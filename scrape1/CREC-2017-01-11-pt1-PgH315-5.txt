                    LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day, which was observed this week inhonor of 
the contributions countless men and women in uniform have made to keep 
our communities safe and secure.
  This year's observance was particularly difficult for our Kansas 
community. Over the last year, three police officers in mydistrict made 
the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty. Brad Lancaster, Dave 
Melton of Kansas City, and Brandon Collinsof Overland Park each lost 
their lives while protecting our community.
  Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is a day to remember them and to 
honor the men and women who remain in the field each daykeeping our 
children and families safe. They are the ones who run into danger when 
others run away. They are the true heroes,and we should always regard 
them as such. It is also a day to honor the United States Capitol 
Police to keep Congress, ourstaff, and our visitors in this very 
Chamber safe.
  Mr. Speaker, let us never forget the service and sacrifice of our law 
enforcement officers, and let us continue to honorthem with the 
gratitude and respect they deserve.
