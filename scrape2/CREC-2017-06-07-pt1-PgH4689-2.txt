                      CELEBRATING LADY BETTY COLES

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and 
celebrate the 90th birthday of Lady Betty Coles of Trenton, New Jersey. 
She was wonderfully celebrated this weekend at a party attended by over 
100 family members and friends, thanks to her daughter and son-in-law, 
Tracy and Robert Ross.
  Lady Coles has distinguished her family, church, and community with 
countless years of dedicated service, love, and leadership by example. 
She has enriched our community as charter member of the Epsilon Upsilon 
Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha since 1952, and continues her years 
of service as a member of Shiloh Baptist Church.
  Personally, I am grateful for her friendship, her stewardship, her 
mentorship, her leadership, and her dedication to not only New Jersey, 
but our global community.
  May God continue to bless Lady Coles on this milestone year, and we 
are forever grateful to Him, having sent her our way.
