     APPOINTMENT OF LARRY KUDLOW AND NOMINATION OF KEVIN McALEENAN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday the 
President named Larry Kudlow as the next head of the National Economic 
Council.
  Larry is well known as a happy warrior for pro-growth economics and 
widely respected for his expertise in fiscal policy. The country will 
be lucky to have Larry serving in this role. I look forward to 
continued engagement with the White House team that will now benefit 
from his insight.
  Speaking of highly qualified personnel, here in the Senate yesterday 
afternoon, we voted to advance Kevin McAleenan's nomination to serve as 
Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This is an 
essential post, and Mr. McAleenan is an excellent nominee.
  I urge everyone to join me in voting for his confirmation when we 
return on Monday.
