                    NORTH KOREA IS A TERRORISM STATE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when I met with Admiral Harris of 
Pacific Command last year, I asked him which nation's threats concerned 
him the most. He quickly replied: North Korea.
  Proving Admiral Harris correct, North Korea illegally launched yet 
another menacing ballistic missile. This was a high-tech, pre-fueled 
rocket that can be launched quickly. This type of rocket has a range of 
about 1,800 miles--thus, making it an immediate threat to South Korea 
and Japan as well as our troops that are stationed there.
  North Korea has even bigger plans. Kim Jong-un reportedly plans to 
develop submarines from which to launch the missiles, which could 
threaten the United States. The last administration pursued an ignorant 
strategy called strategic patience. That policy clearly failed. North 
Korea's program is now stronger than ever. Kim Jong-un's threats 
continue to grow bolder and bolder with no repercussions.
  Once upon a time, the United States had North Korea on the State 
Sponsors of Terrorism list. It is time to put little Kim back on that 
list because he is a world terrorist and a threat to world peace, and 
he has earned that distinction.
  And that is just the way it is.
