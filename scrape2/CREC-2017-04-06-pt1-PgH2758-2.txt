      APPOINT A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS

  (Ms. VELAZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, another week in Washington and, yet, more 
evidence mounts; our election and the White House have been compromised 
by Russia.
  This week we learned one of the President's informal advisers--a 
mercenary who founded the company Blackwater--met secretly with a Putin 
representative and attempted to establish back-channel conversations 
between the Trump administration and Russia.
  Remember, this comes after we found out the President's son-in-law 
met with Russian banking officials. It comes after it was reported that 
the Attorney General likely perjured himself before Congress about his 
own meeting with Russians.
  Sadly, it comes after there were chemical weapons attacks in Syria. 
Let us recall that Assad's closest ally in that horrific civil war has 
been--you guessed it--Russia.
  It is imperative we unearth all of the links between this 
administration, Russia, and Russia's hacking of our election. The House 
Intelligence Committee's investigation has become a farce. We need a 
thorough, independent investigation. Appoint a special counsel now.
