                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Immortal and Invisible God, You continue to be our shelter in the 
time of storms. Thank You for being our Nation's protection.
  Give our Senators the wisdom to place their confidence in You, 
instead of in national power and prestige. Lord, inspire our lawmakers 
with Your presence. Dispel all fear. May they remember that in the most 
turbulent and unpredictable of times, You are still in charge of our 
Nation and world.
  Give each of our citizens the ability to know and do Your will. Lord, 
be in our midst so that we will experience peace even in the midst of a 
storm.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
