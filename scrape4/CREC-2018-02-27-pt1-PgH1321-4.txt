         IN RECOGNITION OF ALAN WILLIAMSON OF GREENE, NEW YORK

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alan Williamson 
from Greene, New York, in New York's 22nd District.
  Alan Williamson is a true craftsman who keeps history and tradition 
alive through his business ventures in Greene. Each of his businesses 
is inspired by trades that are slowly becoming a lost art in our 
country.
  Alan runs an antique sawmill, a shingle machine, a shoelace business, 
a rope-making business, and a broom-making business.
  Alan recently created a one-of-a-kind broom for President Trump. It 
is alternating red and white, with stars wrapped up the handle. The 
``Presidential Broom'' is fitted perfectly inside a wooden and glass 
case that Alan also crafted.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish Alan the best of luck and hope that his 
beautiful, patriotic, and handcrafted broom makes it to the White 
House.
