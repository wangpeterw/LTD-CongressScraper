                       NATIONAL PET ADOPTION DAY

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about H. Res. 133, a 
bill I introduced with my friend and Texas colleague, Congressman Marc 
Veasey.
  This resolution expresses support for the designation of April 11 as 
National Pet Adoption Day and the month of April as National Pet 
Adoption Month. Simply, we are aiming to highlight the importance of 
pet adoption.
  Mr. Speaker, each year, 2.7 million adoptable dogs and cats are 
euthanized in the United States. As a rancher and lifelong animal 
lover, this is heartbreaking.
  The Humane Society of the United States, ASPCA, Animal Welfare 
Institute, and local shelters such as PAWS Shelter of Central Texas 
have endorsed this resolution.
  Mr. Speaker, we request that the President issue a proclamation 
calling upon the people of the United States to observe April 11 as 
National Pet Adoption Day and the month of April as National Pet 
Adoption Month.
  More than 60 Members of Congress have signed on to our bipartisan 
resolution, and I encourage others to do so. For those who may be 
watching this back home, call your Representative in Washington and 
have them support this bill.
  In God We Trust.
