                   TRIBUTE TO ROBERT ``BOB'' G. SMITH

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and 
honor Robert ``Bob'' G. Smith, CEO of Goodwill Industries of Lower 
South Carolina--GWILSC--for 35 years of serving our great State.
  Bob's dedication and passion has been a true testament to GWILSC's 
mission to ``helping people reach their full potential through the 
dignity and power of work.'' He has inspired and instilled confidence 
by promoting essential job training programs that have encouraged 
individuals to meet their goals.
  His service has touched many people all over the South Carolina 
community, and his initiative to orchestrate a collaborative 
environment has helped to expand services that has transformed lives.
  For more than three decades, Bob has worked tirelessly to serve 
others, and his contributions will continue to live on in the 
generations of South Carolinians he has been able to positively impact, 
and we are grateful for everything Bob has done to assist our 
communities. Therefore, I would like to recognize Robert ``Bob'' G. 
Smith for epitomizing the very best of the Palmetto State.
