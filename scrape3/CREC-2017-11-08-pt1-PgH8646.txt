                 AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A BETTER DEAL

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, they are at it again. Corporate lobbyists 
and billionaires are spending whatever it takes to get their way in 
this town and avoid paying their fair share in taxes. Meanwhile, 
working people who play by the rules are getting crushed by healthcare 
costs, childcare expenses, housing payments, and student loan debt.
  What is the Republican solution for this problem?
  A $1.5 trillion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires, and a tax 
increase for tens of millions of hardworking families.
  This bill is a scam. Republicans are throwing a wealthy five-star 
banquet for the wealthy and well connected, and saving a few crumbs 
that fall from the table for the hardworking middle class.
  Democrats know that American people deserve a better deal. That is 
why we are fighting to build an economy that ensures better jobs, 
better wages, and a better future; create 10 million new full-time, 
good-paying jobs; invest in rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, 
and schools; lower costs for everything from prescription drugs to 
childcare; and break up corporate monopolies that are raising costs and 
reducing choices for working families.
  Republicans might be fine with the status quo that benefits the 
wealthy and powerful special interests. We know the American people 
deserve better--better jobs, better wages--for a better future.
