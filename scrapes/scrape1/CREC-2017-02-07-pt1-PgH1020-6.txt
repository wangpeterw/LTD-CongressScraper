                   CELEBRATING SOUTH FLORIDA MENTORS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the organizations 
that work every day to make a positive impact in the lives of south 
Florida's youth.
  By changing the world one woman at a time, the group, Women of 
Tomorrow, has transformed the lives of more than 11,000 at-risk girls 
by matching them with a highly accomplished professional woman and 
providing them with scholarship opportunities.
  Another great organization, Mr. Speaker, is Take Stock in Children. 
It has given low-income students, most of whom come from minority 
families, a chance to improve their lives through college preparation 
programs, through scholarships, and by partnering with them with caring 
mentors.
  Studies show that children with mentors achieve more educational 
success, have higher personal aspirations, and are more confident.
  I would like to encourage everyone in south Florida to become a 
mentor and, thereby, make our community a better and safer place for 
our vulnerable youth.
