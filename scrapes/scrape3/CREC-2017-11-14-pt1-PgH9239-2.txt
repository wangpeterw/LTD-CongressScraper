                  SELL A TAX REFORM DREAM TO AMERICANS

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, each day the President and 
congressional Republicans are trying to sell the American people a 
dream that will not become a reality.
  In addition to running up the deficit, lining the pockets of the very 
wealthy, and eliminating critical deductions that New Jerseyans rely 
on, this tax scheme dismantles the ladder of opportunity that allows 
Americans to grow and thrive.
  Eliminating the medical expense deduction will devastate households 
nationwide struggling to recover from high healthcare costs. Removing 
the student loan interest deduction will cost recent college graduates 
hundreds of dollars a year, significant to young Americans trying to 
get on their feet.
  Our tax system works best when it is fair, responsible, and 
supportive of the true drivers of our economy: families, workers, and 
small businesses.
  I refuse to let congressional Republicans try to sell America a dream 
that never will be reality, and definitely not on the backs of the most 
vulnerable.
