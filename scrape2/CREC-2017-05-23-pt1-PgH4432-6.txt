       WE MUST RESPOND TO THE GLOBAL CRISIS OF HUNGER AND FAMINE

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, 20 million people in South Sudan, Somalia, 
Yemen, and Nigeria are on the brink of famine. We saw this coming. The 
warning signs were there long before January of this year.
  I am so proud that Republicans and Democrats joined together to 
include an additional $1 billion in the FY 2017 omnibus bill to address 
these famines.
  Our citizens and our farmers have always been generous in times of 
such grave need. They know that we have to protect children from hunger 
and the

violence of war. They know that we need to support diplomacy and 
development to avoid future catastrophes.
  Our united effort must continue in FY 2018, but the President's 
budget eliminates the Food for Peace and the McGovern-Dole programs, 
and reduces funding for disaster assistance. I only hope President 
Trump and Secretary Tillerson will come to their senses. We must not 
stand by and watch millions of children and families literally starve 
to death. We must act, and we must lead.
