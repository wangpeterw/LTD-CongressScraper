                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We thank You once again that we can come before You and ask guidance 
for the men and women of this assembly. Send Your spirit of peace, 
honesty, and fairness during this week of constituent visits.
  Bless the people of this great Nation with wisdom, knowledge, and 
understanding, that they might responsibly participate in our American 
democracy.
  Please keep all who work for the people's House in good health. We 
thank You for their generosity and the tremendous jobs so many did this 
past weekend so millions of Americans could enjoy a wonderful Capital 
concert celebrating Memorial Day.
  Bless us this day, and every day, and may all that is done be for 
Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
