                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, from whom comes all holy desires, we thank You for all 
those who give their lives to serve You and country. May they realize 
that they are doing Your work on Earth when they strive faithfully to 
follow Your precepts.
  Use our lawmakers to bring comfort, renewal, and empowerment to our 
Nation and world. Take them along yet untrodden paths, through perils 
unknown, to Your desired destination. May they live in peace and 
contentment, resting in the knowledge that You are directing their 
steps.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
