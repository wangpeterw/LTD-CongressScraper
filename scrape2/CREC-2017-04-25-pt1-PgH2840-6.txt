                         AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Autism 
Awareness Month.
  It is shocking to know that at least 1 in 68 children have been 
identified with autism spectrum disorder in the United States. My own 
family has been affected by this situation with my nephew Joshua, who 
is now 20 years old, a bright and energetic young man who is autistic.
  Mr. Speaker, early detection and treatment plans are crucial to the 
development of a child's social, behavioral, and communications skills. 
As such, we must invest in the research of new interventions, provide 
support to families and caregivers, and fund programs that assist those 
living with autism well into adulthood. Right now,

especially when they age into adulthood, those resources are not there.
  Mr. Speaker, Sesame Street recently introduced a character with 
autism named Julia to teach audiences about inclusion. This month is 
part of a larger conversation about autism derived from a place of 
positivity.
  I am hopeful that Julia can help convey such a message to our youth, 
and I will continue supporting programs that help people with autism 
and their families by providing the tools they need to succeed.
