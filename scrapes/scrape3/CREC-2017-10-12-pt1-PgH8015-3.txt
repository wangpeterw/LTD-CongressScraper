              PROUD OF VIRGINIA'S ASSISTANCE TO DISASTERS

  (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, Congress approved the second 
tranche of emergency funding for those affected by Hurricanes Harvey, 
Irma, Maria, and the wildfires in the Western United States.
  I would like to take a second and shine a light on Virginians who 
have stepped forward to help our fellow Americans impacted by these 
natural disasters.
  Just the other day, I pulled up to a restaurant in Virginia Beach, 
where there was a steady line of vehicles coming in the parking lot to 
drop off goods and essential items. Hundreds came together to give 
money and items for the people of Puerto Rico.
  From Hampton Roads to Richmond, to Roanoke, Virginia rose to the 
occasion. We had soldiers and sailors and coastguardsmen and civilians 
deploy forward to help in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin 
Islands. We had National Guardsmen, Spanish speakers, FEMA workers, EMS 
units, helicopters, drones, boats, and medical supplies, and much more.
  We should all be very proud of Virginia's vast efforts, their 
leadership, and their compassion. Virginia has never been afraid to 
lead.
