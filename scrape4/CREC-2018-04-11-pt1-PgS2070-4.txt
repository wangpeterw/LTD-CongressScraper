          200TH ANNIVERSARY OF STANDING SPRINGS BAPTIST CHURCH

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and 
honor Standing Springs Baptist Church in Simpsonville, SC, for their 
200th anniversary, which will be celebrated on October 18, 2018. As 
Standing Springs celebrates their bicentennial throughout the week and 
weekend, I thank them for their ongoing mission of service and 
fellowship that I hope will continue for 200 more years to come. I 
acknowledge and celebrate the church's 200 years as a congregation 
faithfully serving the people of Simpsonville and Greenville 
County.
