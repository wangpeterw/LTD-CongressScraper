                          HONORING PAUL BOOTH

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
mourn the loss of a precious friend and mentor, Paul Booth.
  Paul was a lifelong happy warrior for justice and a renowned 
progressive champion. For decades, he was a top leader in his union, 
AFSCME, fighting every day for working women and men.
  From his youth as a student leader until the very day he died, he 
fought for peace and equality and opportunity. Paul Booth made things 
happen. He was a strategist and, above all, an organizer. With his life 
partner, Heather Booth, Paul inspired and taught us to work smarter and 
be better.
  Paul Booth will be sorely missed by all those he touched, including 
my husband, Bob, and me. We were cherished friends for decades.
  Our hearts go out to Heather and his sons, Gene and Dan, and all 
those whose lives he inspired and that he touched. We are so sorry. We 
are heartbroken.
