                          REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Trump White House and the 
U.S. Treasury Secretary continue to issue formal reports about the 
Republican corporate tax cut plan. These reports are devoid of fact or 
credibility and have been categorically rejected by each and every 
respectable tax expert.
  These tax cuts will pay for themselves and fuel $2 trillion in 
economic growth over the next decade.
  Not true. Tax cuts have never come close to paying for themselves, 
not once or ever in human history.
  Corporate tax cuts will trickle down to increase annual household 
income in America by between $4,000 and $9,000.
  No one believes this or them. For the White House Council of Economic 
Advisers to say this is official misconduct and a blatant fraud 
perpetrated against middle America.
  Mr. Speaker, this big, corporate tax cut is a massive giveaway to 
corporate America and a major takeaway from middle America.
