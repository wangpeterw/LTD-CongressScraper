                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21, 2018

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m., 
Wednesday, March 21; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the 
morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved 
to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later 
in the day, and morning business be closed. Finally, I ask that 
following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to the consideration of 
H.R. 1865, as under the previous order.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
