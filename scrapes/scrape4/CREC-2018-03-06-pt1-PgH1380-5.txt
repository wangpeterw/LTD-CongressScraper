                            GREAT LAKES WEEK

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this week is Great Lakes Week.
  As a Michigander, I am proud of the fact that Republicans and 
Democrats in Congress continue to work together to highlight the 
importance of our shared water resources and to protect the Great 
Lakes.
  The Great Lakes generate billions of dollars in economic activity and 
provide drinking water to 40 million people. We have to do everything 
we can to protect them from harm.
  Unfortunately, President Trump recently unveiled his proposed budget, 
which cuts funding to the Great Lakes by 90 percent. An important 
restoration initiative that has succeeded and has had bipartisan 
support, the President nearly eliminates.
  Protecting our Great Lakes has never been a partisan issue. Democrats 
and Republicans have come together before to restore funding cuts that 
were proposed by President Trump. I am confident that we will come 
together again.
  This Great Lakes Week, as every week, I stand up for the Great Lakes 
and those who depend upon them. They are a critical water resource that 
must be protected.
