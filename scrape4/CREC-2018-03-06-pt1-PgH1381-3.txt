                  FLORIDA HOUSE PASSES GUN SAFETY BILL

  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, Marco Rubio's Florida State Senate got 
shocked enough by the Parkland shooting to pass a token gun safety 
bill. The Florida House has yet to act. Whatever Florida does, Rubio's 
token gun bill in Washington is belied by his pending bill to eliminate 
virtually all of the District of Columbia's gun safety laws. Worse, 
Rubio has put his D.C. bill in the Congress to raise his NRA rating for 
the last two Congresses. It did raise his NRA rating from B plus to A.
  I have managed to save D.C.'s gun safety laws, but Rubio's shamefully 
token responses in the Senate to the Parkland tragedy will be seen as 
one more act of hypocrisy until he stops meddling in the District of 
Columbia's affairs and withdraws his D.C. gun bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gianforte). Members are reminded to 
refrain from engaging in personalities toward Members of the Senate.
