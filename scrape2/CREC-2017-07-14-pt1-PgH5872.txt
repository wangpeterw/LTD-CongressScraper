       HONORING THE LIFE OF NEW YORK STATE TROOPER JOEL R. DAVIS

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of New York 
State Trooper Joel R. Davis.
  Trooper Davis was tragically killed in the line of duty on July 9, 
while responding to a domestic disturbance call in the town of Theresa, 
in upstate New York. Another victim was also tragically killed in this 
terrible accident.
  Trooper Davis was a father, son, husband, and a friend to many. He 
was deeply involved in his community, and also served as the 
commissioner of a local youth league baseball team. Trooper Davis was 
well-respected by all those who worked with him and beloved by 
everyone.
  As New Yorkers, we stand in solidarity to mourn the life of Trooper 
Davis, a dedicated public servant and a life that was too soon lost. At 
this heartbreaking time, we offer our condolences to his family, 
community, and colleagues alike.
  It is at times like these that we come together and pause to extend 
our gratitude in all law enforcement in our State and across the Nation 
who risk their lives every day to protect us and to keep us safe.
  We are grateful for their dedication, service, and bravery of 
outstanding members like Trooper Joel Davis, who will rest in peace.
