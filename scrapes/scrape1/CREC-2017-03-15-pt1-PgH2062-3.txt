        CELEBRATING ADMIRAL LLOYD ``JOE'' VASEY'S 100TH BIRTHDAY

  (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to send my warmest aloha to 
Admiral Lloyd ``Joe'' Vasey on his belated 100th birthday celebration 
tonight in Honolulu.
  After graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1939, 
Admiral Vasey joined the submarine service and served under John S. 
McCain, Jr., father of United States Senator John McCain.
  After the war and a long and distinguished service to our Nation, 
Admiral Vasey formed the CSIS Pacific Forum, with the goal of promoting 
peace in Asia Pacific. He is why we call the men and women of his time 
the Greatest Generation.
  I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the admiral by 
working to help make his dream of a Pacific War Memorial at Pearl 
Harbor a reality.
  In his words: ``There is no recognition for well over 150,000 brave 
Americans who were lost in the Pacific War. We need to honor them, and 
their families need a place to mourn.''
  Admiral Vasey's patriotism, devotion to duty, and desire for peace 
should be an example for us all.
  Happy birthday, Admiral Vasey, and may you continue to have fair 
winds and following seas.

                          ____________________
