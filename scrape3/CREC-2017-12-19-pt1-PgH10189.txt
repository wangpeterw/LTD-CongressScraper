                    SALUTING THE NAVY'S NEWEST SHIP

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute the U.S. Navy's newest 
vessel, the USS Little Rock, and her brave crew.
  Commissioned this past Saturday, the new USS Little Rock was built in 
Wisconsin and is a littoral combat ship that will operate in waters 
close to shore.
  The vessel carries with it the namesake of Arkansas' State capital 
and the proud history of the former USS Little Rock.
  Today, it is also fitting to honor the former USS Little Rock. 
Completed in World War II, she was one of six vessels to be converted 
to a guided missile cruiser. She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be 
named for Little Rock, Arkansas.
  The only World War II cruiser on display in the United States, the 
former USS Little Rock is the sole survivor of the Cleveland class.
  The USS Little Rock served with distinction as a flagship for both 
the second and the sixth fleets.
  I thank all of those who served on the former USS Little Rock. I wish 
the new USS Little Rock the best as she carries out our Nation's 
critical maritime strategy and protects our interests across the globe.
