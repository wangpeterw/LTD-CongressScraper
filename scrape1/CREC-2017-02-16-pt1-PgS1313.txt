  SENATE RESOLUTION 63--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF THE 
WEEK OF OCTOBER 29 THROUGH NOVEMBER 4, 2017, AS ``NATIONAL OBESITY CARE 
                                 WEEK''

  Mr. CARPER (for himself and Mrs. Capito) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions:

                               S. Res. 63

       Whereas the disease of obesity is a major source of concern 
     across the United States, and more than one-third of adults 
     in the United States are affected by obesity, with the number 
     of people with severe obesity in the United States continuing 
     to grow;
       Whereas experts and researchers agree that obesity is a 
     complex disease influenced by various physiological, 
     environmental, and genetic factors;
       Whereas, while prevention programs have successfully 
     established the seriousness of the public health crisis posed 
     by obesity, it is also imperative that individuals and 
     families currently affected by obesity receive comprehensive 
     care and treatment;
       Whereas studies show that bias against and stigma 
     associated with people affected by obesity among general 
     society and healthcare professionals are significant barriers 
     to effectively treating the disease;
       Whereas healthcare professionals, policymakers, patients, 
     and families should regard obesity with the same level of 
     seriousness with which other chronic diseases are regarded;
       Whereas research suggests that weight loss of as little as 
     5 to 10 percent of the total weight of an individual affected 
     by obesity can improve the associated health risks affecting 
     many patients living with obesity and can thereby support the 
     goals of Federal and State initiatives to reduce chronic 
     disease, improve health outcomes, and help control healthcare 
     costs;
       Whereas healthcare professionals should treat patients with 
     respect and compassion and should partner with patients to 
     develop comprehensive and individualized approaches to weight 
     loss and weight management that consider all appropriate 
     treatment options, such as reduced-calorie diets, physical 
     activity modifications, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric 
     surgery;
       Whereas it will take a long-term collaborative effort, 
     which will involve individual, corporate, and institutional 
     partners in all fields taking active roles, to ignite the 
     betterment of obesity care and treatment; and
       Whereas the week of October 29 through November 4, 2017, 
     would be an appropriate week to designate as ``National 
     Obesity Care Week'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of ``National Obesity Care 
     Week''; and
       (2) encourages all people in the United States to create a 
     foundation of open communication to break barriers of 
     misunderstanding and stigma regarding obesity and to improve 
     the lives of all individuals affected by obesity and their 
     families.
