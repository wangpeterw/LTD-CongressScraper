                        FORT JACKSON CENTENNIAL

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this month marks the Fort 
Jackson Centennial, a celebration of 100 years of military service and 
opportunity at that extraordinary post.
  As the largest initial entry training facility for the Army, Fort 
Jackson has been a leader in training in military readiness. Indeed, 
Fort Jackson recently achieved a remarkable milestone, having trained 
an estimated five million soldiers.
  I know firsthand of the dedication and capability of Fort Jackson. As 
a member of the Army Reserve and the South Carolina Army National Guard 
and a graduate of the Adjutant General School, I trained at Fort 
Jackson. Additionally, three of my four sons have served in the South 
Carolina National Guard, receiving world class training at Fort 
Jackson.
  I have also seen how Fort Jackson supports the Midlands community, 
promoting civilian and military jobs, providing strong leaders and 
volunteers for our community, drawing millions of visitors. This is why 
the Midlands has worked hard to become the most military-friendly 
community in America.
  Congratulations to General Pete Johnson for a strong command at Fort 
Jackson. I look forward to continued success for American families. 
Victory starts here.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may we never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
