            CONGRESS MUST FIX OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Congress must act to fix our broken 
immigration system, including passing legislation to protect DREAMers.
  Like many Members of this body, I was deeply disappointed with the 
President's decision regarding DACA, to take away the promise of 
possibility that DACA provided young people who were brought to this 
country as children--many of them just months old--by their parents and 
have grown up here. They work here. They go to school here. They 
contribute to the quality, to the greatness of this country.
  The one thing I did believe is right that the President said was that 
Congress ought to act. I have sat here and watched us name post 
offices, bring back legislation that we have passed in previous 
Congresses on suspension and brought them to the floor and debated them 
for hours. We have time in this House to stand up for 800,000 young 
people and give them hope that they deserve, to show that this country 
is as great as we say it is.
  When the Speaker was elected, he said he would open up the process. 
Here is my challenge: Bring the Dream Act to the floor of the House of 
Representatives. If you believe these DREAMers should be deported, then 
vote ``no,'' but give them a vote on the floor of this House. That is 
the moral thing to do, and we should do it now.
