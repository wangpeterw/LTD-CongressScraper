                  THIS STATE DEPARTMENT BETRAYS ISRAEL

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the anti-Semitic United Nations has 
struck a new low, demanding thatIsrael prohibit Jews from settling in 
the West Bank. Guess who was supportive of this absurd resolution in 
betrayal of ourclosest ally? The United States.
  Once again, this administration is on the wrong side. It has 
alienated what fewinternational friends we have. Secretary of State 
John Kerry arrogantly declared: ``Israel can either be Jewish or 
democratic;it cannot be both.''
  Mr. Speaker, let's think about that statement. The United Nations' 
mandate separating Jews fromPalestinians in the West Bank is 
segregation. Segregation is not democratic.
  The United States and the U.N. have no legalbusiness telling a 
sovereign nation where people should live or shouldn't live in that 
country. Who in the world do we think weare? Would we approve of the 
U.N. telling us that one race or ethnic group could not live in one 
region of the United States?Absolutely not.
  Thankfully, this State Department will soon be clearing their desks 
at Foggy Bottom--and good riddance. It istime for a new State 
Department that supports America's friends and not our enemies.
  And that is just the way it is.
