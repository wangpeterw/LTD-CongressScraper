                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women of 
law enforcement who put their lives on the line day and night 
protecting our communities, like my nephew Ethan Meehan.
  As we close this year's Police Week, I would like to pay particular 
tribute to the law enforcement personnel who have been killed or 
wounded in the line of duty, like Officer Christopher Dorman of 
Folcroft, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, who was shot and wounded last 
June but bravely back on the job just weeks later.
  Sadly, four of Pennsylvania's finest lost their lives in the line of 
duty last year:
  Pennsylvania State Trooper Eugene Weaver;
  Canonsburg Patrolman Scott Bashioum;
  Pennsylvania Corrections Officer David Weaver; and
  Luzerne County Corrections Officer Kristopher Moules.
  We thank them for their service, and we are indebted for their 
sacrifice. We honor their memories, and our thoughts and prayers are 
with their families.
