                          INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, this year, the American Society of 
Civil Engineers once again gave America's infrastructure a D-plus 
rating.
  During Infrastructure Week, I must highlight the need for action and 
investment in our Nation's infrastructure. Our roads, bridges, and 
waterways are neither Republican nor Democrat; they belong to all of 
us.
  From the New Deal to the Federal interstate highways, infrastructure 
projects have traditionally enjoyed broad bipartisan support and 
leadership. Improving and maintaining our 21st century transportation 
system creates access and opportunities for all, allowing for job 
creation, economic growth, and fostering innovation.
  As we continue to wait for the President to put forth a plan and true 
efforts toward investment in our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, we 
bear witness to hundreds of millions of dollars in lost economic 
productivity and a threat to the safety and security of our Nation.
  It is time to build. It is time to invest in America.
