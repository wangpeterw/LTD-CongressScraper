                 UNIVERSAL COVERAGE NOT UNIVERSAL CHAOS

  (Mr. LARSEN of Washington asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
opposition to the American Health Care Act.
  Over the past several weeks, I have held six townhalls where I have 
discussed health care with more than 800 of my constituents. Thousands 
more have called or contacted my office.
  Erica, from my hometown of Arlington, told me that, thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act, her family can now keep their house and pay their 
mortgage.
  Nancy from Bellingham told me she works with families who rely on 
Medicaid to avoid bankruptcy due to extra medical costs that come with 
caring for babies with disabilities.
  So many Washingtonians support the Affordable Care Act and benefit 
from it. And of my constituents who oppose the Affordable Care Act, 
none of them have asked me to support legislation that would cover 
fewer people. None of my constituents have asked Congress to make poor 
people pay more for insurance. And not one of my constituents have 
asked Congress to give the rich a massive tax break, but that is

what the American Health Care Act will do.
  This bill, Mr. Speaker, will hurt people--women, seniors, individuals 
with disabilities, and middle class families. It will result in 
universal chaos, not universal coverage.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this measure.
