   RESPECT TO THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION--PM 21

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days before the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice, 
stating that the national emergency with respect to the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction that was declared in Executive Order 
12938 of November 14, 1994, is to continue in effect beyond November 
14, 2017.
                                                     Donald J. Trump.  
The White House, November 6, 2017.
