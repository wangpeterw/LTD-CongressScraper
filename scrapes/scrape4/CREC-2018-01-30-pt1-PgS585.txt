SENATE RESOLUTION 388--RECOGNIZING JANUARY 27, 2018, AS THE ANNIVERSARY 
   OF THE FIRST REFUGEE AND MUSLIM BAN, AND URGING THE PRESIDENT TO 
          DEMONSTRATE TRUE LEADERSHIP ON REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT

  Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mr. Booker, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Hirono, 
Mr. Durbin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Brown, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. 
Schatz, and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following resolution; which was 
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 388

       Whereas the world is in the midst of the worst global 
     displacement crisis in history, with more than 22,500,000 
     refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations High 
     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates;
       Whereas, in fiscal year 2017, UNHCR projected that more 
     than 1,200,000 refugees were in need of resettlement to a 
     third country, and this projection continues to grow in 2018;
       Whereas the United States resettlement program is a life-
     saving solution critical to global humanitarian efforts, 
     which serves to strengthen global security, leverage United 
     States foreign policy goals, and support regional host 
     countries while serving individuals and families in need;
       Whereas, for over 40 years, the United States has resettled 
     up to 200,000 refugees per year, with an average ceiling of 
     95,000 refugees per year, and on average actually resettled 
     80,000 refugees per year;
       Whereas refugees are the most vetted travelers to enter the 
     United States and are subject to extensive screening checks, 
     including in person interviews, biometric data checks, and 
     multiple interagency checks;
       Whereas, it would be an abdication of United States 
     leadership to resettle fewer than 75,000 refugees next fiscal 
     year;
       Whereas the United States refugee resettlement system 
     emphasizes early self-sufficiency through employment, and 
     most adult refugees are employed within their first six 
     months of arriving to the United States;
       Whereas refugees contribute to their communities by 
     starting businesses, paying taxes, sharing their cultural 
     traditions, and being involved in their neighborhoods, and 
     reports have found that refugees contribute more than they 
     consume in state-funded services - including for schooling 
     and health care;
       Whereas, on January 27, 2017, President Donald J. Trump 
     released an executive order banning individuals from seven 
     Muslim-majority countries and all refugees from entering the 
     country;
       Whereas, since that time, the President has taken further 
     executive action to ban people from Muslim-majority countries 
     and has taken steps to dismantle the United States refugee 
     program;
       Whereas, in September 2017, President Trump announced a 
     Presidential Determination of 45,000 for fiscal year 2018, 
     the lowest refugee admissions ceiling ever set;
       Whereas, during the first three months of fiscal year 2018, 
     the United States welcomed a total of 5,323 refugees, in 
     spite of the fact that to meet the 45,000 ceiling, 11,250 
     individuals should have arrived during this time period;

       Whereas, at this pace, the United States may only admit 
     between 15,000-20,000 refugees this year; and
       Whereas, United States structures and funding constrictions 
     have resulted in lowered capacity and loss of institutional 
     memory and experience in the successful United States Refugee 
     Admissions Program: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) reaffirms our country's proud history of refugee 
     resettlement;
       (2) recognizes January 27, 2018, as the anniversary of the 
     first refugee and Muslim ban;
       (3) reaffirms the strong bipartisan commitment of the 
     United States to promote the safety, health, and well-being 
     of the millions of refugees;
       (4) underscores the importance of the United States Refugee 
     Resettlement Program as a critical tool for United States 
     global leadership;
       (5) recognizes the profound consequences faced by refugees 
     and their families who have been stranded, separated, and 
     scarred by current United States policies, leaving many mid-
     process and more with little hope of anticipated United 
     States entry; and
       (6) calls upon the United States Government--
       (A) to resettle 45,000 refugees in fiscal year 2018;
       (B) to resettle at least 75,000 refugees in fiscal year 
     2019;
       (C) to uphold its international leadership role in 
     responding to displacement crises with humanitarian 
     assistance and protection of the most vulnerable populations; 
     and
       (D) to recommit to offering freedom from oppression and 
     resettling the most vulnerable refugees regardless of their 
     country of origin or religious beliefs.
