           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this June marks the 50th anniversary of 
the reunification of Jerusalem. I am honored to have supported S. Res. 
176, which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the reunification of 
Jerusalem.
  This resolution reaffirms the Holy City of Jerusalem's central role 
for the Jewish people dating back many millennia. Since 1967, all 
people of all religious faiths are able to visit and worship at the 
holy sites of Jerusalem. I will always stand with Israel as it ensures 
that all individuals enjoy opportunities to visit and worship at 
Jerusalem's holy sites.
  The United States has stood with Israel for the past 50 years and 
will continue to do so. The intervening 50 years have included 
momentous changes in Israel and throughout the region, including peace 
treaties with Egypt and Jordan that stand to this day. These events 
give me hope for a future in which Israel and all of its neighbors 
together benefit from a comprehensive, warm peace.
