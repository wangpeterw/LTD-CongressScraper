                  CONGRATULATING WAYZATA CROSS COUNTRY

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I offer my congratulations to the Wayzata 
girls and boys cross country teams, who both won Minnesota State high 
school championships this season.
  The Wayzata girls' team was led by sophomore Emma Atkinson, who 
finished in third place overall at State. Three of their runners placed 
in the top 10, which helped them beat second-place Edina by 19 points. 
Dave Emmans, who was the 2014 Girls Cross Country Coach of the Year, 
did an outstanding job leading the Trojan girls' team.
  On the boys' side, Wayzata senior Khalid Hussein, led the boys' team 
to victory after coming in first place at State. Six of Wayzata's 
runners placed in the top 25. This was the Trojans' 10th State 
championship in 25 years, and Head Coach Mark Popp has now led the team 
to victory in two of the last three seasons coaching.
  Mr. Speaker, cross country takes an immense amount of dedication, 
passion, and endurance, and it was evident that these Wayzata teams 
have worked so hard.
  Congratulations to the runners, the coaches, and the families for 
their success this year of the Wayzata cross country boys and girls 
teams for becoming State champs.
