     formal training about eating disorders or the identification 
     and treatment of eating disorders;
       Whereas best practices for the treatment of an eating 
     disorder includes the involvement of the patient, the family

     such as social workers, mental health counselors, primary 
     care practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, dietitians, 
     and other specialty providers; and
       Whereas more research on eating disorders is needed to

     minds and bodies: Now, therefore, be it
