                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We ask Your special blessing upon the Members of this people's House. 
They face difficult decisions in difficult times, with many forces and 
interests demanding their attention. In these days, give them wisdom 
that they might execute their responsibilities to the benefit of all 
Americans.
  Give, as well, on this day, acknowledging religious freedom in our 
land, confidence to all people who are concerned about the issues most 
pressing in our Nation at this time.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
