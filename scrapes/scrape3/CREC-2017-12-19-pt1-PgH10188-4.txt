                 HONORING THE SERVICE OF THOMAS PERSEO

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a lifelong public servant, 
Mr. Thomas Perseo, who will be retiring on January 10, 2018, after 43 
years of faithful service to north-central Florida's community in law 
enforcement.
  Mr. Perseo began his career in Green Cove Springs, Florida, in the 
police department in September 1974. He served his hometown community 
until 1982, and then moved to Gainesville, Florida.
  Upon his move, Officer Perseo started working for the Alachua County 
Sheriff's Office. He is currently a warrant investigator, and, after 35 
years of dedicated law enforcement service with an exemplary record, 
Tom will be starting the next chapter of his life.
  Tom is a shining example of what it means to be an American. He has 
dedicated his life to serving our community, and I have no doubt he 
will continue to do so in retirement. I am proud to represent such a 
hardworking individual and also to have the honor of being his friend.
  For myself, and all of Florida's Third District, I wish him the very 
best in his well-deserved retirement.
