                  IN RECOGNITION OF WILEY WASDEN, JR.

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Wiley 
Anderson Wasden, Jr., from Savannah, Georgia, who passed away on 
January 18, 2017, just a few days shy of his 80th birthday.
  Born in Millen, Georgia, to his parents, Wiley Senior and Katherine, 
Mr. Wasden moved to Savannah after graduating from high school in 1953. 
He then began studies at the University of Georgia, where he joined the 
Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and ignited his interest in government. 
Throughout his life, Mr. Wasden continued this interest in government 
and used it to make the State of Georgia a better place to live, 
eventually serving as chairman of the Georgia State Republican Party 
and as a Georgia State senator. Outside of government, Mr. Wasden 
worked hard for his community. He was a well-respected local Realtor in 
Savannah while he also served as chairman of the board for Savannah 
Country Day School.
  I am proud today to recognize Mr. Wasden's outstanding life and the 
positive impact he made on the State of Georgia. He will certainly be 
missed.
