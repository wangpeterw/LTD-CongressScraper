                             FUNDING ISSUES

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, we passed a 
major omnibus appropriations bill, of which I had the privilege of 
submitting over 30 requests. Frankly, I am thankful for the funding I 
received on behalf of the 18th Congressional District of Texas. It is a 
tradition that I pride myself in. I also take pride in the work of the 
Appropriations Committee in working on behalf of the American people.
  It is also important to take note of the fact that--as we have done 
positive things, it is also important to note some issues that I have 
concern with.
  First of all, I want to acknowledge that there is no limit for the 
funding for Planned Parenthood, which is part of my constituency, which 
helps young women with their health. There is opioid funding and VA 
funding. I am most happy with the childcare funding and for TIGER 
grants.
  But what we need more of, even though we had 450,000 new certificates 
for the disabled, is Section 8 vouchers for seniors and families. We 
need to be able to insist that the quality of housing is best.
  As I finish, Mr. Speaker, let me just say that in the effort to stop 
school gun violence, I am disappointed that there are no civil rights 
protections to make sure we aren't pointing out Hispanics and Latinos 
differently from other children, as well as no DACA relief for our 
children.
