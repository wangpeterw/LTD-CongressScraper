                           REMEMBERING D-DAY

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of the 73rd 
anniversary of D-Day as well as to recognize the 75th anniversary of 
the Battle of
  Midway. These two conflicts were critical in changing the course of 
World War II.
  Seventy-three years ago today, the eyes of the world watched as 
Allied forces, under the leadership of General Dwight Eisenhower, 
stormed the beaches of Normandy. For 4 years, Europe was enslaved in 
tyranny by the Nazis. To liberate the people of Europe, these brave men 
parachuted into pitch-black fields and vaulted towering cliffs, all 
while undertaking heavy enemy fire.
  Two years prior to the D-Day landings and 6 months after the attack 
on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. emerged victorious in one of the most 
significant and decisive battles in naval history, known as the Battle 
of Midway. The U.S., under the command of Admiral Nimitz, was able to 
ambush and destroy four Japanese aircraft carriers. Thanks to the 
heroic bomber pilots and crews of the U.S. Navy, this battle changed 
the tide in the Pacific theater.
  The United States and the world are eternally grateful for the 
heroism and

sacrifices that our servicemen and -women displayed over 70 years ago 
today in an uncertain war.
