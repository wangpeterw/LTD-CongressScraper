                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, in whose hand lies the destiny of people and nations, 
empower our lawmakers to do Your will on Earth even as it is done in 
Heaven. Make their lives reflect gratitude for Your merciful kindness 
and loving providence. Lord, break the bonds of any excessive self-
sufficiency by showing them what they can accomplish with Your 
supernatural strength. Help them to be blessings and not burdens as 
they live a life with the gifts of enthusiasm and expectancy. As they 
live at full potential according to Your expectations, use them to 
glorify Your Name on the Earth.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
