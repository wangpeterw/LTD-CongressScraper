              CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DR. ABRAHAM FISCHLER

  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
life of Dr. Abraham Fischler, president emeritus of Nova Southeastern 
University.
  Dr. Fischler was one of south Florida's education pioneers and served 
as NSU's second president for 22 years, as well as a member of the 
Broward County School Board.
  Dr. Fischler was an inspiration to all those who knew him, myself 
included. He served as NSU president when I was a member of the staff, 
often providing wise counsel and guidance.
  He understood that in order to invest in our students, we need to 
invest in our teachers. He was truly an educator's educator. There are 
more than 10,000 students currently enrolled in the Abraham S. Fischler 
College of Education.
  He has shaped countless lives and will always be remembered for his 
determination to ensure our students succeed. Thanks to Dr. Fischler, 
our young adults face their future prepared and ready to take on all 
that life has to offer.
  My thoughts are not only with his wife, Shirley, and the entire 
Fischler family, but with the students, faculty, and staff.
