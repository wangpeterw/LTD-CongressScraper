                           MEDICAID EXPANSION

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I have a new name for the process 
Republicans are using to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Instead of 
repeal and replace, how about we name it ``we cut and gut''? Cut taxes 
for millionaires and billionaires, and gut coverage for hardworking 
Americans.
  The bill would also undermine the Medicaid expansion in the 
Affordable Care Act. In Nevada, our own Governor Brian Sandoval, a 
Republican, made the decision to work with Democrats and expand the 
Medicaid program. Because we expanded Medicaid, 320,000 Nevadans now 
have health coverage, and Nevada's uninsured rate has dropped from 23 
percent to 12 percent, one of the largest declines in the entire 
country.
  So, Mr. Speaker, I would ask my Republican colleagues: Do you really 
want to turn your backs on hardworking families just to give 
billionaires a tax cut that they don't need or deserve?
  Mr. Speaker, the silence is deafening.
