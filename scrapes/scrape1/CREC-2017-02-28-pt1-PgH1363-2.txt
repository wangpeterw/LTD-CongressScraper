                     ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, health care is important to 
every family in America. The Affordable Care Act increased access to 
health care for about 20 million Americans.
  Is the Affordable Care Act perfect?
  No bill that has ever been debated on this floor and passed is 
perfect.
  Let's make our goal not to have anyone who received access to health 
care to lose it. We need to make it better and to guarantee access to 
quality health care for all Americans. America can do better.
