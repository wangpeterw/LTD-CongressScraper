                  BENEFITS OF NATIONAL DEFENSE FUNDING

  (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support for the National 
Defense Authorization Act.
  The United States of America is the greatest force for freedom, 
peace, and prosperity. We are the greatest because we have built a 
military that has the best equipped, the best trained, and the best led 
fighting force the world has ever known.
  Mr. Speaker, we all have a moral responsibility to every 
servicemember who puts their life on the line for America. That 
responsibility is to give them superior equipment, sound strategy that 
doesn't put them in unnecessary danger, and care for their families 
while they are away. This bill gives our troops a sorely-needed pay 
raise, and helps to rebuild our military, thus fulfilling our promise.
  In the words of George Washington: ``To be prepared for war is the 
most effectual means of preserving peace.''
  I am proud of this bill, and I am thankful for my amendment to be 
included in it, that expands veteran opportunities to get credentialed. 
It allows servicemembers to use the skills they developed in the 
military to be more competitive in the workforce. It allows them to get 
credentialed for in-demand professions that are valued by our civilian 
employers.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this bill, and I am thankful for all those 
who worked on it.
