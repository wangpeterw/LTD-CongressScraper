                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Strengthen the constitutional commitments of the Members of this 
people's House as they return to the Capitol today. Guide and sustain 
them in Your wisdom and inspire all, especially those in leadership, 
with the insights needed to assist our Nation at this time.
  During these warm days of summer, may the discourse on the floor and 
in committees be noted more for light than heat, that the important 
work to be done might redound to the benefit of all Americans.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
