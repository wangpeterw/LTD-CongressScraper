               THE WOMEN'S MARCH WAS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, 7,000 in Rhode Island, over 500,000 in 
Washington, and millions across the country, the Women's March was 
democracy in action this past Saturday, and it filled me with hope, 
hope for a better future and hope that we can withstand whatever 
challenges lie ahead as a nation.
  The scene in Rhode Island was incredible, replicated around the 
world. I joined millions who gathered and marched to remind us that 
women's rights are human rights and to support inclusion and equality 
for all--immigrants, the LGBT community, people of color, people with 
disabilities, and people of differing faiths and backgrounds. This is 
the diversity that makes us stronger as a nation, and this is the 
diversity that President Trump must now represent in a way that is 
befitting of the honor and dignity of his office.
  Together, Mr. Speaker, we must hold him accountable to protect 
opportunity for all Americans, not just a select few, because it is by 
working together, treating people with dignity and respect that we move 
America forward. A rising tide lifts all boats, Mr. Speaker. I believe 
that the rising tide of engagement and passion that we saw on Saturday 
will lift all Americans.
