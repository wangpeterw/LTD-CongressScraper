              HONORING MARVIN KAHN, FLORIDA CITRUS GROWER

  (Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when you drive through 
Florida's heartland in Highlands County, you will probably see signs 
that say ``Kahn Groves,'' and then you will drive through miles of 
citrus groves.
  Marvin Kahn has been a passionate advocate for citrus over the last 
five decades, leading his management company from managing 400 acres to 
over 5,500 acres at its peak.
  Mr. Kahn is one of the State's most innovative growers, caretakers, 
and marketers. He served on the Florida Citrus Commission for 8 years 
and worked on the long-range planning committee for several years after 
that. His devotion to Florida citrus and agriculture was real, and he 
did everything he could to share his passion with others, especially 
with young people.
  Each year, the Florida Citrus Hall of Fame honors the most 
distinguished leaders who have made significant contributions to the 
Florida citrus industry, and there is no one more deserving of a spot 
on that hall of fame than Mr. Marvin Kahn. When it comes to serving 
Florida's agriculture industry, his passion for Florida's citrus is 
unparalleled.
  Florida is a better place because of Mr. Kahn, and it has been an 
honor to serve him in the House of Representatives.
