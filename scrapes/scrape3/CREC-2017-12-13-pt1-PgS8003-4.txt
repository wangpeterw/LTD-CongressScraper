 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to MeKenna Carman for her hard 
work as an intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize her efforts 
and contributions to my office, as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  MeKenna is a native of Arizona. She is a student at Arizona State 
University, where she is studying political science. She has 
demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made her an invaluable 
asset to our office. The quality of her work is reflected in her great 
efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank MeKenna for the dedication she has shown while 
working for me and my staff. It was a pleasure to have her as part of 
our team. I know she will have continued success with all of her future 
endeavors. I wish her all my best on her next journey.
