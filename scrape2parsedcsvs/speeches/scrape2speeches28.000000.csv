After his latest failed attempt to roll back the ACA, Speaker Ryan declared to the American people ``ObamaCare is the law of the land.'' Less than 50 days later, Paul Ryan shamefully is going against his word trying to ram TrumpCare down our throats.  It is an embarrassment that we are wasting taxpayer dollars to again consider TrumpCare--or as I called it ``Trump don't care''--a reckless plan that does nothing to make health care better.  TrumpCare gives the rich and big corporations a $600 billion tax break. It forces families to pay higher premiums and deductions, placing health care out of their reach. TrumpCare forces seniors to pay higher costs and changes Medicare as we know it. It strips essential health benefits and protections for people with preexisting conditions.  What a pitiful display of partisan politics. TrumpCare is so bad, Republicans have exempted themselves from it.

2751,topic-id,244,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Polis) for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I wish to express my strong opposition to H.1180.  H.1180 encourages overwork by encouraging workers to spend more time at work in order to earn paid time off, which employers may or may not allow them to use in the future.  Many hardworking families throughout the 12th District of North Carolina need overtime pay just to make ends meet each month. They should not be compelled by their employer to accept comp time when their monthly budget depends on how much overtime they receive in their paycheck. Overtime pay can be the difference between paying for sending a child to college or going into debt. Parents who earn an hourly wage need overtime, not comp time, to care for their families.  Nothing in the Working Families Flexibility Act strengthens existing workplace protections or promotes workplace flexibility. That is why I offered an amendment last week when H.1180 was considered in committee to exempt comp time arrangements from mandatory arbitration agreements.  This amendment would have ensured protections for employees that H.1180 seek to take away. Unfortunately, the majority decided not to support my amendment or any other amendments offered by my fellow Democrats on the Education and the Workforce  Instead of today's bill, the House should consider legislation that would create good jobs with family sustaining wages and benefits. I strongly oppose H.1180, and I encourage by colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.  ",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3013-2.txt,2201,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,2.0,June

His military service during World War II and his commitment to supporting our veterans and the men and women in uniform throughout his life is an inspiration to us all.  At the age of 19, Mr.Bowling began his service as a United States marine and was a proud member of the Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th During the United States campaign to end the war against Japan, Mr.Bowling's unit was among the first to arrive on the beachheads of Iwo  While attempting to secure Mount Suribachi, his unit came under intense and concentrated fire, completely overwhelming his unit. Two projectiles struck Mr.Bowling in the chest and leg, leaving him critically wounded on the battlefield.  At that moment, Mr.Bowling said he looked to the heavens and committed to serving mankind for the rest of his life if he survived. Miraculously, a combat photographer and medical team then carried Mr.Bowling to the safety of a landing craft, where he witnessed the planting of the American flag atop Mount Suribachi, an iconic image that persists as one of the most legendary and triumphant moments of the war. The U.Marines eventually took control of the island. However, this victory came at a heavy cost, as over 6,800 U.servicemembers gave their lives during the battle of Iwo  In keeping faith with his commitment to God made during that battle, Mr.Bowling devoted over 78,000 hours of volunteer service to others at the Lexington VA Medical For over 66 years, Mr.Bowling rose through the ranks within the Disabled American Veterans organization, holding nearly every position possible, including State commander.                              {time}  1030  The Bible teaches in Proverbs 21:21 that ``He who pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity, and honor.''  Mr.Bowling has brought great honor upon himself through his dedication, determination, and love for serving the people of our community. Without a doubt, he has remained true to the commitment he made on the rocky terrain of Iwo  Mr.Bowling embodies the best of American ideals, values, and commitment to serving others, never abandoning the Marine motto of semper fidelis, ``always faithful.''  On behalf of a grateful nation, I would like to thank Mr.Bowling, a model member of the greatest generation, for his many years of service to our country and our community.

He is helping our true American heroes with this, and I am so proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation.  The challenges our Nation's heroes face do not end on the battlefield. Education and career training programs offer veterans the opportunity to enter a new chapter of their lives when they return home from their service.  I recently visited AmSkills, a manufacturing apprenticeship center in New Port Richey, Florida, to learn more about the good work they are doing locally to help veterans transition to civilian careers.  The Forever GI Bill helps ensure that veterans nationwide have the resources to access career education programs such as AmSkills, of course, going to a university maybe, a community college, vocational training, whatever they want to do.  Importantly, this bill allows future eligible GI Bill recipients to use their benefits at any point in their lives. That is incredible. It is long overdue, as opposed to the current 15-year time limit, which is so unfair.  It also includes my provision, the VETERAN Act, which authorizes $30 million to help the VA invest in modernizing their information technology systems for claims processing.  Congress and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee would have oversight of the VA's proposed changes and monitor its progress. The provision would be a major step in helping veterans receive their benefits in a more timely and efficient manner.

2657,topic-id,809,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in favor of the American Health Care Act, a bill that repeals the worst parts of ObamaCare and begins to repair the damage it has caused. This bill brings choice and competition back into the healthcare marketplace and puts healthcare decisions back into the hands of patients and doctors where it belongs.  It has been a winding road to get to this point, but we are here today to fulfill the promise that we made to the American people. I will point out right now to those who say we should have just moved on from healthcare reform, American families and individuals are suffering from rising costs and barriers to getting the care that they need right now.  Under ObamaCare, the situation is getting worse every day. In Iowa, just yesterday, one of the last remaining insurers announced that it will pull out of the ObamaCare exchanges, leaving nearly all of the State's residents with no--and, yes, I will say again, nearly all of the residents with no available health insurance plan for the purchase under                              {time}  1230  And in a few of the Iowa counties which are the remaining insurers, even that company is saying it might stop offering plans, leaving the entire State without an insurance plan available under That is happening this very week. We can't wait a moment longer than necessary to provide relief for the American people by repealing and replacing  I applaud the Members of this body who stuck with us during this process and worked hard to make the bill better. I, myself, had concerns about the bill as it was introduced. I worked hard to make sure that the bill truly reflected my ideals and the views and desires of my constituents. And when the bill came before the Budget Committee, which I chair, I urged my members to stay in the fight and work to improve the bill rather than stop it in its tracks.  And do you know what? Our members did just that, making some recommendations that were eventually included in the various amendments. That message was heard loud and clear by all of the members of our Conference who have worked tirelessly to finalize a bill that truly reflects our vision for healthcare reform.  Throughout this process, our commitment to undoing the damage done by ObamaCare has remained steadfast. Day after day, my constituents call my office begging us to do something to save them from ObamaCare, and it is because ObamaCare is collapsing.  In my State of Tennessee, families are suffering. Premiums have increased by 60 percent, while deductibles are so high that, even if someone has an insurance card, it doesn't mean they have guaranteed care.  There are parts of my State in Tennessee that don't have a single insurance provider in the marketplace, and two-thirds of the counties have only one provider. That is not competition. That is called a monopoly.  While no legislation is perfect, this bill makes some important changes to help American families get quality, affordable health insurance: It zeros out the mandates, it repeals the taxes, and it repeals the subsidies; it allows people to choose health insurance plans to meet the unique needs of their families instead of purchasing a one-size-fits-all plan mandated by a Washington bureaucrat; and it modernizes Medicaid, a once-in-a-lifetime entitlement reform.  Ending Medicaid's open-ended funding structure will play an important role in addressing our future budget deficits and our growing national debt.  This is a particularly proud moment for me. I was working as a nurse in Nashville in the 1990s when the Clinton administration pushed a single-payer pilot program in Tennessee called I saw firsthand the negative impact government-run health care has on patient care. I saw costs rise and the quality of care fall. It inspired me to get involved in public service.  When in 2009 and 2010 I saw those same principles being debated and, eventually, implemented on the national level, I thought my experience in Tennessee could be valuable in the national debate; so, in 2011, I sponsored the first piece of legislation that repealed a part of Today, we take the largest step yet in rescuing the American people from this damaging, government-run healthcare system.  I, and many other Members of this body, have worked hard to make sure that this bill truly reflects our visions for healthcare reform. I, for one, cannot sit idly by and let this opportunity go to waste. Governing is hard, but our constituents did not elect us to do what is easy. They elected us to do what is right.

2696,topic-id,825,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to myself.  The American Health Care Act has gone through many fits and starts over the last few months. This bill begins to fulfill our promise to the American people by reducing costs for American families. It eliminates ObamaCare's burdens on small businesses and families and protects those with preexisting conditions. We must continue to work to build on this.  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), our majority leader.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding, but, more importantly, I thank Congresswoman Diane Black for more than four decades as a nurse, for caring for the sick, for her passion for the unborn, and for her work on this legislation.  Now, Mr.Speaker, Americans are a practical people. We know that we can have fair health care that helps those who need it without trapping everyone in a government-run system dreamed up by Washington's central planners.  Now, contrary to our freedom, ObamaCare forced the American people to purchase insurance. Contrary to our well-being, ObamaCare imposed taxes we cannot bear. Contrary to what is responsible and right, ObamaCare made Medicaid unsustainable for the people most in need. And contrary to common sense, ObamaCare regulations continued to drive up the cost of insurance beyond what people can afford.  You want to know how ObamaCare is working? Just read this week's papers. Now, let me take you all the way back to yesterday. This is the headline: ``Medica, the last insurer selling individual health policies in most of Iowa, likely to exit.''  Now, 94 of the 99 counties will have no insurer in Ninety-four of the 94 counties in Iowa will have no insurer.  Here is another headline from yesterday: ``Aetna will exit ObamaCare markets in Virginia in 2018.''  Humana left the ObamaCare exchanges. Blue Cross left United Healthcare left all but a handful of markets this year.  Mr.Speaker, we have roughly 3,000 counties in all of One-third, 1,022, only have one provider. Soon, more counties will have none.  So do you know what doesn't cover preexisting conditions? A healthcare system that doesn't have coverage. No options means no coverage. That is the road ObamaCare is leading us down, and doing nothing leaves too many Americans out in the cold.  Now, Mr.Speaker, we will not stand for that. We tried the ObamaCare way. It is failing remarkably, and the American people are demanding a change.  Now we have a chance to do something great. We could have care without control, stability without centralization, and support without mandates. We have a chance to listen to the American people and repeal and replace  The American Health Care Act will repeal the individual and employer mandates. It will repeal ObamaCare taxes. It will repeal ObamaCare rules. It will repeal ObamaCare subsidies. And it will do what is right by stopping taxpayer funding for abortion providers and by refocusing Medicaid on those who most need it. We replace all of that with a system that protects those with preexisting conditions.  Mr.Speaker, I heard a lot about this bill, and this bill is not 2,000 pages. It is less than 130. But, Mr.Speaker, I have heard things on this floor that are not true.  So let me state it one more time. We will replace all that with a system that protects those with preexisting conditions and then reduces premiums through the tried-and-true process of fair competition.  As the price of insurance decreases, we give those who still can't quite afford it a step up through tax credits and expanded health savings accounts. This is fundamental and structural reform.  Now, Mr.Speaker, since I have had the honor to stand on this floor and serve in this House, this body has done many good things. We have stood time and again for what was best for our country, struggling against other branches for so long. Many times that required us to dig in our heels and stop something terrible. It is good to stop bad things from happening, but it is great to make good things happen. Finally, after years of waiting, we have the chance to do something good today.  This bill is not perfect. No bill could be. The question is not: Why can't it be made perfect? The question is: Do we retreat or do we act? Do we take this great leap to repeal and replace ObamaCare, extend a hand to our fellow citizens most in need and break free from Washington control, or do we continue to wait for a day that is already here in the hope of a better day that may never come?  We were not sent here to wait. We are called to action. This is our opportunity. Mr.Speaker, I do not want to read another day of headlines of more people going without insurance, without insurance without preexisting conditions, without coverage.

It is beyond clear that approach has failed. It is time we start to address the persistent and systemic racial bias that has plagued our criminal justice system and adopt policies that will move us forward, not backward. It is time to de-schedule marijuana.  Since 2001, arrests for marijuana have increased across the Country and now account for over 50 percent of all drug arrests in the United The ACLU conducted a thorough study of over 8 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010. It found that 88 percent of those were for marijuana possession. Alarmingly, the study also found that African Americans are 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white peers, even though they use marijuana at similar rates.  Over the last five years, States have begun to legalize marijuana in an effort to push back on the failed War on Drugs and combat the illicit drug market. Currently, eight States and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana and more States are taking up measures to follow suit. We know from the experiences of States that have already legalized marijuana that we will gain far more than we lose--these States have seen increased revenues and decreased rates of serious crime, and a reallocation of resources toward more productive uses. In Colorado, arrest rates have decreased and State revenues have increased. Washington saw a 10 percent decrease in violent crime over the three-year period following legalization.  However, the Federal government still treats marijuana as an illegal substance. It is time for the Federal government to end the Federal prohibition of marijuana.  Today, I introduced the Marijuana Justice Act, a bill that would remove marijuana from the list of controlled substances, thereby ending the Federal prohibition. The bill would also automatically expunge records for people who were convicted of Federal marijuana use and possession offenses. We must help people with criminal records get back up on their feet and obtain jobs, and expunging their records is an important step in that process.  The legislation would allow individuals currently serving time in Federal prison for marijuana offenses to petition a court for a resentencing. One of the greatest tragedies from the Fair Sentencing Act was that it did not provide retroactive relief to individuals serving time under the old crack and powder cocaine sentencing laws.

2693,topic-id,1625,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the United Steelworkers, the AFL-CIO, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in relation to this bill.                                          United Steelworkers,                                                      May 3, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the members of the United      Steelworkers union (USW), I continue to urge you to oppose      the American Health Care Act (AHCA), despite proposed      amendments. This legislation will adversely affect every      American's health insurance benefits including workplace      plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and the individual market.       This harmful and partisan legislation will cause tens of      millions to lose insurance coverage over the next decade.      Deductibles and premiums are expected to rise. In short,      rather than reducing costs of health care, this bill will      simply shift costs to working Americans and their families      while cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations.       The MacArthur Amendment allows states to opt out of certain      protections under the Affordable Care Act such as the      requirements that insurers provide plans with a minimum      package of services and don't discriminate against people      with pre-existing conditions. The amendment also lets states      allow insurance companies to charge older people up to five      times what they charge younger people. This amendment will      allow for an uneven patchwork of insurance coverage across      the country and will make insurance cost prohibitive for many      working and retired Although lawmakers are working      to address the treatment of individuals with pre-existing      conditions, none of the proposals have adequately addressed      the costs associated with removal of the Affordable Care      Act's protections for those individuals.       Overall, the AHCA is a transfer of wealth from working      Americans to the very wealthy and to corporations including      the pharmaceutical industry, insurance companies, and medical      device manufacturers. It removes taxes on the very wealthy      and on corporations, giving the wealthiest 400 household an      average tax cut of about $7 million each. Meanwhile, the bill      retains the ``Cadillac Tax'' which puts the burden of the      cost of this legislation squarely on the backs of middle      class working families.       Most of our members are covered under employer-negotiated      insurance plans. However, the AHCA removes the employer-     mandate included in the Affordable Care This      dramatically changes the incentive and landscape for      employer-sponsored insurance, which threatens the system that      provides insurance for millions of hard-working      CBO estimated that 7 million people will lost their workplace      coverage as a result of this bill.       The AHCA also undoes protections and assistance for older      Americans and our members who are retirees with dramatically      increased out-of-pocket costs to Americans who are older but      not yet eligible for For those who will or      currently rely on Medicare this bill reduces the solvency of      the program by three years by repealing taxes on the wealthy      and on corporations.       Additionally, this bill makes perilous cuts to Medicaid      which provides health care to low-income Americans who have      been laid off, work at low-paying jobs, are disabled, or are      elderly. This will strain already limited state budgets,      restrict the needy Americans who are eligible for assistance,      and eliminate needed services.       Our members who work in the health care industry may also      be affected by job losses and strained budgets caused by the      passage of this bill. Providers (our employers) may be      subjected to lower reimbursement rates from state Medicaid      programs as a result of the federal cuts. Also, the costs of      uncompensated care will rise as millions of Americans lose      health insurance but still need health care treatment for      illnesses and injuries. Once again, hard-working middle class      health care workers will have to bear the costs of this      harmful legislation.       The amendments to the bill do not change the fundamental      flaws in the legislation enough to make it worthy of your      support. Harmful tax cuts are retained, and the bill would      not do anything to reduce costs or to prevent Americans from      losing health insurance--in fact, this bill would make those      problems worse.       The American Health Care Act is a harmful piece of      legislation that does not solve the problems in our current      health insurance system. Despite amendments, the costs of      this bill would still be borne by working families, making      health care less affordable and less accessible. The United      Steelworkers strongly opposes the AHCA and we urge you to      vote against it.           Sincerely,                                                    Leo Gerard,     International                                  ____                                                      AFL-CFO,                                                      May 4, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 12.5 million working      people represented by the AFL-CFO, I urge you to oppose the      American Health Care Act (AHCA, H.1628). In a stunning      fashion, this bill takes health coverage away from about 24      million people while providing massive tax cuts for the      wealthy and large corporations. No one in good conscience can      support this legislation.       It is important to understand what is driving Republicans      to pursue a massive roll back in health coverage. While it is      packaged as health care reform, a straightforward look at      this legislation shows that it is fundamentally designed to      pare back public commitments to health coverage in order to      benefit the wealthy.       House Speaker Paul Ryan publically boasted that the AHCA is      a ``trillion dollar tax cut'' that will benefit corporations      and pave the way for further tax ``reform.'' He made clear      that repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) taxes is a major      aim of the bill. The tax cuts, however, largely go to higher      earners and corporations. The one ACA tax left intact is the      only one that predominantly impacts working people--the so-     called ``Cadillac'' tax on workplace health benefits.       There are terrible human costs to this upward      redistribution of wealth. Millions of individuals will again      face the dilemma of choosing between getting life-saving      medical treatment and meeting their families' basic financial      needs.       The AHCA replaces ACA subsidies that support a minimum      level of coverage with tax credits so small that at least 3      million people will be unable to afford coverage in the      individual market, according to the Congressional Budget      Office (CBO). Millions more will find that they can only      afford skimpy coverage that will leave them exposed to      substantial costs should they face major sickness,      undoubtedly increasing the number of medical bankruptcies.      The bill allows insurers to require that seniors in the      individual market pay five times as much in premiums as      younger adults, imposing an ``age tax.''       The bill also decimates Medicaid, ending the program as we      know it--placing seniors, people with disabilities, and      children in jeopardy of losing access to care. The AHCA      slashes the program by $839 billion dollars over ten years,      and CBO estimates that these cuts will result in 14 million      people losing their coverage. In using the program as a[[Page H4162]]     piggy bank, without efforts to improve the services it      provides, the AHCA manages to shift resources away from many      of the nation's most vulnerable people as part of its      redistribution project.       Medicare is not spared either. The bill pulls approximately      $77 billion from the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund      to provide a tax cut to the wealthy, shortening the lifespan      of the fund. An additional $28 billion is extracted from      Medicare's trust fund for outpatient medical services, to      provide a tax break for pharmaceutical companies.       Employer-based health insurance, the nation's major source      of coverage, also gets hit. The AHCA preserves the so-called      ``Cadillac'' tax on workplace health coverage that will      impact more than 42 percent of large employer plans when it      goes into effect. Economists predict the tax will cause      employers to hollow-out the coverage provided in their plans,      exposing workers to higher out-of-pocket costs, such as      deductibles and copays. In some cases, employers are expected      to drop coverage altogether. The bill also eliminates the      penalty that employers face when they do not comply with the      ACA's employer shared responsibility requirements. 030      estimates that seven million people will lose employer-based      coverage under the       These sacrifices in health coverage finance stunning tax      cuts for the very wealthy and corporations. The legislation      provides the 400 highest-income households with an average      annual tax cut of $7 million each. Large corporations see      impressive windfalls. The AHCA gives insurance companies      alone $145 billion in tax relief, while medical device makers      get $20 billion, and pharmaceutical companies benefit by      paying less into       The reasons for opposing this legislation, which sacrifices      health coverage for millions to support tax cuts for the few,      are clear. We hope you stand with working people when you      make your choice.           Sincerely,                                               William Samuel,                                                         Director,     Government Affairs                                  ____                                         International Brotherhood                                                 of Teamsters,                                                      May 4, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members      of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and their      families, I urge you to vote no on the American Health Care      Act (AHCA) today. The Teamsters have long opposed proposals      to tax worker health benefits and this legislation retains      the 40 percent excise tax on high quality health care plans      which would ultimately reduce the health benefits that hard      working Americans receive and increase their out of pocket      costs. The amendments added to the bill do nothing to allay      Teamster concerns nor address the fundamental flaws of the      underlying bill. The amendments make the bill worse than      before by opening the door to the erosion or elimination of      minimum coverage and pre-existing condition protections and      by allowing insurers to charge older adults much higher      premiums. It does not change the fact that the millions of      American families will lose health insurance.       Congress should be looking for ways to strengthen the      middle class instead of promoting policies that will      ultimately take money from their hard earned paychecks and      reduce, and make more costly, the health care benefits they      receive.       The American Health Care Act remains fatally flawed      Accordingly, I call on you to oppose and vote no on the      American Health Care Act when it comes to the floor today.

2747,topic-id,1197,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 299 provides for the consideration of H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility This resolution provides for a closed rule since no amendments were submitted to the Rules  Mr.Speaker, the workforce of the 21st century is a lot different from the workforce of the thirties and forties when many of our Nation's labor laws were first written. As such, many of these laws are outdated and out of touch with the realities facing today's workers.  For example, in nearly half of two-parent households, both Mom and Dad work full time. That is up from roughly 30 percent in 1970. Meanwhile, millennials now represent the majority of the workforce.  Given the changes in the workforce, there are new challenges related to the work-family balance. From children's field trips, to taking care of an elderly family member, to a single parent juggling different tasks while their spouse is on a military deployment, the demands are greater than ever. That is where the Working Families Flexibility Act comes in.  This commonsense bill would improve the quality of life for many hardworking men and women by removing outdated Federal restrictions imposed solely on the private sector.  Already, workers in the public sector at the Federal, State, and local level have the ability to take comp time in lieu of overtime pay if they prefer. This bill would give that same option to workers in the private sector.  Here is how it would work. An employee and their employer would come together and mutually agree to enter an arrangement where the employee would receive time and a half in time off or comp time instead of time-and-a-half overtime pay. In other words, employees would have the choice between paid time off and cash wages for working overtime.  As I mentioned, this provision is already available for workers in the public sector. That is because, in 1985, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards Act to give public sector employees greater flexibility. In fact, in a report filed by the House Education and the Workforce Committee more than 30 years ago, our Democratic colleagues wrote that this change in law recognized the ``mutual benefits'' of comp time for State and local governments and outlined the ``freedom and flexibility'' comp time would offer public sector workers.  Shouldn't workers in the private sector be entitled to the same freedom and flexibility given to government workers?  Now, I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will say this bill is somehow bad for workers. That could not be further from the truth. Let me clear up some of the false information put out by union bosses and special interest groups.  First, this proposal is completely voluntary. Both an employee and an employer would have to agree to a comp time agreement, and their agreement would have to be put in writing.  Second, no employer can coerce or intimidate their employees into taking comp time. An employee who feels they have been mistreated can file a charge with the Department of Labor, at no cost, or they can bring their own legal action. Employers who take advantage of their employees would face the same penalties as they would for other wage violations.  Now, as a labor and employment attorney, I have been a part of these kind of legal matters in the past, and I can honestly say that no sensible employer would take advantage of an employee and risk double damages, exorbitant attorney fees, and a legal battle with the Federal  Third, employees have control over when to use their comp time, as long as reasonable notice is given and the request doesn't unduly disrupt the workplace. This is the same standard used in the public sector, and it is the same standard used under the Family and Medical Leave I imagine it is also[[Page H3014]]the same standard used in each of our congressional offices.  Fourth, this bill includes a 5-year sunset that would require Congress to come back and reaffirm this law after reviewing the impact of comp time. This would give us the ability to change the law based on the real-world impact.  Fifth, the bill would set the maximum comp time accrual amount at 160 hours, which is less than what is allowed in the public sector. This provision was actually included after Democrats expressed concerns that workers would accrue too much comp time.  Sixth, an employee has the right to cash out their comp time at any time and for any reason. This is a decision that the employee alone can make. Additionally, at the end of the year, employees would receive a cash payment for any unused hours.  Finally, this is not a far-fetched or radical idea. In fact, President Bill Clinton had his own comp time proposal during his  So this bill is great for workers and actually gives them greater choice and flexibility in the workplace. In fact, our committee, the Committee on Education and the Workforce, heard a real-life example of how comp time would make life easier for families during a recent hearing on the bill. We heard about a clerical worker for a mental health company who recently found out she was pregnant and was putting in a lot of overtime during a transition to a new computer system. This mom-to-be simply wanted to waive the overtime pay and, instead, be credited the time for maternity leave.  As her human resources professional testified: ``I had to explain to her that we were unable to do so because it was against the law. It was difficult conveying this message to this single mom-to-be who felt she should be allowed the option to choose for herself whether to take the overtime pay or paid leave when her child was born.''                              {time}  1245  That is why this bill is necessary, for people like this working mom. That is how this bill will make a real difference.  Now, Mr.Speaker, I know comp time won't work for every worker or family, so if an employee wants to continue receiving time-and-a-half overtime pay, then they can continue to do so and this bill will have no impact on them. But this bill would create a new option for employees to better meet the needs of the 21st century workforce. Workers today want and need the type of freedom and flexibility that this bill provides. This bill would allow a working mom or dad to put in a little extra time at work in order to have that time off to attend a child's baseball game, dance recital, or field trip. This is all about freedom, flexibility, fairness, and choice.  Certainly, more work and changes will be needed as we adapt to the workforce of the 21st century, and I look forward to learning more about proposals from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But the simple fact that there are other proposals out there should not stop us from passing this commonsense bill to give working families the flexibility they need and deserve.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 299 and the underlying bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.

They would rather lock workers into these restrictive arrangements where you have working mothers, like the one I used in my initial remarks, who can't get their flexible time off that they want because we do not allow them to do that under the Federal Labor Standards  Comp time is just not technically optional, as my friend said, under this[[Page H3016]]law. It is optional by law. It is a voluntary thing by law. There is no question about that. Employers cannot coerce or intimidate an employee to do that under this law. It is strictly prohibited, and there are serious legal repercussions for an employer who attempts to do that.  There are no differences in the protections for someone under this bill and the protections that public employees have when they seek to have this sort of flextime under the laws that pertain to them. It is the same protection. So it doesn't matter whether you are in the private sector or the public sector; under this bill, you are going to be protected.                              {time}  1300  Let me tell you something, as someone who has practiced in this area. It is not an idle threat to an employer to face a regulatory proceeding from the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor or to face a private lawsuit. Those are a big deal. If you lose, you have to not only pay double damages, you have got to pay the employees' attorneys fees, which can be significant. No sensible employer is going to go out there and intimidate and coerce and think they can get away with it. They can't.  Wages, under our bankruptcy laws, are the first priority of what is paid out during the winding up of a bankruptcy proceeding. Before any other creditor is paid, wages get paid. In my experience, I don't remember wages ever not being paid in a bankruptcy. That is always assumed. They get taken care of quickly. Most employers do the right thing.  My friend talked about employers needing to do the right thing. Most employers do the right thing. Just like I know my colleague, when he had a business in the private sector, did the right thing by his employees. Most employers do. Yet too often in this body, we act as if the assumption is that employers are going to do the wrong thing, and then we come down with this heavy-handed overregulation, punitive approach that restricts the freedom of both employers and--let's get back to it--the workers themselves to work these things out.  This is a commonsense solution to a real problem in the new workplace of the 21st century, where most moms and dads are working and where we have this new millennial generation that wants flexibility. They expect it. When you go to them and tell them: Oh, you can't have it because it is a Federal law, they don't understand.  I have got to tell you, Mr.Speaker, I don't understand. Yes, I understand that this law was put together in the 1930s. Maybe it made sense for the workplace in the thirties, but it doesn't make sense for the workplace of the 21st century.  I am disappointed in my colleagues who used to be in favor of these sorts of flexible arrangements and no longer favor it, but I get that. I hope that the rest of us will use our common sense and use what we all know is really happening in the workplace today and support this very important bill.

2758,topic-id,341,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I think my friends on the other side of the aisle don't understand how this works. An employee comes to their supervisor or the person who runs the HR office in the company and says: I would like to get some comp time in return for the overtime I am getting ready to work because I have got a specific reason to want to use it. The employer says: Okay, when do you want to get the overtime and when do you want to take the comp time? They work that out.  The employer has the responsibility for having the system and the paperwork for showing that they have complied with the law. From an employer's point of view, that is an extra burden. It is really not in the interest of an employer to do this. An employer would really prefer to say: Look, I don't want to have to do this, because if I make a mistake, I am going to get in trouble with either a private lawsuit or the Department of So it is really better for the employer not to have this option because it is not going to be an option in which they can make a mistake.  This is for that employee to get the comp time so they can have some flexibility in their schedule. That is who it is for. If they don't want to use it, they don't have to use it. They can still be paid the time and a half that they are paid today. No one can coerce them. The law says you can't do that, and there are real penalties for it.  To the contrary, when we are hearing that somehow this is something for the employers, no, it is not. This is for the workers--the new workers of the 21st century, who sometimes I think we have forgotten about when we have these debates in this body.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The American people are sick and tired of agencies that don't have the authority to go out there and they do something, and it doesn't solve the problem.

As a young woman herself, she understands what's going on in the workplace with people her age and how they try to juggle all the demands of their time. She has come up with a very commonsense approach to how we can deal with this in a way that makes sense for everybody.  We just heard a lot about the labor movement and big bosses. I got transported back in my mind. You would have thought we were in the 1930s and 1940s. I don't know if my colleague from Colorado has been paying attention, but union membership is at its lowest level since the 1940s right now because, even after 8 years of the most pro-union administration in decades, union membership continues to fall, and it continues to fall because workers in America aren't buying what they are selling because a lot of what they are selling is exactly what we hear is the opposition to this bill, which is: Let's limit people; let's restrict people; let's come up with all these things to tell them what they can't do instead of telling them what they can.[[Page H3019]]  What the American people want, what I heard in my townhall meetings, they want the government off their back so that they can make their own choices and live their lives the way they want to live them. This is really true with the millennial generation.  I have four children who are adults right now. They are millennials. They really want to have flexibility in their lives, and this bill, Congresswoman Roby's bill, gets a little way toward that. I don't see why we would be against trying to give not just young workers, but all workers, that flexibility.  I have heard the arguments, and I have heard them several times now. I have just got to tell you, they make no sense to me. Perhaps they are something that made sense 50, 60, 70 years ago, but they don't make any sense in 2017. It is a different time.

Mr.Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 299 and the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:           An Amendment to 299 Offered by Mr.Polis        At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     1868) to provide that providers of broadband Internet access      service shall be subject to the privacy rules adopted by the      Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 2016. The      first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points      of order against consideration of the bill are waived.      General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not      exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair      and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and      After general debate the bill shall be considered      for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order      against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion      of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee      shall rise and report the bill to the House with such      .amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question      shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments      thereto to final passage without intervening motion except      one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the      Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to      no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day      the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of      business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the      Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.       7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.1868.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an a amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and balances, Congress has responsibility to hold the executive branch of government to a fair and equal standard of transparency ensuring the public interest is placed first;  Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public;  Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline of reasonable information including whether the President paid taxes, ownership interests, charitable donations made, and whether tax deductions have been exploited;  Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the President's financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians;  Whereas, the President recently fired Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, under whose leadership the FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election;  Whereas, President Trump reportedly stated to Russian officials during a White House meeting that he fired Director Comey to ease pressure on the ongoing investigation of Russia's influence in the 2016 election;  Whereas, Senate Russia investigators have requested information from the Treasury Department's criminal investigation division, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which handles cases of money laundering, for information related to President Trump, his top officials and campaign aides. FinCEN has been investigating allegations of foreign money-laundering through purchases of U.real estate;  Whereas, the President's tax returns would show us whether he has foreign bank accounts and how much profit he receives from his ownership in myriad partnerships;  Whereas, Donald Trump said The Trump Organization saw money ``pouring in from Russia'' and that ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets'';  Whereas, Congress gave itself the authority to review an individual's tax returns to investigate and reveal possible conflicts of interest of executive branch officials involved dating back to the Teapot Dome scandal;  Whereas, it has been reported that federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records as part of the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 election;  Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world;  Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his[[Page H4673]]businesses, and can still withdraw funds at any time from the trust of which he is the sole beneficiary;  Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state'';  Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President's tax returns under section 6103 of the Tax Code;  Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public;  Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;  Whereas, Director Comey has testified that tax returns are a common tool in investigations because they can show income and motives;  Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise:  Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives shall:  One, immediately request the tax return information of Donald Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives;  Two, support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns.

Over the following years, this humble brush arbor evolved into the thriving spiritual center that New Light Beulah Baptist Church has become today.  New Light Beulah Baptist Church embodies the resilience and service of the African-American community. Forged from adversity, this congregation has stood strong throughout tumultuous times, both externally and internally. Their strength comes not from the brick and mortar within which they worship, but from God's good graces and the steadfast individuals who have labored in this historic church.  The church has been a leader in Hopkins, South Carolina, a small rural community southeast of Columbia, the State's capital. Through various community-oriented initiatives, such as their child development program, Meals on Wheels, the Neighboring Christian Athletic Association, and the Educational Society, the congregation has positively impacted the entire community.

On the day it was passed, I observed that the Affordable Care Act is the Civil Rights Act of the 21st century. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would be inhumane and put egregious forms of discrimination back into our healthcare delivery system.

It would precipitate a proliferation of junk policies that have historically plagued unsuspecting low-income communities for years.

2773,topic-id,251,"Mr.President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins me today in recognizing the Idaho National Laboratory's achievements in 50 years of operation of the advanced test reactor. The success of the scientific mission of the advanced test reactor is a pride of Idaho and of the entire American nuclear science community.  The advanced test reactor is a unique system designed to support multiple different experiments simultaneously. It can serve as a nuclear ``time machine'' by testing the stresses of nuclear power 20 times faster than conventional systems. It is currently involved in research to convert weapons-grade nuclear material to reactor fuel. This will strengthen American energy independence.  The U.Navy's nuclear propulsion program is a key customer of advanced test reactor research. It is one of many ways in which Idahoans contribute to our national security. The advanced test reactor is also the only American source for a particular isotope known as Cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 is vital for its use in modern brain cancer treatments and is saving the lives of Americans every day.  Beyond these good works, the advanced test reactor is available to our universities. Our next generation of scientists has access to this unique system on the condition that their research be published for the benefit of the American public. Through this and other efforts, the Idaho National Laboratory works to support current and future generations.  Congratulations to the dedicated men and women of the Idaho National They are the embodiment of American scientific achievement and leadership in nuclear research.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgS3729.txt,250,REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.

Contrary to its name, the Working Families Flexibility Act provides no flexibility for working families but makes it harder to plan financially at a time when wages have stagnated and American workers are working harder than ever.  The 40-hour workweek is a long established American way of life--a way of life won by hardworking American men and women. This legislation aims to undermine the Fair Labor Standards Act and the 40-hour workweek by handing even more power over to employers by giving them the right to not pay for overtime hours.  This legislation amounts to a handout for large American companies at the expense of their workers. Hardworking Americans can't afford to loan their bosses overtime pay for months at a time. Employees would also find themselves at a disadvantage if they wanted to get paid for overtime instead of opting for comp time. Companies would find it in their financial interest to select comp time workers instead of workers who want overtime pay. This isn't the flexibility that American workers need.  The bill is right about one thing: American workers do deserve an update to the If they really want to talk about helping American working families gain more flexibility in the workplace, Congress should be taking up bills on paid sick days, paid family and medical leave, and a real increase in wages.

The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.2210       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(3) During an enemy ambush, Kusick, though seriously      wounded, refused aid and radioed the forward air controller      to advise him of the critical situation.       (4) While the team leader led a withdrawal to a landing      zone, Kusick maintained contact with the controller and      requested emergency extraction.       (5) Realizing the importance of having a radio operator on      the ground to direct landings, Kusick refused evacuation by      the first helicopter.       (6) After the second helicopter was shot down, and in the      midst of enemy fire, Kusick continued to maintain radio      contact and called for a hoist extraction of the men still      remaining on the ground.       (7) The last helicopter, which Kusick boarded, was shot      down by intense Viet Cong fire and crashed in flames,      resulting in Kusick's death.       (8) On December 22, 1967, Kusick was posthumously awarded      the Silver Star Medal for gallantry in action.       (9) The citation to accompany the award of the Silver Star      Medal stated that ``Kusick's gallantry in action, at the cost      of his life, was in keeping with the highest traditions of      the military service and reflects great credit upon himself,      his unit, and the United States Army''.     2.

I just want to say this bill can have a very simple slogan: American people are going to pay more and get less. That is what this bill does.               Statement on the American Health Care Act  (By Rick Pollack, President and CEO, American Hospital Association,                             April 27, 2017)       The latest version of the AHCA continues to put health      coverage in jeopardy for many Our top concern is      what this change could mean for older and sicker patients,      including those with preexisting conditions, such as cancer      patients and those with chronic conditions. For these      reasons, along with our previously stated concerns about the      AHCA, we cannot support the bill. However, we urge Congress      to continue to work with stakeholders on a solution that      provides meaningful coverage.       The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen      the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at      greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health      benefit standards, which could leave patients without access      to critical health services and increase out-of-pocket      spending. This could allow plans to set premium prices based      on individual risk for some consumers, which could      significantly raise costs for those with pre-existing      conditions.       Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has not yet      scored the amendment. However, CBO previously projected that      the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people covered in      2026. It is unlikely this amendment would improve these      coverage estimates.       As the backbone of America's health safety-net, hospitals      and health systems must protect access to care for those who      need it and ensure that the most vulnerable patients are not      left behind.

Re H.1628--OPPOSE     Diane Black,     Chairwoman, House Budget Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington,       Dear Representative Black: On behalf of the millions of      American kids and families who rely on comprehensive,      dependable health insurance to stay healthy and to get      medical treatment when they need it, we are writing to      respectfully express our strong opposition to your bill, H.     1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). We have added this      bill to our Common Sense Legislative Ratings Tool as an      ``Against Kids'' bill and will communicate our position to      our parent and teacher members.       Common Sense is the nation's leading independent nonprofit      organization dedicated to helping kids thrive in a rapidly      changing world. We empower parents, teachers, and      policymakers by providing unbiased information, trusted      advice, and innovative tools to help them harness the power      of media and technology as a positive force in all kids'      lives. The policy arm, Common Sense Kids Action, is building      a movement of parents, teachers, business leaders, and others      dedicated to making kids our nation's top priority by      supporting policies at the state and federal level that      contribute to the building blocks of opportunity for kids.      Access to affordable and quality medical care for kids is      certainly one of those key building blocks.       Thanks to current law, including the Affordable Care Act,      Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),      95% of young children in the U.today have health      insurance. That's a remarkable achievement. With health      insurance, parents are more likely to seek medical care for      themselves and for their children, helping to prevent      illnesses from developing and shortening their duration when      they occur. However, the AHCA will result in 24 million fewer      Americans having coverage, including millions of children.      This jeopardizes the health and well-being of America's kids      and will alarm any parent who understands the importance of      health insurance for their children and family. The      Affordable Care Act certainly needs to be fixed, but if      Congress has the goal of making sure that all families and      businesses have access to affordable and comprehensive health      insurance, it could improve the law for everyone without      forcing millions of kids and their parents to lose access to      critical medical care.       As Congress continues to grapple with this issue, health      insurance programs, we think these facts about children's      health insurance from the Congressional Budget Office and the      Georgetown University Center for Children and Families are      important to keep in mind:       Ninety-five percent of children age 0-5 are insured today.       Forty-five million of those children access health care      through two programs: about 37 million through Medicaid (a      federal-state program) and 8 million through CHIP, the      Children's Health Insurance       Children are the single-largest group of persons covered      under       Under the Affordable Care Act, as you know, many states      expanded Medicaid with help from the federal government,      increasing coverage for kids and families, including coverage      for mental health care.       Changes being considered, including under the AHCA, would      cut funding to Medicaid by as much as $880 billion over the      next 10 years.       The AHCA, when compared with current law, would result in      24 million fewer Americans with health insurance by the year      2026.       Even with changes recently suggested to your bill,      America's kids will be best served by strengthening the      Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid and CHIP, not by      repealing the Affordable Care Act and block granting or      establishing a per capita cap on We urge you to      keep our children's future foremost in your thinking,      withdraw your bill, and work on a bipartisan basis to support      measures that protect and strengthen children's health care.

The harm that AHCA will impose on ordinary Americans is      breathtaking in scope. As the Congressional Budget Office has      detailed, 24 million will lose their health care coverage.      The Medicaid program will be cut by $839 billion and      restructured, ending the guarantee that the federal      government will fund a specified share of state Medicaid      costs. The bill makes coverage more expensive, especially for      lower-income families and older workers and it undermines the      financial strength of And the MacArthur amendment      makes a very bad bill worse by allowing states to opt out of      Affordable Care Act protections that ensure that people with      pre-existing conditions will be able to obtain comprehensive,      affordable health care. Moreover, the MacArthur amendment      would allow insurance companies to re-impose caps on annual      and lifetime limits, even in employer-sponsored coverage,      putting the health care of those with catastrophic illnesses      or injuries at risk.       Under the Upton amendment, grants to states that could be      used for high-risk pools will be increased by 6% or $8      billion over five years. This is a paltry increase. Even the      conservative Mercatus Center described the increase as a      ``pittance.'' High-risk pools would still be grossly      underfunded, even if states put all of the $138 billion in      grant funding into them. We urge the Congress not to ignore      the previous experience with state high-risk pools. By      segregating those with pre-existing conditions into separate      coverage we know they will face higher premiums, benefit      exclusions, annual and lifetime limits on coverage and      waiting lists.       It is unacceptable that this bill eliminates $500 billion      in taxes on the wealthiest 2%, health insurers,      pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device makers, while      taking health care away from millions. Moreover, the bill      retains the 40% tax on high cost health plans, which will      undermine employer-sponsored insurance for working families      by hollowing out coverage and increasing out-of-pocket      expenses, although it delays the implementation for six      years.       The bottom line is that this bill would cause millions to      lose their health coverage. Most of those with pre-existing      conditions would return to the days when even inadequate      coverage was unaffordable. The bill would drive up costs for      those who are older and lower-income, shift costs to states,      fail to protect employer-sponsored coverage, weaken public      health and undermine the solvency of the Medicare trust fund      all the while providing tax cuts for the wealthy and well-     connected.       The priorities demonstrated by this bill are upside down.      We urge you to oppose this bill.

2596,topic-id,794,"Mr.Speaker, the saga continues, and there seems to be no end in sight for the Trump administration's growing legal and ethical problems. Every day another shoe drops, or at least another foot is inserted into the administration's mouth.  The testimony of James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week showed us that this is no longer just a matter of foreign intelligence and the Russian meddling in American elections. While that is very important and we need to address the[[Page H4858]]foreign intelligence and security aspects of that matter, the very important question of how we keep Russia from hacking our elections in the future, what is clear is that the investigations into the Trump administration are now matters for the Judiciary  The gentlewoman from California, Senator Feinstein, and I were on CNN this weekend, and we made the point that the Judiciary Committee has the oversight responsibility for the Justice Department, therefore, it is time for the committee to do its job.  That was the theme of my speech here last week, and nothing has happened. It is also the reason I wrote to Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte last week to request that he take action, hold hearings, begin preparations for the hearings that will come--and they will come--because the silence of the Judiciary Committee has been deafening so far.  As soon as President Trump said on Friday he was willing to testify under oath 100 percent, I wrote Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte to say the committee should schedule a hearing and take the President at his word.  Now, I don't think the chairman will invite the President, a man he campaigned for, because the role of the House Judiciary Committee right now is to protect the President at all costs, shielding the President from tough questions instead of representing the people's interest.  In doing so, Judiciary Republicans and House Republicans in general are getting deeper and deeper into bed with this You see, they have a whole agenda, and they are counting on this President to help them cut taxes for people with trust funds while cutting healthcare, education, child care, civil rights and voting rights for people who work for a living.  Mr.Speaker, the House Judiciary Committee ought to be in the middle of congressional examinations of the Trump administration, and so far they have been on the sidelines.  Is it no longer the practice of the House of Representatives to hold oversight hearings? Is it no longer the practice of this body to hold the executive branch and the White House accountable?  I have never seen an administration more in need of congressional oversight than this one, yet the Congress does not dare do anything that might cause the President to call someone out in one of his dawn Twitter rants.  We know that the administration has a policy now--this administration--of not cooperating with congressional oversight, instructing agencies not to comply with inquiries from members of Congress unless they are a committee chairman, all of whom happen to be  Mr.Speaker, I am sorry, but the President and his administration are accountable to over 320 million Americans, all 435 Members of this body and 100 Senators as well, regardless of their party affiliation.  At least one senior senator called this policy opposing congressional oversight nonsense. To his credit, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, Mr.Grassley of Iowa, is not impacted by the Trump administration policy because he is a chairman, but he spoke out forcefully against the Presidential obstruction. See, my friends, that is how you do it, the way Mr.Grassley did it. Follow his example.

2690,topic-id,1931,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Save Medicaid in Schools, a coalition of dozens of organizations. This letter states that this bill jeopardizes health care for the Nation's most vulnerable children: students with disabilities and students in poverty.                                                      May 2, 2017.     Re The American Health Care Act Vote     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Minority      Leader Schumer, and Minority Leader Pelosi: The undersigned      member organizations of the Save Medicaid in the Schools      Coalition are concerned that the American Health Care Act      (AHCA) jeopardizes healthcare for the nation's most      vulnerable children: students with disabilities and students      in poverty. Specifically, the AHCA reneges on Medicaid's 50+      year commitment to provide America's children with access to      vital healthcare services that ensure they have adequate      educational opportunities and can contribute to society by      imposing a per-capita cap and shifting current and future      costs to taxpayers in every state and Congressional district.      While children currently comprise almost half of all Medicaid      beneficiaries, less than one in five dollars is spent by      Medicaid on children. Accordingly, a per-capita cap, even one      that is based on different groups of beneficiaries, will      disproportionally harm children's access to care, including      services received at school. Considering these unintended      consequences, we urge a `no'' vote on The American Health      Care Act (AHCA).[[Page H4160]]       Medicaid is a cost-effective and efficient provider of      essential health care services for children. School-based      Medicaid programs serve as a lifeline to children who can't      access critical health care and health services outside of      their school. Under this bill, the bulk of the mandated costs      of providing health care coverage would be shifted to the      States even though health needs and costs of care for      children will remain the same or increase. Most analyses of      the AHCA project that the Medicaid funding shortfall in      support of these mandated services will increase, placing      states at greater risk year after year. The federal      disinvestment in Medicaid imposed by the AHCA will force      States and local communities to increase taxes and reduce or      eliminate various programs and services, including other non-     Medicaid services. The unintended consequences of the AHCA      will force states to cut eligibility, services, and benefits      for children.       The projected loss of $880 billion in federal Medicaid      dollars will compel States to ration health care for      children. Under the per-capita caps included in the AHCA,      health care will be rationed and schools will be forced to      compete with other critical health care providers--hospitals,      physicians, and clinics--that serve Medicaid-eligible      children. School-based health services are mandated on the      States and those mandates do not cease simply because      Medicaid funds are capped by the As with many other      unfunded mandates, capping Medicaid merely shifts the      financial burden of providing services to the Medicaid Enables Schools to Provide Critical Health Care for Students       A school's primary responsibility is to provide students      with a high-quality education. However, children cannot learn      to their fullest potential with unmet health needs. As such,      school district personnel regularly provide critical health      services to ensure that all children are ready to learn and      able to thrive alongside their peers. Schools deliver health      services effectively and efficiently since school is where      children spend most of their days. Increasing access to      health care services through Medicaid improves health care      and educational outcomes for students. Providing health and      wellness services for students in poverty and services that      benefit students with disabilities ultimately enables more      children to become employable and attend higher-education.       Since 1988, Medicaid has permitted payment to schools for      certain medically-necessary services provided to children      under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)      through an individualized education program (IEP) or      individualized family service program (IFSP). Schools are      thus eligible to be reimbursed for direct medical services to      Medicaid-eligible students with an IEP or In addition,      districts can receive Medicaid reimbursements for providing      Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment Benefits      (EPSDT), which provide Medicaid-eligible children under age      21 with a broad array of diagnosis and treatment services.      The goal of EPSDT is to assure that health problems are      diagnosed and treated as early as possible before the      problems become complex and treatment is more expensive.       School districts use their Medicaid reimbursement funds in      a variety of ways to help support the learning and      development of the children they serve. In a 2017 survey of      school districts, district officials reported that two-thirds      of Medicaid dollars are used to support the work of health      professionals and other specialized instructional support      personnel (e.g., speech-language pathologists, audiologists,      occupational therapists, school psychologists, school social      workers, and school nurses) who provide comprehensive health      and mental health services to students. Districts also use      these funds to expand the availability of a wide range of      health and mental health services available to students in      poverty, who are more likely to lack consistent access to      healthcare professionals. Further, some districts depend on      Medicaid reimbursements to purchase and update specialized      equipment (e.g., walkers, wheelchairs, exercise equipment,      special playground equipment, and equipment to assist with      hearing and seeing) as well as assistive technology for      students with disabilities to help them learn alongside their      peers.       School districts would stand to lose much of their funding      for Medicaid under the Schools currently receive      roughly $4 billion in Medicaid reimbursements each year. Yet      under this proposal, states would no longer have to consider      schools as eligible Medicaid providers, which would mean that      districts would have the same obligation to provide services      for students with disabilities under IDEA, but no Medicaid      dollars to provide medically-necessary services. Schools      would be unable to provide EPSDT to students, which would      mean screenings and treatment that take place in school      settings would have to be moved to physician offices or      hospital emergency rooms, where some families may not      visit regularly or where costs are much higher.       In addition, basic health screenings for vision, hearing,      and mental health problems for students would no longer be      possible, making these problems more difficult to address and      expensive to treat. Moving health screenings out of schools      also reduces access to early identification and treatment,      which also leads to more costly treatment down the road.      Efforts by schools to enroll eligible students in Medicaid,      as required, would also decline.   The Consequences of Medicaid Per Capita Caps Will Potentially Be                         Devastating for Children       Significant reductions to Medicaid spending could have      devastating effects on our nation's children, especially      those with disabilities. Due to the underfunding of IDEA,      districts rely on Medicaid reimbursements to ensure students      with disabilities have access to the supports and services      they need to access a Free and Appropriate Public Education      (FAPE) and Early Intervention services. Potential      consequences of this critical loss of funds include:       Fewer health services: Providing comprehensive physical and      mental health services in schools improves accessibility for      many children and youth, particularly in high-needs and hard-     to-serve areas, such as rural and urban communities. In a      2017 survey of school district leaders, half of them      indicated they recently took steps to increase Medicaid      enrollment in their districts. Reduced funding for Medicaid      would result in decreased access to critical health care for      many children.       Cuts to general education: Cuts in Medicaid funding would      require districts to divert funds from other educational      programs to provide the services as mandated under      These funding reductions could result in an elimination of      program cuts of equivalent cost in ``non-mandated'' areas of      regular education.       Higher taxes: Many districts rely on Medicaid      reimbursements to cover personnel costs for their special      education programs. A loss in Medicaid dollars could lead to      deficits in districts that require increases in property      taxes or new levies to cover the costs of the special      education programs.       Job loss: Districts use Medicaid reimbursement to support      the salaries and benefits of the staff performing eligible      services. Sixty-eight percent of districts use Medicaid      funding to pay for direct salaries for health professionals      who provide services for students. Cuts to Medicaid funding      would impact districts' ability to maintain employment for      school nurses, physical and occupational therapists, speech-     language pathologists, school social workers, school      psychologists, and many other critical school personnel who      ensure students with disabilities and those with a variety of      educational needs are able to learn.       Fewer critical supplies: Districts use Medicaid      reimbursement for critical supplies such as wheelchairs,      therapeutic bicycles, hydraulic changing tables, walkers,      weighted vests, lifts, and student-specific items that are      necessary for each child to access curriculum as closely as      possible to their non-disabled peers. Replacing this      equipment would be difficult if not impossible without      Medicaid reimbursements.       Fewer mental health supports: Seven out of ten students      receiving mental health services receive these services at      school. Cuts to Medicaid would further marginalize these      critical services and leave students without access to care.       Noncompliance with IDEA: Given the failure to commit      federal resources to fully fund IDEA, Medicaid reimbursements      serve as a critical funding stream to help schools provide      the specialized instructional supports that students with      disabilities need to be educated alongside their peers.       We urge you to carefully consider the important benefits      that Medicaid provides to our nation's most vulnerable      children. Schools are often the hub of the community, and      converting Medicaid's financing structure to per-capita caps      threatens to significantly reduce access to comprehensive      health and mental and behavioral health care for children      with disabilities and those living in poverty. We look      forward to working with you to avert the harmful and      unnecessary impacts the AHCA would impose on Medicaid, which      has proven to benefit children in a highly effective and      cost-effective manner.

2779,topic-id,997,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi for his remarks about the brave men and women in the Navy and their need for support.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, I rise today to join my Democratic colleagues in speaking out against the dangerous TrumpCare bill which is currently being drafted behind closed doors by our Republican colleagues.  The secrecy around this bill shows that Senate Republicans know they cannot defend it to their constituents. That is why Senate Republicans are refusing to even hold a single hearing on the bill. In my State of New Hampshire, you can't pass a bill if it has not[[Page S3655]]had a hearing, and the Senate here in Washington should work the same way. I continue to urge my colleagues to hold public hearings on this bill so that we can examine the bill for ourselves and get feedback from our constituents and stakeholders.  We do know that this legislation will be very similar to the House TrumpCare bill, which President Trump himself called mean, and calling it mean is even putting it lightly. TrumpCare threatens to have devastating impacts on millions of Today I am going to address three specific ways that TrumpCare is mean to people in New Hampshire and across the First, it undermines the Medicaid Program; second, it hurts our seniors; and third, it continues this administration's efforts to roll back women's access to healthcare.  As Governor, I worked to pass and then reauthorize New Hampshire's bipartisan Medicaid expansion plan that provides coverage now to over 50,000 hard-working Granite And TrumpCare, by proposing to repeal Medicaid expansion, hurts many of the hard-working people who are served now by that expansion program and whose care depends on the expansion program being continued. This includes people like Jo from  I met Jo at a roundtable earlier this year. Jo has a painful, precancerous disease that eats at her abdominal organs. She has had it for most of her life. Prior to the Great Recession, she had a job that provided health insurance and allowed her to get treatment for this chronic health condition. But in 2009 Jo was laid off from her job. Then unable to find reliable, full-time work, she worked several part-time jobs, but they didn't offer health insurance.  In 2012, she desperately needed surgery. She didn't have health insurance. She couldn't get the surgery. Her health declined, the recession continued, and her ability to support herself also declined.  In 2014, after New Hampshire came together and passed its bipartisan Medicaid expansion program, she was able to get healthcare coverage. The Medicaid expansion program helps her get 8 to 12 prescriptions, necessary medical tests, physical therapy, treatment, and specialists. This has also meant that Jo is healthy enough to work again. TrumpCare would end Medicaid expansion, putting people like Jo at risk.  TrumpCare also changes Medicaid into a per-capita cap system. That is a fancy label for massive cuts to the Medicaid Program that would force States to choose between slashing benefits, reducing the number of people who can get care, or both. Under TrumpCare, States will be faced with cutting services that children, people with disabilities, and seniors depend on.  This brings me to the second point I would like to highlight today about this mean bill and whom it impacts. It is clear that TrumpCare would hurt seniors across the Granite The majority of nursing home residents in New Hampshire are served by TrumpCare would jeopardize the ability of seniors to stay in nursing homes. It would also threaten services for seniors who receive at-home care. And these cuts to Medicaid are just one of the ways seniors would be hurt under this mean proposal, because TrumpCare would also create an age tax, letting insurance plans charge older adults five times more than younger people. If you are between the ages of 50 and 64, you will be especially hard hit.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, under TrumpCare, you could face 20 percent higher premiums in 2018, with especially high premium hikes for older And the AARP opposes TrumpCare because it would ``make healthcare less secure and less affordable.''  Finally, my third point is that it is clear that TrumpCare would continue this administration's efforts to roll back women's access to critical healthcare services. To compete economically on a level playing field, women must be able to make their own decisions about if and when to start a family. They should not have to pay more than men for healthcare, and they should be able to visit providers of their own choice who understand their healthcare needs. To fully participate not only in our economy, but also in our democracy, women must be recognized for their capacity to make their own healthcare decisions, just as men are.  Under TrumpCare, if you are a mother, giving birth could now be considered a preexisting condition. TrumpCare would also undermine the requirement that insurance companies have to cover essential health benefits, including maternity care. And TrumpCare's Medicaid cuts would have drastic impacts for women across the country. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Medicaid pays for nearly half of all births in the United States, and it provides healthcare coverage for one in three children across our country.  TrumpCare also defunds Planned Parenthood, which provides critical primary and preventive healthcare services to thousands of New Hampshire women, including preventive care, birth control, and cancer screenings.  My Democratic colleagues and I are ready to work with anyone who is serious about working to build on the Affordable Care Act and lower healthcare costs for hard-working people, but what we do not need is legislation that even the President himself admits is mean.  I will continue working with my colleagues to speak out against and defeat TrumpCare, and I urge the people of New Hampshire and people all across America to keep making their voices heard and make clear that this mean bill is simply unacceptable.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgS3654-3.txt,99999999999999,HARRY W. COLMERY VETERANS EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,20.0,July

2666,topic-id,418,"Mr.Speaker, Republicans now control all of our government. Whatever happens to our healthcare system will be their responsibility, including what has already happened since January with the destabilizing of our insurance markets and health plans announcing rate hikes due to uncertainty.  They will be held accountable for what happens. Today, Americans will have an opportunity to see exactly where their Representatives stand. This vote is a simple one. It votes to kick 24 million Americans off of their health insurance coverage. I don't say that; CBO says that, which is perhaps why we don't have a CBO report on the amendment. It includes 7 million people who are covered through their employers.  It is a vote to make coverage unaffordable for one in four Americans with preexisting conditions and ration care through high-risk pools.  It is a vote to impose an age tax on older Americans, some $1,700 to $14,600. That is quite a hike.  It is a vote to force Americans to pay more for less, to raise premiums 24 to 29 percent, on average, over each of the next 2 years. CBO says that, not me.  And no matter how Republicans try to spin it, healthcare advocates from the AMA to AARP, to everybody that follows, have said that it ends protections for those with preexisting conditions.  I repeat: It ends protections for those with preexisting conditions.  I repeat again: It ends protections for those with preexisting conditions.  It takes away essential health benefits, like doctor visits, emergency room visits, and prescription drugs. So this, Mr.Speaker, will be a very instructive vote. It will show the American people if Republicans stand with those who don't want to lose their coverage, some 55 percent now and 75 percent saying fix it, don't repeal it--or if they stand with a President who wants to claim a victory, but doesn't even seem to know what his own TrumpCare bill says.  I recommend, as a political strategist who is concerned about 2018, that you once again withdraw this bill. Instead, we ought to work together to make sure that the Affordable Care Act works for all Americans, and deliver on the promise that President Trump made--and made from that rostrum--when he said that he wanted ``insurance for everybody;'' not kick 24 million off, ``for everybody;'' not make seniors pay more, ``for everybody;'' not to put Medicaid at risk, ``for everybody'' that is ``far less expensive and far better.''

2670,topic-id,1472,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from SEIU, which states:       This legislation will leave millions without health      insurance, and decimate the Medicare program.                                                         SEIU,                                                      May 2, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of      the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), America's      largest healthcare union, I write to voice strong opposition      to the American Health Care Act (AHCA). New provisions in the      legislation manage to make a bad bill worse. Not only does      the bill cause millions to lose insurance coverage, face      higher costs, and end Medicaid as we know it, but now it also      strips essential protections for those with pre-existing      conditions. The AHCA will leave millions of men, women, and      children without access to high quality, affordable health      care. The AHCA legislation unequivocally jeopardizes working      families' safety, health, and financial security.       The AHCA will leave millions of Americans without health      insurance and therefore without access to healthcare. The      last available estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional      Budget Office (CBO) estimated about 14 million fewer people      will have health insurance in 2018, and by 2026, 24 million      fewer people will have coverage compared to the current      baseline under the Unfortunately, we do not have more up      to date information. Despite the importance that healthcare      plays in the lives of working families, Congressional leaders      have indicated that they intend to hold a vote on the      legislation without knowing its impact.       The AHCA also decimates the Medicaid program, rationing and      endangering healthcare for children, seniors, people with      disabilities, and their families as well as for those who      have gained coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansion.      According to CBO, the legislation will cut federal funding      for Medicaid by $880 billion over ten years. Americans know      that Medicaid is working and realize the key role that the      program plays in helping families afford care--including      nursing home care and home and community-based services for      elderly and disabled individuals. Nearly 1 in 5 Americans are      covered under Medicaid and rely on it to get health services      Under the AHCA, those Americans would lose access to vital      care that may mean the difference between life and death.       Additionally, the AHCA would cap the amount of money states      receive in Medicaid funding from the federal government each      year, regardless of the cost of providing healthcare to those      who qualify. Medicaid is already a lean program especially      when measured on a per capita basis, and cuts from capping      federal funding will quickly force states to cut services,      limit enrollment, and decrease payments to hospitals and      other providers. Also, Medicaid is the largest payer for long      term care in the country. The program pays for more than 60      percent of all nursing home residents and for more than 3.2      million Americans with home- and community-based care, which      allows many older Americans and people with disabilities to      remain in their homes rather than move to a more expensive      institutional setting. States--which must balance budgets and      already face fiscal pressures--will not be able to make up      the lost federal dollars and will be forced to deny care. The      inevitable result will be that the AHCA will make it much      harder and more costly for older Americans, people with      disabilities, and their families to get services they need.       In addition, the legislation will effectively end the      Medicaid expansion, which provides health coverage to      millions of people earning low to moderate incomes. While the      bill purports to allow states to maintain the expansion,      states will only receive an enhanced match, or additional      funding, for people who enroll before 2020 and maintain      continuous coverage. It is widely understood that there is      significant churn on and off the program in this coverage      category, and thus over time the reimbursement rates for      states will drop. The resulting large cost shift to states      may lead them to eliminate coverage for this group      altogether. In fact, seven states have triggers that would      end the Medicaid expansion in their state if federal      reimbursement decreases.       Lastly, Medicaid provider rates are already extremely low      in most states. Cuts to Medicaid, capped funding, and      elimination of the Medicaid expansion would lead to further      reductions in rates for providers, leading to job and other      spending cuts in the health care industry that will have      ripple effects on the broader economy. We have serious      concerns that hospitals, especially those that serve      communities that may not have access to many providers, could      be forced to close or cut back services, further reducing      access to care in underserved areas.       Those who purchase coverage in the individual market do not      fare much better under the proposed bill. The AHCA provides      tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 to individuals to      purchase private insurance--substantially lower than the      ACA's current levels for the majority of those who receive      them. Unlike the ACA, it is unclear that people with access      to employer insurance that is unaffordable or inadequate will      be eligible for credits, which would mean that they will be      left without access to coverage and care. The bill also      creates an age tax on older Americans by letting insurance      companies charge people over 60 as much as five times what      they charge others for the same coverage. CBO found that      under the initial bill introduced, premiums for those between      age 50 and 65 would sky-rocket. Moreover, it is unclear what      coverage will be available on the individual market or if the      current healthcare marketplaces will even still exist under      this scheme. Between premiums and out of pocket costs like      deductibles, especially for those most in need of care due to      pre-existing conditions, illness, or age, the result could be      higher costs for less coverage.       A bad bill has managed to have been made even worse by the      ``MacArthur-Meadows Amendment.'' The amendment guts essential      protections for those with pre-existing conditions. It would      allow states to charge those with pre-existing conditions      higher premiums by allowing states to very easily waive      community rating requirements, which currently prohibits this      practice. Furthermore it would grant states, through a waiver      that is approved by default, the ability to opt out of      essential health benefit requirements, a core set of medical      services, like hospitalizations, mental health, maternity      care and prescription drug coverage, which all insurers are      required to cover under the If states waive      requirements, insurers could leave those who are sick or with      pre-existing conditions out to fend for themselves and face      exorbitant costs to get life-saving care they need. Experts      agree that the funding included in the ``Upton-Long      Amendment'' is completely inadequate to protect those with      pre-existing conditions. The Administration and Congressional      Leaders promised to the American people that those with pre-     existing conditions would remain protected--this bill even      with added amendments defaults on that promise.       Another failure of the AHCA is that it hurts women by      freezing funding to providers like Planned Parenthood,      risking the health and well-being of the 2.5 million people      who rely on the organization for basic care. One in five      women in the United States has visited Planned Parenthood      clinics and for many low-income women of color, including      many of our members, Planned Parenthood is their essential      health provider. For these individuals, healthcare is not an      ideological struggle or about the politics of one policy      versus another; it is a necessity that could mean the      difference between sickness and health.       The real winners of the AHCA appear to be special interests      and the wealthy. The legislation repeals most if not all of      the ACA tax provisions for special interests like the      pharmaceutical and insurance industries, offsetting these      costs with the massive cuts to Medicaid described above. The      bill also maintains the so-called ``Cadillac tax,'' which      places a tax on workers who have robust health coverage,      merely delaying implementation to 2026. Implementation of the      tax will punish people who have decent insurance, and will      encourage employers to further shift health costs to workers.      Furthermore, the incentives for health savings accounts,      which encourage wealthier people to shelter pre-tax income,      are of little use to working households earning low-to      moderate incomes.       The AHCA is not care, it is chaos. The legislation creates      an environment of uncertainty and unaffordability for      Americans and is a bad deal for working families. The bill      radically restructures Medicaid as we know it and cuts      funding for the program significantly, endangers women's      health, and further enriches corporations, special interests,      and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working      families' access to healthcare and financial stability.

Proposed changes to the bill      tinker at the edges without remedying the fundamental failing      of the bill--that millions of Americans will lose their      health insurance as a direct result of this proposal.       ``High-risk pools are not a new idea. Prior to the      enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 35 states operated      high-risk pools, and they were not a panacea for Americans      with pre-existing medical conditions. The history of high-     risk pools demonstrates that Americans with pre-existing      conditions will be stuck in second-class health care      coverage--if they are able to obtain coverage at all.       ``Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance      coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in      many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with      underlying medical conditions vastly more for their      coverage.''       ``America should not go backward to the time when our      fellow citizens with pre-existing health conditions faced      high costs for limited coverage, if they were able to obtain      coverage at all. The AMA urges congressional leaders and the      Administration to pursue a bipartisan dialogue on alternative      policies that provide patients with access and coverage to      high quality care and preserve the safety net for vulnerable      populations.''                     Background on high-risk pools       A January report from the American Academy of Actuaries      notes that ``enrollment has generally been low, coverage has      been limited and expensive, they require external funding,      and they have typically operated at a loss . . . Removing      high-risk individuals from the insured risk pools reduces      costs in the private market only temporarily. Over time, even      lower-cost individuals in the individual market can incur      high health care costs, which would put upward pressure on      premiums.''       According to the Kaiser Family Foundation: State high-risk      pools featured premiums above standard non-group market      rates--with most states capping them at 150%-200% of standard      rates. Many also featured high deductibles, some $5,000 or      more.       Despite the fact that many individuals were forced into      high-risk pools because of a pre-existing condition, nearly      all states excluded coverage for these conditions for 6-12      months.       Almost all high-risk pools imposed lifetime limits on      covered services, and some imposed annual limits.       Some states capped or closed enrollment.       Combined net losses for the state high-risk pools totaled      more than $1.2 billion for 2011, or $5,510 per enrollee, on      average.       Furthermore, a 2010 paper by James Capretta and Tom Miller      that appeared in National Affairs estimated that the cost of      adequately funded high risk pools would be $15 billion to $20      billion per year.

2711,topic-id,622,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in honor of an amazing Idaho family which has taken a horrible personal tragedy and turned it into a cause that will benefit many other families in the years to come. I am referring to the family of Shauna Hill, a 16-year-old girl who lived in Eagle, Idaho, in my district, and who tragically lost her life in 2012.  At the time of her untimely death, Shauna was a junior at Eagle High She was a competitive figure skater and ice dancer and played the violin in her school orchestra. She even performed with the orchestra at New York's Carnegie  She was also working to qualify for a Congressional Silver Medal for public service, personal development, and physical fitness. She aspired to attend Stanford University and become a doctor. Sadly, she lost her life in a car accident on her way home from orchestra practice.  I first met Shauna's parents, Captain Edward Hill and his wife, Heidi, in 2013, when I helped present them with the Congressional Bronze Medal their daughter had earned. While presenting the award, I learned that Captain Hill, who served 28 years as a Navy pilot and flew to protect America during three combat tours, had retired shortly before Shauna's death.  Following the tragedy, Captain Hill was working with the Navy to try to reassign his benefits to his second child, Haley, who was also planning to attend college. With almost 3 decades of distinguished service, Captain Hill qualified for the full utilization of the education benefit, but the Navy said Haley wasn't eligible because education benefits under the GI bill cannot be reassigned.  The Hills asked for my help, and my staff got to work. Unfortunately, we found out that the Navy's hands were tied. Current law does not allow the transfer of education benefits after a servicemember has retired. No waivers are permitted, even in such tragic circumstances.  I promised the Hills that I would seek a legislative solution. In February of this year, I introduced H.1112, the Shauna Hill Post 9/11 Education Benefits Transferability This bill would permit the reassignment of veterans' education benefits in cases where the designated beneficiary passes away.  Losing a child is the worst thing I can imagine, and surely Congress didn't intend to exclude the ability to transfer benefits to a surviving child or spouse.  The bill I introduced would correct this oversight, and it has received support from many veterans' groups. These include: the Concerned Veterans for America, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the Student Veterans of America, AMVETS, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Association of the United States Navy, and the National Military Family  This month, VA Committee Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz included my bill in the bipartisan GI Bill, the Harry Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2017. This bill passed the House last night, and I was proud to join my colleagues in voting for it.  I am grateful to Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for including my bill in their legislation. I am also thankful to Senator Crapo, who has introduced companion legislation in the Now that the House has acted, it is my hope that the Senate will act too and, from there, our bill can be signed into law.

2683,topic-id,1475,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the Service Employees International Union's letter voicing strong opposition to the deadly American Health Care Act for their 2 million Members.[[Page H4158]]                                                         SEIU,                                                      May 2, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of      the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), America's      largest healthcare union, I write to voice strong opposition      to the American Health Care Act (AHCA). New provisions in the      legislation manage to make a bad bill worse. Not only does      the bill cause millions to lose insurance coverage, face      higher costs, and end Medicaid as we know it, but now it also      strips essential protections for those with pre-existing      conditions. The AHCA will leave millions of men, women, and      children without access to high quality, affordable health      care. The AHCA legislation unequivocally jeopardizes working      families' safety, health, and financial security.       The AHCA will leave millions of Americans without health      insurance and therefore without access to healthcare. The      last available estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional      Budget Office (CBO) estimated about 14 million fewer people      will have health insurance in 2018, and by 2026, 24 million      fewer people will have coverage compared to the current      baseline under the Unfortunately, we do not have more up      to date information. Despite the importance that healthcare      plays in the lives of working families, Congressional leaders      have indicated that they intend to hold a vote on the      legislation without knowing its impact.       The AHCA also decimates the Medicaid program, rationing and      endangering healthcare for children, seniors, people with      disabilities, and their families as well as for those who      have gained coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansion.      According to CBO, the legislation will cut federal funding      for Medicaid by $880 billion over ten years. Americans know      that Medicaid is working and realize the key role that the      program plays in helping families afford care--including      nursing home care and home and community-based services for      elderly and disabled individuals. Nearly 1 in 5 Americans are      covered under Medicaid and rely on it to get health services.      Under the AHCA, those Americans would lose access to vital      care that may mean the difference between life and death.       Additionally, the AHCA would cap the amount of money states      receive in Medicaid funding from the federal government each      year, regardless of the cost of providing healthcare to those      who qualify. Medicaid is already a lean program especially      when measured on a per capita basis, and cuts from capping      federal funding will quickly force states to cut services,      limit enrollment, and decrease payments to hospitals and      other providers. Also, Medicaid is the largest payer for long      term care in the country. The program pays for more than 60      percent of all nursing home residents and for more than 3.2      million Americans with home- and community-based care, which      allows many older Americans and people with disabilities to      remain in their homes rather than move to a more expensive      institutional setting. States--which must balance budgets and      already face fiscal pressures--will not be able to make up      the lost federal dollars and will be forced to deny care. The      inevitable result will be that the AHCA will make it much      harder and more costly for older Americans, people with      disabilities, and their families to get services they need.       In addition, the legislation will effectively end the      Medicaid expansion, which provides health coverage to      millions of people earning low to moderate incomes. While the      bill purports to allow states to maintain the expansion,      states will only receive an enhanced match, or additional      funding, for people who enroll before 2020 and maintain      continuous coverage. It is widely understood that there is      significant churn on and off the program in this coverage      category, and thus over time the reimbursement rates for      states will drop. The resulting large cost shift to states      may lead them to eliminate coverage for this group      altogether. In fact, seven states have triggers that would      end the Medicaid expansion in their state if federal      reimbursement decreases.       Lastly, Medicaid provider rates are already extremely low      in most states. Cuts to Medicaid, capped funding, and      elimination of the Medicaid expansion would lead to further      reductions in rates for providers, leading to job and other      spending cuts in the health care industry that will have      ripple effects on the broader economy. We have serious      concerns that hospitals, especially those that serve      communities that may not have access to many providers, could      be forced to close or cut back services, further reducing      access to care in underserved areas.       Those who purchase coverage in the individual market do not      fare much better under the proposed bill. The AHCA provides      tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 to individuals to      purchase private insurance--substantially lower than the      ACA's current levels for the majority of those who receive      them. Unlike the ACA, it is unclear that people with access      to employer insurance that is unaffordable or inadequate will      be eligible for credits, which would mean that they will be      left without access to coverage and care. The bill also      creates an age tax on older Americans by letting insurance      companies charge people over 60 as much as five times what      they charge others for the same coverage. CBO found that      under the initial bill introduced, premiums for those between      age 50 and 65 would sky-rocket. Moreover, it is unclear what      coverage will be available on the individual market or if the      current healthcare marketplaces will even still exist under      this scheme. Between premiums and out of pocket costs like      deductibles, especially for those most in need of care due to      pre-existing conditions, illness, or age, the result could be      higher costs for less coverage.       A bad bill has managed to have been made even worse by the      ``MacArthur-Meadows Amendment.'' The amendment guts essential      protections for those with pre-existing conditions. It would      allow states to charge those with pre-existing conditions      higher premiums by allowing states to very easily waive      community rating requirements, which currently prohibits this      practice. Furthermore it would grant states, through a waiver      that is approved by default, the ability to opt out of      essential health benefit requirements, a core set of medical      services, like hospitalizations, mental health, maternity      care and prescription drug coverage, which all insurers are      required to cover under the If states waive      requirements, insurers could leave those who are sick or with      pre-existing conditions out to fend for themselves and face      exorbitant costs to get life-saving care they need. Experts      agree that the funding included in the ``Upton-Long      Amendment'' is completely inadequate to protect those with      pre-existing conditions. The Administration and Congressional      Leaders promised to the American people that those with pre-     existing conditions would remain protected--this bill even      with added amendments defaults on that promise.       Another failure of the AHCA is that it hurts women by      freezing funding to providers like Planned Parenthood,      risking the health and well-being of the 2.5 million people      who rely on the organization for basic care. One in five      women in the United States has visited Planned Parenthood      clinics and for many low-income women of color, including      many of our members, Planned Parenthood is their essential      health provider. For these individuals, healthcare is not an      ideological struggle or about the politics of one policy      versus another; it is a necessity that could mean the      difference between sickness and health.       The real winners of the AHCA appear to be special interests      and the wealthy. The legislation repeals most if not all of      the ACA tax provisions for special interests like the      pharmaceutical and insurance industries, offsetting these      costs with the massive cuts to Medicaid described above. The      bill also maintains the so-called ``Cadillac tax,'' which      places a tax on workers who have robust health coverage,      merely delaying implementation to 2026. Implementation of the      tax will punish people who have decent insurance, and will      encourage employers to further shift health costs to workers.      Furthermore, the incentives for health savings accounts,      which encourage wealthier people to shelter pre-tax income,      are of little use to working households earning low-to      moderate incomes.       The AHCA is not care, it is chaos. The legislation creates      an environment of uncertainty and unaffordability for      Americans and is a bad deal for working families. The bill      radically restructures Medicaid as we know it and cuts      funding for the program significantly, endangers women's      health, and further enriches corporations, special interests,      and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working      families' access to healthcare and financial stability.

2618,topic-id,309,"Madam Speaker, I appreciate the chairman and his extraordinary leadership on this important topic.  I rise today to urge support for this broad, bipartisan reform package which expands and modernizes the GI Bill to better serve our military families. The bill includes a bipartisan proposal that I have worked on with Congressman Mark Takano of California to help veteran students impacted by school closures, like ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, based in our home States.[[Page H6169]]  When ITT Tech abruptly closed its doors, 40,000 students nationwide, including 7,000 veterans, were left without a degree or path forward.

He told my office: ``To spend 2 years of my life at a place with nothing to show for it is one of the biggest disappointments.''  Jason's story is, sadly, one of thousands. It is not fair to these veterans that they would lose their GI benefits through no fault of their own, and if we really care, we need to do something about it.  The Takano-Messer proposal restores GI Bill benefits to veterans who were attending ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges when they closed so they can earn their degrees elsewhere. It also helps veterans who may be impacted by a school closure in the future.  Our military men and women count on their GI Bill benefits to build a career and a life after they have served our country. This bill will make sure they get a chance.

2707,topic-id,872,"Mr.Speaker, the Republicans have rushed this bill to the floor before they even had a chance to print the text, let alone get a CBO score. They are pushing this bill through without any analysis so that the American people won't know how terrible this bill really is--how many millions of people will lose their health insurance, how much premiums will skyrocket for those with pre-existing conditions, how little money they will actually save. And all to score empty political points or to impress Donald Trump, a man who has demonstrated again and again that he does not know or care what is in this bill, and just wants to ``win.''  This bill is the same terrible legislation the Republicans failed to pass in March, but with amendments to make it even more cruel to the American people. The bill will kick 24 million people off their health insurance and eliminate employer-provided coverage for seven million people. The bill creates an ``age tax'' that would allow insurers to charge older Americans five times as much as a younger person for the same plan. The bill raises premiums 30 percent for people who allow their insurance to lapse for any reason. The bill cuts $880 billion out of Medicad and forces states to ration care to the millions of families and children who rely on it, in clear violation of Donald Trump's campaign pledge. The bill gives the wealthiest Americans a trillion dollar tax cut and cuts taxes on drug companies and health insurance companies that pay their CEOs more than $500,000.  But that bill wasn't terrible enough to get the votes of the right wing of the Republicans in the House, so the Republicans made it even crueler. The amendments the Republicans will add today allow states to waive the essential health benefits requirements for insurance plans, meaning you could lose coverage for services as basic as hospital stays, prescription drugs, or doctor visits. States will also be able to waive the guarantee against discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. Of course, the Republicans are saying that insurance companies cannot deny people coverage, but insurers will be able to charge people whatever they want. The Center for American Progress estimates that premiums could increase by over $36,000 per year for people diagnosed with breast cancer. Pregnancy will result in a $17,000 increase in premiums. Asthma, a $4,000 increase. The high risk pools Republicans are touting will do nothing to protect people by sequestering the sickest Americans in pools and then drastically underfunding them. The Republicans are hiding from these numbers behind the so-called Upton Amendment, which provides a paltry $8 billion to cover some extra costs for those with pre-existing conditions. But even the conservative Mercatus Foundation found that to be less than a pittance compared with the skyrocketing costs for those who need it.  Every day, we are finding new egregious consequences of this legislation. Last night, the New York Times reported that passing this bill will cut special education programs to over 2500 students with disabilities. Yesterday, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities reported that the tax credits Republicans are proposing in this bill will be totally unusable in states like California and New York because of state laws that require coverage of abortion. Reports have come out that sexual assault and domestic violence would, once again, be considered a pre-existing condition, making insurance unaffordable for survivors. The Wall Street Journal reported that the bill could allow employers to reinstate lifetime caps and eliminate out-of-pocket caps for their employees' insurance plans, leaving the 159 million Americans who get insurance through their employer with no insurance coverage when they need it most. That's right--if you think that because you don't buy insurance on the exchange and therefore don't have to worry about this bill, you're wrong. I have no doubt that in the time it takes to read this statement another round of articles and reports will come out finding even more abhorrent consequences of this contemptible piece of legislation.  So I ask my Republican colleagues--who are you passing this bill for? Are you so out of touch with the lives of real Americans that you no longer understand what it means to struggle to pay your medical bills? Have you traveled so far from the values you claim to uphold that you are willing to force parents to watch their children die of curable diseases because they have reached the lifetime cap on covered costs that your bill reinstates, and they can no longer afford to pay for treatment? Are you willing to gamble away their lives and the lives of their children just to say you passed a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act?  Shame on any member who votes for this cowardly, cruel bill and tries to sell this bill to their constituents as a win for the American people. Shame on this House for even considering a bill that could leave the most vulnerable in our country--children born with disabilities, women fleeing domestic violence, older Americans too sick to buy insurance but too young to enroll in Medicare--at the mercy of insurance companies and fate.

But now it is back worse than ever. So bad, it might actually pass.  I don't have a lot of time to explain, but let me tell you two groups that are really going to say thank you: it is the billionaires and it is the undertakers.  This bill will make health care more unaffordable and cause preventable deaths. Meanwhile, it gives $600 billion--excuse me--$800 billion to the wealthy, to the billionaires. TrumpCare brings us higher costs, less coverage, guts the benefits, has a crushing age tax, and steals from In my district alone, 43,000 people will lose coverage. 9,000 of those are children. The elderly, Medicaid will be lost, close to 2,000.  There is a reason they are trying to jam this down our throats. There is no CBO score because they don't want to hear a score.

2701,topic-id,5597,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him, Congressman Scott, I thank Frank Pallone, John Yarmuth, Ritchie Neal, our ranking members, who have done such excellent work on this debate on the values of our country.  Mr.Speaker, our colleague, Mr.Clyburn, began his remarks quoting Reverend Martin Luther King, and I want to join him. I think those words bear repeating. Over 50 years ago, King said: ``Of all of the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and the most inhumane because it often results in physical death.''  We come to the floor with the moral force of Martin Luther King's words in our hearts: Affordable health care is a civil right, a fundamental right for every person in our country, not just the privileged few.  And so, in the spirit of Mr.Clyburn and King, let us be prayerful about how we go forward on this very personal issue about the well-being of every person in our country.  Speaker Ryan once called this bill an act of mercy. There is no mercy here. Indeed, inequality and inhumanity is exactly what TrumpCare has in store for the American people. But when he said it is an act of mercy, here is what others said.  From the beginning, TrumpCare was a moral monstrosity that will devastate seniors, children, and hardworking That was from me. But don't take it from me.  Sister Simone Campbell said: This is not the faithful way forward and must be rejected.  The Catholic Health Association wrote: We strongly encourage the full House to reject this replacement bill.  And the United Methodist Church, opposing TrumpCare, this is what they said: People will die because of efforts like this to roll back health care.  Lutheran Services in America said: TrumpCare will jeopardize the health care and long-term services and supports of millions of  The Episcopal Church said: TrumpCare falls woefully short of our spiritual calling to care for the least of these, as well as the noble values upon which our great Nation was founded.  And all that was said before the Republicans decided to destroy the protections of Americans with preexisting conditions.  I grant our Republican friends their position. I respect them and their constituents who sent them here. But I reject the wrong priorities in TrumpCare--tax cuts for the rich at the expense of the health insurance for tens of millions of working families across  TrumpCare very clearly spotlights the differences in priorities between Democrats and Republicans in It has stepped forward in the longstanding Republican belief that Medicare should wither on the vine, that Medicaid should be shrunken, and that Social Security should be privatized.  If you believe in the health and well-being of the American people, you must reject this bill before us now. It is what TrumpCare--here is what it means to the American people. You know, much has been said about policy here today and over time. Much has been said about politics, what are the politics of this.  What is really important is what this means to the American people. And they know they are listening. They know what it means to them.  It means, TrumpCare does, it forces families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, increasing out-of-pocket costs. Higher costs.  Less coverage. TrumpCare will take away health care from more than 24 million hardworking  A crushing age tax. TrumpCare forces Americans aged 50 to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are.  It steals from TrumpCare shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund and ransacks funds that seniors depend on to get long-term care they need. That is why it is consistent with their wither on the vine for Medicare philosophy.  And then, if that were not bad enough, and they couldn't pass their bill because it was that bad, they moved further away from the American people by gutting key protections. TrumpCare eviscerates essential health benefits such as maternity care, prescription drugs, emergency coverage, prenatal care, and guts protections for Americans with preexisting medical conditions.  As bad as TrumpCare was the first time around, you know, it was dead. It died. It died right here on the floor. Now it has come back to life like a zombie, even more scary than before, and it is even worse.  If Republicans had their way, Americans with preexisting conditions will be pushed off their insurance and segregated into high-risk pools, where they will face soaring costs, worse coverage, and restricted care.  TrumpCare means huge premium increases. It is a frightening future for families who need affordable, dependable care the most.  Now, on the floor, the Republicans have recklessly, and some would say fraudulently, claimed that TrumpCare covers Americans with preexisting conditions. It does not.  As Robert Graboyes at the conservative Mercatus Center said about the Upton amendment: ``. . . the $8 billion amount is a pittance. Spread over 5 years, it is a fifth of a pittance.''  As Karen Pollitz from the Kaiser Family Foundation said, the Upton[[Page H4165]]amendment will cover the costs for only 1 percent of the individual market. Others have given it up to 5 percent; 1 to 5 percent. Does that mean covering?  Forcing a vote without a CBO score shows that the Republicans are afraid of the facts. They are afraid of learning the full consequences of their plan to push Americans with preexisting conditions into the cold or, as my colleague from New York said, off the sidewalk.  If Republicans thought they were really protecting people, they wouldn't be afraid of the facts. But they are also afraid of the truth, and the truth that would come forth if we knew the facts. And they are afraid that the American people would find out that this is not a healthcare bill, this is a tax bill disguised as a health bill.  This is a bill that is one of the biggest transfers of wealth from the middle class to the richest people and corporations in This is a tax bill not a healthcare bill. That is why they have to do it now so they can get on with their tax bill.  But the suffering TrumpCare will inflict on the sick is all too clear. That is why this disastrous bill has been condemned by the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, AIDS United, the Children's Hospital Association, AARP, the March of The list goes on and on--the American Cancer  Instead of reading all of these pages, I include them for the       Trumpcare--pulled from the House Floor by Speaker Paul Ryan      on March 24--already meant higher health costs, more than 24      million Americans losing their health coverage, gutting key      protections, a crushing Age Tax, and stealing from       Amazingly, Republicans have managed to make Trumpcare even      worse. The MacArthur Amendment would completely gut the      protections for people with pre-existing conditions by      allowing states to waive essential health benefits and      community rating rules, which prevent insurers from charging      people with pre-existing conditions more. This will make it      all but impossible for millions of Americans fighting illness      to afford the coverage they desperately need.       As seen below, over the last few days, the number of health      care, consumer, seniors, children, disability and other      groups that are speaking out against Trumpcare continues to      grow.       A Coalition of Patient Advocacy Groups, Including American      Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Lung      Association, American Diabetes Association, and March of      Dimes: ``In March, our patient advocacy organizations      collectively urged Congress to ensure that any changes made      to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)      provide affordable, accessible and adequate coverage and do      not result in a loss of coverage for any The AHCA      would do the opposite, causing at least 24 million Americans      to lose health insurance, according to the non-partisan      Congressional Budget . . . We are alarmed by recent      harmful changes to AHCA . . . These changes include allowing      states to waive the requirement for essential health benefits      . . . Another change allows states to waive protections      against health status rating. Weakening these rules would      enable insurers to charge higher prices to people with pre-     existing conditions, possibly making insurance unaffordable      for those who need it most. . . . The individuals and      families we represent cannot go back to a time when people      with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage or      forced to choose between purchasing basic necessities and      affording their health care coverage. Given these factors, we      oppose the latest draft of the We urge Members of      Congress to reject this legislation.'' [5/1/17]       American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of      Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and      Gynecologists, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in      Women's Health, National Partnership for Women & Families:      ``Rather than support recent gains in women's access to      healthcare and coverage, the MacArthur Amendment and AHCA      turn back the clock and reverse hard-won progress. . . . The      MacArthur Amendment would enable states to waive EHBs      including those for maternity and newborn care, preventive      services, and services for mental health and substance use      disorders; [and] to waive community rating rules. . . .      Supporters of the bill claim this bill maintains protections      for those with preexisting conditions, but allowing states to      waive coverage of EHB and charge people more based on their      health status renders the promise of coverage for preexisting      conditions to be meaningless. . . .  Women and families must      not be made to suffer, lose access to care and coverage, and      pay higher healthcare costs. . . . The AHCA and the MacArthur      Amendment turn the clock back on women's health and should      not move forward.'' [5/1/17]       Association of American Medical Colleges: ``This week, the      House could vote on a new version of the American Health Care      Act that includes the MacArthur amendment. . . . The      [MacArthur] amendment's treatment of essential health      benefits and health status underwriting dilutes protections      for many Americans and would leave individuals with      preexisting conditions facing higher premiums and reduced      access to care. The shortcomings in the underlying bill      remain the same. The original analysis from the Congressional      Budget Office indicated that 14 million Americans would lose      their health insurance coverage as early as next year, and as      many as 24 million by 2024. Nothing in the bill has changed      that alters the fact that this legislation would lead to      fewer Americans with quality insurance, less affordable      coverage for those who have it, and the destabilization of      the current Medicaid program.'' [5/2/17]       Children's Hospital Association: ``On behalf of our      nation's children's hospitals and the patients and families      they serve, Children's Hospital Association (CHA) continues      to oppose the newly modified American Health Care Act (AHCA)      and strongly urges the House of Representatives to reject the      bill. Recently adopted changes only worsen the AHCA by      putting children with preexisting conditions at increased      risk of losing health care coverage and failing to correct      the Medicaid cuts that would impact over 30 million kids. . .      . The block grant option in particular would be devastating      to children as it eliminates Medicaid's EPSDT (Early and      Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment) benefit which      ensures children receive immunizations, mental health      assessments and vision, eye and hearing exams as well as      other medical services they might need. CHA urgently asks      members of Congress to vote against the AHCA.'' [4/27/17]       Children's Leadership Council: ``The Children's Leadership      Council opposes the American Health Care Act (AHCA) because      it would jeopardize health care for millions of babies,      children, youth and families. We urge you to vote NO on this      legislation. . . . The ACHA's changes to Medicaid would      radically restructure a program that has worked for more than      50 years to support children's health. The Medicaid cap would      shift $839 billion to states, forcing them to cut      eligibility, benefits, or provider rates that could have      disastrous health consequences. There is no question that the      massive cuts to Medicaid, increased premiums likely for      millions of families, and eliminating the Essential Health      Benefits requirements under current law will seriously harm      children and families. . . . This legislation is a dangerous      step backward.'' [5/1/17]       Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities: ``The Consortium      for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is strongly opposed to      the amended American Health Care The amended American      Health Care Act retains the original bill's proposals to      dramatically cut Medicaid services that are vital to people      with disabilities and seniors through per capita caps, which      CCD has opposed. . . . The newest amendments to the American      Health Care Act make the bill even more harmful to people      with disabilities. The new amendments would allow states to      easily obtain waivers that would allow them to charge higher      premiums to people with pre-existing conditions, including      people with disabilities. They would also allow states to      seek waivers from the Affordable Care Act's requirement to      provide essential health benefits, including services for      people with disabilities . . . We urge you to oppose the bill      should it come to a vote.'' [4/28/17]       National Education Association: ``Apparently, snatching      health care coverage from children and families was not      enough for House Republican leaders and the Trump      administration. To make a terrible bill even worse, a new      amendment to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) would allow      states to jettison existing essential health benefit      requirements and permit insurance companies to charge people      with pre-existing conditions more than they charge healthy      people. . . . If the AHCA and new amendment are enacted,      millions of kids and families would effectively lose the      health care coverage they need. The new amendment also      threatens to make insurance for people with pre-existing      conditions prohibitively expensive.'' [4/27/17]       American Society of Clinical Oncology: ``On behalf of the      American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), I write to      express our strong opposition to the American Health Care Act      (AHCA), as currently amended. . . . Studies show that when      cancer patients do not have adequate insurance they receive      less care, receive it later, and have worse outcomes than      those with better insurance coverage. . . . The AHCA as      currently constructed will create or worsen barriers to care.

Members of the ATS serve a large      and diverse patient population, including patients with      respiratory diseases, critical illnesses and sleep disorders      such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, sepsis and obstructive sleep      apnea. Our patients cannot afford to lose affordable health      insurance coverage for any period of time.'' [4/27/17]       Lutheran Services in America: ``Lutheran Services in      America continues to oppose the drastic and unnecessary      restructure of the Medicaid guarantee to a per capita cap      system as proposed in the American Health Care Act (AHCA).      Furthermore, we oppose the bill's new provisions that      eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions      as these provisions would be devastating to people with      chronic diseases and disabilities. . . . In addition, the      modified bill maintains the AHCA's drastic cuts and      fundamental restructuring of the Medicaid program, shifting      significant risks and costs to states, and to the people who      need and provide Medicaid services. . . . Lutheran Services      in America respectfully urges members of Congress to reject      this or any legislation that would erode Medicaid, increase      the number of uninsured and/or decrease protections for      preexisting conditions.''

It      eliminates the community rating provision, allowing insurers      to charge people with pre-existing conditions an exorbitant      amount for coverage. Despite the fact that the proposal      claims to maintain the current prohibition on gender rating,      it still allows insurers to once again discriminate against      women and charge more for being a woman. Eliminating the      community rating provision disproportionately affects women,      since insurers can claim having given birth, having had a C-     section, or having been a survivor of domestic violence is a      so-called pre-existing condition. For example, a woman who      had breast cancer could be charged more than $28,000 per year      for coverage and a woman who was previously pregnant could be      charged more than $17,000 per year for . . .

The newly-revised AHCA      language will end this guarantee and radically turn back the      clock on the progress made in women's health. Specifically,      the ``MacArthur Amendment'' would enable states to apply for      the ability to waive EHBs, including those for maternity and      newborn care, to waive community rating rules, and to shift      patient with preexisting conditions or illnesses into high-     risk pools.

The current ban on health status      underwriting protects individuals from being discriminated      against by virtue of their medical conditions.

The only fresh idea in this      proposal is a new way to raise insurance rates on sick      people. States are happy to work with the federal government      on strengthening health care, but we never asked for the      flexibility to jack up premiums on people with pre-existing      conditions.

Thanks to current      law, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and the      Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 95% of young      children in the U.today have health insurance. That's a      remarkable achievement. However, the AHCA will result in 24      million fewer Americans having coverage, including millions      of children. Even with changes recently suggested to your      bill, America's kids will be best served by strengthening the      Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid and CHIP, not by      repealing the Affordable Care Act and block granting or      establishing a per capita cap on We urge you to      keep our children's future foremost in your thinking,      withdraw your bill, and work on a bipartisan basis to support      measures that protect and strengthen children's health      care.''

For these reasons, along with our previously      stated concerns about the AHCA, we cannot support the bill.      The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen      the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at      greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health      benefit standards, which could leave patients without access      to critical health services and increase out-of-pocket      spending. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has      not yet scored the amendment. However, CBO previously      projected that the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer      people covered in 2026. As the backbone of America's health      safety-net, hospitals and health systems must protect access      to care for those who need it and ensure that the most      vulnerable patients are not left behind.

2702,topic-id,788,"Mr.Speaker, under TrumpCare, families, seniors, vulnerable children, Americans with disabilities, people struggling to overcome addiction, and the sick will lose their health care. Rural hospitals will be closed. Nearly 2 million jobs will be destroyed across Seven million veterans will lose access to tax credits for health care.  And all of this, to give a massive tax cut to the richest in TrumpCare is a billionaire's tax cut, again, disguised as a healthcare bill. It is Robin Hood in reverse, one of the largest, again, transfers of wealth from working families to the rich in our country.  Today, we honor the visions of our Founders, we can, who risked everything. They risked everything, their lives, their liberty, their sacred honor, to advance the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the life, a healthier life, the freedom to pursue your happiness, the freedom from being job-locked or policy-locked because of what the Republicans want to do today.  Today, we fight to preserve affordable health care as the right of every American, again, not the privileged few.  Today, we fight for children like Zoe Madison Zoe was born with a congenital heart defect in May of 2010. She faced her first of three heart surgeries at 15 hours old. By 6 months old, Zoe was halfway to her lifetime limit her insurer had placed on her. She[[Page H4168]]faced a grim future, not only using up her lifetime limit by preschool but by carrying a preexisting condition that will require attention and care for the rest of her life.  Under the Affordable Care Act, Zoe is protected, but TrumpCare puts her future in danger.  I wish that our Members who vote for this bill, I hope you make time to sit down with the parents of a newborn with a heart condition, or a young woman who just learned she had breast cancer, the family of loved ones struggling with a disease or a chronic condition, any of the tens of millions of Americans who are rightfully terrified of what TrumpCare will mean in their lives.  Mr.Speaker, we have, with this bill, a right, a wonderful opportunity. This is one of the best civics lessons we can engage in. Because of what happened following the election, the American people are engaged. They are paying attention. I am not saying in a political way, I am saying in a personal way.  A former Speaker said: All politics is local. In the case of health care, all politics is personal when it comes to health care. And so, this civics lesson will teach the American people a number of things.  As special as we think we are when we come to the floor here, most Americans don't know who their Member of Congress is. But they will now, when they find out that you voted to take away their health care. They will know when you put an age tax on them, or undermine Medicare and Medicaid and the rest.  Oh, yeah, they are paying attention because it is really personal with them and their families. So I think we have to get ready for that.  I have Members, I have colleagues who have the mantle of being a moderate. You vote for this bill, you have walked the plank from moderate to radical. And you are walking the plank for what? A bill that will not be accepted by the United States Why are you doing this?  Do you believe in what is in this bill?  Some of you have said: Well, they will fix it in the But you have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead. You will glow in the dark on this one. You will glow in the dark. So don't walk the plank, especially unnecessarily.  Our responsibility to the sick and the hurt is It is fundamental to who we are.  As Pope Francis said: ``Health is not a consumer good but a universal right, so access to health services cannot be a privilege.''  Today, let us declare, once again, that affordable health care must be the right of every American, not the privileged few.  So I ask you, my colleagues, does TrumpCare lower health costs?  Does TrumpCare provide better health care?  Does TrumpCare protect seniors and families?  Is TrumpCare good for our veterans?  Is there any caring in TrumpCare at all?

Throughout 150 years of change and growth, the city remains anchored in that local spirit.  The area was first inhabited by French fur trappers and hunters. Among those was an explorer named Pierre Yax, the son of the first German resident of Yax secured a land grant from President John Quincy Adams in 1826, in what was then the Michigan As other French settlers followed, long farms were established, stretching from the rivers outward.

Mr.Ashley was a local businessman and would name the area the Village of This name would remain until 1867 when the village was officially incorporated as New New Baltimore would stay a village until it became a city in 1931.  In its early days, New Baltimore was linked to the regional economy through its position along waterways. It operated as a small port, bringing agriculture and manufactured goods to the surrounding communities. The area became known for the manufacturing of barrels, brooms, bricks, coffins, corsets, and creamery products.  As shipping methods changed and automobile transportation increased, so too did the role of New The city began transitioning to a resort and commercial area. New attractions were built, including an opera house, hotels, saloons, a brewery, and other leisure and resort attractions. With the construction of a locomotive line between port Huron and Detroit in the 1800s, New Baltimore became a hub of activity well into the 20th century.  Today New Baltimore is a vibrant community covering nearly 7 square miles. Residents take pride in their excellent schools, including a high school, two middle schools, seven elementary schools, two early childhood centers, and an alternative education program. The resort industry continues to flourish with events such as the annual Bay-Rama Fish Fly Festival, which attracts thousands of people each year. The city's public park and beaches also provide opportunity for numerous recreational activities.  The city of New Baltimore has a proud history, vibrant present, and bright future. As New Baltimore celebrates this milestone, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating its residents, elected officials, and businesses as they celebrate their history.

2748,topic-id,2090,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Over the last several months, I have heard from thousands of my constituents over the phone, by email, and record numbers at townhalls. Frankly, the overwhelming message is frustration with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress--no calls to pass this bill, which every group that advocates for workers' rights and unions opposes. The people in my district say that, to the contrary, Republicans continue to put the priorities of the few over the priorities of hardworking  People are frustrated that, instead of working with Democrats, Republicans are focused on gutting healthcare coverage, increasing premiums, and stripping away workers' rights. People in my district, across my State, and across the country are worried. The members of our immigrant community--our neighbors, family, and friends--will continue to be demonized by the President of the United So while I don't expect this kind of rhetoric or policies to change overnight, I feel it is important to share these concerns with this body.  Now, earlier this week, frankly, I was encouraged. There were some signs of positivity. Congressional Democrats and Republicans announced a bipartisan funding bill through the end of the year that shows a bright spot of what we can do together when we try. I hope we can all agree that a government shutdown would be catastrophic. In my district alone, I am reminded of the devastating impact of congressional inaction when I hosted a townhall in Estes Park just last week. The government shutdown in 2013, right during tourist season, cost our small and vibrant town nearly half a million dollars in tax revenue and millions of dollars in sales, threatening the existence of many Main Street businesses that rely on that tourism revenue and keeping Rocky Mountain National Park open. Estes Park sits at the entrance of Rocky Mountain National Park, and Rocky Mountain National Park was closed for most of the 16-day shutdown a few years ago.  But somehow, despite those obvious economic indicators in jobs, Donald Trump tweeted just this morning that our country ``needs a good shutdown.''  What does that even mean?  We need a good shutdown like we need a root canal. It would put people in my district out of work and cost the private sector millions of jobs.  But I am hopeful now that we will avoid a shutdown; that, thankfully, the spending bill, through 2017, prohibits funding on a new border wall. It minimizes cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, allowing them to continue their work to keep our air and our water clean; and Planned Parenthood will continue to receive Federal funding.  Now, that being said, of course, that budget isn't perfect, and we will have the chance to debate it on the floor. The Republicans insist on massive government deficit spending for increased military spending that digs our mountain of debt for the next generation even bigger. The tax-and-spend Republicans continue to spend hand over fist and increase the deficit at the cost of the next generation of  Now, the bill before us, the Working Families Flexibility Act, is another example of Republicans putting ideology and special interests over the needs of workers and American families. The trend isn't new. It comes out of the typical playbook we have seen for decades.  In fact, this very bill has been introduced multiple times over the past 22 years, never with any success. Nearly identical bills were introduced in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2015, and now 2017. That is 10 times over 22 years. Each time, the bill never becomes law, and it won't become law now either. But that is how the Republicans want to spend their time in this body when we actually have important things to discuss that could become law, like fixing our broken immigration system.  This bill somehow claims to provide employees with more flexibility, but the only flexibility are for the bosses. Instead of receiving overtime, workers would receive comp time; so their paychecks won't get anything out of extra time worked. It is important to note that this legislation applies to the private sector and only to employees subject to overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards The current overtime threshold is set at just under $24,000, so only employees that make less than $24,000 are affected by this bill. We have tried mightily to increase that threshold to keep up with inflation, but we have met resistance by the Republicans every step of the way.  In 2017, the Federal poverty level for a family of four is about $24,000. So we are talking about only giving overtime to families that are below the poverty level. These families rely on that overtime to pay their bills, to pay their rent, and to put food on the table. These are the families who would benefit most from receiving overtime pay. In fact, a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute showed that 40 percent of people making less than $22,500 a year worked some overtime hours and needed that income to get by. This same 40 percent are the very people[[Page H3015]]who would lose out under the Republican bill today.  My Republican colleagues claim that no one is forcing workers to accept comp time instead of overtime pay, and comp time is technically optional. But this argument represents how out of touch Republicans are with the real-life workforce conditions and actual working families.  In practice, the power differential between employers and employees means that many employees would feel obligated to accept comp time instead of overtime pay, even if that is not what works best for them. Especially in nonunion workplaces, employees could feel pressure to go along with their employers' demand or risk not even being offered overtime or comp time in the future.  Now, Republicans have also made the argument that public sector workers receive comp time. They are right. But that is not apples to apples. Public sector union membership is around 34 percent, and public sector employees have vast protections that private sector employees lack. As an example, public sector workers can't be fired except for good cause, and they have administrative appeal rights. They can't be discriminated against based on their desire to take overtime pay instead of comp time. Nonunionized private sector workers can be legally discriminated against in assigning their hours based on their decisions to take comp time versus overtime pay.  If the Republicans want to enlarge this discussion to include providing additional workplace protections to workers in the private sector, we are happy to have that discussion both on the committee where I serve with my colleague, Mr.Byrne, as well as on the floor of the  Republicans somehow argue that this bill provides flexibility for workers to get time off, but I will remind my colleagues that nothing in the current Fair Labor Standards Act prevents employers from offering time off right now. In fact, the Fair Labor Standards Act allows the ultimate flexibility. Employers can already provide paid or unpaid leave on sick days, maternity, and paternity under the They don't need this legislation to provide them flexibility. They just need to do the right thing.  This bill also ignores the fact that not all businesses are successful. Before coming to Congress, I started several businesses. I know this firsthand. A statistic is that 59 percent of restaurant businesses go out of business within 3 years. I am zero for two. I tried starting two restaurants. They both failed. Maybe that means if I try again someday, I will be finally due for a success.  But what is important is that when something goes out of business, we don't leave the employees in the lurch. What you are effectively doing here by deferring the overtime pay into potential future time off, if the company goes out of business, that employee would have to get in line with other creditors and risk never being paid. That is not a theoretical risk. The majority of new businesses don't last 10 years. They go out of business. Depriving people of the payment for the work they have done already is not the right way to treat workers in those businesses, and it is not their fault when the bad decision is made by their bosses.  In our committee markup of the bill, my Democratic colleagues offered a number of amendments to improve the legislation. Representative Bonamici offered an amendment that would allow comp time to earn interest before workers' use. Under the current way this bill is written, low-wage workers are being asked to give an interest-free loan to the company. That doesn't make sense. The amendment didn't pass. If employees receive overtime pay, they should receive interest on it as well.  Representative Wilson offered an amendment that would exempt workers who are earning less than 2\1/2\ times the minimum wage, so the employees earning the very least wouldn't be subject to the law and could actually rely on their overtime pay. Again, that amendment was rejected by  Representative Blunt Rochester on the committee offered an amendment that would limit the bill so only workers eligible for at least 7 days of paid sick leave receive comp time. Yet, again, Republicans rejected this amendment.  In total, committee Democrats offered eight amendments to try to improve this bill. Every single one was rejected.  Instead of bringing forward the same, tired, 22-year-old policies that I certainly don't hear my constituents requesting, Democrats have offered real solutions that benefit working families. Working families would benefit from an increase in the overtime salary threshold. Last year, the Department of Labor proposed an increase to that threshold, and 248,000 workers in Colorado alone would have benefited under that rule.  Democrats continue to write bills that provide commonsense solutions. We have offered legislation that would provide up to 12 weeks of partial-paid parental leave. Only 14 percent of the workforce has paid family leave through their employers. As a parent of a 5- and a 2-year-old, I know how important that is to be able to spend time with your newborn kids.  Democrats have also introduced a bill that would allow employees to earn up to 7 sick days per year. That would be a tremendous help to the 4 in 10 private sector employees who don't have access to any paid sick leave at all under current law.  Democrats have also offered legislation to combat pay discrimination. In 2017, women working full time are still paid 80 cents on the dollar compared to what men make. Democrats have offered legislation that I am proud to cosponsor that would address that kind of pay disparity. Those are the kinds of bills that the American people need, that workers need, and that we need to help lift people out of poverty and into the middle class.  Today, House Democrats introduced the Equality I was proud to join so many of my colleagues in a bipartisan bill to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Sadly, in many States, it is still legal to fire someone just because they are gay. The Equality Act would finally extend Federal workplace discrimination protections to LGBT Americans in all 50 States and the territories.  Finally, House Democrats will soon be introducing the bill that would raise the minimum wage. In my home State of Colorado, voters chose to raise the wage last November, and many other States have minimum wages higher than the Federal minimum wage. But it shouldn't come down to what State you live in to determine if you even earn enough to put food on the table and pay your rent. It is long past time we update the Federal minimum wage, and the Raise the Wage Act would do just that.  Yet, again, we are offering many solutions that we would love to discuss and love to vote on, and, instead, the Republicans are offering a bill to strip existing rights away from workers.  Mr.Speaker, the bill before us represents the same old policies the Republicans have offered for decades. They have never succeeded, and they won't succeed now. This time around, they are offering a bill that might be great for some of the bosses, but it undermines the lives of hardworking Americans that keep our country going.  Mr.Speaker, I oppose the Working Families Flexibility Act and the rule before us, and I reserve the balance of my time.

2753,topic-id,654,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration Policy from President William Jefferson Clinton from 1997, in which President Clinton lays out the criteria, by and large, which is still the criteria under which Democrats would support a comp time flexibility bill, had the Republicans been at all serious about actually passing one into law rather than just passing a symbolic bill that they have passed for 22 years.   [From the American Presidency Project, John Woolley & Gerhard                        Peters, Santa Barbara, CA]William Clinton: Statement of Administration Policy: H.1--Working             Families Flexibility Act of 1997, March 19, 1997                (House) (Ballenger (R) NC and 99 others)       The President will veto H.1 if it is passed in its      current form. The President will not sign H.1, or any      other comp time legislation, unless it adheres to three      fundamental principles: (1) real choice for workers; (2) real      protection against employer abuse; and (3) preservation of      workers' rights.       H.1 purports to give working families greater      flexibility. In reality, it grants employers more rights at      the expense of working people:       H.1 fails to offer workers real choice. In particular,      H.1 would allow an employer to decide when a worker could      use his or her compensatory time-off by disapproving such      time-off if the employer claims it would ``unduly disrupt''      its operations. In addition, H.1 would permit an employer      to ``cash out'' a worker's earned compensatory time over 80      hours.       H.1 fails to protect workers against employer abuse. For      example, H.1 offers inadequate protections for vulnerable      workers and part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees,      including garment and construction workers, and those who are      employed in industries with histories of Fair Labor Standards      Act violations. H.1 also fails to prohibit employers from      substituting compensatory time-off for paid vacation or sick      leave benefits. Furthermore, H.1 lacks meaningful remedies      for workers when employers penalize them for electing to      receive overtime pay in lieu of compensatory time-off. In      addition, H.1 contains inadequate worker safeguards in      cases where an employer goes bankrupt or out-of-business.       H.1 fails to preserve workers' rights. Workers who take      compensatory time-off[[Page H3017]]     can be forced to work additional overtime in the same week--     even on the weekend--without being paid overtime premium pay.       The Administration supports the substitute amendment to be      offered by Representative George Miller, although procedural      obstacles in the House have prevented the amendment from      addressing all of the important issues that need to be      treated, including expansion of Family and Medical Leave Act      (FMLA). The Administration strongly believes that any      legislation to authorize compensatory time under the Fair      Labor Standards Act should be linked to expansion of the      Expanding the FMLA to give working families greater      flexibility to foster the education of their children or      provide routine health care for their children or elderly      relatives will go a long way toward achieving the stated      goals of H.1.       The Miller amendment, however, would ensure real employee      choice, by adding crucial provisions not found in H.1. For      example, employers that adopt comp time programs would have      to make comp time available to similarly-situated employees      on a fair and non-discriminatory basis. Working families are      guaranteed real protection against possible comp time abuse      through the Miller amendment.       Furthermore, the Miller amendment would preclude employers      from using comp time to modify or reduce existing paid leave      plans. It would entitle employees choosing comp time to get      regular statements of their accrual and use of comp time; put      a reasonable limit on the number of hours of comp time that      can be accrued; and allow employees to seek damages when they      incur costs because an employer wrongfully denies them use of      the comp time they earned. The Secretary of Labor would have      the authority to bar employers with a pattern and practice of      comp time abuse from continuing to offer comp time. H.1      has none of these protections. These are all improvements to      H.1 that guarantee the legislation enhances rather than      decreases flexibility for America's working families.

2759,topic-id,198,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, while we are debating a rule for a bill that would strip workers of their overtime pay, since President Trump took office, dangerous bills like this are more likely to become law.  Just a few weeks ago, President Trump signed a bill into law that strips the American people of our online privacy, allowing internet service providers to sell yours and my sensitive information to the highest bidder without our permission.  This information includes location, financial and health data, information about our children--even pictures of our children--Social Security numbers, web browsing history, app usage history, content of communication: emails, video chats. It is simply wrong.  For this reason, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Jacky Rosen's bill, H.1868, which would reinstate the Federal Communication Commission's internet privacy rule.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

2760,topic-id,405,"Mr.Speaker, sometimes you need a redo or a retake. When this body narrowly passed the bill that President Trump signed that took all of our private data and allowed internet service providers to sell it without our permission, it was a mistake. Hopefully enough Members of this body have since realized it is a mistake and they will now change their vote and support defeating the previous question[[Page H3018]]allowing for immediate consideration of Representative Rosen's bill to protect our privacy.  As we know, broadband access through internet access providers is a critical way to have access to a world of information and commerce, but the price of that access should not be all of your private information, including your kids' photographs and birthdays and your Social Security number.  Under the bill that became law, everything you enter on the internet on any site, regardless of their privacy policy, would be owned by your broadband provider and be able to be sold by your broadband provider without your consent.  That is simply wrong for America; it is wrong for consumers; it is wrong for innovation. It casts a shadow over the entire internet ecosytem, which not only has brought so much enjoyment to so many but has created millions of jobs in my district and across our country.                              {time}  1315  If we can defeat the previous question, we can do a redo on this bill. We can pass H.1868, which would reinstate a rule that has broad, popular support. I haven't heard a single constituent of mine say that they don't want their broadband privacy protected, and I have had hundreds of them say that they do want their broadband privacy protected.  I am hoping that, since my Republican friends have now had the chance to have townhalls and to listen to their constituents, they will agree that we should reinstate the Federal Communications' internet privacy rule to protect our privacy subject to the terms of use; information can be sold if you consent for it to be sold, but without your consent, all the information you enter on the internet should not be the property of the broadband provider for their use and for sale. It is common sense. The vast majority of the American public agrees. I think it is time to call the question on Congress to see if we can get Congress to agree.

Maybe they were so overwhelmed by the Republican efforts to get rid of their health care, increase the deficit, spend more money, and take away their rights that they didn't get down their list of concerns to broadband privacy.  Certainly in my district, Mr.Speaker, dozens of constituents in my townhalls--both Republican and Democratic constituents--brought this issue up as a way of arguing how out of touch House and Senate Republicans are to say that, at this time in our Nation's history, what we need is less privacy, not more.

2804,topic-id,637,"Mr.President, we know that the quality of teachers and principals are two of the most important in-school factors related to student achievement. Yet the pipeline into the profession has been neglected. If we want to improve our schools, it is essential that we invest in the professional preparation of teachers, principals, and other educators. As such, today, I am reintroducing the Educator Preparation Reform Act with my colleagues Senators Casey and Coons to ensure that the Federal government continues to be a partner in addressing this critical national need.  Today, we are facing a crisis in education. According to a research brief from the Learning Policy Institute, we have seen dramatic declines in enrollment in teacher preparation programs--an estimated 35 percent decline between 2009 and 2014. We also continue to see high rates of attrition among educators. If these trends continue, there will be an estimated gap of more than 100,000 between the number of teaching positions open and the number of teachers available to be hired annually through 2025.  The impact of these shortages falls the hardest on our most vulnerable students in our highest need communities. Rhode Island is no exception. Providence, our largest school district, is facing an acute shortage of teachers certified to teach English language learners. My home State has also reported shortages in special education, science, math, and school nurses.  We cannot solve this problem without improving both teacher and principal preparation. We need to make sure that our educator preparation programs are worthy of the professionals entering the field and the students they will serve. That is why it is more urgent than ever that we enact the Educator Preparation Reform  Our legislation builds on the success of the Teacher Quality Partnership Program, which I helped author in the 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education It continues the partnership between high need school districts, institutions of higher education, and educator preparation programs to reform pre-service programs based on the unique needs of the partners. Among the key changes are specific attention and emphasis on principals and the addition of a residency program for new principals. Improving instruction is a team effort, with principals at the helm. This bill better connects teacher preparation with principal preparation. The Educator Preparation Reform Act will also allow partnerships to develop preparation programs for other areas of instructional need, such as for school librarians, counselors, or other academic support professionals.  The bill streamlines the accountability and reporting requirements for[[Page S4672]]teacher preparation programs to provide greater transparency on key quality measures such as admissions standards, requirements for clinical practice, placement of graduates, retention in the field of teaching, and teacher performance, including student-learning outcomes. All programs--whether traditional or alternative routes to certification--will report on the same measures.  Under our legislation, States will be required to identify at-risk and low-performing programs and provide them with technical assistance and a timeline for improvement. States would be encouraged to close programs that do not improve.  We have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders on this legislation. Organizations that have endorsed the Educator Preparation Reform Act include: the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, American Association of State Colleges and Universities, Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, Higher Education Consortium for Special Education, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National Association of Elementary School Principals, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National Association of State Directors of Special Education, National Disability Rights Network, National Network of State Teachers of the Year, Public Advocacy for Kids, Rural School and Community Trust, and the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional  I look forward to working to incorporate this legislation into the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort and support this legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-01-pt1-PgS4669.txt,1982,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,1.0,May
2638,topic-id,472,"Mr.President, it is not every day that we take a moment to commemorate America's family-owned businesses that dedicate themselves to serving their local communities. I stand before you today to recognize a small business that emphasizes service, tradition, and family values. In my home State of Idaho, I have had the privilege of seeing firsthand Idahoans' dynamic use of natural resources. In our State, we continue to watch our agricultural small businesses advance and thrive. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to honor Ballard Family Dairy and Cheese of Gooding as the Senate Small Business of the Month for June 2017. Ballard Family Dairy and Cheese has been a pioneer in Idaho's artisan cheesemaking community and is a remarkable example of entrepreneurial innovation.  With just a few Jersey calves and a strong work ethic, the Ballard family started their dairy farm in 1995. Steve and Stacie Ballard, along with their children, Travis and Jessica, have worked hard to perfect cheeses that are distinctive and can only be cultivated in Idaho's unique climate. Their goal was to create a cheese that was specific to Since then, the Ballard family has developed a successful in-house cheese facility that has produced numerous award-winning specialty cheeses. The Ballard family gained the skills to produce artisan cheeses over years of hard work and trial and error. Their determination has allowed them to produce a fresh and original-tasting commodity unique to  The Ballard family produces numerous types of hand-crafted cheeses, including cheddar, gouda, and cheese curds. Their facility produces approximately 3,000 pounds of cheese daily. Ballard Family Dairy and Cheese cows are individually cared for, which ensures that the calves are healthy and allows for the finest cheese. This well-executed cheese production system combined with small batch sizes enables the Ballard family to achieve the right consistencies for high-quality cheeses.  Award-winning cheese is not the only noted accomplishments this family-run business has attained. In 2013, the Ballards' cheese facility was distinguished by the Innovation Center for U.Dairy as having ``Outstanding Achievement in Energy Efficiency.'' By adjusting their operational processes, their facility in Gooding has reduced their energy costs by about $23,000 annually.  Beyond the Ballard family's thriving retail throughout the State, the Ballards also provide educational resources with their cheese purchasing information to Idahoans who are interested in learning about cheesemaking methods. Ballard Family Dairy and Cheese is an exceptional example of the entrepreneurial spirit of Idaho agriculture and of innovative energy practices from a family-owned business. I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to the Ballard family and all of the employees of Ballard Family[[Page S3554]]Dairy and Cheese for being selected as the June 2017 Small Business of the You make our great State proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-15-pt1-PgS3553-3.txt,1896,AMERICAN SOLDIERS KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN,2017.0,15.0,May

2841,topic-id,381,"Mr.Speaker, for the past 8 years, we have been stuck in the slowest economic recovery in 70 years. With all the debate about the Financial CHOICE Act today, a simple question gets to the heart of the matter: Do we want to grow again?  I contend, Mr.Speaker, the answer is--the answer has to be a resounding yes. It has to be yes because there is a moral imperative at play. The Financial CHOICE Act is about ending a stagnant status quo that is crushing our economy and opportunity.  Multiple studies show that the Dodd-Frank Act has hindered economic growth. One study estimates that, because of the overregulation we have seen since the 2008 financial crisis, there are 650,000 fewer small businesses than there otherwise would be, which would have provided 6.5 million jobs. That is 6.5 million people not utilizing their God-given talents for the betterment of society. That is 6.5 million people not paying the Social Security, Medicare, and income taxes that we need to fund critical programs.  Some just want to raise taxes on the already-burdened taxpayers. I say, let us get new taxpayers into the game. Having more taxpayers helps us to pay for programs for veterans, education, medical research to find cures for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer, taxpayers to help fund the national defense.  A couple of weeks ago, I visited a senior center in my district and had some very special conversations. Folks told me about the days when there were lots of jobs in factory towns in western Pennsylvania, and one World War II veteran showed me his Bronze  These individuals are counting on us to allow an economy to grow that will create the taxpayers who can help pay for the critical programs that support them, that pay for their care.  We have a moral obligation, Mr.Speaker, to restore healthy growth to this economy. Today, let us pass the Financial CHOICE Let us move from overregulation to right-sized regulation. Let us unclog the flow of capital to small businesses. Let us unclog consumers' access to credit. Let us lower the cost of financial services for everyday consumers. Let us bring an end to the anti-growth policies of the last 8 years and move into a much brighter, more prosperous future for everyone.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgH4711.txt,2158,AHCA TO REPEAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,2017.0,8.0,May

As a new generation of servicemembers are returning from the battlefield, we as a nation have needed to reevaluate how we better help our veterans succeed back home. This important legislation is an example of how that success for veterans can be achieved.  As a result of the hard work of many veteran service organizations, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and countless veteran advocates, H.3218 makes many important reforms to the GI Bill to improve veterans' access to education.

You don't have to look any further than what happened in Iowa yesterday, where literally they are going to have in 94 out of 99 counties nobody to write insurance for people that are in the ObamaCare exchanges.  So what do the people, Mr.Speaker, that are opposed to this bill say to those millions of people in Iowa who are about to have no place to go to get health care?  What are the people that oppose this bill, Mr.Speaker, going to say to the millions of people with preexisting conditions across the country who are being faced with double-digit increases in their health insurance every year and, oh, by the way, premiums and deductibles as high as over $10,000, which are creaming those folks that are struggling under the weight of this bill?  So what we are replacing it with, Mr.Speaker, are reforms that actually lower premiums, that actually put patients back in charge of their healthcare decisions so that elitists up here in Washington won't tell you what you have to buy. You actually get to make that choice yourself.                              {time}  1300  You get to focus on plans that are good for your family at lower costs so that you can be in charge.

This bill is important, Mr.Speaker, to rescue the American people from a law that has failed dismally. Let's end the skyrocketing premium increases.

I extend a warm welcome to these brilliant young minds, Lida Azizi, Somayeh Faruqi, Faramarz Najafi, Rodaba Noori, Fatemah Qaderyan, Kawsar Roshan, and Alireza Of course, we extend a warm welcome to the team's creation, a robot that can sort balls, recognize blue and orange, and move objects to their proper places. People across Afghanistan are extremely proud of the robotics team's achievements. In recent days, Americans have become acquainted with the many challenges they have overcome in order to excel in their studies and come to the U.S., and we too, are very proud of them.  I have been impressed to learn about their passion for education and determination to pursue STEM studies. This team's indomitable spirit is a testament to what can be achieved through hard work, creativity, and perseverance. Each member of the Afghan robotics team has become a powerful symbol for young women across the globe, especially for those in developing regions who face barriers to education and opportunity.  The FIRST Robotics Competition should also be recognized for its ability to bring young people together in the name of science, mathematics, and technology. It is the creation of Granite Stater Dean Kamen, and had its beginnings in a New Hampshire high school gym a quarter century ago. Today, FIRST programs reach more than 400,000 young people across the world every year. Beginning this weekend in Washington, the FIRST Global Challenge will bring some of the best and brightest young people from around the world to compete, to demonstrate teamwork, and to forge new friendships.  It gives me great joy to know that Lida, Somayeh, Faramarz, Rodaba, Fatemah, Kawsar, and Alireze will be among them. The FIRST Global Challenge is a competition, and only one team will leave Washington with top honors, but the seven young women representing Afghanistan are already winners. They have had the courage to overcome barriers and the audacity to compete with some of the most talented young people from across the globe. I wish these young women great success. I thank them for inspiring us with their fierce determination to achieve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgS3990.txt,1901,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,13.0,May

2611,topic-id,303,"Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.3218, which secures and strengthens the GI Bill for future generations of veterans. It does so without cutting benefits from anyone who is currently serving.  There are several provisions in this legislation worth celebrating. Removing time restrictions for future student veterans and making this a lifetime benefit, and increasing support for reservists, guardsmen, and their families are among the long overdue improvements to the GI Bill that are included in this legislation.  But the restoration of GI Bill benefits for students defrauded by ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges is particularly noteworthy for veterans in my district and across the country. When those two schools abruptly shut their doors, thousands of student veterans were left with nontransferable credits, depleted[[Page H6168]]benefits, and none of the job opportunities they were promised. By restoring their tuition and housing benefits, we are restoring a measure of justice for these veterans, and we are restoring their opportunity to get the education they deserve.  I hope this is just the start of our efforts to crack down on for-profit colleges that exploit veterans.  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their leadership, as well as the other members of the committee and the veterans service organizations who contributed to the strength of this legislation.  Madam Speaker, passing H.3218 is an important step toward ensuring that every person who serves this Nation has the opportunity to live a rewarding and purposeful and prosperous civilian life. I encourage all Members to support this bill.  Madam Speaker, before closing, let me just add my praise to the chairman for his generosity and humbleness. I recognize, too, that this bill does not bear his name but the name of a predecessor. That was an incredible gesture, Madam I salute the chairman's leadership.

2663,topic-id,521,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, which states that this legislation will dramatically cut Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities and seniors.                                           Consortium for Citizens                                            with Disabilities,                                                   April 28, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: The Consortium for Citizens with      Disabilities (CCD) is strongly opposed to the amended      American Health Care The amended American Health Care      Act retains the original bill's proposals to dramatically but      Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities      and seniors through per capita caps, which CCD has opposed.      The new amendments--including permitting states to seek      waivers from the protections for people with pre-existing      conditions and from the requirement to provide essential      health benefits--makes the amended AHCA even more harmful to      people with disabilities. We urge you to oppose this      legislation.       Medicaid provides services and supports that maintain the      health, function, independence, and well-being of 10 million      enrollees living with disabilities. For many people with      disabilities, being able to access timely needed care is a      life or death matter. The American Health Care Act changes      the way that the Federal Government funds Medicaid--rather      than paying states based on the actual costs of healthcare      for people in Medicaid, it sets a cap on the amount of      federal support, a cap that is totally unrelated to the      actual costs of needed care for enrollees. This cap is      designed to cut Medicaid, and the bill uses those cuts to pay      for unrelated tax cuts. Slashing federal support for      Medicaid, which is already a lean program, will force states      to cut services and eligibility that put the health and      wellbeing of people with disabilities at significant risk.       The newest amendments to the American Health Care Act make      the bill even more harmful to people with disabilities. The      new amendments would allow states to easily obtain waivers,      that would allow them to charge higher premiums to people      with pre-existing conditions, including people with      disabilities. They also would allow states to seek waivers      from the Affordable Care Act's requirement to provide      essential health benefits, including crucial services for      people with disabilities such as mental health and substance      use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and      habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness      services and chronic disease management, and pediatric      services. These waivers jeopardize the Affordable Care Act's      protections for people with pre-existing conditions,      including people with disabilities, and CCD opposes any roll-     back of those protections.       The ACA helped millions of people with disabilities and      others to gain access to affordable and comprehensive health      insurance. The amended American Health Care Act is      insufficient to help people with disabilities meet their      healthcare needs, and we urge you to oppose the bill should      it come to a vote.

2662,topic-id,613,"I thank the gentleman from Florida for not only raising this issue, but being a real partner in this legislation. I met with your Governor as well, who has been very helpful in the discussions.  We believe that accounting for aging demographics of the Medicaid program and broader population is an important factor we must consider to ensure that any Medicaid reform is successfully implemented. I am committed to working with the gentleman from Florida, our colleagues in the Senate, and the Trump administration to ensure Florida's unique challenges related to an aging Medicaid demographic are recognized and accounted for appropriately.  Mr.Speaker, in the remaining part of my time, I would just like to thank my colleagues for their work on this measure.  Making sure that people have access to affordable health care is essential. It is something I would say that we all care about. We all care about family members who have suffered from cancer or other debilitating diseases or afflictions. We are trying to find a place here that works for all Americans, where we have insurance markets that are actually available where you can get an insurance product that works for you that is affordable for you.  We know that today, in America, the insurance market and the individual market--that is a very small segment, 7 percent of insurance in America; that is what we are talking about here today--that that market is collapsing before our eyes. In fact, in Iowa, I think they just announced 94 in 99 counties, people there won't even have an insurance product they can try to purchase on the exchange.  We have met with Governors and we have met with insurers. We have said: What do we need to do to intercede to get this market back to where it works? The proposals contained in our legislation are designed to do exactly that: to get back to where consumers have choices when they are required to buy insurance to take care of their families. Those choices need to be affordable. They are not now, today.  In my own State of Oregon, premiums have gone up 50 percent in the last 2 years. Meanwhile, the number of options that you have to choose from has gone down--and continues to go down. Now, we haven't gone as far as some States where you have either no option in most areas of the State or just one, but how far off is it when insurers are failing, people losing their opportunity to get affordable health insurance?  We take care of the disabled. We take care of the elderly. In fact, we plus-up to medical CPI plus 1 to make sure that we take care of the elderly and the disabled in our Medicaid program.  By the way, that is probably more than most States are spending today.  So we have thought this through carefully. We care about people and their medical condition and their families because we are all in this together as  I think the bill we have before us today works. It works to take care of those most in need. It works to make sure that the people can get access to insurance.  I will tell you what. It is a first step in a many-step process to also look at families who are dealing with opioid addition and what we can do there. There are efforts at NIH, which we just supported yesterday, to fund medical research so that we can get cures for those who have diseases and other afflictions.

2606,topic-id,816,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in unwavering support of H.3218.  It is interesting, we may prove a couple of things. One is that the universe needs to be balanced, or God has an incredible sense of irony, or our democracy is resilient and strong because, after our debate over the last piece of legislation, I can tell you that, in the time I have had the privilege of representing the people of southern Minnesota, I am not sure there is a day that I feel more of that sense of pride and honor than to be here today. Much of that thanks goes to a humble man who won't say so himself.  The Colmery GI Bill, in any years past, and maybe with a different chairman, would have been the Roe GI Bill, as the Sonny Montgomery GI Bill; but the chairman is a man of humbleness and passing on thanks to others, and it shows in giving the credit to so many Members who wrote and were part of this legislation.  This is a real historic piece of work. It is hard to get big pieces of legislation like this done. I saw somebody had written up recently and said: Well, the VA Committee is moving a lot of things because it is easy.  I think, after that last little debate and how this one has gone, there is nothing easy about it because it is not supposed to be easy. It is supposed to be a challenge building the coalitions necessary. It is supposed to be thoughtful because we are impacting generations going forward.  There are so many people to thank, and the chairman started hitting on them; but I want to again as someone who, if not for the GI Bill, would not have received my education, and our lives and the trajectory of our lives are changed dramatically for that.  Somebody stood in these chairs years ago and thought about putting a GI Bill in place that ended up benefiting me; and the idea of being able to pay it forward from one veteran to another, or from this House to another, is something that seems like it is lacking too much around here.  When we get together, there is much we can do for this country. The improvements in the bill are wide-ranging. I just want to mention a couple because I think they need to be said and I think veterans are paying attention, Madam Speaker, and maybe some of the folks watching this.  I am happy to say we are able to remove the 15-year expiration date. The idea of a lifetime GI Bill just goes to the reality of modern-day warriors; many of them serving at different times, serving later in life, not going right away when they get out, or even changing professions; and having that benefit there and holding it and enhancing their education is not only benefiting their lives, it benefits our economy.  We know that when these wars started we had very high veteran unemployment rates. We are trying to figure out different ways. And as the chairman pointed out, using the GI Bill for STEM research and other ways to get a skill set is just smart legislation.  I want to thank a few folks on the other side about understanding that we have one force now. We do not have an active Army and a Guard and Reserve that are two separate things. These warriors fight side by side, and their call up, when they get called up, means the same thing.  Because of the way regulation was written, there were things in here that created an inequality among them. And we were happy to have a general with us in General Bergman, Representatives O'Rourke, Banks, and Radewagen, along with someone who[[Page H6167]]is not a member of this committee but is a co-chair on the Guard and Reserve Mr.Palazzo worked to make sure that we offset those things to make sure our Guard and reservists receive those same benefits from when they were deployed.  So this is a rare opportunity, Madam Speaker, to pass a significant piece of legislation that is fully paid for, compromised to in a bipartisan manner. The Senate is going to pick this up, I think. And I look forward to that day when President Trump, hopefully here towards the end of summer or early fall, picks that pen up and signs this and makes a difference in veterans' lives today and going forward.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Paralyzed Veterans of      America (PVA) urges rejection of the latest version of the      American Health Care Act (AHCA). PVA is the nation's only      Congressionally-chartered veterans' service organization      solely dedicated to representing veterans with spinal cord      injury and/or disease. Consequently, we are very concerned      about the conflicting information circulating about this      legislation and the adverse impact it could have on our      members and millions of other people with disabilities.       As we understand it, the AHCA cuts $880 billion out of the      Medicaid program in order to finance tax cuts that will      explode the deficit and largely assist upper income      individuals, corporations, and providers. The Medicaid      changes are particularly devastating to people with      disabilities. Under the cap and cut proposal, the federal      government would no longer share in the costs of providing      health care services and community services beyond the capped      amount. This would eliminate the enhanced federal match for      the Community First Choice Option under Medicaid that      provides attendant care services in the community. Thanks to      this program, many poor veterans with serious non-service-     connected disabilities have been able to move from nursing      homes into their communities. The AHCA also weakens Medicaid      by ending the Medicaid expansion earlier and offering      Medicaid block grants to states. Data from the Robert Wood      Johnson Foundation shows expansion has helped thousands of      veterans and their caregivers.       For veterans and PVA members in particular, the AHCA      continues several problematic policies of the ACA as well as      troubling new provisions that could affect the ability of      many veterans and their family members to afford health      insurance in the private market. The underlying AHCA bill:       Continues to exclude CHAMPVA beneficiaries--dependents of      the most catastrophically disabled veterans--from the      dependents' coverage policy up to age 26.       Fails to remove the prohibition on enrollment into the VA      health care system for Priority Group 8 veterans, thus      denying these veterans access to the principal health care      system for veterans.       Denies access to tax credits making health insurance      affordable to anyone eligible for a host of other federal      health programs, including those ``eligible'' for coverage      under Title 38 health care programs. This would prevent many      veterans who may be ``eligible for'' but not enrolled in the      VA health care system from accessing these tax credits      intended to help people buy insurance.       Not only do the changes made to the original version of the      AHCA continue its failure to protect veterans and people with      disabilities, they make these circumstances worse. The latest      changes would allow states to seek waivers that would allow      insurers to charge higher premiums to people with pre-     existing conditions, including people with disabilities. The      new amendments also would allow states to seek waivers from      the ACA's requirement that certain essential health benefits      must be provided, including crucial services for people with      disabilities such as prescription drugs, rehabilitative and      habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness      services and chronic disease management. The combination of      these changes would make it nearly impossible for people with      pre-existing conditions to find affordable plans that cover      basic health care services.       Throughout these past few months, the American people have      been calling for a bipartisan effort to improve the nation's      health care system. Congress should heed these voices, stop      its pursuit of the flawed American Health Care Act and work      together through regular order to strengthen all Americans'      access to affordable, high quality health care.

2688,topic-id,249,"Mr.Speaker, there are many reasons that people may come to the conclusion this is not the piece of legislation for them. I would argue most egregious amongst this is the manner in which it was done. There was clearly an error made on the 7 million veterans you heard about. I do not question a single Member's commitment in here to caring for veterans. You did not do it on purpose. You did it because you had to, to meet the arcane rules of the Senate, so you stripped it out, and you will, by all intents and purposes, fix it in the  For you, I would say good luck with that. But for the Members who are sitting here: Why would we not debate this? Why would we not fix it? Why would we not go through regular order so all of us would ensure there is not a loophole that would deny coverage to 7 million veterans. This is too important to rush. It is too important to make errors like this. It is darn sure too important to count on the Senate to fix it. And it was our responsibility.  So here we sat with 30 seconds among 15 of us to make points that are important to the American public.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues: reject this. Come back and do it right, and provide the health care our veterans deserve.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

2778,topic-id,878,"Mr.President, let's talk about the size of our Navy's fleet.  The current fleet has 276 ships, but the Navy's requirement is now for 355 ships--a figure supported by congressionally mandated future fleet architecture studies.  Last week, I spoke on the floor about the national imperative to build a larger I outlined the critical missions that our Navy performs every day to help secure the country's vital interests. I also described an intense naval competition with our real and potential adversaries. This is a competition America cannot afford to lose.  America needs a bigger How do we get there? Related to that question is when we get to a 355-ship fleet. According to the Chief of Naval Operations, ADM John Richardson, we should reach our 355-ship objective in the mid-2020s. To do that, we should have started yesterday. Building and sustaining technologically advanced ships is a long-term national project. It cannot happen overnight. It takes years.  As chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I intend to lay a firm foundation this year to help support a buildup. Based on my subcommittee's work, I am convinced that Congress has a critical role to play in determining how we get to 355. All options should be on the table. Here are four ideas to consider.  1, ramp up hot production lines.  The Navy's accelerated fleet plan states that over the next 7 years, the shipbuilding industrial base can support building more ships than are currently planned. The Navy plans to build 59, but the shipbuilders can actually complete 88. We should do this. Many hot production lines have excess capacity. Congress should authorize the Navy to ``buy in bulk,'' using multiyear and block buy contracts. These contracts would help solidify the skilled workforce, stimulate suppliers, and drive down costs. We can also authorize advance procurement funding to buy long-lead-time pieces and parts.  2, extend the service life of ships in the fleet.  A quarter century ago, the Navy had 450 ships and deployments that averaged 167 days. Now the average deployment exceeds 200 days. In other words, the Navy is smaller, but the tempo of its operations has accelerated. An extra month of deployment puts additional wear and tear on ships, and this can force early retirement and ultimately squander taxpayer dollars.  Better maintenance can extend ships' service lives, delay retirement, and help us reach the 355-ship goal faster. I applaud the President's budget request for fully funding ship depot maintenance. We must build new ships and maintain the current fleet better.  In a recent speech to the Naval War College, the CNO, Admiral Richardson, noted that extending the lives of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers could help the Navy reach the 355-ship objective 10 to 15 years earlier. The commander of Navy Sea Systems Command, VADM Thomas Moore, agreed with the CNO in a recent speech in which he stated that proper maintenance would extend service lives and help grow the fleet more rapidly.  3, reactivate ships in the Ready Reserve fleet.  During the Reagan buildup, the Navy brought ships out of mothballs, including battleships with massive guns, to help grow the fleet size. The Navy should look at the Reserve fleet ship by ship to determine if any can be restored to operational status.  In his Naval War College speech, the CNO revealed that he is considering bringing some retired Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates out of mothballs. Vice Admiral Moore also suggested examining the merits of returning some logistics ships to the force.  Reactivating retired ships does not simply mean bringing back less capable ships. Jerry Hendrix and Robert O'Brien wrote in POLITICO in April that reactivated ships could be outfitted with modern missile systems and potentially cutting-edge electromagnetic railguns and directed energy weapons. In other words, reactivated ships could perform completely different and relevant missions at a fraction of the cost of new construction.  4, develop and deploy unmanned maritime systems.  The fleet of the future will include new types of ships. Again, according to the CNO, ``There is no question that unmanned systems must also be an integral part of the future fleet.'' Unmanned undersea and surface ships can offer significant advantages, such as the ability to conduct persistent operations. We have seen drones revolutionize combat from the skies. The same is possible on the seas.  I believe the Navy needs a dedicated range to test unmanned systems with other manned and unmanned platforms, while also training new operators and maintainers. I applaud the Navy for including substantial R&D funding for unmanned underwater vehicles, UUVs, in its unfunded priorities list. I am hopeful that Congress will provide the resources that are necessary to rapidly develop and deploy new unmanned systems.  To conclude, we should be considering all options for building up our naval capacity. I do not dismiss the fact that these options cost money and some are controversial, but they deserve to be explored. It would be irresponsible for Congress not to do the work now to ensure that the Navy of the future has what it needs to respond to challenges and fulfill its missions. That means 355 ships, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to set this imperative national project into motion.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

2839,topic-id,460,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to discuss my resolution, Res 30.  In July of 1999, three brothers--Ylli, 25 years old; Agron, 23 years old; and Mehmet Bytyqi, 21 years old--who were born in the United States and resided in Hampton Bays, New York, went overseas towards the end of the Kosovo war to fight mass war crimes aimed to eradicate the civilian Albanian population from  These three men left the comfort and safety of their homes in the U.to embark on a civilian humanitarian mission. They were trying to stop abroad those horrific crimes against humanity. During that civilian humanitarian mission, they were arrested after accidentally crossing into Serbian-controlled territory.  Two weeks later, they were given a judicial order of release. Instead, the brutal execution of these men followed shortly after, and it was not until 2001, 2 years later, that their remains were found in a mass grave.  While Serbian authorities have investigated the deaths of the brothers, there have been no charges brought against those responsible for those murders. Moreover, the main suspect remains a prominent member of the governing political party.  Today we remember Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet, who were senselessly and brutally murdered 18 years ago.  Since taking office over 2 years ago, I have been committed to helping the Bytyqi family receive the justice they have long deserved. I have been in contact with the family as we work to resolve this.  In the last Congress, I introduced 51, calling for justice to be served in these horrible murders, and imploring the Serbian Government to make it a priority that this must be properly investigated and that those suspects be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I am proud to have reintroduced this legislation in the 115th Congress as 20.  It is absolutely reprehensible that, despite many promises by Serbian officials to resolve this case, no individual has ever been found guilty of this horrible crime, nor of any crimes associated with the deaths of these innocent  It is the responsibility of the Serbian Government to resolve this case, and my resolution notes that progress into this investigation should remain a significant factor which determines the further development of U.S.-Serbian relations. Their inaction on finding and prosecuting those responsible is an insult not only to the memory of Ylli, Agron, Mehmet, and the Bytyqi family, but to every  The Bytyqi brothers gave their lives to fight injustice. It is now upon us to return this favor and deliver justice for their family. Those responsible for these unspeakable acts against our citizens must face the law. It is vital that the Serbian Government steps up and does what is right. Eighteen years later, it is time we put an end to this sad story.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5439-2.txt,2261,SERBIAN GOVERNMENT MUST STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING,2017.0,12.0,May
