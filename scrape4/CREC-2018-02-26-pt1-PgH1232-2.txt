                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, our hearts are heavy grieving for the 17 
innocents murdered in Parkland. We are praying for their families and 
friends.
  I cannot begin to fathom the sorrow of parents who must bury a child. 
From the time our children are born, we instinctively understand it is 
our responsibility to protect them; but, increasingly, as a nation, we 
are failing our children and allowing them to be gunned down in 
schools, at concerts, and in houses of worship.
  Still, in this darkest of time, I see reason to hope. I am inspired 
by the eloquence of the survivors and the young people across the 
country who are speaking out for positive action.
  We all know there are commonsense actions that would curb gun 
violence in our communities and save lives: universal background 
checks; banning military-style assault weapons, high-capacity 
magazines, and bump stocks; and funding mental healthcare, to name but 
a few.
  These measures have the overwhelming support of the American people. 
All that is missing is the political will from Congress. Hopefully, 
this moment will be different.
  I urge my colleagues to listen to the voices of our young people. 
Let's have the debate and vote on real actions to reduce gun violence 
in our schools, our neighborhoods, and our country.
