                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, by whose providence our steps are ordered, You are our 
source of hope, joy, and peace.
  Guide our lawmakers on the path of integrity so that they will honor 
You. Lord, inspire them to recommit to the noble principles upon which 
our Nation was founded. Give them wisdom to trust You with all their 
hearts and to passionately and humbly pursue Your will, knowing that 
You have promised to direct their paths. Today, may our Senators 
experience the constancy of Your presence. Lead them to Your higher 
wisdom, and bring them to the end of this day with their hearts at 
peace with You.
  And, Lord, sustain those who are dealing with the ravages of 
Hurricane Maria.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
