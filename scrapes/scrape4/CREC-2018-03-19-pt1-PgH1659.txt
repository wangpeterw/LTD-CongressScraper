                           WORLD CIVILITY DAY

  (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the initiative of Mr. 
Chuck Hughes and Dr. Gordon E. Bradshaw from the city of Gary Chamber 
of Commerce. Their dedicated efforts have created the Community 
Civility Counts initiative and a World Civility Day, which will 
celebrate its third annual occurrence on April 12.
  World Civility Day was established as a day to become more aware of 
our behavior toward others and to think about how we can bring more 
understanding into our lives and the lives of others.
  We live in a time when we can all benefit from being a little bit 
more civil. We live in a time when a kind gesture can have a great 
consequence for creating a just and tolerant society.
  I congratulate the initiative and dedicated work of Mr. Hughes and 
Dr. Bradshaw. I ask my colleagues to join me this World Civility Day 
and every day to do our part to bring a little more empathy into our 
world.
