                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, who has ordained the seasons of our lives, thank You for the 
steadfastness of Your mercy and long-suffering. Inspire our lawmakers 
to open themselves to the gift of Your presence, remembering that You 
are always with them. Where there is fear, give courage. Where there is 
anxiety, give peace. Where there is despair, give hope. Where there is 
sadness, give joy. May our Senators joyfully encounter You on a daily 
basis. Inspire them to hear Your words and obey Your commands.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
