                    CONGRATULATING TROY HIGH SCHOOL

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Flying Horses of 
Troy High School football team for an extraordinary achievement: 
winning a second consecutive New York State Public High School Athletic 
Association Class AA State Championship.
  Troy's Flying Horses are the first team in section 2 history to 
accomplish back-to-back undefeated seasons and State championship wins.
  Their 41-26 championship win this past Sunday over an impressive 
Lancaster Legends team showed the dedication and heart of each and 
every one of the players, their families, and their coach--their 
supercoach--Bobby Burns.
  On behalf of countless proud fans and supporters throughout New York 
State's capital region, I wish the players great success in all of 
their future endeavors. I, again, congratulate them and salute their 
passion, their dedication, and their sportsmanship. They are, indeed, 
an inspiration to all of us.
