                   CONGRATULATING THE GENEVA VIKINGS

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Geneva 
Vikings girls basketball team on winning their first Class 4A State 
championship at ISU's Redbird Arena on Saturday.
  Facing the Edwardsville Tigers, the Geneva High School girls fought a 
close back-and-forth game until its final minutes.
  Beating an unbeaten team is no small feat. With just 3.7 seconds left 
on the clock, junior guard Stephanie Hart made a shot to give the 
Vikings a one-point lead. As center Grace Loberg then stole the ball 
from the Tigers to run out the clock, the Tigers were unable to answer, 
giving Geneva the win, 41-40.
  Virtually the same thing had happened in the semifinal the day 
before, when junior guard Margaret Whitley scored the game-winning 
point with just seconds left.
  Clearly, the Vikings do well under pressure. I applaud Coach Sarah 
Meadows and the Geneva Vikings on their achievement and their hard 
work.
  Go, Vikings.
