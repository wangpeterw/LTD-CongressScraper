     NULLIFY RULE PROMULGATED BY FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to help set the 
record straight on the vote last week to roll back the Federal 
Communications Commission's flawed internet service provider rules.
  Since the internet was created, the Federal Trade Commission has been 
in charge of online privacy and has been largely successful in this 
mission. However, last year, the Federal Communications Commission 
overreached its authority by creating its own set of privacy rules that 
applied to a small group of internet service providers like Comcast, 
Verizon, and AT&T.
  This is why I joined my colleagues in the House to approve the 
Congressional Review Act to nullify this redundant rule promulgated by 
the FCC. The FCC claimed these rules would provide customers with 
strong security protections, but, in reality, the FCC's rules created 
confusion, an additional layer of bureaucratic red tape, and a false 
sense of privacy that did not exist.
  In fact, the head of both the FCC and FTC penned a joint op-ed 
recently supporting Congress' decision. In their own words, we cleared 
the way to reinstate a rational and effective system for protecting 
consumer privacy.
