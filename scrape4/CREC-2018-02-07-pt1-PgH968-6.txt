  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I think most of the world today saw the 
leader of the Democratic Caucus, Nancy Pelosi, stand on her feet with 
compassion and passion for the 800,000 DREAMers, those who are 
desperately in need of a solution, and 140,000 in the State of Texas.

21 trillion gallons of water, and Houston underwater for a period of 
days.
  We must help the American people and Texans.
