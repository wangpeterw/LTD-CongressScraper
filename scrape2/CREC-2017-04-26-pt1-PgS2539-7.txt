                        GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one other important matter currently 
being discussed here in the Senate, conversations are ongoing about the 
way forward on a government spending bill. Our friends on the other 
side of the aisle sent me a letter that asked for this bill to reject 
poison pill riders. I would suggest that if they take their own advice, 
we can finish this negotiation and produce a good agreement that both 
sides can support.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
