                            FUNDING FOR CHIP

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise again today pleading with my 
colleagues that we must come together to support a long-term funding 
solution for the traditionally bipartisan Children's Health Insurance 
Program, commonly known as CHIP.
  Mr. Speaker, there is a family in Chesapeake, a locality in my 
district, that demonstrates the dire challenges families across 
Virginia and this country face without CHIP.
  CHIP serves as a lifeline for this family with four children, ages 8, 
7, 4, and 2. Before this family had access to CHIP, these children did 
not have health insurance or well child visits with a doctor. The 
parents limited the 7- and 8-year-old children to indoor activities 
because they were afraid the children might break a bone or sustain a 
serous injury.
  The mother also missed visits to the doctor's office for vital 
prenatal care because she was worried about doctor bills. The parents 
missed work and kept the children home during flu season because they 
could not afford a doctor's visit.
  With CHIP, the mother and children all have health insurance, they 
are up to date on their wellness exams, and the children play outside 
again.
  Mr. Speaker, for the health of my constituents and millions of other 
Americans, we must immediately come together for long-term funding for 
CHIP.
