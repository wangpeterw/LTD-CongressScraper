                  TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN PETER A. MACHTEL

 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I wish to honor an outstanding 
American, Captain Peter A. Machtel, on his retirement from American 
Airlines.
  Captain Machtel distinguished himself with over 30 years of safe 
commercial airline flying for Piedmont, USAirways, and American 
Airlines. In addition, he served the American public as a Federal 
flight deck duty officer, beginning with that program as soon as it was 
implemented following the attacks on 9/11. His work for more than 15 
years with that vital security program demonstrated his selfless duty 
and commitment to the safety of the American people.
  Over the years, I have relied on Captain Machtel's knowledge and 
insights on issues relating to airlines, pensions, and aviation safety. 
I know that his wisdom and dedication to our country will be sorely 
missed.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Captain Machtel for his 
distinguished service and congratulating him on his retirement.
