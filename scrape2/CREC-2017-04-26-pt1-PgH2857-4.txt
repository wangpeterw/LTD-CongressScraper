       CONGRATULATING CONGRESSMAN STEVE STIVERS ON HIS PROMOTION

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to join my colleagues in 
congratulating Steve Stivers on his promotion to brigadier general. I 
served for 26\1/2\ years in the United States Air Force, and I can tell 
you that every officer who puts on the uniform, in the quiet moments of 
their own minds, they dream of the day that maybe someday they might 
aspire to become a flag officer or to attain the rank of general 
officer.
  I can tell you that, from my perspective, it is a lot easier to get 
elected to the House of Representatives than it is to earn the rank of 
general--at least that is what my experience shows. I can tell you, I 
never served under Steve Stivers and his command, but if his military 
leadership and performance is anything like his performance here in the 
House, he is going to represent the State of Ohio and our Nation very 
well.
  Congratulations to my colleague, Steve Stivers. God bless you, and 
thank you for your service to our country.
