  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, this week, Senate Republicans are very likely 
to vote on a bill that would take away health insurance from 22 million 
Americans, people like Marcia and Grace Kohler in Boulder, Colorado. 
The Kohlers, like many other families, were able to have access to 
healthcare through the Affordable Care Act.
  At the age of 8\1/2\, Marcia's youngest daughter, Grace, was 
diagnosed with childhood leukemia. She endured 26 months of extensive 
treatments and several chemotherapy sessions per week. In Marcia's own 
words: ``Going through this process without the assistance of 
healthcare is unimaginable. It brings tears back to my own eyes.''
  We are simply not a nation that turns its back on our most vulnerable 
citizens. 39 percent of all children in this country are supported on 
Medicaid, 64 percent of nursing home residents, and 30 percent of 
adults with disabilities.
  I hope my colleagues in the Senate right now think of Grace and all 
those like her. I hope that they think about the millions of Americans 
that will have the rug pulled out from underneath them if they pass 
their cruel bill. For some it is a matter of debt or taxes, but for 
many it is simply a matter of life or death.
