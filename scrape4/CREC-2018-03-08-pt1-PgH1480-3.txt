               ESTABLISH A UNIFORM RULE OF NATURALIZATION

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I wish to commend Attorney 
General Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration for finally taking 
action against California's lawlessness on sanctuary cities and 
immigration practices.
  California is clearly violating Federal immigration laws. States 
don't get to dictate to the Federal Government when and where these 
laws are enforced.
  California needs to be held accountable for their willful defiance of 
Federal immigration law and its sanctuary State insurrection.
  Several laws have been passed by the Federal Government over the 
years on immigration. Actually enforcing a law on the books, arresting 
and deporting illegal immigrants shouldn't be shocking. The Supreme 
Court has held that immigration regulation was a Federal responsibility 
exclusively in 1876.
  Under the Obama administration, Arizona, in order to try to fix the 
immigration problem in this country, passed a bill called S.B. 1070, 
but the Supreme Court ruled that they couldn't enforce the border 
themselves.
  Now we have California going the other direction, trying to cause no 
enforcement to be done on immigration in our State. The Federal 
Government is ruling and working to overcome that as well.
  So I commend Attorney General Sessions for taking action on 
California's lawlessness.
