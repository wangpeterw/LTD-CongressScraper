                  IVY FRANCES SHOEMAKER AKA NUMBER 12

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, she was born at evening time as a full 
Moon rose over Texas. Ivy Frances Shoemaker joined the world weighing 7 
pounds and was 20 inches long. Her birth was on May 9 in Dallas.
  The miracle of birth is God's blessing to the rest of us. It is a 
blessing to Ivy's parents, Kellee and Anthony, and her sisters, Olivia 
and Rosalyn.
  Ivy, of course, is a beautiful, smart-looking baby. She has the 
privilege to be born to wonderful parents who will raise her to grow in 
widsom and stature in the Lord.
  My wife, Carol, and I are the proud grandparents of Ivy, whom I will 
call from time to time, number 12.
  Mr. Speaker, you see, I refer to my other grandchildren by their 
birth numbers as well. There are 11 of them.
  My hope for Ivy is that she sees the importance of being good to 
others; that she makes the world a better place; that she is faithful 
to the Lord; that she appreciates her heritage; and that, of course, 
she always lives in Texas.
  And that is just the way it is.
