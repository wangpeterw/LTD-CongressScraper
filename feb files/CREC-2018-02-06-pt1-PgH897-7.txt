             LOCAL BENEFITS FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT

  (Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a 
company in the Third Congressional District of

Alabama that has given out $500 bonuses to all their 500 employees as a 
direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Russell Lands in Alexander 
City is the first company in my congressional district to distribute 
bonuses as a direct result of the tax overhaul.
  The historic tax reform legislation recently signed into law by 
President Trump is helping companies and hardworking families in 
Alabama and across America. Thanks to tax reform, U.S. companies are 
paying more than $3 billion in bonuses, and over 3 million workers have 
received a bonus or a pay increase because of the tax cuts.
  I am proud of Ben Russell and his company for leading the way on 
this, and I am thrilled that his employees are receiving this extra 
money. This bonus is a car payment, a new washing machine, or savings 
for school. This bonus represents opportunity, and I don't think you 
would ever hear the employees at Russell Lands calling their bonus 
``crumbs.''
