  Mr. NADLER (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
to dispense with the reading.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit on behalf of 
Ms. Velazquez. This is the final amendment to the bill, which will not 
kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will 
immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.
  It is unfortunate that we are here today debating inadequate policies 
while our fellow Americans in Puerto

[[Page H7611]]

Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are hurting.
  While I do not doubt the underlying bill was made with good 
intentions, it is not just inadequate for all the victims of the 
hurricanes, and it is insulting to the people of Puerto Rico. They are 
hurting. They have no food, no water, no power. They need our help.
  Estimates suggest the storm caused $40 billion to $85 billion in 
insurance claims throughout the Caribbean, with 85 percent of those 
losses in Puerto Rico. Nearly all of the island is without power, and 
85 percent of cell towers were knocked out. The hurricane ravaged 80 
percent of the crop value in Puerto Rico--a $780 million loss. This 
will result in higher food prices at a time when Puerto Rico faces 
shortages.
  These are only the initial estimates. Each day we learn more about 
the scale of devastation, and likely won't know the measure of damage 
for some time.
  FEMA has indicated that it has ``provided more than 1.5 million 
meals, 1.1 million liters of water, nearly 300 infant and toddler kits, 
and nearly 12,000 emergency roofing kits to the U.S. Virgin Islands and 
Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria's landfall.'' That is a quote from 
FEMA.
  Yet the total population of American citizens in Puerto Rico is 3.4 
million. The total in the U.S. Virgin Islands is over 100,000. It has 
been 7 days since the storm. The math simply doesn't add up, and 
neither does the bill as it is written.
  This motion to recommit would do more for the people of Puerto Rico 
and the Virgin Islands than the underlying bill. Unlike the underlying 
bill, this motion will give them funds to help them rebuild. The 
dollars are directed for rebuilding and other economic support.
  It considers specific provisions to ensure long-term growth is 
capable on the island, and it strives to treat disaster victims 
equally. By taking the politics out of natural disasters, all of our 
constituents, from New York, and Puerto Rico, to Florida, Louisiana, 
and Texas, will automatically have the necessary aid to rebuild. Giving 
them this peace of mind will give them the ability to focus on what 
matters: their families and communities.
  Rather than putting forth a fig leaf to offer themselves cover, as 
the underlying bill does, this motion would provide immediate, greater 
benefits to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. They 
cannot wait for assistance.
  By voting for this motion, you would be voting to help our fellow 
Americans. I urge all Members to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
motion to recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I believe in bipartisanship, 
which means that oftentimes I am disappointed in this institution, but 
today I am not disappointed, I am shocked. I am shocked that some would 
politicize such a sensitive, desperate situation that so many 
Americans, from Texas to Puerto Rico, are facing at this hour.
  My colleagues say they want to help the people of Puerto Rico, the 
people of the Florida Keys in my district, and others throughout the 
country. A lot of them have come here boasting about the fact that they 
have never opposed a disaster relief package, yet they are willing to 
do so today. Why? To try to attempt to score political points.
  I think that is wrong, and I can't help but take it personally, 
because my constituents really need this help.
  The people of Puerto Rico, by the way, the person they elected to 
this chamber, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, supports this legislation; 
Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands, our colleague, put her name to 
this legislation as well; Chairman Brady, whose constituents are trying 
to recover in the Houston area, is asking for passage of this 
legislation, yet people from other parts of the country are coming to 
this floor saying: No, that is not good enough for your constituents.
  So if my constituents get nothing, I should tell them: That is right. 
Someone from elsewhere said that because this wasn't good enough, you 
get nothing.
  That is just wrong. This is an important first step that we have to 
take to help people in all of these jurisdictions, especially the 
people of Puerto Rico, because we know that the situation there is in 
no way comparable to anything that has happened on the mainland.
  It is personal for me in that sense as well, because guess what? When 
my wife's family was exiled from Cuba, they went to Puerto Rico and 
they were welcomed there. My wife's two elder brothers were born in 
Puerto Rico. My wife still has family in Puerto Rico, and I know that 
this legislation would improve their situation.
  Can we do more? Should we do more? Should we work together to do more 
in the future? Yes, we should and we will, but that is no excuse to 
vote against this legislation, that is no excuse to leverage the 
suffering of these people to try to achieve a political objective or 
even to advance different legislation.
  I respectfully ask all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, and 
I thank the 26 Democrats who stood with us on Monday, and I ask them to 
do it again today and for more to join us, to send a strong message of 
national unity for the people of Florida, Texas, Louisiana, the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, and, yes, Puerto Rico.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is 
ordered on the motion to recommit.
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule 
XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 
5-minute votes on:
  Passage of the bill, if ordered;
  Passage of H.R. 2792; and
  Agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 188, 
nays 227, not voting 18, as follows:

                      Announcement by the Speaker

  The SPEAKER. The Chair wishes to mark the return to the Chamber of 
our dear friend and colleague from Louisiana, Mr. Steve Scalise.
  Our prayers have been answered. His bravery and his family's strength 
have been such an inspiration to this House and to the people it 
serves. America is grateful for this moment.
  (By unanimous consent, Mr. Scalise was allowed to speak out of 
order.)


         Expressing Appreciation for Support During My Recovery

  Mr. SCALISE. Wow. Mr. Speaker, you have no idea how great this feels 
to be back here at work in the people's House.
  As you can imagine, these last 3\1/2\ months have been pretty 
challenging times for me and my family. But if you look at the 
outpouring of love, of warmth, of prayer, my gosh, Jennifer and I have 
been overwhelmed with all of that outpouring. It has given us the 
strength to get through all of this and to get to this point today, and 
it starts with God.
  When I was laying out on that ball field, the first thing I did once 
I was down and I couldn't move anymore is, I just started to pray. And 
I will tell you, it gave me an unbelievable sense of calm knowing that 
at that point it was in God's hands.
  But I prayed for very specific things, and I will tell you, pretty 
much every one of those prayers was answered. There were some pretty 
challenging prayers I was putting in God's hands, but He really did 
deliver for me and my family. And it just gives you that renewed faith 
and understanding that the power of prayer is something that you just 
cannot underestimate. So I am definitely a living example that miracles 
really do happen.
  The first place I want to go to thank true angels along the way 
starts with the United States Capitol Police. When I was elected 
majority whip, as you know, the elected leadership has a security 
detail, and if anybody ever wondered why we are assigned security 
detail, I surely found out that day.
  Let me tell you, I want to specifically mention Crystal Griner and 
David Bailey. Crystal and David were assigned to my security detail 
that morning. Day in and day out, they are part of our family. Jennifer 
and I truly do treat them as part of our family because they are with 
us everywhere we go. On that day, it was no different.
  On June 14, they came at 6:30 in the morning. We arrived at the 
baseball field just to play and practice for a game of charity 
baseball. Nobody would have suspected what ensued, and yet, as soon as 
those shots were fired--I will tell you, when I was laying on the 
ground, one of the things I prayed for was that David and Crystal would 
be successful in carrying out their duties.
  Both David and Crystal are incredibly well-trained and incredibly 
professional. But when I was laying there, not long after the first 
couple of shots were fired, I could hear a different caliber of weapon. 
That told me that they had immediately engaged the shooter. Let me tell 
you, if they didn't act so quickly--even after being shot both 
themselves, they continued to engage the shooter and ultimately got him 
down, which not only saved my life, but saved the lives of a lot of 
other people that are here in this Chamber today.
  Crystal couldn't be with us today, but David Bailey is with us. 
David, you are my hero. You saved my life. Thank you so much. Tiger 
blood.
  I also owe thanks to a lot of the people who were on the field with 
me. Right after the shooter was down, a lot of my colleagues came and 
ran to come check on me. One I want to mention in particular is one of 
those things that Jennifer and I call the little miracles that happened 
that day and throughout the next few months of our recovery.
  We happened to have Brad Wenstrup on the field that day, and he was 
one of the first to come to my side. As you know, Brad is not only a 
doctor, but he is a decorated Army Ranger who served in combat. And one 
of his roles and missions was to take care of people that were wounded 
before they went off on the helicopter to go get prepared. Who would 
have thought that God would have put Brad out there on that field with 
me because the tourniquet he applied, many will tell you, saved my life 
so that I could actually make it to the hospital in time with all of 
the blood loss. So, Brad, where are you at? Right down in front.
  Once I arrived at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, I was a little 
bit out of it at that point. But luckily, I ended up in the trusted 
hands of Dr. Jack Sava and his great team over at MedStar. They gave me 
a second chance at life. Through many, many surgeries, where my life 
was truly in the balance in a few of those, they did a wonderful job at 
making sure that I was well taken care of and, ultimately, made it 
through that point so I could get to Dr. Golden and his team who 
actually put me back together again, which was quite a task, to the 
point where I am actually able to relearn how to walk again. So, Dr. 
Sava, Dr. Golden, thank you for being here and thanks for your team's 
work.
  Above all else, I want to thank my lovely wife, Jennifer. Those of 
you who know her know how strong Jennifer is. She is an incredibly warm 
and loving wife, and she is an incredible mother to our children. 
Somehow, through the late nights and the surgeries and all of the other 
things, she managed to hold our family together, to make sure that 
Harrison and Madison were cared for as well. Still, to this day, she is 
not only by my side, but she is also serving as a great mother. I am 
lucky to have you. Thanks for being here. I love you, Sweetheart.

  While it has been a challenging time for my family, the thing that 
really

[[Page H7613]]

overwhelmed us from the start was the outpouring of love and warmth and 
prayers. From southeast Louisiana, the district that I represent, we 
saw blood drives at St. Catherine of Siena Parish. We saw prayer groups 
at First United Methodist Church in Slidell.
  But what we also saw were prayer groups and well-wishes being given 
from people that we never met before throughout all of your districts. 
You shared it with me, and it was one of those things that was hard for 
us to completely comprehend that you had people from all walks of life 
that had never met me before, and yet, they saw what had happened and 
they just wanted to offer prayers.
  Let me tell you, to each and every one of you--and please convey it 
to your constituents, and I sure convey it to my constituents back 
home--that warmth and love gave us just incredible strength that you 
can't imagine during some really, really difficult times. So that is 
one more example of the power of prayer.
  Something else I saw firsthand wasn't a surprise to me, but it was 
the outpouring of love from you, my colleagues, both Republican and 
Democrat. I know right after the shooting--we were practicing on the 
Republican side and the Democrats were practicing too--my colleague and 
friend, and sometimes archrival in baseball from back home in New 
Orleans--unfortunately, the star of the game too many times--Cedric 
Richmond somehow figured out which hospital I was sent to, and he got 
there. He was probably the first person there on the scene, in his 
baseball uniform, to check on me.
  So many others of you, again, both Republican and Democrat, reached 
out in ways that I can't express the gratitude and how much it means to 
me, Jennifer, and our whole family. It really does show the warm side 
of Congress that very few people get to see.
  I want to thank each and every one of you for that. You don't know 
how much it meant to me. When I came back into this Chamber here today, 
just seeing the faces of all of you, it just means more to me than you 
can imagine. So thanks for all of that love and support.
  A lot of people ask: Did the event change you? And I think those of 
you who know me know I am an optimistic person. I am just a fun-loving 
person. I am from south Louisiana, and we believe you work hard and you 
play hard and joie de vivre.
  Is an event like this really going to change that? The first thing I 
can tell you is, yes, it changed me, but not in the ways you might 
think. It has only strengthened my faith in God, and it has really 
crystallized what shows up as the goodness in people. I got to see that 
goodness in people.
  While some people might focus on a tragic event and an evil act, to 
me, all I remember are the thousands of acts of kindness and love and 
warmth that came out of this and kept me going through all of it and, 
again, just reemphasized just how wonderful most people are and how 
much compassion there is out there.
  Finally, I want to talk about something that I guess hit me and 
probably struck me more than anything that I was not expecting, and 
that was the outpouring of love and support from world leaders, people 
I have met and have known. Benjamin Netanyahu and I have had some 
incredible conversations from the hospital. And Theresa May, King 
Abdullah of Jordan--leaders that so many of us have met--reached out. 
But other world leaders also reached out, people I had never met 
before.
  That touched me in a different way because each and every one of us, 
we come here and we fight for the things that we believe in. I have 
passionate beliefs. For some reason, some of you don't agree with all 
of those. But it is so important that we come up here. We are the 
people's House. This is the place where these ideas are supposed to be 
debated, and we fight through those issues. But, ultimately, we come 
together on whatever the board shows is 218. If you can put the 
majority together, that is what rules the day. It is so important that, 
as we are having those political battles, we don't make them personal.
  One of the things I saw--and I guess this is the thing that really 
kept coming back to me--is I tried to make sense of all of this. In 
comprehending the outpouring of love that I saw, it kept coming back to 
those world leaders. Why would leaders from around the world that I had 
never met before reach out and say: ``Steve, we hope you can get back 
to work. We hope you can come through this.''?
  And what it says is, sure, they cared about my wellbeing, but more 
than that, they saw this as an attack on all of us. They saw this as an 
attack on the institution of the United States Congress and our 
government. And they really count on us to be successful.
  Look, we all know the United States is the leader of the free world. 
It is something that we have, frankly, had the honor as a country to 
hold as a distinction for generations. And yet, when you look at that 
title, what it really means is, is that there are people all around the 
world that want freedom, maybe that have freedom, but they know the 
United States being strong is critical to the rest of the world having 
the opportunity for freedom.
  That is why I am so excited to be back because, as we are fighting 
through the issues of the day, let's just keep in mind that we rise 
above the challenges of the day and understand that it is not just us 
and our constituents and the country, the United States, that is 
counting on our being successful. People all around the world who 
believe in freedom are counting on us as well, and we will deliver for 
them. That is why I am so honored to be back here in the House serving 
with you.
  God bless each and every one of you, and God bless the United States 
of America.
  (By unanimous consent, Ms. PELOSI was allowed to speak out of order.)


                            Answered Prayers

  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I join you in thanking God for the return of 
our colleague, Steve Scalise, and to have him do so in such a strong 
way.
  You were brief, Mr. Speaker, I will be even briefer.
  Thank God, our prayers are answered.
  I take great pride in Steve because we are both Italian Americans, 
and I think that is a source of some of his strength.
  I, too, want to say how proud we are of Jennifer, Harrison, and 
Madison, of your staff, and of our first responders--our Capitol 
Police--who took such good care of you.
  But if it is, as you said, an attack on you is an attack on all, then 
we all came through this magnificently because of your strength. So it 
is the power of Steve Scalise.
  The day we came to the floor when you weren't here, we were all Team 
Scalise. Today we are Team Scalise.
  Thank you for being so wonderful.
  God bless you.
