  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations: 
Executive Calendar Nos. 327, 332, 333, and 337.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Stephen B. King, of

United States of America to the Czech Republic; Barbara Lee, of 
California, to be Representative of the United States of America to the

States of America to the Seventy-second Session of the General Assembly 
of the United Nations; and J. Steven Dowd, of Florida, to be United

years.
  Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to consider the nominations en bloc.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; 
that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified 
of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that 
any statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Is there any further debate on the nominations en bloc?
  If not, the question is, will the Senate advise and consent to the 
King, Lee, Smith, and Dowd nominations en block?
  The nominations were confirmed en bloc.
