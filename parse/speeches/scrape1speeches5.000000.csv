272,topic-id,960,"I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding, and, Mr.Speaker, what an honor to be able to introduce myselfas a freshman of the 115th Congress and serve with some great colleagues and freshmen. It is great to be called a freshmanagain. It has been a long time since I have been called a freshman.  I am very honored to serve the Second District of It is one of three districts of the State that consists of acounty-and-a-half around Omaha, and it is a great home, a great place to live.  I was raised on a farm in a small town in Illinois, Momence, Illinois, a town of about1,800. We had corn, soybeans--I baled hay four times a year--beef cattle, and I did that until I was 21 years old. I knowfirsthand how hard our farmers work to make a living, and it is an honor to be able to serve on the Agriculture Committee tomake a difference there.  I started serving in the Air Force back in 1985 as a 21-year-old, as a newlywed. My wife and I had 16 assignments; fourdifferent continents we were located in, coast to coast, and a lot of places in the middle. I was very honored to be able toserve as a commander of five different units, to include Ramstein Air Base in And there I got to see firsthand theimportance of working with our allies and the importance of NATO, and I am going to take that experience with me.  I was also honored to serve as the commander of Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, I loved the missions there. Iloved the people. I had several different flying missions, a nuclear mission there as well, and I look forward to being a strongvoice for Offutt and our military community there.  I was also able to deploy four times to the Middle East, and I look forward to using the experiences that I have learned tomake sure that our men and women are equipped and trained to win.  I also did missile defense in It was an honor to work with our Israeli friends. I look forward to being a strongvoice to improve the friendship with our great ally  Out of those 16 assignments, I did have three assignments at Offutt, and I will tell you that my wife, Angie, and I lovedeastern The people are friendly. They have character. They love the military. And we are so blessed to be able to callit our home now, and so honored to be able to represent the great people of the Second  I will be serving on three different committees. I will be on the Armed Services Committee, the Agriculture Committee, andthe Small Business I look forward to using my experiences to make a difference in all three. I am going to work myhardest on all three to make a difference.  One thing I am certain of: when Americans are put on a level playing field, we win. When our businessmen and -women and whenour farmers are put on a level playing field, we win.  It has been our own government that has put our citizens at a disadvantage: high corporate taxes, regulations, our brokenhealthcare system. I am going to dedicate myself to fixing these because we need to help our Nation get on this level playingfield where we start prospering and succeeding once again.  During my time at Congress, I look forward to doing the following and focusing on the following goals:  I want to reduce the burdensome regulations. And we have had a great start in the 115th It is so exciting to seethe great votes we have already taken. We have over 3,000 regulations, on average, that are put out by our agencies. And whenyou add up the cost[[Page H460]]of those from the past and those present, it adds up to almost $2 trillion, Mr.That isalmost 10 percent of our GDP, and it falls unfairly on our small business community, our farmers, and we have got to do better.  We need to reduce the cost of health care, and we are starting to work on that now. I look forward to being part of thesolution. We need to ensure that folks have patient-centered health care that is supported by their doctors, not Federalbureaucrats running their health care where it is a one-size-fits-all approach.  I am going to work hard to open up markets for farmers and ranchers. Nebraska has such a great agriculture, farming, andranching community. We are going to give them that opportunity, and we are going to work hard to do it.  I am going to work hard to reform a broken Tax It is not right that our Nation has the highest corporate taxes, and itputs us at a disadvantage when we compete overseas and with our neighbors. We must fix that.  I want to work hard to rebuild and restore our military's readiness. It is hard to believe, Mr.Speaker, that our readinessis at the lowest level since post-Vietnam, and it is wrong. We have got to fix it.  Finally, I want to work hard to restore our allies' faith in our Leading from behind has been a failure.  I will close with this thought, and it is something that I communicated much during the campaign. Winning elections is notthe goal, but it is a means to an end.  Mr.Speaker, we are going to work hard in this Congress and I am going to be dedicated to working my hardest to deliverresults for the American people and our district. It is about defending liberty. It is about ensuring that we have opportunityand prosperity for the next generations. It is about making sure that our Nation stays secure.  I thank the gentleman again for this opportunity to introduce myself.  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH455-2.txt,99999999999999,TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS,2017.0,12.0,January

I myself went to Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday night, and what I saw was shocking to me. I saw Fatema coming in from an airline--a legal, permanent resident in this country, who came with her 1-year-old son who is an American citizen--being detained with the threat of being deported and pressured to sign to give up her right to be a legal permanent resident.  I was fighting to get to her, to make sure she had legal counsel, to make sure that she had that opportunity, and I was unsuccessful. Despite me and another Member being there, the Customs and Border Protection wouldn't even talk to us. They wouldn't give us a briefing. They merely hung up on us.  Mr.Speaker, this is wrong. This provision is discriminatory based on religion and nationality.

For nearly three decades, ``Big John'' Smith led the Department of Transportation for the Eastern Shoshone and[[Page S681]]Northern Arapaho Tribes of the Wind River Wyoming lost one of its great representatives and leaders on December 31, 2016, but John's legacy lives on through the changes he effected on the Wind River  John's unwavering commitment to improving transportation infrastructure earned him awards and respect the country over. More importantly, Big John inspired others to invest in transportation and road safety on the Wind River It is only fitting that a bill, which seeks give additional tools to tribal governments across the country, would be named after such a committed man.  The John Smith Act will streamline requirements for tribal transportation projects to help make intersections, railroad crossings, and other tribal transportation features safer for the people who depend on this infrastructure. Relatively minor changes can dramatically improve public safety around roads. The John Smith Act makes sure that simple things, like installation of rumble strips, improvement of roads for pedestrian or cyclist safety, and even basic signage would not be subject to months or years-long delays due to bureaucratic backlog.  When he testified before the Committee of Indian Affairs when I was Chairman, Mr.Smith told the stories outlining the many tragic deaths on dangerous roads in Indian country. He shared that at the time of his testimony, the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming had the highest rate of pedestrian deaths in the United The John Smith Act would ensure that basic safety measures could be put in place in a timely manner. Big John shared, ``When you have narrow roads, with sharp curves, no medians and no shoulders, you are asking for trouble.'' The projects included in this bill will help to save lives in tribal communities.  John Smith has been described as a ``Champion of Change'' by the White House, a skillful diplomat by his peers, and I was proud to call him my friend. It is with great honor and respect that I am pleased today to introduce the John Smith Act to build on John's lifetime of transportation safety achievements.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-03-pt1-PgS680-3.txt,1881,SHILOH NATIONAL MILITARY PARK BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT AND PARKER'S,2017.0,3.0,January

He left me big shoes to fill, but I am blessed to be able to counsel withhim, and I am honored to follow his example.  My district covers parts of the southeast metropolitan area of Phoenix, the[[Page H456]]cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, QueenCreek, and communities like Sun Many families have lived there for generations. They are hardworking, patriotic, andfaith-driven people.  I am a native Arizonan, one of the few. I live in Gilbert with my wife of 35 years, We have six children and fourgrandchildren. I received my bachelor's degree in Asian Studies from Brigham Young University, my master's degree from ArizonaState University, and my law degree from the University of Arizona, and I have pursued additional graduate work.  For the past 14 years, I have had the opportunity to serve in the Arizona State legislature where I served as the senatepresident for the last 4 years. During that time, we balanced the budget, going from the worst budget situation in the Nation ona per capita basis, and we reduced taxes. We cut government regulations.

252,topic-id,2197,"Mr.President, the House's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act is dangerous and irresponsible. Just listen to Governor John Kasich, Republican Governor of my State, who says we should not be throwing 500, 600, 700,000 Medicaid beneficiaries--mostly people who have jobs and work in low-income jobs--we shouldn't throw them off their insurance. In fact, in Ohio there are 900,000 people--700,000 on Medicaid, 100,000 on their parents' healthcare plan, and another 100,000 on the exchanges--who would lose their insurance if the House succeeds and the Senate goes along in changing dramatically or repealing the Affordable Care  My office is flooded with letters and calls from Ohioans begging us not to take away their care. Let me share some of those letters.  A woman from Beachwood, OH, in Northeast Ohio wrote to me on January 11 terrified of possible changes to the Medicaid system that helps fund nursing homes like the one where she lives. She writes:       I strongly believe changes would drastically diminish my      quality of life and many other residents' in the nursing home      setting. My care needs are currently well managed by      qualified and caring staff members. I am a 2-person assist      with dressing, bathing, and getting to the bathroom. I also      require two people with getting dressed every morning.       Medicaid cuts would decrease the number of staff members. .      . . Without adequate staff, I am afraid of extensive wait      periods and frequent bathing accidents. . . . It would be      very difficult to endure, cause embarrassment, while      destroying my dignity in the process.       I am not as strong as I used to be. I have children who      love and care for me and placed me in a safe environment.      Living in the nursing home has allowed me to live a little      better, smile a little longer, and enjoy my days with family      members.  ``Please consider,'' she writes, ``the people who will be affected the most.''  Understand that most Medicaid dollars--dollars that unfortunately Republicans want to block-grant or capitate in some way, whatever terms they want to use here, send to the States, shrink those dollars, and people like this lady from Beachwood will be the losers as a result. Understand again that most Medicaid dollars--two-thirds of them--go to nursing home care. ``Please consider the people who will be affected the most,'' she writes.  Another woman from Mount Vernon, OH, a part of the State where I grew up in Mansfield, wrote to urge us not to rip coverage away from individuals who are currently receiving mental health and addiction services. She writes:       As a constituent concerned about preserving access to      lifesaving mental health and addiction services, I am writing      today to urge and request your support in protecting the      Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid expansion.       I work as a substance abuse counselor in Knox County and      work with adolescents and women with co-occurring disorders.      Without the Medicaid expansion, many of our clients would not      be able to get the help they need.  Without ObamaCare, without the Affordable Care       Without the Medicaid expansion, many of our clients would      not be able to get the help they need.  Today in Ohio, 200,000 people are in the midst of opioid addiction treatment, and 200,000 of them have insurance so they could get that treatment delivered in the right way and have insurance because of the Affordable Care This House proposal would just rip it away from them.  She goes on to write:       Knowing that they can receive help and healthcare often is      one of the motivating factors for our clients to begin to      make change. Their ability to access medications such as      Vivitrol through Medicaid has been a strengthening point in      the recovery process of many. With our teens, I have seen      them be able to change substance use with the resources that      Medicaid provides.  In other words, some of them are breaking their addiction and some of them are being cured because of the Affordable Care Act, because they have       Medicaid allows our rural and low-income teens--  And of the 88 counties in Ohio, 70 or so are classified as small town or rural, like the county I grew up in, Richland County--     many of whom otherwise would not be able to attend treatment      due to transportation barriers--to attend treatment through      public transportation. Working with these clients, you learn      their stories. So many have been through unimaginable trauma,      losses, and emotional/physical pain. Many have never had the      support to help them begin to work through these issues      underlying the substance use.  She is worried. The lady in Mount Vernon, OH, is worried, with very good reason, that these repeal plans would ``leave millions of Americans without access to needed mental health and addictions treatment in our state and communities.''  Most recently, a woman in Butler County--the congressional district of former Speaker John Boehner and some members of my staff, past and present--writes:       I am extremely concerned about the cuts President Trump and      the Republican-led Congress propose to make in the Medicaid      program and services for the developmentally disabled.  Her son is 14 years old. He was diagnosed with a specific type of autism. He is nonverbal, with severe cognitive and physical challenges. She wrote to my office how Medicaid has been ``a godsend'' for her and her family. Before her son received a waiver under the Medicaid Program, her family was spending $100 a month in copays for psychiatric medications alone. That is in addition to all the extra medical costs in caring for a severely challenged child. They couldn't afford the physical therapy he needs, despite having insurance coverage through her husband's employer. She wrote that Medicaid ``more than anything else, improved the quality of my son's life, and by extension, the life of our whole family.''  Understand that health challenges--especially mental health challenges but health challenges overall--in one member of a family afflict the whole family. That is something we should remember as this Congress seems to rush pell-mell into trying to repeal Medicare, trying to repeal the Affordable Care  These three letters are three of hundreds of thousands that we received--hundreds of thousands of letters and calls that Members of the Senate are receiving. I don't understand how, when 20 million people will lose their insurance, so many Members of Congress, who themselves have government-financed health insurance--we have health insurance in this body paid for by taxpayers, most of us. Yet we think it is appropriate to pass legislation in part giving tax cuts to the richest Americans and at the same time stripping away Medicare benefits, taking 22 million people who now have insurance off of that insurance and proposing minor insurance for some of them but not nearly all of them. If we are people of God, if we are people who care about our constituents, how we can do that is just beyond me.  I go back to the quote from one of the people I read about today from She writes: ``Please consider the people who will be affected the most.''                  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Mr.President, President Trump declared this week Consumer Protection Week, but his proclamation has gaping holes. It ignores the many ways large corporations cheat consumers and the biggest tool Americans have to fight back.  Not once did the proclamation mention the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has returned $12 billion to 29 million consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created under Dodd-Frank 8 or 9 years ago. Not once does it talk about the unscrupulous lenders who targeted Americans with predatory mortgages before blowing up the economy in 2007 and 2008. Not once does the President's Consumer Protection Week proclamation mention the millions of fake accounts opened by Wells Not once does it mention the shady outfits that set up shop outside the gates of our military bases and the payday[[Page S1632]]lenders and other unscrupulous lenders who set up shop outside the gates of the military bases because they aren't allowed on the military bases as they try to exploit our service men and women and their families.  Not only did the President ignore some of the most pressing consumer protection issues, his administration is attacking the most important consumer advocate indeed--the Consumer Financial Protection  Last week, President Trump's Department of Justice filed papers in Federal court signaling that it will argue that the CFPB shouldn't be independent. The President and White House want the CFPB under their control so they can weaken it, so they can help Wall Street, so they can take away some of its power. They think the President should have the power to fire the head of the agency for any reason.  The whole reason we wrote it to be independent was to protect it from a President who chose Wall Street over Main It was Presidential Candidate Trump who sounded pretty good standing up to Wall Street and helping Main If you look at the nominees, his appointments, and his actions so far, it has been exactly the opposite. He has been the president of Wall Street and at the same time exploiting Main It means that what the President has proposed is that the President can fire his director for doing his job: stepping on the toes of special interests.  The CFPB works in part because it has an independent The current Director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray from Ohio, has protected consumers, has returned billions to Americans who were cheated and who were taken advantage of by big companies.  The CFPB has an independent budget. Banks can't kill it by lobbying it and cutting off its budget. That is the point. People whom he has in many cases recovered money from because he represents consumers--those banks, those large Wall Street banks and other financial institutions, because of the way it is set up, can't lobby Congress to take money away from it and put it out of business. Special interests have relentlessly attacked the CFPB since the day we created it.  President Trump ran on the promise of protecting the little guy, but he hasn't followed through on the promise of protecting ordinary Americans from some of the wealthiest, most privileged special interests in this town.  If you are one of the 29 million Americans who received help from CFPB, you might know how important saving it is, but you might not know how important it is to especially protecting one group of people, and that is protecting our veterans and our servicemembers. The CFPB has an entire office that is dedicated to helping men and women who have served in uniform--the Office of Servicemember  A couple of weeks ago, my Rhode Island Senator friend, Jack Reed, was in the Armed Services Committee with the senior enlisted advisers of military services--the Army, Air Force, Navy, Their job is to make sure our servicemembers and their families are getting the support they need. Every one of them had great things to say about the CFPB's Office of Servicemember Affairs--of the value it provides and the support it provides to the men and women who sacrifice so much for our country.  Senator Reed brought up an alarming figure. A recent report estimated that thousands of servicemembers are forced out of service every year because of financial hardships--problems with their mortgages, with payday loans, with credit card debt. One will remember earlier in the presentation that I talked about how many of these financial groups set up right outside military bases. That causes a tragedy for these men and women who want to serve their country, and it causes tragedy for their families. It costs taxpayers $57,000 every time someone is forced out of service. Many other servicemembers lose their security clearances because of financial trouble, which directly affects the mission readiness that is brought on by shady business practices.  The CFPB is stepping in to protect these heroes who are often taken advantage of. The CFPB's Office of Servicemember Affairs is led by men and women who have served in the military and know what kind of help servicemembers need. They visit 145 military facilities across the country in order to help servicemembers get their finances straightened out and to hear about their concerns. They have handled 70,000 complaints from servicemembers and veterans about abusive practices by financial institutions. They have returned $130 million back to servicemembers and their families simply by enforcing the law and protecting those consumers.  The CFPB protects the men and women who protect our country. It protects all of us. The best way to celebrate Consumer Protection Week is not through words and proclamations, it is through actions.  We need to combat cyber crimes and identity theft, as the President mentioned, but we also need to combat all kinds of tricks and traps--loans with outrageous interest rates, for-profit colleges that promise far more than they deliver, lenders who discriminate based on race. The list goes on and on.  I urge my colleagues to join me in working to ensure that the CFPB remains a strong, active ally in the cause of consumer protection this week, next week, every week.

144,topic-id,3530,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017, will allow America's small businesses to thrive, creating jobs, developing incredible products and services, and growing our Nation's economy.  Starting a business, designing a product, developing a service, these projects often require upfront capital. For entrepreneurs and startups in this country, access to capital is one of the biggest hurdles they will face. Without it, they may not have the cash on hand for research and development, the funds to make payroll at the end of the month, or the raw material needed to start production.  Mr.Speaker, H.1219 seeks to provide more sources of funding for our small businesses by raising the cap that requires a group of investors to register as an investment company. This change in the law is important. It allows angel funds, which are basically a pool of accredited investors, to permit up to 250 investors in one fund as opposed to the 100 permitted by current law.  As long as the fund does not exceed $10 million in capital commitments, it would be considered a qualified venture capital fund that is exempt from costly registration with the  Angel funds allow individuals who may not otherwise invest in startups to join together and direct their investment dollars to promising young companies. Without raising the cap on the size of these funds, we may be pushing potential investors out of the market.  Small businesses, in their earliest stages, often have nowhere to turn for credit. While banks have historically been a source of funds, in recent years, small business loans from banks have declined. That is where these groups of individual investors come in. In many cases, they are providing just enough cash to push businesses off the ground to the next level of funding; but by overregulating groups of angel investors, we are blocking significant sources of capital from ever reaching startups.  We need to wisely regulate in this country, and this legislation doesn't eliminate the need for larger investment funds to register with the It simply raises the cap for smaller groups of individuals to contribute a limited amount of funds to the American small business community. For businesses on the receiving end, these funds may be the difference between success and bankruptcy.  Thankfully, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act has already raised the cap requiring companies to register with the SEC from 500 investors to 2,000 investors. By allowing small companies[[Page H2709]]to seek more individual investors, these businesses can expand the number of individuals who have a stake in the company's future, the number of individuals who will ensure the venture succeeds.  H.1219 is a natural complement to the JOBS Act, allowing those potential investors to more easily join their resources to efficiently and successfully invest in America's small businesses. In fact, the current limit on the number of investors who can join together, set by the Investment Company Act of 1940, is a relic from nearly 80 years ago. In the past 80 years, our financial market and our economy have drastically changed. The barriers to entry for small businesses in many industries are lower than ever.  Just yesterday, I spent time with Etash Etash is a young man from my district who won the Congressional App Already, in high school, he takes computer science classes and codes smartphone apps. He even started a club to teach others programming.  He and students like him have many of the skills needed to start a small business. They have the ability to create software programs that consumers want and need. They may start small, they may start in high school, but they hold great potential.  Many individual investors may see that potential. This bill allows those investors to make a down payment on the future of these young entrepreneurs. Without growing the sources and amount of capital available to these businesses, we will end up stifling the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit that our country is known for.  Our Nation is successful because Americans are innovators and hard workers. Those Americans who start businesses embody this spirit. We are not here asking for the government to help these people succeed. No, these individuals are fully capable of building businesses on their own. But we are here asking the government to step out of the way so that our fellow citizens can help American small businesses succeed.  This rule and the underlying legislation should not be controversial. Last Congress, similar legislation passed the Financial Services Committee by a vote of 57-2. It then passed the House by a vote of 388-9.  Yesterday, I came to the House floor and spoke about the importance of passing bipartisan bills. Many Americans see their Capital awash in partisanship and bickering. They suffer under poorly crafted policies, while politicians in D.fail to find consensus on legislation that would help. They wonder why politicians who talk about bipartisanship on the campaign trail can't come together in Washington to pass commonsense legislation.  The challenge before us is to find solutions to our Nation's problems that overlap the principles held by both parties. That is why this bill is refreshing. It stands as an exemplar of the sort of consensus-driven legislation that can earn America's trust.  Everyone can agree that innovative companies help the American economy grow and add to the quality of life in our Everyone recognizes how important access to capital is for small businesses.  This bill was reported out of the Financial Services Committee with overwhelming support. I ask now that the entire House support the rule and this underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, this is the 28th closed rule we are considering in Let me repeat that. This is the 28th closed rule that we are considering in this That means that 64 percent of the rules that the Republican leadership has brought to the floor this year have been completely closed, with no opportunity for Democrats or Republicans to offer their ideas to expand upon or improve the legislation.  Under a closed rule, you can't even offer an amendment to fix a typo. If somebody is in their office listening to the debate on this bill and has an idea on how to improve it, they are denied that opportunity to offer any amendments on the floor--in short, no amendments.  Mr.Speaker, this place is called the people's Maybe it should be called the Russia House because this is the way they legislate in Russia, completely closed, no opportunity for different ideas to be brought before the Congress and debated.  I have never, in all my years in Congress, experienced a more authoritarian approach to legislating than I have in this I have never encountered a more closed Congress than this Congress is.  This is not right, and it should not be considered normal. Not only Democrats should be outraged, but Republicans ought to be outraged as well.  You know, I wish my Republican friends had learned something from the collapse of their healthcare bill a few weeks ago. They rushed to the floor a bill cobbled together in the dark of night, filled with bribes and backroom deals. In fact, to strong-arm Members into voting for the bill and to correct for all the technical drafting errors that occurred thanks to their secretive process, there were not one, not two, not even three, but five--that is right, five--separate manager's amendments filed with the Rules  Now, let me explain that.  Only the people who wrote the bill were allowed to amend it. They wrote it so quickly, so sloppily, that they had to amend their amendments. I mean, this would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. And even after all of that, they were not able to piece together votes within their own Conference, and the bill imploded.  Well, it was a mess from beginning to end; and, to put it bluntly, the process was a disaster. Don't take it from me. Listen to Sean Hannity of FOX Now, don't adjust your television set. I am actually going to quote FOX News--and Sean Hannity, at that. I can't believe that he and I agree on something.  Here is what he said. According to a CNN report, he said: ``Now, this legislation was flawed from the beginning. It was created behind closed doors. Not one single Member saw the bill until it was rolled out. And that made it a disaster.''  That is Sean Hannity, one of President Trump's biggest cheerleaders, one of the biggest cheerleaders of my Republican friends. Here he is trashing the Republican health bill. And if that is not a wake-up call for Republicans, I don't know what is. You know, if Republicans are being criticized on their process by Sean Hannity, they have a serious problem.  Now we are reading that Republicans are again huddling in back rooms in the Capitol in an effort to resurrect their terrible plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, strip important protections away from our constituents, and put insurance companies in charge of our health care. There it is on the front page of today's Washington Post: ``GOP Presses for New Health Plan.''  Now, I haven't been invited to any of these secret backroom negotiations, but from what we are hearing, it isn't good. It seems that things are not looking good for hospitals. MassDevice alerted us to the fact that: ``Hospital Stocks Fall as GOP Looks to Revive TrumpCare Bill.''  It appears as though Republicans are still working to make their bill even more devastating. Mother Jones reported: ``TrumpCare 2.0 Still Isn't Cruel Enough to Satisfy Conservatives.''  Yesterday, Tribune Media Wire wrote about: ``How the Revised TrumpCare Plan Could Hit Americans with Preexisting Conditions.''  I include in the Congressional Record, Mr.Speaker, an article that appears in today's New York Times about how the latest health proposal weakens coverage for preexisting conditions.                [From the New York Times, 4, 2017] Republican Health Proposal Would Undermine Coverage for Pre-Existing                                Conditions                        (By Margot Sanger-Katz)       Throughout the debate to repeal and replace the Affordable      Care Act, President Trump and Republican congressional      leaders have insisted they would retain a crucial, popular      part of the health law: the promise that people can buy      insurance even if they've had illnesses in the past.[[Page H2710]]       Their efforts foundered last month, when a House health      bill had to be pulled from the floor after it failed to      attract enough support. Late Monday night, word emerged that      the White House and the group of conservative lawmakers known      as the Freedom Caucus had discussed a proposal to revive the      bill. But the proposed changes would effectively cast the      Affordable Care Act's pre-existing conditions provision      aside.       The terms, described by Representative Mark Meadows,      Republican of North Carolina and the head of the Freedom      Caucus, are something like this: States would have the option      to jettison two major parts of the Affordable Care Act's      insurance regulations. They could decide to opt out of      provisions that require insurers to cover a standard, minimum      package of benefits, known as the essential health benefits.      And they could decide to do away with a rule that requires      insurance companies to charge the same price to everyone who      is the same age, a provision called community rating.       The proposal is not final, but Mr.Meadows told reporters      after the meeting that his members would be interested in      such a bill. To pass the House, any bill would need to find      favor not just with the Freedom Caucus, but also with more      moderate It would also need to attract the      support of nearly every Republican in the Senate to become      law.       The ability to opt out of the benefit requirements could      substantially reduce the value of insurance on the market. A      patient with cancer might, for example, still be allowed to      buy a plan, but it wouldn't do her much good if that plan was      not required to cover chemotherapy drugs.       The second opt-out would make the insurance options for      those with pre-existing conditions even more meaningless.       Technically, the deal would still prevent insurers from      denying coverage to people with a history of illness. But      without community rating, health plans would be free to      charge those patients as much as they wanted. If both of the      Obamacare provisions went away, the hypothetical cancer      patient might be able to buy only a plan, without      chemotherapy coverage, that costs many times more than a      similar plan costs a healthy customer. Only cancer patients      with extraordinary financial resources and little interest in      the fine print would sign up.       There is a reason that many conservatives want to do away      with these provisions. Because they help people with      substantial health care needs buy relatively affordable      coverage, they drive up the price of insurance for people who      are healthy. An insurance market that did not include cancer      care--or even any cancer patients--would be one where      premiums for the remaining customers were much lower. The      result might be a market that is much more affordable for      people with a clean bill of health. But it would become      largely inaccessible to anyone who really needs help paying      for medical care.       We do not have to speculate to know what the world looks      like without essential health benefits and community rating.      It was how most state insurance markets worked before      Back in 2009, most sick people who did not get      insurance through work or a government program were excluded      from coverage if they had a history of health problems like      allergies or arthritis. Plans that did not cover pregnancy      care or drug addiction treatment were widespread. (The data      about individual market insurance premiums is a little      spotty, but it appears that they were substantially lower in      most states.)       One idea Republicans have about how to care for the sick      was also in effect pre-Many states had ``high-risk      pools,'' where people shut out of the traditional insurance      markets could buy special plans with the help of state      subsidies. The Freedom Caucus proposal is likely to include      some money that states could use to set up such pools.       ``The fundamental idea is that marginally sick people would      pay with risk associated with their coverage,'' Mr.Meadows      said ``Those that have, you know, premiums that would      be driven up because of catastrophic illness or long-term      illnesses, we've been dealing with that for a long time with      high-risk pools.''       But insurance in the old high-risk pools tended to be      expensive, and often came with long waiting periods or      benefit limitations, even for the very sick.       The main difference between the policy environment in 2009      and today is that the federal government would now be      offering tax credits to help healthy people buy what would      probably be relatively skimpy plans. That would mean that      more middle-income Americans would probably have health      coverage than before the Affordable Care Act, since the      combination of policies would tend to make insurance much      more affordable for people who are young and healthy.       What states would choose to do with this set of options is      hard to predict. Before Obamacare, few states required      community rating of health plans. And few states required      insurers to cover all of the benefits deemed essential under      Obamacare, though most did require a few types of treatments      to be covered. State governments would face a difficult      choice: either take away the requirements, and leave sick      patients without insurance options, or keep them and see      people unable to afford coverage under the new subsidy      system.       Under Obamacare, states can already waive many of the law's      insurance rules if they can show that an alternative program      would cover as many people with comprehensive coverage at a      lower cost to the government. But that standard is difficult      to meet. Mr.Meadows suggested that the waivers under      discussion should be ``very easily granted'' to states.       The politics of health care in the United States have      shifted since the Affordable Care Act was passed seven years      ago. In recent months, the law has grown more popular, and      the pre-existing conditions policy is among its best-known      protections. That could create political pressure for states      to keep the insurance rules, even if they are not required by      law. But it is likely that at least some states might decide      to eliminate them if they are made optional. Shifting norms      about health insurance regulation may also affect the idea's      reception in       Mr.Meadows said that the proposal presented to the Freedom      Caucus would retain the pre-existing conditions policy. But      that would be true in only the most literal sense. The mix of      policies could allow insurance companies to charge sick      people prices that few of them could pay. And it could allow      them to exclude benefits that many healthy people need when      they get sick. The result could be a world where people with      pre-existing conditions would struggle to buy comprehensive      health insurance--just like before       Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I mean, preexisting conditions. Oh, my What are my friends thinking about?  And we are reading that essential health benefits are still on the chopping block.  You know, these are some of the main provisions of the ACA that people like, that people need, and that people deserve.  Protecting essential health benefits in people with preexisting conditions is our moral obligation. Taking these protections away from people would be cruel and unjust and immoral. I would say to my Republican friends: You don't have to do it.  But I guess we will have to wait and see until these secret negotiators emerge from their back rooms with details to share. And I will start getting ready for the next emergency Rules I am looking forward to that meeting because that will probably be the only time we will have to talk about the bill because I think it is probably too much to expect that my Republican friends would actually, this time around, hold a hearing. Maybe they will bypass a markup, but they will have to go to the Rules Committee in an emergency meeting, and we will probably look forward to another martial law rule.  But we are doing this bill today that no one has ever heard of. It was a noncontroversial suspension bill last year, but now we lift it up like it is the most important piece of business that we are facing in America today. You know, what about the urgent priorities facing our country?  I think it is clear that Speaker Ryan and the majority leader are grasping for filler legislation to keep us busy on the House floor so that the American people really don't see really how dysfunctional this majority really is.  Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Member of the Republican Conference, said, and I think he said it best last week when he said: ``It's pretty evident that we don't have the votes among Republicans to do, in essence, anything that's real.''  Maybe that is why we are wasting our time this week on these bills instead of moving an infrastructure package or finishing the FY17 appropriations process, which should have been finalized last year.  I will remind my Republican colleagues that our government runs out of funding on April 28. That is 5 legislative days from now, since we are going on break at the end of this week. Now, maybe, again, this is a radical idea, but maybe we should be dealing with that today.  I am beginning to give up hope for regular order in the appropriations process under the Republican leadership, but I would have thought we would at least have some insight about a funding bill by now. Again, 5 legislative days from now, the government potentially could be shut down.  Maybe some of you think that the underlying legislation that this rule would allow us to consider, a bill to increase the number of companies that are exempted from certain SEC regulations, is vitally important. Maybe you are being inundated with calls about this issue. I don't know. Maybe your townhalls are overflowing with people[[Page H2711]]demanding this SEC suspension bill, but I am certain that no Member of this body could say with a straight face that this is somehow more important than keeping the entire Federal Government open.  For the life of me, I don't understand why we always have to get right up to the edge of the cliff, but here we are again. Today is just the latest example that the priorities of this Republican leadership do not serve the American people.  I would urge my colleagues to think about this as we spend time in our districts over the next 2 weeks. Maybe, when we get back, Congress can actually do its job and fund the government and focus on things that are important like a jobs bill or an infrastructure bill instead of more of the same Republican messaging bills.

154,topic-id,933,"Mr.Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I will close for our side.  Mr.Speaker, I want to alert my Republican colleagues to some recent polls that came out today. There is a poll that Qinnipiac did that said that Trump is more unpopular than Obama ever was, and, today, President Trump's approval rating is at 35 percent. That is down from 37 percent, and that is the lowest, I think, of any President this early on in his I think the lowest rating ever was President George It was at 28 percent, but it took 8 years, two unpopular wars, and a staggering economy to get to that point. But with President Trump, we are already at 35 percent. The Gallup Poll says his approval is at 39 percent.  By the way, the Affordable Care Act, according to Kaiser, now polls at 55 percent approval rating, and the Republican Congress is about as low as President Trump is right now.  I am trying to think of the words to help my colleagues understand what these polls mean. I guess ``not good'' comes to mind, or ``very, very bad.'' I don't think, even if you tried, you could get poll numbers so low so early on in a new Congress or so early on in a new administration.  I would say to my friends the reason for this unpopularity is the way you are conducting business in our government, that the closed processes that are being used with regard to legislation I think are unprecedented. There has never been a more closed Congress than this one. You were pretty closed last session as well. This is a terrible pattern.  I agree with my friend, Mr.Buck, on one thing he said. The gentleman said yesterday that good process produces good policy, but perhaps equally as important, good process helps instill faith in this institution. I agree with that. I could have said those remarks here today.  My question is: If that is the case, why are my Republican friends tolerating a process on healthcare reform that is now going on that is being done behind closed doors in some back room somewhere in this building with no input from patients or patient advocate groups or doctors or nurses or hospitals or anybody who has anything to do with health care? Why, on something so important, is the process so closed and so restrictive and so secretive?  I will tell you, just as this closed process led to a disastrous Republican healthcare bill recently, this continued closed process will lead to more disaster. This is not the way we should be doing the people's business. So we[[Page H2714]]strongly object to the way the Republicans are running this House and, in fact, the way the President is handling this issue as well.  It is always nice to see Vice President Pence in the hallway when he is walking back and forth, but it would be better to see him in a public setting talking about what the administration's priorities are, not rushing from one back room to another back room to another back room trying to make secret deals to get more people to vote for something when they have no idea what is in the legislation. That is not the way of doing business. So we object to the process.  Again, I urge my colleagues to also vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can have an opportunity to see President Trump's tax returns. Every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax returns, every major Presidential candidate, and every day we read in the newspaper about more and more potential conflicts of interest between the President and his family. I have to tell you, we are on a collision course with corruption. The President has promised to drain the swamp. He has created a cesspool, and it should be of concern to every single person in this Chamber, Democrat and Republican alike.  I don't think it is too much to ask for transparency when it comes to the person who is our Commander in I shudder to think if Hillary Clinton had won the Presidency and didn't release her tax returns, the outrage that would be coming from the other side of the aisle. I can't even imagine how much outrage would be coming from them.  Yet when Donald Trump hides his financial information from Congress and the American people, there is silence; people don't want to know. Well, the majority of people do. Poll after poll show the overwhelming majority of Americans want to know what is in his tax returns.  Why is this such a state secret? Why can't people see what they want to see and what they have been given with every other President?  So this is an opportunity to put this issue behind us, and if there is nothing controversial in his taxes, well, then this issue goes away and we can talk about something else. But maybe there is something he is hiding. Maybe there is something that we should be concerned about. Maybe there are conflicts of interest that might be constitutionally questionable. Maybe there are ties to Russia that would cause my colleagues on the other side of the aisle more concern.  This idea of hiding this has to stop. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and vote ``no'' on the underlying rule.

It is, in fact, a great piece of legislation, and I am proud to close now on that bill.  We have the opportunity today to improve access to capital for America's entrepreneurs and startups. The men and women who start companies in this Nation put everything on the line. They give of their time and their financial resources. They give of their weekends and evenings and vacations.  Our economy relies on the small businesses that these men and women create. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. They provide jobs and important products and services. They contribute to the life of their communities.  If we want to grow our economy, if we want to increase hiring, if we want to improve our quality of life, then we need to unleash America's entrepreneurs and startups. That is why we need to support this bill.  We must expand access to credit for small-business owners. We need to make it easier for angel investors to take a risk on young companies. We are not asking the American taxpayer to take a risk or spend any money on this. We are simply asking the Federal Government to allow angel investors to join together in larger groups to invest in promising young American companies.  I am encouraged that this bill represents a bipartisan effort to make small-business owners in this country more rewarding. When the cost of starting a small business is outweighed by the reward, our country will benefit from the resulting innovation and job creation. We simply need to give entrepreneurs the tools they need to succeed, and one of those tools is access to capital.  America's entrepreneurs and startups need H.1219. Americans who want to work for small businesses need H.1219. Americans who want to buy great products, access incredible services, and visit amazing websites all need H.1219.  I thank Chief Deputy Whip McHenry for introducing this important bill, and I thank Chairman Hensarling for bringing this legislation before us. I also thank Representative Velazquez, Representative Hollingsworth, Representative Sherman, and Representative Gottheimer for cosponsoring this legislation.  I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote ``yes'' on the bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 242 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require      the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and      certain candidates for the office of the President, and for      other purposes. All points of order against consideration of      the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the      bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and      controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority      members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and      Government After general debate the bill shall be      considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All      points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At      the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the      Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with      such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous      question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and      amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion except one motion to recommit with or without      instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports      that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the      next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the      third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.305.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend[[Page H2715]]     the rule because the majority Member controlling the time      will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the      same result may be achieved by voting down the previous      question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous      question is defeated, control of the time passes to the      Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous      question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may      offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of      amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

179,topic-id,3494,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the nomination of Congressman Ryan Zinke to be Secretary of the  The Secretary of the Interior is one of the most important jobs in the Federal Government and even more so for people in the I know the Presiding Officer would agree with that.  The Department of the Interior has an incredibly broad portfolio. It is responsible for managing our Nation's public lands, our national parks, our national wildlife refuges, and overseeing mineral and energy development on our public lands and in our Federal waters offshore, making sure that the taxpayers of the United States get a fair deal for the resources that the public--the public--actually owns. The responsibilities of the Department of the Interior also include ensuring that tribal trust responsibilities are met, as well as attending to our insular affairs. The Secretary of the Interior also manages a large part of water resources in Western States--again, which I know the Presiding Officer knows so well because there are so many issues related to drinking water and hydroelectric facilities that affect millions of our citizens.  So it is a far-reaching and diverse portfolio, and it requires the Secretary[[Page S1459]]to take into account not only the demands of the extraction industry--the oil, gas, coal, and hard rock mining companies--the Secretary, above all, must protect the public's interests.  I think the public could probably best understand this by knowing what happened in the Gulf of Mexico and the implosion that happened with the Deepwater Horizon well. Here, the Department of the Interior and minerals management resource agencies, in my opinion, should have been doing a better job of protecting the public and protecting that vital resource.  The conclusion of hearings after this fact found that there were many recommendations to clean up and streamline the minerals management agency so that it was not catering to the interests of the oil and gas industry, but making sure that it adheres to what is the public interest. Now all that has been made famous in a movie, which many of the public I think should go to see. Taking shortcuts when it comes to extraction of mineral resources is not a good idea, and having an Interior Secretary who makes sure we manage these resources well is critical to our  Also, the outdoor recreation industry, in and of itself, in my opinion--and I am sure in the opinion of many others here who understand it--has become a juggernaut. I will talk about that in a little bit. It is an economy in and of itself. It is worth preserving. It is worth fighting for. It is a source of tax revenue, income, jobs, and, most importantly, a quality of life that so many Americans hold dear. I have been so touched by the letters I have gotten from veterans, who have said to me on their returning back from Iraq and Afghanistan that having the wonders of the outdoors as a place for peace and sanctuary has been so critical to them. They have argued in support of important programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and others, to make sure that our public lands are there for them to enjoy and for their children to enjoy in the future.  So, in short, the Secretary must balance the short-term demands of developing resources on these public lands against the need to protect the environment and sensitive areas and preserve that natural heritage, as I said, for future generations. It is very important that we have a Secretary who understands what our Nation's leading stewardship responsibilities are, understands what those special places are, like the Grand Canyon, and other places such as Mount Rainier, and makes sure they are protected.  I had hoped to be able to support Congressman Zinke's nomination based on his assurances that he would manage the Department of the Interior as a Teddy Roosevelt However, I cannot ignore the Trump administration's plans for our public lands and resources, and I cannot ignore Congressman Zinke's commitment during our committee hearings to work to implement President-Elect Trump's energy independence policy, as well as a variety of positions on returning Federal land, taking public lands off the protection that they deserve today. These are very important public policy issues, and I note that President Trump has said to many people: ``My Cabinet is free to say whatever they want.'' So the fact that these important policies are going to be implemented that may erode what has been decades of policy for us in managing our public resources is quite concerning to me.  What exactly is the Trump administration's plan? Clearly, the Trump administration intends to pursue an aggressive agenda when it comes to mining and drilling on our public lands and waters. The President and his senior advisers have made clear their intention to undo what are reasonable protections put in place in environmentally sensitive areas. The administration will renew its efforts to reverse protections of important onshore and offshore areas. Based on energy plans posted on the White House website immediately after the President's inauguration, the President seems to be committed to simply opening up as much Federal land as possible to coal mining and energy development.  The administration has said it will use money from drilling and mining on all our public lands and waters to pay for a multibillion-dollar infrastructure package. My constituents want to know where they draw the line. Where does that stop?  The administration has already suspended rules ensuring polluters on our public lands don't have to pay their fair share. The President has signed into law a measure gutting the Obama administration rule that would have prevented coal companies from dumping toxic chemicals into our Nation's rivers and streams. So it is clear to me that the new administration will do everything it can to reverse the responsible management of our public land and instead pursue an aggressive energy development policy without regard to the environmental and public health consequences.  The bedrock principle, I believe, is that polluters should pay and they should clean up their messes on public lands. We may all have a different opinion here about how much public land should be developed, but I think everybody should be in agreement that polluters should pay, and they should leave our public land in a pristine nature.  It is equally clear that the new administration will be encouraged in this effort by the majorities in the House and the Senate by some of the legislation we have already seen, such as enabling coal companies to dump their mining waste into streams and impacting State drinking water, enabling oil companies to waste the public's natural resource without paying royalties on the gas they waste--that is costing taxpayers money--and reports that the President intends to issue an Executive order to overturn the current moratorium prohibiting new coal leases on Federal land. That is an issue about getting a fair deal for the taxpayer. The taxpayer is impacted by this coal extraction. Coal companies, instead of doing the job it takes to extract coal without an impact on the public, are taking Federal resources and making lots of money without responsibility to the taxpayer.  The previous Secretary, Secretary Jewell, basically said, for the first time in many years, that they would look at what the industry was paying as far as coal royalties. That process is underway, and we think it should be carried out. We think the taxpayer deserves a fair deal.  Unfortunately, I am not convinced that Congressman Zinke will be willing or able to moderate the Trump administration's extreme views on exploiting our public lands, and I am not sure he will be willing or able to stand up to the President to protect the public interest and ensure that our public lands are managed and protected for the benefit of all Americans--not just the oil, gas, and mining companies and their commercial interests.  The Secretary's principal job is to be a guardian, a steward of our public lands. To me, stewardship is so important. So many of my colleagues come to the floor and act like they are managing this resource for their lifetime and their generation. Stewardship is about managing these resources for future generations as well. If our past ancestors had been so callus with these Federal resources, where would we be today? It is so important that we not look at these Federal lands so narrowly as a source of natural resources that someone has in their particular State or interest but also to make sure that stewardship protects these resources for future generations as well. With that in mind, I have seen several laws and regulations under attack that are fundamental to keeping that mission of stewardship at the Department of the Interior, including the Clean Water Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the Clean Air Act, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, and the Antiquities  While Congressman Zinke said he would oppose the transfer of Federal lands to the States, which I appreciate, at the same time, he has indicated he is willing to consider transferring away management of certain Federal lands to the  What does that mean? For example, you could have a monument or a designation of Federal land--it could be even Mount Rainier or some beautiful place in the Pacific Northwest--consequently transferred back to the State and that particular State--it wouldn't happen in Washington but might happen in some other State--decides to start managing that land and extracting resources. You might think that[[Page S1460]]couldn't possibly happen. I have news for you. That is the debate du jour. This is exactly--exactly--the debate today.  Last Congress, Congressman Zinke cosponsored and voted for a bill to transfer to the States management of red snapper fisheries in Federal waters. He supports transferring Federal management responsibilities to the States, and it clearly undercuts the commitment to Federal resources.  We also know he has previously supported efforts to restrict use of the Antiquities Act to designate national monuments. In fact, he appears open to efforts to weaken or repeal certain recently designated national monuments. He has indicated one of his first priorities, upon confirmation, will be to visit Utah to consider a Republican proposal to rescind the recently designated Bears Ears National This is despite the strong support of many across the Nation and in Utah, as well as tribal support from the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, representing the five affected tribes in the region.  As somebody who enjoys the outdoors, I can state how important it is to be able to go and recreate. I have not been to Bears Ears, but I have heard incredible stories from climbers and those interested in seeing this unique terrain that it is a very special place.  As we enter this debate, the issue of the Bears Ears National Monument and whether they are going to roll back Federal land protection will be at the center of this discussion. Created by President Obama, Bears Ears encompasses 1.3 million acres of beautiful desert hills, mesas, sandstone canyons, spiritually significant lands to local tribes, and some of the best crack climbing in the world. The climbing community loves to recreate there.  The conservation community and tribes have fought for many years for this designation. If and when he is confirmed, Congressman Zinke will be under intense pressure from some quarters to try to undo this designation. In fact, heated debate on this subject boiled over just a week ago as the Outdoor Retailer show decided to leave Salt Lake City, after two decades and contributing at least $40 million to the economy in various shows that they had each year there, because of Utah's stated desire and the congressional delegation's interest in basically claiming Federal lands and selling them off for extraction from the oil and gas industry.  I was so proud of retailers, such as REI in my State or others such as Patagonia, Black Diamond, Outdoor Research and others, basically put their money where their mouth is. They decided that if a State was going to attack the very economy that was so important to them in jobs and recreation, that they were going to do something about moving their impacted industry somewhere else.  I would like to read what the Salt Lake Tribune editorial board had to say about this issue.  ``In the same week Utah announced that it had topped $8.17 billion in annual economic benefit from tourism, the $40 million Outdoor Retailer show announced it was leaving.  ``Surely we can take a half-percent hit, right?  ``The exit of Outdoor Retailer is so much more than just losing the State's largest convention. There will be hospitality jobs lost, and hotel rooms from Sandy to Ogden vacant for those two weeks a year. We're now building a 900-room downtown convention hotel--with public bonding authority--largely on spec. There is now no convention currently on Salt Lake City's docket that demands it.  ``The reason Outdoor Retailer is leaving--their rejection of Utah's political leaders' values as shown in the stubborn and pointless fight against a Bears Ears National Monument--should make this moment a turning point.  ``In the 1960s, Utah found itself at a confluence. One flow was fed by a collection of downtown Chamber of Commerce types who hatched a longshot bid to obtain the 1972 Winter They knew they wouldn't win, but they saw it as a chance to sell Utah's ``Greatest Snow on Earth.'' It was the first time Utah took its outdoor tourism message to the world, and it was well received.  ``The other flow came from a fundamental change in the American people, who were waking up to the natural world and the treasures in their own presence. In Utah, there was recognition that we held those treasures. A national park was created in Canyonlands, and national monuments in Arches, Capitol Reef were elevated to national parks. Utahns of all creed and color united in their pride of our shared national icons.''  I am sure the Presiding Officer also agrees with the concept, being from the home of the Grand Continuing to read from the editorial:  ``Where once we were a peculiar backwater, we became known the world over. Were it not for pioneering efforts, there would be no ski industry. No No Sundance Film No Flat Tire No steady stream of tour buses climbing to Bryce No $8.17 billion per year.  ``Losing Outdoor Retailer over Bears Ears represents a reversal of a half century of progress in inviting the world to appreciate Utah.''  ``The seeds of that failure were shown in the rejection . . . of the unprecedented unity of five Indian nations coming together to protect their ancestral homeland.

180,topic-id,1189,"Mr.President, I think that editorial puts this debate squarely in front of my colleagues. We have a nominee who has been all over the map as it relates to public lands, and, certainly, he has been on record that he will implement the President's strategy. I know he plans to visit this area, and I am so concerned that it will be the first of many areas in which people run over the larger public and national interests in order to preserve special places just for immediate extraction when, in reality, the jobs from the outdoor economy are just as important and, if you add up numbers, may be more important economically in both the near term and the long term.  I should also note that those of us in Washington would gladly welcome the outdoor retailers with open arms. I am sure they will consider many different places, but we understand that protecting our most treasured places not only preserves them for this generation but for future generations, and it helps drive an economy.  In Utah, outdoor recreation is responsible for $12 billion in consumer spending--more than twice the value of oil and gas produced in that If we are talking about top dog economics, the outdoor industry wins. In Washington State, the outdoor economy supports 227,000 direct-paying jobs and wages of $7.1 billion. Nationwide, it is 6.1 million jobs and $646 billion in revenues from outdoor recreation, so this is a very valued part of the U.economy. It is also a very valued part of the American spirit.  Not only do the Bears Ears National Monument and others like it benefit county, State, and Federal coffers, but they also offer access to our shared heritage. As I said, it is that spiritual connection to nature that is so valuable to all of us, but I hold so dear that our veterans cherish it so much too. They deserve the relief of being able to go to our greatest and beautiful places and have some solace.  A second major responsibility of the Secretary is to manage the mineral resources that are on public lands and waters. One of the fundamental principles of the public resource management is that the American people should receive a fair market value for the energy and minerals that are extracted from our public lands. These resources are owned by every  I think, sometimes, people get confused that these are the rights of these industries, that they own them. We have allowed that extraction and the leasing of that extraction, but we need to make sure that the taxpayers' interests and the costs of impact are well represented and that extraction is done in an efficient manner--that it protects the resources for the future, that it cleans up its mess, and that polluters pay.  An important principle is that our public lands be managed so that their use will not permanently harm the land or the environment and that, in allowing companies to mine on public land, they must minimize the harm they do, clean up the messes they make, and repair and pay for the damage. ``Polluter pays'' should be a basic principle.  The Secretary of the Interior must be committed to preserving and enforcing those important principles and to making sure that the taxpayers get a fair deal. The previous Secretary, as I said--Secretary Jewell--took important steps to advance those principles. On her watch, the Department issued its new stream protection rule, its methane venting and flaring rule, its mineral valuation rule, and the comprehensive examination of its coal leasing program.  Most of these initiatives involve updating existing policies that have been in place for 20 or 30 years. That is just another way of saying that whether the taxpayer is getting a fair deal by allowing these companies to mine these Federal resources has not really been evaluated for 20 or 30 years, so I am sure my colleagues could understand that that kind of updating should take place. During these three intervening decades, technology has improved and science has advanced, and we need to make sure technology recognizes that, when pollution happens, it needs to be cleaned up.  Attacks on Secretary Jewell's public health and taxpayer initiatives are already underway, and I am concerned that Congressman Zinke will not stand up to make sure that the policies of ``polluter pays'' are followed and that the good work that has already been established is continued. At his confirmation hearing, Congressman Zinke stated that the war on coal is real and that he supports lifting the coal leasing moratorium. This is completely contrary to the rational view of energy market dynamics, and it is at odds with the energy policies our constituents expect.  While Federal coal leasing is an issue of national concern, it is also critically important in my They want to make sure that taxpayers get a fair deal for the leasing of that land. As people have discussed here on the floor, the advent of natural gas and its cheap value has done more to drive down the use of coal than any of this discussion about whether taxpayers are getting a fair deal.  Finally, the Secretary of the Interior must be committed to upholding our trust and treaty obligations for our country's 567 federally recognized tribes. That Secretary must be committed to recognizing tribal sovereignty and self-determination, protecting tribal lands and waters and mineral resources, and supporting adequate resources for tribal education, social services, and infrastructure.  Congressman Zinke has been a strong advocate of the Crow Tribes' coal resource in his home State; and while I respect his responsibility to his district, he will be required as Secretary of the Interior to have a much different position in representing all tribes across the United  I know that some of my colleagues think that one can be expedient on any[[Page S1462]]of these issues whether it is on the Antiquities Act or on coal leasing or on making sure that we live up to tribal sovereignty. In reality, it takes very little to sign an Executive order; it takes a lot to overrule the law of the land. Many of these issues will end up in court, and many of them will be battled for several years. I would suggest to my colleagues that we find a common interest in preserving our stewardship, in preserving our natural resources, and in continuing to develop this kind of economy moving forward.  I am not convinced that Congressman Zinke is going to show the leadership on these resources that is necessary, given his very different views on public lands as a Congressman--on all sides of the issue. We need someone who is going to stand up, just like those in Utah did, and say that the outdoor economy is worth it. The designation of public lands, as done by the President of the United States, should be preserved, and we should continue to fight for something that is providing so many jobs and such a great connection for so many  I yield the floor.

2,topic-id,1056,"Mr.President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today on behalf of Delaware's congressional delegation--Senator Chris Coons, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester and myself--to honor the exemplary service of MG Frank Vavala, the adjutant general for Delaware for the past 18 years. As Governor of Delaware, I had the distinct pleasure of nominating him to serve as Adjutant General in February 1999, and I believe to this day it is one of the best appointments I have ever made. Over the past 17 years, General Vavala has been responsible for the mission readiness of all Delaware National Guard units for both Federal and State missions. He served as a cabinet member and trusted military adviser to me when I was Governor, as well as to the three Governors who succeeded me: Governor Ruth Ann Minner, Governor Jack Markell, and Governor John In January 2017, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general Delaware, becoming the first three-star general to lead the Delaware National  During General Vavala's tenure, the Delaware National Guard has deployed close to 11,000 soldiers and airmen to support our State and country. Nearly half of them were deployed abroad to Bosnia, South America, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan, among other countries. Once in theater, these men and women accomplished almost every mission imaginable. They ran entry control points, provided security, established and maintained communications and conducted medical evacuation from the battlefield. They also transported supplies, patients, personnel, and dignitaries in both UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and C-130 aircraft. Back at home, the Delaware Guard activated nearly 5,000 soldiers and airmen to provide support during 11 snowstorms, 8 hurricanes--including Hurricane Katrina, where hundreds of Delawareans went to help in Mississippi and Louisiana just 24 hours after the devastating storm made landfall, 1 tornado, dozens of floods, Noreasters, and three Presidential inaugurations. General Vavala oversaw all operations as soldiers and airmen helped transport emergency workers and patients, evacuate flooded areas, get residents to shelter, safety, and medical assistance, and even set up emergency communications around the state.  Like many successful leaders, General Vavala did not keep regular office hours. He routinely came to work early, stayed late, and worked on weekends. He was known for taking the time to recognize, thank, console, and care for everyone under his command from the newest private to the most senior officer. He valued every person who wore the uniform equally. I have met Guard men and women for years who say that when they were in a time of need, General Vavala was there for them, even if it was just taking time to drop them an email or note. Sometimes they wondered how he found out about what was going on in their lives, but however he did it, he found out. He prioritized his soldiers and airmen over his own career. Instead of focusing the spotlight on his individual accomplishments, General Vavala put the focus on his soldiers and airmen, and it made his career a success by default.  In addition to holding dozens of leadership positions in the Delaware Guard, General Vavala held prominent national positions as president of the Adjutants General Association of the United States and chairman of the board of the National Guard Association of the United States, During his tenure as chairman of the board, NGAUS was the main driver responsible for passing one of the most significant pieces of military legislation in a generation--the National Guard Empowerment General Vavala provided key testimony before the House Armed Services Committee and was instrumental in advocating for the passage of this important legislation. In January 2012, Delaware's 146th General Assembly passed H.10, recognizing General Vavala for his leading role in helping to reshape the U.military.  General Vavala is from a proud military family, having served with both his father, COL Frank Vavala, and brother MSG Gerard Before serving as Adjutant General, he worked full time for the DuPont Company, where he was employed as marketing services supervisor for 31 years. He has been honored with the Anthony of Padua Founders' Award and the Italian-American Man of the Year He also cares about his community, organizing food drives for the Food Bank of Delaware, and he is a person of deep faith who takes seriously what the Bible tells us about caring for others and focused that into his career as Adjutant  I believe General Vavala has been successful in no small part because he possesses some of the finest leadership qualities that I have ever observed in a military leader. Frank Vavala understands that leaders are humble, not haughty. They have the heart of a servant. They understand that their role is to serve, not be served. General Vavala leads by example. It is not do as I say, but do as I do. He knows that the best leaders aren't afraid to keep out of step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune. Leaders unite, not divide. They build bridges not walls. They are aspirational--purveyors of hope, if you will--and they appeal to our better angels. Like the very best leaders, Frank has always sought to do what is right, not what is easy or expedient. He embraces the Golden Rule and treats other people the way he would want to be treated. General Vavala surrounds himself with the best people he can find. When his team does well, he gives the credit to them. And when the team falls short of the mark, this leader takes the blame. Finally, when General Frank Vavala knows he is right, he never gives up. As a leader, General Frank Vavala is in a class of his own, and he is one whom other leaders, both civilian and military would do well to emulate.  On behalf of Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, let me wholeheartedly thank General Vavala for his service to our country and our The leadership and commitment he modeled helped keep Delaware and our Nation more safe and secure. Today, we are honored to be able to offer General Vavala our sincere congratulations on a job well done. From our hearts, we wish him and his wife Jane, who he has been married to for 50 years--along with their children Anne, Jane, and Nick and their three granddaughters--many happy, healthy, and successful years to come.

38,topic-id,2201,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Representative Zinke to become Secretary of the  As is always the case, I take this opposing position with some trepidation. Having served as the Governor of my State, I appreciate the importance of deference to a chief executive's decisions to build his or her team, but at the same time, I think we in the Senate have a constitutional obligation to provide our advice and to provide our consent because in the end not all nominees are best for the country we are pledged to protect.  Some of my western colleagues may wonder what stake a small State like Delaware on the east coast would have in the selection of a Secretary of the It turns out, there is plenty.  As the chief land steward of our great Nation, the Secretary of the Interior will be asked to manage our collective interests in the conservation, use, and appropriate management of the abundant land, wildlife, mineral and other resources found on our public lands. For that reason alone, we should expect a firm commitment from such a leader that the American taxpayer will receive full value for private use and profit from the use of our Nation's resources, and we need assurances that the use of those resources will not abuse the quality of life for Americans while enhancing the profits of a very limited few.  That, I am very sad to say, does not appear to be Mr.Zinke's track record.[[Page S1464]]For example, as a Congressman, I am told he opposed the Federal coal leasing moratorium ordered by his predecessor, Secretary Some would call this an appropriate reaction to an alleged War on Coal, but let's just take a moment to take a closer look.  As you know, I live in a small State, Delaware, that is, as it turns out, getting smaller almost every day. With each passing tide and every coastal storm, a part of us--our land--disappears forever. We are fighting a valiant and, some would say, futile war against an encroaching sea. This is not a result of variability in weather patterns or long-term trends in ocean dynamics, this is climate change at work.  We are not alone in feeling the effects of our Nation's dependence on and robust use of carbon-based fuels--like coal--over the past couple of centuries.  There are Native Alaskan communities that have to move in their entirety. Think of that. They have to move in their entirety because tides, storms, and waves--assisted by the absence of ice that used to protect them from fierce winter storm surges--are literally eating away at their communities. I am trying to imagine what it would be like as a family to get the news that you have to leave a place that has been your home for generations, the place from which your ancestors derived their sustenance, honored their forbears, and raised their legacies.  I also can't imagine being a person who represents those people and families, having to help them come to grips with the realities of a changing world that we--if we act quickly and assertively--can begin to stabilize.  It means a whole lot to us in Delaware that we take a very careful look at when and how we use the bounty of mineral resources under our public lands. At the very least, that should include--as Secretary Jewell's order envisioned--an assurance that we, as Americans, are paid a price for the coal and other public resources our lands provide that matches the value they represent.  It is the least among us who need our government's help, not those with the most.  We should also, as Secretary Jewell's policy recommended, be aware of and responsible about the climate change implications of the coal sales from public lands. If we humans, as Mr.Zinke admits, are responsible for our changing climate and the fact that my State is slowly eroding away, then we should embrace--not ignore--the commonsense wisdom of the former Secretary of the Given the chance to agree with this common sense in his response to questions from my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Mr.Zinke repeatedly demurred.  Continuing on this theme, Mr.Zinke, in response to questions from Energy and Natural Resource Committee members, supported the Congressional Review Act resolution to eliminate the Obama administration's rule to curb wasteful releases of methane from Bureau of Land Management land-based operations--yet another example of willingness to sell the American people short in favor of a handful of energy companies.  Wasted gas is wasted public revenue. Let me say that again. Wasted gas is wasted public revenue. Wasted methane is adding yet more of a very potent greenhouse gas to our atmosphere.  Given the opportunity to reflect some concerns for Americans, our climate, Delaware's and Alaska's shorelines, and our global obligation to put a lid on climate contributions, this nominee demurs.  We have seen this pattern of helping the few at the expense of the most across the board with too many of this President's nominations. I believe this is ultimately un-American, unwise, unfair, and unacceptable.  I am also concerned with Mr.Zinke's stance toward the use of the Antiquities Act by the President to designate lands as national monuments. Specifically, during his confirmation, we heard a willingness from Congressman Zinke to take the legally uncertain step of revisiting the use of the Antiquities Act by the President to designate lands and historic sites across the Nation as national monuments.  Undermining the Antiquities Act is--I believe and a lot of people believe--bad for conservation, is bad for historical preservation, and is bad for economic development opportunities associated with national monuments and our national parks.  For those who don't know, the Antiquities Act has been used by Presidents dating back to the early 20th century--roughly 100 years--to preserve and protect our Nation's historic sites and preserve Federal lands for all of us--all of us--to enjoy.  During his time in office, President Obama utilized the Antiquities Act to safeguard and preserve Federal lands and cultural and historic sites. Ultimately, he designated over 550 million acres of land as national monuments, including what we call the Delaware national monument.  Delaware, as it turns out, has a special history with the Antiquities Act, which I will take just a moment to talk about today. Before Delaware saw the establishment of national parks in our borders, we had a national monument for a couple of years.  In 2013, President Obama recognized Delaware's important contributions to the founding of the United States, including its role as the first State to ratify the U.Constitution, by creating the First State National Monument, with our urging and support.  Before that designation, Delaware was the only State in the Nation that had neither a national monument or a national park. We were the first State to ratify the Constitution but until a couple of years ago no national park. We were the only State that was in that situation. Simply put, Delaware was missing out on tourism and economic development that a national monument or park can bring.  The economic opportunities afforded to States with national monuments and national parks, as it turns out, are significant--quite significant. Each State with a park or monument sees economic benefits of at least $1 million, I am told, if not much more, in tourism and economic development, and every year millions of Americans and countless others from across the world plan their vacations around America's national parks and monuments.  Believe it or not, if someone in some other country--whether it is Europe, Asia, Latin America, or Central America--if they are interested in coming to the United States, they go on the National Park Service website, and they look up all of the national parks and monuments across the country and decide which ones they might want to visit. The single most popular destination within the U.borders for tourists from other parts around the world, believe it or not, are our national parks. Isn't that extraordinary. The economic opportunities afforded to States with national monuments and national parks are significant--again, around $1 million or more.  Delaware's national park celebrates Delaware's rich colonial history as the first State to ratify the U.As it turns out, the Constitution was first ratified on December 7, 1787.  Many years before that--maybe 150 years before that--the first Finns and Swedes came to America, and they landed in what is now Wilmington, They sailed across the ocean in the Kalmar Nyckel and the Fogel Grip from Sweden and It was before they even had a Finland, and the Swedes and Finns were one.  They sailed through the Delaware Bay and north to the Delaware River and came to an uncharted, unnamed river that headed off to the west, off of the Delaware They went about a mile. When they came, there were a lot of big rocks along the coastline, and they landed there at the rocks. They declared that spot the colony of New Sweden, which later became Wilmington, They built a fort called Fort Christina, and they built a church, the Old Swedes It is the longest continuously operating church in  About 15 miles south of that spot on the Delaware River is actually the river they sailed up on and planted their flag, the Christina They named it after the 12-year-old child Queen of Sweden, but about 50 miles south of the Christina River, further down the Delaware River, is a town of New There is a big statue of William Penn in the town of New Castle, and it is because William Penn first landed in America--not in an area[[Page S1465]]close to Philadelphia where they have Penn's He landed in New Castle, DE, and he brought with him the deeds to the land that later became Pennsylvania and  Further down the coast toward where the Delaware Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean is a town called Lewes, Lewes, DE, was settled by the Dutch, the first time unsuccessfully. The settlers lost their lives. The second time they came back in greater numbers and successfully settled Lewes, DE, and it endures to this day.  The Brits didn't much like the idea that the Dutch had a foothold in that part of Delmarva, in what is now Sussex County, DE, and one night many years ago--several hundred years ago--the British surrounded Lewes, DE, which was then inhabited by the Dutch, and they burned it to the ground. The next morning when the sun came up, there was one house standing in Lewes, DE, and it was Ryves Holt It is believed to be one of the oldest standing houses in all of North  If you drive up from Lewes headed north on Route 1 toward Dover Air Force Base, just before the Dover Air Force Base is a colonial plantation called the Dickinson Plantation, named after John Dickinson who was a penman, an early writer who spoke about and wrote some of the early writings that had been cited and encouraged the colonists in what is now America to rise up against the tyranny of the British  As you go a little further up Route 1 to Dover and go to downtown Dover, you come across an area where there used to be a tavern called the Golden Fleece Tavern, and that was the place where, on December 7, 1787, after three days and nights of debate and discussion, luckily, 25 early colonists decided to ratify the Constitution, which had come down the week before from We were the first State to ratify the  A few years before that, a fellow named Caesar Rodney, who had been president of Delaware and later held any number of offices in the State even before it was a State, actually rode his horse right past the area where the Golden Fleece Tavern was--where the Constitution was ratified--and rode his horse all the way up to Philadelphia, PA, in order to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the Declaration of That is a little bit of the history of  The National Park Service decided 3 years ago that the early colonial settlement leading up to the ratification of the Constitution is what made Delaware unique, and our national park includes a number of those different components.

It started off really as a national monument from the Antiquities Given that kind of history, we need to make sure that future administrations and future Presidents have the ability to utilize the Antiquities Act to safeguard the country's history, protect the outdoors for all of us to experience and to enjoy.

303,topic-id,1834,"Mr.President, I come to the floor witha lot of other folks to talk about the health care in this country. I think one of the goals we all share--and maybe we are notsure how to get there--is how to make sure that everybody who needs access to health care has it, that it is affordable, and thatthey get reasonably good quality, whoever they are and wherever they come from.  When I was a naval flight officer, we usedto fly a lot of missions out of Japan during the Cold I have a special interest in Japan, and I like the folks there. Theyare pretty remarkable in what they have achieved over the years. One of the things they have achieved over the years isproviding pretty good health care for a fairly modest amount of money.  We started working on the Affordable Care Act 7 or 8years ago. One of the things I learned about Japan was that they were spending 8 percent of their gross domestic product forhealth care in their country. We were spending 18 percent. As it turns out, they were getting better results. They had lowerrates of infant mortality and higher rates of longevity. People lived longer. Newborns died less frequently than we did. On topof all that, in Japan they covered everybody. Everybody was covered for health care. We had about 40 million people--over 40million people at the time--whose health care coverage was to get into an emergency room of a hospital, try to get in line, andget someone's attention.  I know how smart the Japanese are, but I don't think they can be that smart and we can be thatdumb. That is sort of where we were 6, 7 years ago. So we said: What are we going to do about it?  I think almost everyPresident--maybe since Truman--had a goal of making sure everybody in this country had access to health care. A lot of folkstalked about it and maybe tried to do something. The first time we had a serious effort to do that was during the Clintonadministration, not led by President Bill Clinton but led by First Lady Hillary What she came up with and worked on wassomething called  The Republicans came up with an alternative to HillaryCare introduced by the RepublicanSenator from Rhode Island, John Chafee--a really good guy, a very able guy. I actually served with his son Lincoln in the Senate.But in 1993, 1994, when most people focused on HillaryCare, John Chafee introduced legislation with 20 or so A couple of them are still here, I think. Senator Orrin Hatch was one of them, and Senator Chuck Grassleyof Iowa was one of them--maybe a couple of Democrats, as well. But 20 to 25 Senators, mostly Republican, cosponsored the  This chart mentions the Chafee bill and what was included in the Chafee legislation. One of the things includedwas the individual mandate--basically, that everybody had to get coverage.  Second was the employer mandate, which basicallysaid that employers had to provide health care coverage for their employees--maybe not for everyone, maybe not for the smallestbusinesses--but getting employers to meet what Senator Chafee and other Senators thought were the employers' obligations, theirresponsibilities.  In the Chafee legislation there was a ban on preexisting conditions.  In the Chafee legislation therewere subsidies for purchasing insurance. Purchasing it where? Purchasing it in State exchanges. The idea of creating largepurchasing pools--there were folks who didn't have health care coverage who could get their health care coverage in a largepurchasing pool. If their income was low or relatively low, they would be eligible for tax credits to buy down the cost of theirhealth care coverage. They would get theirs from the exchanges and the purchasing pools.  Those were all ideas in SenatorChafee's legislation in 1993. Do you know what? I am a Democrat and probably shouldn't say this, but I thought they all madesense.  The legislation didn't go anywhere. In the end, HillaryCare didn't go anywhere. But long before we had serious debateon the Affordable Care Act, people were talking about the same thing.  You go over here--RomneyCare in 2006. Individualmandate: Got it. Employer mandate: Got it. Ban on preexisting conditions? Subsidies for purchasing insurance? Yes.Establish State purchasing groups? Those are all in  I have always given Governor Romney credit for the ideaof the individual mandate, but apparently that was wrong. It was in Senator Chafee's legislation as well. Governor Romney tookthe handoff, if you will, from Senator John Chafee and introduced what they call RomneyCare in It was introduced in 2006.  When it first was introduced, they had real good success in getting people covered. Itwas successful in terms of getting people covered. Where they were not so successful initially was affordability. They had towork on affordability. Part of the problem there was it took a while for the healthier, younger people who did not think theyneeded health care coverage because they were young and invincible. It took a while for them to start.  They said: The finekeeps going up year after year after year. Maybe I should get some health care coverage and not pay the fine. Ultimately, Ithink RomneyCare did a much better job on affordability.  If you take those five key provisions, the individual mandate,employer mandate, ban on preexisting conditions, subsidies for purchasing insurance, and establishing the State exchanges--keyprovisions in the Chafee bill--they are in Believe it or not, they are in the Affordable Care  I know some ofour Republican friends think that nobody listened to them when we wrote the Affordable Care Actually, these are your ideas.These are your ideas. Some of the provisions or aspects of the Affordable Care Act that our friends across the aisle have beenmost critical of are things that were originally their idea--originally their idea.  Then we changed this thing. SenatorSanders who has joined us on the floor. We added to that. We expanded We said to States--we didn't make themexpand Medicaid, but we said: If you do, the Federal Government will pay the lion's share of the increased costs in Ithink initially maybe 24 States signed up and said: We will do that, including the District of Later on, another sevenor so, eight States--I think Indiana is one of those that decided, under then-Governor Pence, to expand Medicaid up to aboutroughly 135 percent of poverty from maybe closer to 100 percent of poverty for most  That is a little bit of a goodhistory lesson. I think we have another chart we can look at. It is a pie chart. Sylvia Matthews Burwell came by--the Secretaryof Health and Human Services came by a month or two ago and talked to our Democratic Senate caucus. One of the things she saidto us that I thought was especially informative was she talked about this pie chart.  What she said is: Think of this piechart. It includes about 300 million Americans who get health care, at least those who get some kind of health care other thanemergency room. She told us that roughly half of the people, a little bit more than half of the 300 million people among theAmericans who are getting health care--a little over half, 57 percent--get their coverage through employer coverage. The employersprovide that as a condition of employment. Another roughly 22 percent--that is this area, sort of the brown area--is Medicaid and[[Page S237]]the S-CHIP program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a bipartisan idea. Bill Roth worked on that, the Clintons,and others. I even worked on it as About 15 percent--this area right here, the green--is Then down here youhave the individual markets, the marketplaces, and so forth.  There are roughly 5 or 6 percent down here where people aregetting their coverage. A lot of the attention, a lot of the criticism of the delivery of health care in the last 6 or 7 yearsby our friends on the other side has been down here with the marketplaces, the exchanges. Those were their ideas.  One of thenice things the Affordable Care Act has done--not many people know this--but the Medicare trust fund, which is in danger ofrunning out of money, the life of that trust fund has been extended by 12 years because of the Affordable Care The Medicaidpieces have been--the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Matthews Burwell, has negotiated with a number of Governorsto try to give them the opportunity to sort of customize their Medicaid programs.  I think maybe in Indiana they wanted tohave a small copay for the people who participated in That is what they got. So it is not all one size fits all, butthere is some differentiation between Now we have roughly two-thirds of the States that have signed up for  So that is just a little visual. Do we have another chart here? The question is, Who gets hurt by repealing theAffordable Care Act? If we just repeal the Affordable Care Act, and we don't replace it at the same time we repeal it or changeit, a lot of people will get hurt, including a lot of people who are in the exchanges and getting health care coverage maybe forthe first time in a long time, and actually folks who are not in the exchanges, people who get their health care coverage in allkinds of ways, including employer provided, Medicare, and Medicaid, or privately purchased.  We don't need the kind ofuncertainty, the lack of predictability that would be created by repeal without having a very clear picture of what we are goingto replace it with at the same time--not a year from now, not 2 years, not 3 years, not 4 years from now but at the same time.That is what we ought to do.  I will close with this. I note one of my colleagues from a big State up to the northeast of ushas a few things he wants to say. I welcome hearing him.  My dad used to say to my sister and me when we were kids growingup, a little younger than our pages--we would do some bone-headed stunt, and he would say to my sister and me: Just use somecommon sense. That is what he would say. Just use some common sense. He said it a lot. We must not have had much.  Well, justrepealing the Affordable Care Act and not having something to replace it with immediately that provides coverage just asgood--affordable, comprehensive coverage--that would not be very good common sense. We can do better than that. We can do better.  I hope our Republican friends, with this rush to judgment to repeal and replace 2 or 3 or 4 years down the line, can comearound and say: No, that does not make much sense. I hope they will listen to some of their colleagues and some of the rest ofus who say: If we are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, let's know what we are going to replace it with, and make sure wedo that on day one.

248,topic-id,2512,"Mr.President, I rise today to offer a few comments about the House Republican bill that was just unveiled yesterday. Those who have been promoting it or those who have been working on this issue for a couple of weeks are claiming it is a new healthcare plan or a new comprehensive healthcare proposal--in essence, by their argument, a replacement if the Affordable Care Act were repealed. I disagree. I don't believe in any way it is a plan. It might be a bill, but I think a better description of it in terms of its impact would be that it is a scheme, not a plan. It is a scheme that will roll back coverage gains from the Affordable Care Act, which is better known by a longer name: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Kaiser--one of the great institutions that track healthcare data and healthcare policy--told us that there are 156 million Americans with employer-sponsored coverage. Those Americans didn't have much protection before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with regard to preexisting conditions or annual lifetime limits--a whole series of protections for people that were not there before that.  This scheme, as I am calling it, will not only roll back coverage gains in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in the process it will also devastate the Medicaid Program, leaving many of the most vulnerable Americans behind.  Another impact of this scheme will be to increase costs for middle-class families while cutting taxes for millionaires or multimillionaires as well as big corporations. It will raise the cost of care for older Americans and substantially cut funding for hospitals in rural communities.  How did we get there, and where are we going based upon the House Republican proposal? Last night the Republicans released their bill to ``replace'' the Affordable Care Act, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee will be marking up the bill tomorrow. I guess it doesn't require much reading to get to a markup tomorrow.  Usually when you introduce a bill, the bill is reviewed by Members of There is some public debate on it. There is some back-and-forth. And then a period of time later, maybe weeks, there is a markup. The committee engages in a thorough review of the bill, and the markup means they make changes. They add amendments or try to alter the bill in one way or another. That is a serious approach when you do this work of legislating on a serious issue.  Healthcare is about as serious and difficult an issue as there is. I think it should be accorded the serious review that the complexity and the consequence of this issue demand. This is not a serious proposal. It is a scheme, but it is also not a serious process that the House seems to be focused on right now. This process means the House will mark up this bill within I guess about 48 hours of it being unveiled, maybe less than 48 hours. That means there will not be a single hearing on the bill or getting the bill scored, which is a fancy Washington word for having someone tell us what it costs. There will be no thorough review, no serious review on such a monumental issue called healthcare and what happens to hundreds of millions of  At the same time, the markup will proceed with lightning speed, and there will not be any information on the record about an analysis of the bill that is thorough and serious, and of course we will not know how to pay for it and we will not have the score that will tell us how it will be paid for and what the cost will be.  It is hard to come up with the words, but the impact of this bill would be a disaster. If you are a millionaire and up, you are doing quite well under this bill. You are going to get a bonanza from this bill. You are going to have a great payday. If you are a child or you happen to be a senior or if you are a woman or if you are an individual with a disability or a chronic disease, you are out of luck. You are in big trouble. I would hope that those Americans would have the benefit of a serious review of a serious issue. If the bill is not serious, I guess they are going to ram it through. We will see what happens in the next couple of days.  There is one analysis that should be on the record. There are some that are hot off the presses. This is a report released today that I am looking at. It is about 2\1/2\ pages. They know the vote will take place soon in the committee--two committees, maybe in the This report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is moving quickly to keep up with the fast pace at which the bill is proceeding. I won't read the whole report, and I won't enter the whole report into the Record; I am sure people can go online and look at it. Here is the title of the report: ``House GOP Medicaid Provisions Would Shift $370 billion in costs to states over a decade.'' It is written by Edwin Park, who has been writing about Medicaid for a long time. Few Americans know more about Medicaid than Edwin Park and people like him who study it. I will read the first sentence, which gives you the basics of it: ``The new House Republican health plan would shift an estimated $370 billion in Medicaid costs to states over the next ten years, effectively ending the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion for 11 million people while also harming tens of millions of additional seniors, people with disabilities, and children and parents who rely upon Medicaid today.''  That is the opening line of this proposal, which I believe is a scheme. What does that mean for Medicaid?  One of the basic debates we will have here is what happens to Medicaid itself, and we will have a lot of debates about other aspects of the implications for the Affordable Care  Here is what it means. It means that 70 million Americans who rely upon Medicaid--again, they are children in urban areas, children in rural areas, children in small towns who get their healthcare from It is a lot of individuals with disabilities, a lot of children with disabilities who benefit from It is also, of course, pregnant women, as well as seniors trying to get into nursing homes, because we know that a lot of seniors can't get into a nursing home unless they have the benefits of The idea in the bill on Medicaid that is objectionable, among other objections I have, is a so-called per capita cap. This idea limits Federal contributions to a fixed amount. If the caps are not tied to overall increases in healthcare spending, the net effect is fewer healthcare dollars over time so they can afford the tax cuts they want to have as part of this scheme.  We have heard a lot around here about flexibility, that States want more flexibility when it comes to I will tell you what they don't want. They don't want a flexibility argument to be a scheme that results in cuts to those States, where the Federal Government says: Here is a block grant that may increase or may not, but good luck, States, as you balance your budgets.  Of course, Governors and State legislators balance their budgets, and they have very difficult choices to make--sometimes choices the Federal Government never makes. That is why some Republican Governors took advantage of the Medicaid expansion and expanded healthcare to a lot of people in their That is one of the reasons they are worried about--and some will oppose this idea of so-called per capita caps or block-granting of Medicaid or the like.  If we have a proposal to cut $370 billion from the House, what does that mean for some of those groups that I just mentioned earlier? Well, we know that more than 45 percent of all the births in the United States of America are paid for by Medicaid, so that is a consequence for pregnant women and their children. One in five seniors receives Medicaid assistance by way of the benefit to someone trying to get into a nursing home. Medicaid also pays for home-based care for seniors and, of course, long-term care as well. What if you have a disability? Over one-third of the Nation's adults with disabilities who require extensive services and support are covered by  We know that in a State like mine--because we had a Republican Governor[[Page S1629]]embrace the Medicaid expansion, and then we had a Democratic Governor embrace it and really develop it and bring it to where it is today--we have expansion of Medicaid that resulted in some 700,000--that is not an exact number, but it is approaching 700,000 Pennsylvanians gaining coverage through the Medicaid expansion. And 62 percent of Americans who gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion are working. So we are talking about a lot of families and a lot of individuals who are working and getting their healthcare through That opportunity presented itself because, in the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid was expanded.  There are lots of numbers we could talk about. I will give maybe two more. Medicaid is the primary payer for mental health and substance abuse treatment. Medicaid expansion enabled 180,000 Pennsylvanians to receive these lifesaving services. If you are a Member of Congress and you have been going home and talking about the opioid crisis--and to say it is a crisis is a terrible understatement. It has devastated small towns and rural areas. It has devastated cities. It has destroyed families. We know how bad it is. Some of the numbers indicate it is getting worse, not leveling off. If you say you care about that and you supported the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act as a Member of Congress and you supported the funding that was in the 21st Century Cures Act at the end of the year, and you say you are working toward help for communities devastated by the opioid crisis, it is OK to say that, but you can't then say: But I want to support the House Republican proposal on Medicaid, when Medicaid is the primary payer for these substance abuse treatment programs.  I mentioned before adults and children with disabilities. Medicaid covers 60 percent of children with disabilities. We know the range of that--ranging from autism to Down syndrome, to traumatic brain injury, and many other disabilities or circumstances that I have not mentioned. For a lot of people, this is real life. It is not some theory that gets kicked around Washington, often by people who have good healthcare coverage as they are talking about cutting healthcare for others. We have a lot of testimony from what we might want to call the real world.  One of the most compelling pieces of correspondence I received in my time in the Senate was from a mom about her son. Her name is She is from Coatesville, That is in Southeastern Pennsylvania, within the range of suburban She wrote to tell me how important Medicaid is to her family and to tell me about her 5-year-old son She sent me a picture of Rowan with a firefighter's hat on. Of course, he is fascinated, as we all are, by the heroic work of firefighters. Her story--I will not go through her whole letter, but she got news a couple of years ago that many parents get in the course of the lives of their children. She got news in March of 2015 that her son Rowan was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The diagnosis was made by a psychologist who worked for the Intermediate Unit--meaning the institution that works for the school districts and helps to provide special education. Rowan continued in the preschool program and daycare program before and after school, but then Pam goes on to say:       I was never able to find a daycare suitable for all of      Rowan's needs. In late January of 2016, I applied for      [Medical Assistance].  I will stop there for a moment to explain. Medical Assistance is the State share of the State end of the Medicare We call it Medical Other States have a different name for it.  Pam said she applied for Medical Assistance:       After Rowan was awarded this assistance we were able to      obtain wrap-around services, which included a Behavioral      Specialist Consultant . . . and a Therapeutic Staff Support      worker.  Pam goes on to say, and I am quoting her again:       Without Medical Assistance, I am confident that I could not      work full time to support our family. . . . [We] would be      bankrupt and my son would go without the therapies he needs.  These are the therapies I just mentioned. Then Pam goes on to say, urging me as one of her two Senators to focus on her son, focus on her family when we are casting votes and having debates about policies that relate to healthcare and Here is what Pam asked me to do as her Senator:       Please think of . . . My 9-month-old Luna, who      smiles and laughs at her brother, she will have to care for      Rowan late in her life after we are gone. We are desperately      in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and would be devastated      if we lost these benefits.  So said Pam about her son and about the importance of the Medical Assistance Program, which is known on the national level as I would hope that those in the House, as they are quickly marking up legislation that would have a huge impact on families like Pam's and many more--I would hope they would think of Rowan, think of his little sister Luna and what her challenges might be years from now when she would likely have to care for Rowan and answer some of Pam's questions.  There are a lot of questions that we have about policy and numbers and budget impacts, and they are all appropriate. But some of the most important questions we have to answer for those who are asking them are questions that our constituents are asking. And one of those is We have to be responsive to her concerns about her son and the challenges her son faces.  I hope, in the midst of debate, in the midst of very rapid consideration of a complicated subject on a bill that has been slapped together--in my judgment, too quickly--that Pam's concerns would be an uppermost priority in the minds of those who are working on this legislation.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

285,topic-id,1431,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the Medicaid Program, a program that I am sure a lot of folks in Washington and around the country hear about a lot. We talk about it a lot, but I am not sure that people around here have a real sense of what it means to folks back at home.  Medicaid is a program that is more than 50 years old now. In some ways, the name doesn't convey the scope of it. In some ways, I wish it had a different name because it would remind people who benefits from it.  Instead of referring to it as the Medicaid Program, if you called it the ``kids, seniors, and folks with disabilities program,'' or something like that, you would be accurately describing the scope and the reach of the program because it has a profound impact on the lives of children, on the lives of older citizens trying to get long-term care in nursing homes, and, of course, it has a huge impact on individuals with disabilities.  We know that in the campaign, President Trump made a statement. I am not quoting him exactly, but it was a brief statement during his campaign, and it was in writing that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or I think a lot of people had forgotten about that third one.  One of the tasks that we have in the Senate is to make sure that, when a statement like that is made, any President is held accountable to that promise.  The examples I could cite are many about the impact of Just a couple are significant. Not by way of exclusion, but I will just mention a few.  I am holding here a March of Dimes document. It is an issue brief by the March of Dimes, and it is entitled ``The Value of Medicaid.'' I won't read it all, but here is just one fact that I am not sure a lot of people know. ``Medicaid covers 45% of all births''--and they have a footnote for that. I am not sure there are many in Washington who know that. But that is why I referred to it earlier in a more informal way as ``the baby program,'' because all of those children come into the world paid for by  Medicaid has a substantial impact on rural families, rural America, and rural hospitals. By one estimate a couple of years ago, First Focus, one of the advocacy groups here in Washington that tracks issues that relate to children, estimated that as of 2012--and I doubt that it has changed much since then--more than 45 percent of rural children got their health care through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance So almost half of rural children were benefitting from one program or the other.  Here are just a couple more. One in five seniors receives Medicare assistance through Medicaid, and that includes premium assistance, cost sharing, long-term care, dental care, and vision care.  Another important number is that two-thirds of nursing home residents are covered by  I mentioned children before and the profound impact it has on their lives. Medicaid covers 40 percent of all children in the country. I mentioned CHIP and Medicaid combined covering almost half of rural children. Just Medicaid alone covers 40 percent of all children--rural, urban, and everywhere in between. If you just consider low-income kids, or children who come from low-income families, Medicaid covers some 75 percent of those children.  So there is a lot to talk about. But one issue that we are in the process of engaging on as an issue is: What will happen to Medicaid?  Despite what the President said when he was campaigning--and I am talking specifically about Medicaid--just this weekend, the administration announced--without much attention drawn to it at the time, but I hope increasingly more attention--that the administration would support block-granting That is at variance with what the President said. In my judgment, it is a total contradiction of what he said, and now, apparently, his administration has embraced the House Republican approach to Medicaid, which is block-granting.  There are a lot of ways to measure the impact of block-granting. One that I will just cite for the record is a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities dated March 15, 2016, entitled ``Medicaid Block Grant Would Add Millions to Uninsured and Underinsured,'' which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 15, 2016] Medicaid Block Grant Would Add Millions to Uninsured and Underinsured                            (By Edwin Park)       House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price's budget plan      would radically restructure Medicaid by converting it to a      block grant, cutting federal funding by about $1 trillion      over the next decade. It would also repeal health reform's      Medicaid expansion. The combined result would be a total      Medicaid cut of $2.1 trillion over the next ten years,      relative to current law, likely making tens of millions of      Americans uninsured or underinsured.       Repealing the Medicaid expansion means that at least 14      million people would lose Medicaid or not get it in the      future, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates.      In addition, the large and growing funding cut from the block      grant would almost certainly force states to sharply scale      back their Medicaid programs.       The Price plan would also repeal health reform's other      coverage expansions, including the subsidies to help people      afford marketplace coverage.       All told, not only would the estimated 20 million Americans      who've already gained coverage through health reform lose it,      but millions more who qualify for Medicaid apart from health      reform would likely lose their Medicaid coverage as well.      Tens of millions of Americans would likely become uninsured.       Under Price's ``State Flexibilities Funds'' block grant      proposal, the federal government would no longer pay a fixed      share of states' Medicaid costs, apparently starting in 2018.      Instead, states would get a fixed dollar amount of federal      funding, which would rise only modestly each year, as      explained below.       Block-grant funding would fall further behind state needs      each year. The annual increase in the block grant would      average about 4.3 percentage points less than Medicaid's      currently projected growth rate over the next ten years. In      the plan's tenth year (2026), federal Medicaid and Children's      Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funding would be $169      billion--or roughly 33 percent--less than under current law      (see graph). And the cuts would likely keep growing after      2026.       The block grant would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1      trillion from 2017-2026. A small share of these cuts could      come from CHIP which the Price plan would presumably merge      into the Medicaid block grant as in past House Republican      budget plans. Over the next ten years (2017-2026), the budget      plan would provide nearly 25 percent less in federal Medicaid      and CHIP funding to states than under current law--not      counting the lost federal funding for the Medicaid expansion.       The loss of federal funding would be greater in years when      enrollment or per-beneficiary health care costs rose faster      than expected--for example, due to a recession or new      treatment that improved patients' health but raised costs.      Currently, the federal government and the states share in      those unanticipated costs; under the Price plan, states alone      would bear them.       As CBO concluded in 2012 when analyzing a similar Medicaid      block grant from then-House Budget Committee Chairman Paul      Ryan:       ``The magnitude of the reduction in spending . . . means      that states would need to increase their spending on these      programs, make considerable cutbacks in them, or both.      Cutbacks might involve reduced eligibility, . . . coverage of      fewer services, lower payments to providers, or increased      cost-sharing by beneficiaries--all of which would reduce      access to care.''       In making these cuts, states would likely use the large      added flexibility that the Price plan would give them. For      example, the plan would likely let states cap Medicaid      enrollment and turn eligible people away from the program, or      drop benefits that people with[[Page S418]]     disabilities or other special health problems need.       The Urban Institute estimated that the 2012 Ryan proposal      would lead states to drop between 14.3 million and 20.5      million people from Medicaid by the tenth year (outside of      the effects of repealing health reform's Medicaid expansion).      That's an enrollment decline of 25 to 35 percent. Urban also      estimated that the Ryan plan would lead states to cut      reimbursements to health care providers by more than 30      percent. The Price block-grant proposal likely would mean      similarly draconian cuts.

286,topic-id,833,"Here is one of the headlines of that article, one of the basic inclusions by a respected organization that tracks this information. I will just read that headline: ``The block grant would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion from 2017-2026.''  So if you are saying you are going to protect children and you are going to protect seniors and you are going to make sure that those with disabilities don't have any problems going forward, it is pretty difficult to do that if you take a trillion dollars out of the Medicaid Program over the course of a decade.  There was an op-ed in the New York Times on Christmas It was interesting that it actually was printed on that holy day. There was an op-ed by Gene Gene is someone who many people in Washington know. But for those who don't, Gene served two Presidents; he served both President Clinton and President Obama as the Director of the National Economic  Here is one of the conclusions that Gene reached, based upon his research and his vast experience. I will quote him directly from the December 25 op-ed in the New York Times entitled ``The Quiet War on Medicaid'': ``Together, full repeal''--and there he means full repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act--``and block granting would cut Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program funding by about $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years--a 40 percent cut.''  So whether you look at it in terms of block granting's impact on Medicaid or the combination of that block-granting policy, which the administration has now embraced fully, and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the result of that is that you adversely impact two programs--the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Medicaid  Let me bring this back to real people. I just want to highlight a couple of excerpts from a letter I received recently, and then I will conclude.  This is a letter from Coatesville, PA, the southeastern corner of our State, a letter sent to me by Pamela I will just call her Pam, even though I don't know her personally.  She wrote me a letter about her son. Pam Simpson's son is She said that Rowan, who I guess is now 5 years old, back in 2015 was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She went on to say how much Rowan has benefitted from the Medicaid We call it Medical Assistance in  She said that among the services he received was the behavioral specialist consultant helping him and a therapeutic staff support worker. They received direct help, direct intervention so that Rowan could grow and benefit from those direct services.  She said that the agency that administers these kinds of wraparound services for Rowan and children like him--in this case, the Child Guidance Resource Centers--started a particular program focused on social skills, especially for children with autism.  But here is how she concluded her letter, and this is why I want to cite it in the context of this critically important debate we are going to have about Medicaid and the question of block granting, which sounds kind of benign; doesn't it? When you say it, it doesn't sound that bad. But in my judgment, it would be devastating to these families.  She said to me in the letter: Please think of my dear Rowan and his happy face, his big blue eyes, and his lovely strawberry blonde hair.  You can see him in these pictures that I should have mentioned earlier. Rowan is in these two different pictures, and there he is dressed as a firefighter.  She continued: Please think of me and my husband, working every day to support our family, and please think of my 9-month-old daughter Luna who smiles at her brother daily.  There is Luna in the picture, being held by  She says that she is worried that that little girl, when she is much older, will have to take care of Rowan later in life when Pam and her husband are gone.  She ends the letter this way: Overall, we are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and would be devastated if we lost these benefits. What she is referring to there, of course, is  I have real trouble believing that if the Trump administration's proposal on block granting Medicaid marches forward, now that they have embraced the proposal that Republicans in Washington have embraced for years--they had voted for block granting over and over and over again. Now it is a live issue. Now it is no longer just voting. Now it is an issue that could be enacted into law, and I think that would be a terrible step in the wrong direction.  So I think we have to remember that when we consider these budget debates, when we consider the debate about health care, and especially when we consider real families like Pam's and real children like  With that, I yield the floor.

191,topic-id,2298,"Mr.President, today I have the privilege, with Senator Collins, to introduce a replacement bill for ObamaCare, with her experience as an insurance commissioner and mine as a physician caring for the insured and the underinsured. Let me also give due credit to Pete Sessions in the House, who has introduced a very similar bill to come up with something that we think works not just for the people we represent but for the entire country. That is our goal.  I wish to speak on the Patient Freedom Act of 2017. Our goal, if you will--I tell my staff to imagine a woman who voted for Donald Trump and doesn't like ObamaCare, but she has breast cancer. Her coverage has a $6,000 deductible, but she has coverage. On the other hand, she wants to see something different. If we just view our efforts through the prism of her care, I think we will do right by the American people.  Let me say something else. Again, our goal is not to come up with a Republican plan; it is not to come up with an anti-ObamaCare plan; our goal is to come up with an American patient plan where, whoever she or he is, they can feel comfortable that, as a Senate, we are trying to do right by the American people.  Let's go to first principles. First principles is, we in the Republican Party think that if you like your insurance, you should be able to keep it. I will come to that later. President Obama was rightly criticized because he pledged that, and it turns out it wasn't true. That is one of our first principles, and we mean it.  Secondly, we think the States should have the power, not the Federal When you speak to Americans, they want their State capital to be the kind of principal force behind how their insurance is administered, not our Nation's Capital, so we return power to both the States and to patients.  Lastly, I will say that we are truly reaching out to One of the criticisms of ObamaCare is that it was rammed through on a partisan vote with hardly a consideration given of Senator Collins and I are absolutely open to working with Democrats for this solution.  How do we begin?  We first begin by repealing the ObamaCare mandates and penalties. The American people do not like Washington telling them how to live their lives. We take those mandates and penalties from both the individual and the employer and we take them off.  Secondly, we work to make health care truly affordable. We do this by giving States a choice to put in what we call the State alternative. I think we are going to begin calling it the better choice. In the better choice, we would use tax credits which would go to those who are eligible and which would go into an account. If the patient did nothing, she would have a[[Page S401]]health savings account, which will be pre funded. The money would go in, actually put money into the account--catastrophic coverage and a pharmacy benefit.  It is important to note that she would have power over this account. If she wished, she could combine it with her family's, these different tax credits, and they could buy a richer family policy, or she could assign it to her employer as the employee's contribution for an employer-sponsored plan.  If each member of the family decided to keep their own HPSA account and one of them got a terrible illness and went into the cash portion and exhausted their health savings account, we would allow family members to donate their health savings account balance to each other to help cover that cash exposure.  We do different things, but the goal is to give the patient the power.  Since we are going to these health savings accounts under the better choice model, in the better choice model, we give these tax credits that go into a health savings account. The individual can donate their own money, or the employer can contribute theirs. These are some of the options they have, but whichever options they have, we institute price transparency. That is to say that when the patient goes to have her blood test, she will know the cost of the blood test before she has it done as opposed to finding out later.  This came to mind this past I had a friend in town for the inauguration. She is a physician, and she went for a vitamin D level. When she went for the vitamin D level and got the bill, it was $290. She called the hospital and said: I order these all the time. Am I really getting a $290 charge on each of these?  They said: Oh, yes, ma'am. That is what we bill patients.  So she went to different labs and found out the cash price for the panels of labs she typically orders.  She had a patient who was from out of town and was paying cash. She said: Pay me $38; it will cover the labs. Here is the slip; go to the lab.  The patient paid $38 but went to the wrong laboratory. She was from out of town and not quite sure where to go. She went to the wrong laboratory. The bill she got, which in one lab would be $38, in the other lab was $690.  My physician friend called the hospital and said: You have to be kidding--$690?  They reduced it to $380. There is a tenfold difference in the cash price for labs. If the patient had known that, she probably would have paid more attention to the directions. But certainly if the price of the labs were posted when she went, even if she went to the wrong place, she could have looked at the fee schedule and decided she needed to go someplace else.  One of the young men who work with me said: Yes, I get it, price transparency. Who would buy a car without knowing the price beforehand? It would be great for the car dealer but really lousy for you. That is how we purchase health care now. It is great for the folks selling the service; it is pretty lousy for the person paying the cash.  By this, we think we begin to use market forces to reduce costs. By the way, this is not only about saving the patient money, which is very important, but here is another example.  John Fleming is a physician who until recently was a Member of the House of He tells the story of when their office went to a health savings account, a woman who worked with him came to him and said: Fleming, I don't like these health savings accounts. Previously I had a pharmacy benefit that paid for my inhaler, and now I don't have the same pharmacy benefit.  He said: Well, under their plan, at least, you can use the health savings account to pay for your inhaler, and, by the way, if you stopped smoking, you wouldn't need the inhaler.  Then he walks away.  Six months later she says to him: Fleming, you were right.  He didn't remember the conversation. He turns around and she says: Remember when you told me if I stopped smoking, I wouldn't need an inhaler? I stopped smoking and I don't need an inhaler.  So what this does is it activates the patient. It gets her or him engaged in their health care, and between that--not only do we protect the patient's pocketbook, but we also do something positive for their health care.  Let me also point this out. We think most States would go for the better choice. It is possible, though, that a State will reject everything and say: We don't want Medicaid expansion dollars and we don't want any extra help for those who have lower incomes. We would give States that choice. This is not Washington, DC, forcing something on people.  Let me also point out something else. Republicans believe that if you like your health care, you can keep it; if you like your health insurance, you can keep it, and we mean it. If a State decided they wished to stay on ObamaCare--I think it is a terrible decision--but this legislation would allow a State to do so.  I was so disappointed. I saw that the minority leader, Mr.Schumer, criticized our bill and said things that weren't true--fake news, if you will. He said we didn't cover preexisting conditions. We do. He said the deductibles and copays would be too high, which is not true, but what was striking is that he hasn't read our legislation yet.  This is what is wrong with Washington, Here we have something which in good faith would allow New York to stay in ObamaCare if the people of New York decided they wished to--but we can look at double- and even triple-digit premium increases in other Without reading our bill, other States are going to be condemned to these double- and triple-digit premium increases because folks don't want to consider something different. This is not a Republican plan. It is not a Democratic plan. We want it to be an American plan where States can decide the best system for their State, and if it is working for New York, it can stay in New It is not working for Louisiana so our State would go with the better choice, I am confident.  That said, please don't criticize the plan before you even look at it, and please allow those on the Democratic side who are down to one insurance company on their exchanges, with double-digit premium increases, to at least consider an option that would be good for their  Now, folks say: Well, you don't have a mandate. We don't think Washington, DC, should be telling people how to live their lives. So how do we, under our better choice, get the kind of big insurance pool without a mandate? We give States the option to do what we call automatic enrollment. If someone is eligible, they would be enrolled. The tax credit they receive would be adequate for their premium. They would never have to pay anything out-of-pocket to have this health savings account--high-deductible health plan and pharmacy benefit. It would be covered with the tax credit they receive. By doing so, all these young males who haven't signed up for ObamaCare because they are paying too much would actually be enrolled in an insurance plan. For those who get ill or have chronic conditions, they are spreading the cost of their expensive illness over the many healthy and not just over the few sick. It restores the law of big numbers.  We had an insurance plan model this, and they said they think just by doing our method of enrollment, it would lower premiums by 20 percent. That is without an individual mandate.  By the way, think of the folks who will never sign up for an ObamaCare exchange policy. The mentally ill person living beneath a bridge is not going to go to a public library. If he has his W-2 form, he doesn't know where it is. He is not going to fill out a 16-page, long-line form and sign up for Under our policy, he could be automatically enrolled. So if he goes to the urgent care center with cellulitis, he has coverage. If something terrible happens--if he is hit by a car, and goes to the emergency room and is admitted to the hospital, society is protected from major expenses. If he gets his life together enough, he has a pharmacy benefit providing those antipsychotics. So we actually think we would increase the number who truly need health care to the number of those who are covered.  Let me finish up by speaking about our timeline. We hope that over this next year, Republicans and Democrats can come together. I understand Democrats will not vote for a reconciliation[[Page S402]]bill that begins the repeal process of ObamaCare, but that almost certainly will pass. What we hope is that sometime within this year, Democrats who live in States with only one insurance company on their exchanges, in which premiums are increasing by double--and maybe even at that time in their States triple digits--will come together to vote with us to give their State an option for our better choice. So we would pass that legislation in 2017, giving their State legislatures and Governors the option to choose this pathway in 2018; and in 2019, the States would implement their option of choice; and by 2020, it has all been done.  That is our hope.  Folks say Senator Collins and I are naive; that the Senate cannot overcome its partisanship; that inevitably it will be so partisan, people, without reading the bill, will criticize our legislation, saying things about it that are not true.  I go back to where I started, to that woman who didn't go to college, working hard, voted for Trump, doesn't like ObamaCare but has breast cancer. She needs coverage, and she wants something done for her. We want to give her the power. We want to give her that coverage. My goal is that when this finishes, as she goes from cancer to health, the only thing she knows about her coverage is that the decisions about her health care are made in her State Capitol and around her kitchen table, and that as her breast cancer is treated, her health coverage improves. That is our goal. It is not a Democratic plan or a Republican plan. It is not a partisan plan. It is a plan for her. That is our goal.

306,topic-id,1213,"Mr.President, as we continue to debate health care, there are some things that arekind of being debated that I call monkey dust. When two gorillas fight, they try to confuse each other by throwing dust up inthe air. It has nothing to do with the substance of the fight but rather is only meant to distract the other side. That is partof what this kerfuffle, if you will--people raise per-beneficiary payments as if that is something pernicious, something thatshould be avoided, something which is bad.  First, we are setting this kind of in the perspective of  Let mespeak about per-beneficiary payments. For those who are in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the Federal Governmentmakes a per-beneficiary payment to the insurance company to cover that Federal employee. For those States which have a Medicaidmanaged care company contract, the State makes a per-beneficiary payment to the Medicaid managed care company. That is a per-beneficiary payment. The reason I like this is because, inherently, the dollar follows the patient.  Now we are speakingabout this in the context of a Medicaid reform program. Why should Medicaid be reformed? That is the question. Let's speak aboutour current Medicaid system. It is bankrupting States and the Federal Government.[[Page S239]]  In 2009, for the first time, theamount of money spent by States on Medicaid exceeded what they spent on education. Ever since then, Medicaid's expenditures aregoing up, and education expenditures are going down. Despite all this money, we get poor outcomes. Medicaid typically paysphysicians below their cost of seeing a patient.  I pointed out in my speech yesterday that the week ObamaCare passed theHouse of Representatives, Robert Pear, the New York Times journalist, wrote an article in the New York Times following cancerpatients on Medicaid in What Mr.Pear found was an oncologist who had so many Medicaid patients she was goingbankrupt. Indeed, she had to begin to discharge those patients from her practice because she could not pay her bills. We trackeddown one of those patients who was featured, and she died 2 weeks after being discharged from the practice.  Medicaid pays sopoorly that physicians cannot afford to see large numbers.  That said, it isn't just an anecdote from this New York There is a study out of MIT for the National Bureau of Economic Research, I believe it is, that found that with all themoney spent on Medicaid, the beneficiary only receives 20 to 40 percent. The rest goes to institutions.  If we speak about aper-beneficiary payment, substantially all of that money goes to the patient. Under the current scenario, out of an MIT study,only 20 to 40 percent does.  Go back to the oncologist who couldn't afford to see the patients because her reimbursementswere so low. What if the rest of that money, which was not being attributed to the patient, instead could go to pay her doctor,then the patient would have never been discharged.  By the way, on average, States spend 17 percent of their State dollars onIn my own State of Louisiana, it is 19 percent, and in my State this has increased, nearly doubling from the year2000.  Let's go back to the per-beneficiary payment, where the dollar follows the patient, as in, by the way, the insuranceplans that people have under ObamaCare on the exchanges. There is a subsidy that goes to the insurance company that thenprovides for the patient. The dollar follows the patient. So the per-beneficiary continues to do that.  Folks say: Well,there is not enough money in Medicaid; therefore, we have to somehow do things differently. The models we use in privateinsurance will not work in the Medicaid population.  We looked up the SEC report for a Medicaid managed care company, and theMedicaid expansion population, they get $6,000 per enrollee. I just met today with an insurance company that was discussing therates they are going to give on the exchanges next year. It is going to be roughly $5,500 per enrollee will be a year's premium.  So think about this. Those in the Medicaid expansion population have more Federal dollars going to support them than thosecitizens, those fellow Americans who are receiving their insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges. Yet we continue to hear from theMedicaid patients that they have problems accessing specialists.  There is more money in Medicaid than in the privateinsurance market, but the Medicaid patient can't see a specialist because the patient's specialist is being paid below cost andcannot afford to see the patient. There is something incredibly wrong here.  By the way, I should also point out that inStates in which Medicaid is expanded, another MIT study found that 60 percent of those who go on the Medicaid expansion droppedprivate insurance--dropped private insurance--which means they go from kind of paying their own way to the taxpayer paying forthem.  My own State of Louisiana recently expanded It might not have been 60 percent of those on the Medicaidexpansion dropped their insurance, but I am told by the chief insurance company that I think about 70 to 80,000 people droppedprivate insurance to go on Medicaid; 60 or 70 or 80,000 people stopped paying for themselves and asked taxpayers to pay forthem.  That is OK if you are the person going on You no longer have a deductible or a copay. I understand ObamaCareexchanges have $6,000 deductibles, and maybe that is what they had to do, but if we are going to come up with a sustainablesystem, that is not an answer.  What I do is encourage that there be a per-beneficiary payment, that the money follow thepatient. Again, for those who say it is some terrible thing to have a per-beneficiary payment, they are ignoring all theevidence of how it is good. Think of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Probably if somebody is watching onC-SPAN, their spouse or their own policy they get through their employer, the employer pays the insurance company a certainamount of money per employee and per employee family member.  We could also do what Indiana has done. In their HealthyIndiana Plan 2.0, they made per-beneficiary payments, if you will, to Medicaid enrollees, giving them a health savings accountand covering their catastrophic expenses. They found that the Hoosiers who enrolled in this used 40 percent less charity carethan those with traditional insurance. These are all Medicaid patients.  Folks say: Oh, my gosh. Health savings accounts per-beneficiary payments can never work for the poor.  In this case, 70 percent of those enrolled in this program were below theFederal poverty level. Yet, nonetheless, they contributed to their own They continued making those contributions andaltered their behavior to become more cost-conscious, better consumers of health care.  I always say don't underestimatepatients. In my own practice, for 30 years, I worked in a hospital caring for the uninsured, and although the uninsured don'thave some of the advantages in life that others have, they can take care of themselves. They know what is right and what iswrong in terms of their own interests.  So let's make those per-beneficiary payments. Let's not be distracted by those whosomehow make this a bad thing. Let's believe in the American people, that they can handle their own health care and that theydon't need a Washington bureaucrat to tell them how to live their health care lives.

48,topic-id,949,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act, which I have introduced with my friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Our legislation aims to help ensure that our seniors and disabled citizens have timely access to home health services available under the Medicare program.  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of healthcare services, particularly in rural and medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be in scarce supply.  In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in 1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services provided by those health professionals as long as those services are within their scope of practice under State law.  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home healthcare services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only physicians are allowed to certify or initiate home healthcare for Medicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the patient's case as the nonphysician provider.  In fact, in many cases, the certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the patient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home healthcare. At best, this requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps to the process before home healthcare can be provided. At worst, it can lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home care that they need simply because a doctor is not readily available to sign the requisite form. The inability of these advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for our seniors in medically underserved areas, where these providers may be the only healthcare professionals who are readily available.  For example, needed home healthcare can be delayed for up to days at a time for Medicare patients in some rural towns in my State of Maine, where nurse practitioners are the only healthcare professionals and the supervising physicians are far away. A nurse practitioner told me about one of her cases in which her collaborating physician had just lost her father and, therefore, understandably, was not available. But here is what the consequence was. This nurse practitioner's patients experienced a 2-day delay in getting needed care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another doctor.  Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ludicrous that she can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute facility but cannot order home healthcare. How does that make sense?  One of her patients had to wait 11 days after being discharged before his physical and occupational therapy could continue simply because the home health agency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation of the very same therapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to authorize when the patient was in the facility.  Think about that. Here we have a patient who is in a rehab facility, for example, or a subacute facility or a nursing home--a skilled nursing home--and that patient is ready to go home, but the chances of successful treatment of that patient--of that patient regaining function--is going to be diminished if there is a gap between the physical and occupational therapy and the home healthcare nursing that the patient would receive at home if there is no physician available to do the paperwork.  So that simply does not make sense. I would wager that it leads to additional cost for our healthcare system because, if that essential home healthcare is not available in the patient's home, the tendency is going to be to keep the patient in the facility for a longer period of time to avoid the gap in treatment. Yet we know that it is much more cost effective to treat the patient in his or her home. We also know that for many patients, that is their preference as well. They would rather be in the comfort, security, and privacy of their own home.  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act would help ensure that our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care they need and when they need it, by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives to order home health services.  It only makes sense. They can order it when the patient is in certain facilities, but then they lose the right to order it when the patient goes home? That just doesn't make sense. These are skilled professionals who know what the patients need, and we should not be burdening the system with unnecessary paperwork.  Our bipartisan legislation is supported by the National Association for Home Care & Hospice, the American Nurses Association, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American College of Nurse Midwives, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, and the Visiting Nurse Associations of  A lot of times we deal with healthcare issues that are extraordinarily complex, and it is difficult for us to figure out what the answer is. This is not one of those cases. This is a commonsense reform that will improve and expedite services to Medicare beneficiaries, whether they are our disabled citizens or our seniors. It will help them get the home health care they need without undue delay.  I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this commonsense bill.  Seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

192,topic-id,2447,"Mr.President, first, let me commend the Senator from Louisiana for his extraordinary work on this bill. It has been a great pleasure to work so closely with him as we have made a genuine effort to put together a bill that would be a reasonable replacement for ObamaCare that would help to bring people together.  I wish to commend the Senator from Louisiana for his expertise. As a physician, Senator Cassidy brings an important perspective to this debate, particularly since he has practiced for so many years in hospitals in Louisiana that serve the uninsured. So I wish to personally thank him for the privilege of working together to craft this bill.  There has been much debate recently on the best approach to replacing and reforming the Affordable Care Considerable confusion and anxiety exists about the current status of the law and about the future of health care in our country. However, what is often overlooked in this discussion is that while the ACA provides valuable assistance for some people who were previously uninsured, the system created by the law is under tremendous financial strain.  ObamaCare exchanges are on the verge of collapse in many The reality is that significant changes must be made. Doing nothing is not an option.  I am, therefore, both surprised and disappointed by the remarks of the Democratic leader to the press and on the floor today about the genuine effort that Senator Cassidy and I have put forward in introducing the Patient Freedom  First of all, let me point out that the Democratic leader could not possibly have read our bill since we haven't introduced it yet, and it is evident that he has misunderstood many of its provisions.  For example, in a press statement, he said we gutted the preexisting condition protections that we strongly support and that are codified in our bill in section 101(b). Again, that is section 101(b). It ensures that insurers cannot discriminate against individuals with preexisting conditions who pay their premiums.  I guess what disappoints me most is that the Democratic leader's response really represents what is wrong with Washington, The American people want us to come together. They want Democrats and Republicans to work as a team to solve the problems facing our If we are going to have a leader on the other side of the aisle denounce to the press and come to the Senate floor to criticize a bill that has not even been introduced yet, where are we? I really hope this is an aberration and that we can work together and that the compromises we put in the bill are recognized as a good-faith effort to bring both sides of the aisle together in the interests of the American people and in providing access to affordable health care. That is our goal.  We are not saying our bill is perfect. We are open to refinements. We have made a good-faith effort, and to hear it described inaccurately and as other than a genuine effort to solve a problem truly disappoints me.  The fact is, the ACA has been in effect for years. Yet nearly 30 million Americans still do not have health insurance coverage. Many of those who do have coverage through the ACA exchanges are experiencing large spikes in premiums, deductibles, and copays, increasing costs to consumers and taxpayers alike. Contrary to the predictions made by the early supporters of the ACA, premiums are increasing in nearly every State, with an average increase of 25 percent nationally.  In New York State, the average increase on the exchange is 16.6 percent. I don't know, but perhaps the Democratic leader thinks that is an acceptable rate of increase. It strikes me as pretty high, and even though it is below the national average, it is still in double digits. The situation is even more dire in some States like Arizona, where premiums have increased by 116 percent. In many counties throughout our country, there are only one or two health insurers offering plans on the exchanges, severely limiting consumer choice.  In my State of Maine, premiums for the individual market for 2017 have soared by 22 percent, on average, and plan options have become more limited. Now, while subsidies do cushion the blow for those consumers who are eligible for them, others have had to shoulder the full increase, and of course taxpayers have borne a greater burden. Moreover, individuals and families with incomes exceeding 250 percent of the poverty rate are not shielded from the dramatic increases in deductibles and copays. That is important to remember. The premium subsidy applies to incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty rate. It then drops off the cliff, and you are eligible for no subsidy whatsoever--there is no orderly phaseout. For help with copays and deductibles under the Affordable Care Act, the threshold is 250 percent of the poverty rate. These huge premium spikes and increases in deductibles and larger copays are having an effect on families and individuals--who are by no means wealthy--all over this  Millions with coverage under the ACA are also facing increasingly narrow networks, which means they may find their preferred doctors are not in their networks. This can be particularly difficult for rural States that may have few specialists and whose citizens rely on major medical centers in nearby If patients want to continue to see these doctors, they can be faced with enormous costs that are not covered by their ACA insurance. As one Mainer put it, ``[President] Obama said I could keep my doctor, and the insurance company says I can't.''  The co-ops created under the ACA to help provide health insurance coverage have been failing at an alarming rate. In fact, only 5 of the 23 remain operational. It is also important to carefully consider the effects that ObamaCare's Medicare cuts have had on providers like rural hospitals and home health agencies, many of whom are struggling.  In sum, prices are skyrocketing, coverage is narrowing, and the individual market is likely in a death spiral if Congress fails to act.  I know many Members of this Chamber share the goal of expanding access to affordable health care. Over the years, I have collaborated with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on a number of initiatives. Today I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator and Doctor Bill Cassidy, in introducing the Patient Freedom Act of 2017 to help ensure that Americans have access to affordable health care that improves choices and helps to restrain costs.  Let me emphasize again that our bill is a work in progress. It is not perfect. However, what it does--and it is virtually unique in this regard, in this Chamber--is it puts specific proposals on the table as we seek to craft bills to repair and improve the Affordable Care Other legislation being discussed,[[Page S403]]such as those designed to help small businesses pool risks so they can better afford to provide insurance to their employees, also deserves consideration. Let's get a lot of ideas on the table.  We have to start, and we have been willing to step forward and propose a specific bill. To be criticized for that by the Democratic leader is just so disappointing, particularly since the leader is well aware that I work across the aisle all the time to try to find solutions for our country.  The Patient Freedom Act is built on the premise that giving people more choices is superior to the one-size-fits-all approach that defined the Affordable Care We recognize that what works best for people in Maine or New Hampshire may not be right for people in New York or Our bill respects those differences by giving States options to choose the path that works best for their citizens.  Now, option one would allow a State to choose to continue operating its insurance markets pursuant to all the rules of the Affordable Care So if New York State wants to keep with the status quo, despite the 16.6-percent increase, on average, in the premiums for the individual market, New York State can make that choice. If a State chooses to remain covered by the ACA, exchange policies will continue to be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies and advanced premium tax credits, and the insurance markets will still be subject to ACA requirements. The individual mandate and the employer mandate will also remain in place for that Medicaid expansion States will continue to receive Federal funding. So if a State is happy with the status quo--with spiraling costs, with limited choices, with a market that is broken--fine, keep the In some States, maybe it is working well. States should have that option, and they would under the Cassidy-Collins bill.  More appealing to many States, however, would be what we call the better choice option in the Patient Freedom Act that would allow a State to waive many of the requirements of the ACA, except for vital consumer protections, and still receive Federal funding to help its residents purchase affordable health insurance. Senator Cassidy has explained how it would work so I will not go through that all again.  Let me just say that eligible individuals in States selecting this option would receive Federal funding deposited into their Roth health savings accounts. The aggregate funding for these per-beneficiary deposits would be determined based on the total amount of funding that the Federal Government would have provided in the form of ACA subsidies in each State, plus any funding each State would have received had it chosen to expand its Medicaid Program--even if, like my State, it has chosen not to do so. These deposits in the Roth health savings accounts would be phased out for higher income beneficiaries.  States selecting this option for every resident who does not have health insurance coverage through his or her employer or through public programs like Medicare or the VA or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program--in those States, the option would be a standard health insurance plan that would include first-dollar coverage through the Roth health savings account, basic prescription drug coverage, and a high-deductible health plan. States could automatically enroll their residents who are uninsured in this standard plan, unless an individual opted to use his or her health savings account to purchase more comprehensive coverage or opted out of coverage altogether. I can't imagine someone making the choice of opting out altogether when they would receive this generous subsidy.  In addition to Federal funds, individuals and employers could make contributions to these health savings accounts, and the balances would grow tax-free. The bill also provides for a partial tax credit for very low-income individuals who do receive employer-based coverage to help these workers pay for their deductibles and their copays.  Here is another important provision of our bill: Health care providers receiving payments from the Roth health savings accounts would be required to publish cash prices for their services. That would add transparency that is sorely lacking in our current system and that we need to move toward a more patient-directed health care future. For example, if your physician has suggested that you have a colonoscopy, you would know whether one hospital or one clinic would charge more than another so you can make the right decision for you.  Health care reform should be about expanding affordable choices, and that is what our legislation aims to do by allowing States to structure their individual health insurance markets and to do so without the burdensome individual mandate, the employer mandate, or many of the other restrictive requirements in the ACA that have substantially driven up costs and forced millions of Americans to buy coverage that is more than they want, need, or can afford. Americans should have the choice to purchase more affordable coverage, if that is what works best for them.  Let me again emphasize, since misinformation was given to the press about the consumer protections in our bill, the Patient Freedom Act would retain several important consumer protections, contrary to what was said earlier today by a colleague who hadn't read our bill. Dependents will be able to remain on their parents' health insurance policies until age 26. Insurance companies will still not be able to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions or discriminate based on health status. In fact, there is no medical underwriting for the standard plan offered under the better choice option. Insurance companies cannot cap benefits by including lifetime or annual limits in their policies, and they must offer to renew policies as long as enrollees continue to pay premiums. Insurance companies must also continue to cover mental health and substance use disorder benefits for individuals, a particularly important benefit given the nationwide scope of the opioid crisis that has seriously affected my State of Maine and so many other States throughout our country, ruining the lives of individuals, their families, and their communities.  Provisions like these vital consumer protections should be retained. However, the Washington centric approach of the ACA must be changed if we are ever to truly reform our broken health care system.  I am pleased to see a growing consensus among Members of both the Senate and the House that we must fix the Affordable Care Act and provide reforms at nearly the same time as we repeal the law. This will help protect the families who rely on the program and give insurers time to transition to a new marketplace that is based on more choices for consumers. That is what we are trying to do here. Reforms in the way we provide health insurance must ensure that individuals relying on the current system do not experience a needless and avoidable gap in coverage.  If we are going to reform the system, we must begin to put specific proposals on the table for our colleagues to debate, refine, amend, and enact. That is why the criticism is so disappointing. This is an attempt to put forth a possible solution that would appeal to Members on both sides of the aisle.  As we continue our work to find a responsible path to repealing and repairing the ACA, we should give the States the freedom to choose what they believe works best for their citizens, whether that means staying with the Affordable Care Act or selecting a different path--in my view, a better path--that will lead to patient-directed reforms that contain costs and provide more choice. The Patient Freedom Act does exactly that, and I commend my colleague Senator Cassidy for his leadership on this legislation. I also want to thank our cosponsors, including Senator Isakson and Senator Capito for their support as well.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS400.txt,2121,A WOMAN'S RIGHT AND LIBERTY TO MAKE OWN HEALTH DECISIONS,2017.0,23.0,January
390,topic-id,513,"Mr.President, one of my toppriorities as a Senator has been to expand access to affordable health care for all I have always believed that thekey to achieving this goal is to bring down the cost of health care, so more Americans can afford to purchase the healthinsurance that they need. During debate over the Affordable Care Act, I raised the concern that the bill's cumbersome ``one sizefits all'' approach would do more harm than good and would result in an even more expensive, broken, and unsustainable healthcare system.  Unfortunately, my fears are now reality. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for employer-sponsored family health plans now top $18,000 per year, up nearly $5000 since 2009. Deductibles have also been rising: in 2009,only one in five workers enrolled in single-coverage employer plans faced a deductible over $1000. Today more than halfdo.  In Maine, premiums on the Exchange will rise an average of 22 percent this year, and many States are seeing even higherpremium hikes. Meanwhile, fewer insurers are willing to write policies, leaving few choices for consumers who are looking forinsurance.  Some of the ACA's provisions--especially its consumer protections--enjoy bipartisan support and should be retained;however, its Washington-centric approach must be changed if we are ever to truly reform our broken health care system.Nevertheless, this task must be undertaken with care.  There is growing understanding that we cannot simply repeal theAffordable Care Act now and then wait 2 or 3 years to put reforms in place. Doing that would risk harming consumers who relyupon the current system for their insurance and would exacerbate the turmoil in the insurance markets. If we want a smoothtransition from a broken and unaffordable system to a system that finally delivers on the promise of reform, we must carefullyplan how we intend to get from where we are today, to where we need to be tomorrow.  Thus, we are called to act quickly, butnot in haste. That is why I joined Senators Corker, Portman, Cassidy, and Murkowski in offering an amendmentthat would change the reporting date for the bill reported pursuant to the budget resolution's reconciliation instructions fromJanuary 27 to March 3. While I continue to much prefer the later date, I have received assurances from Senate leaders that theJanuary 27th date is not binding and that there is a shared commitment that we will take the time necessary to proceedthoughtfully with legislative reforms to replace and reform  Few issues are as important to the American people asfixing our broken health care system. As we move to repair the ACA, I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues onresponsible alternatives that can put us on a path to a health care system that is truly sustainable and affordable.

I ran a 14-month campaign for Congress not simply to have a prestigious title ahead of my name or to simply come toWashington to point fingers at the other political party and blame everybody else for our Nation's many problems. Rather, I ranfor Congress so I could come here and work to solve our Nation's many challenges.  The First Congressional District of Kentucky stretches from the foothills of Appalachia all the way to the western mostcounties along the Mississippi It is a conservative, rural district comprised of 35 unique counties with the mainindustries being agriculture, coal, and manufacturing.

The EPA's war on coal has devastated the coal economy and its massive economic spin-off. Overburdensome regulations likewaters of the U.threaten the viability of our family farmers, and an unsustainable government takeover of our healthcaresystem, better known as ObamaCare, has significantly increased healthcare premiums on my small businesses and working middle-class families.  Mr.Speaker, as I stand here today, there is a great sense of hope in My district voted overwhelmingly for DonaldTrump and voted out of office six incumbent Democrat State representatives. My people expressed their displeasure at the polls,and for once they feel like their voices were heard and their votes mattered.  I have heard my people's cries.

181,topic-id,1327,"Mr.President, tonight, President Trump will address a joint session of Congress for the very first time. This, of course, will be his first opportunity as President to talk about his agenda and his vision for the Nation with the American people, who will be listening. I look forward to hearing what he has to say.  He will, undoubtedly, talk about the promises he made during the campaign and how he is working to deliver on them for the American people. I know the cornerstone of that vision for America is that of reviving our economy and boosting job growth.  Fortunately, he has already taken a few steps--through Executive action--in that direction, for which I am grateful. He has also nominated top-notch financial and economic advisers to look at our archaic Tax Code and to review our trade agreements so as to get our country back on track. He has begun to trim the fat of our bureaucracy, and he continues to push for measures that keep the government from interfering unnecessarily in the lives of American families.  Congress has also played an important role. Earlier this month, we passed the first of several resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act--one, to roll back the erosion of Second Amendment rights and another to repeal a job-killing rule that targeted our energy providers. There were others as well.  These rules have one characteristic in common, which is that all of these rules that we are rolling back through congressional resolutions of disapproval were put in place under the Obama administration. They frequently represent overreach in executive authority or in, certainly, what is prudent when it comes to regulation. There is such a thing as prudent regulation and overregulation, and I think what we saw is regulatory overreach under the Obama administration.  We finally have a President in the White House who will sign these bills into law that we pass here. I am glad the President is delivering on his promise to protect American jobs and to grow our economy, and he is willing to work with Congress to do just that.  Another area in which Congress and the administration are working together is in repealing and replacing ObamaCare is, perhaps, President Obama's signature legacy. His healthcare law, by all accounts, is completely unsustainable and is, essentially, creating a real crisis for the people who happen to be on those exchanges.  Texas families cannot afford these high monthly premiums or the sky-high deductibles that so often go along with them. In fact, here is an interesting statistic. In Texas, if you have a gross income of $24,000 a year, you could well end up spending 30 percent of your gross income on healthcare costs. That certainly doesn't sound affordable, which was the promise of  I look forward to working with our colleagues to deliver on the promise we made to the American people to repeal ObamaCare and put in its place a healthcare law that actually works for people, not against them--one that provides them with more choices and fewer mandates; if they like their doctors, they can keep their doctors; if they like their plans, they can keep their plans; and, yes, they can even save money. All of this was promised under ObamaCare, but none of it has proven to be true.  We do know some of the basic principles of that replacement for ObamaCare--that of moving healthcare decisions, for example, away from Washington to where they belong--with patients, their families, and their doctors. Actually, I think this is sort of the healthcare counterpart of what we did with the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was the follow-on to No Child Left Behind in moving more of the decision-making out of Washington and back to the States--back to the people most intimately affected and the people most interested in the results.  We also believe in giving patients the right tools they can use, like health savings accounts, to make their healthcare more portable and more affordable; in breaking down barriers that restrict choice and prevent Americans from picking the insurance plans that are best for them and their families; and, finally, in empowering small businesses to provide employees with the same kind of affordable health coverage that meets their needs. Association health plans is, perhaps, one of the most commonly recognized means of doing that.  I am glad that we finally have a President in office who will work with us and not against us when it comes to repealing and replacing ObamaCare and in giving the American people more choices at a price they can afford when it comes to their health care.  For our economy to grow, we have to have a stable and safe country, though, where our people can flourish. That brings me to President Trump's latest promise to restore national security as the number one priority in our budgeting process. He has already nominated and we have confirmed two incredibly strong leaders to key posts in his national security That would be Defense Secretary Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary I am confident that these men will do a stand-up job. America is lucky to have them continuing to serve our Nation in these new positions, and I am grateful to them for their service. The safety of our communities and the safety of our country and world peace is our chief job.  As Ronald Reagan demonstrated, the best way to keep the world peaceful is for America to remain strong because when America retreats from the world stage, when America no longer leads or when we underfund our national security requirements, all it does is encourages the bullies and the tyrants and the thugs around the world to fill the gap. That is what we have seen time and time again, ranging from Vladimir Putin in Russia--the best message we can send to Vladimir Putin is not necessarily additional Russian sanctions, which I would vote in favor of, but to quit the reversing of our spending on national security priorities. That is something he understands--strength. That is something he will respect. He does not respect weakness. In fact, it is an enticement to him to dangerous activities, as we have seen not only in Crimea and Ukraine but also now in Syria and the Greater Middle  I have to say that the truth is, since the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the sequestration process that came along with that, we haven't made national security our 1 priority--the priority it should be. I hope, working together with our colleagues and the administration, we can fix that because there are a lot of things the Federal Government funds that are simply things that we would like to do but are not absolutely essential to our existence, our prosperity, and our welfare, such as national security.  I think President Trump has demonstrated that he understands what the priorities should be, and I know he will keep the goal of national security at the forefront. We ought to do everything we can, working together with this administration, to make that a success.  I look forward to hearing the President talk about some of his accomplishments in the 5 short weeks since he has been in office. You look at the stock market, for example, at historic[[Page S1463]]highs. I think there is a lot of anticipation, a growing confidence not only in our economy but that America is now back in a leadership role and that the whole world will end up benefiting--most importantly, the American people.  I am eager to learn about how Congress can continue to partner with our new President to make his administration a success, so that America can remain a success, and to make the rest of his campaign promises a reality.

318,topic-id,1228,"Mr.President, today is the daywhen we will begin to repeal and replace Repealing and replacing this disastrous law is one of the top jobs thatcitizens elected us to get done. In many ways, it is why Donald Trump will be sworn in next week as the 45th President of theUnited  I think what is most helpful is to recap why repealing ObamaCare is so important to so many Montanans were promised that with this bill you could keep the health plans that you liked. That was wrong andmillions of Americans lost their plans.  Montanans were assured that coverage under ObamaCare would be affordable. Formillions of Americans, for thousands of Montanans, nothing could be further from the truth. Montanans were guaranteed thatObamaCare would lower health care[[Page S247]]costs. We witnessed premiums skyrocket since ObamaCare's implementation.  Finally,Montanans were assured that ObamaCare would create more competition in the marketplace, but now Americans in one-third--one-third--of the counties across our entire country have but one plan to choose from. Let's not forget, supporters of ObamaCare paidfor these failed programs by raiding Medicare of over $700 billion. Seniors and people with disabilities in Montana and acrossour country deserve much better.  Over the past several years, I have heard from countless Montanans about how ObamaCare hasfailed them. Take, for example, Terry from Choteau, MT, who wrote:       We just got a letter fromPacific Source that our premium is      going up $260 per month and our deductible is going up to      $1000. This is $1025 per month anda $7500 deductible for 2      healthy adults [with] (no preexisting conditions). For a      ranch family this is a huge hit, especially inthese times      with low commodity prices. Something needs to change.  Jeff from Kalispell, MT, said this:       I am married with 5 children. I live in I bought      Blue Cross Blue Shield of MT PPO Goldinsurance plan #104 for      the 2016 year. My premium was $1,477.28 per month. In early      November 2016 [2 months ago] I receivednotice that my same      plan would increase to $2,820.00 per month. That is a 91%      increase. . . . If keeping the same rate hikes, myinsurance      will be $5,500 in 2018, then $10,000 per month in 2019.  That was from Jeff in Kalispell,  I haveAnthony from That is my hometown. I went to college in A fellow Bozemanite writes this to me. He says:       I have never been able to afford Obamacare insurance. With      quotes of over $400 a month for asingle healthy male I found      it easier to pay the penalty. So now not only can I not      afford to have medical insurance but I amgetting fined for      not making enough money to pay all of my bills and give a 20%      tithe to the medical insurance industry.  Here is another Bozemanite, He writes this:       For 2014 we had med insurance fromPacific Source for my      wife which was adequate and filled our needs. For 2015      Pacific Source canceled that policy, citingObamacare rules,      and best alternative was 150 percent more expensive.       We did it for 6 months and then canceled; it just tooktoo      much from our budget. The IRS fined us $584 for missing      insurance for 6 months. We are doing without coverage for      2016 againbecause of the outrageous costs for this high-     deductible policy. Our IRS fine will probably be about $1500.  The list andthe heartfelt stories go on. They all share one common theme: ObamaCare is not working. This ObamaCare hardship did not justimpact Terry, Jeff, Anthony or Montanans, on average, face premium increases between 27 and 58 percent just this lastyear. This is year-over-year numbers.  Last evening, I had a telephone tele-townhall meeting where thousands of Montanansjoined me, thousands across the entire Every corner of our State was on the call last night. I asked a simple question. Iasked: How many of you would want to repeal ObamaCare? An overwhelming 82 percent said they support the repeal of  The reason why is quite simple. They did not get what was promised to them on this very floor of this Chamber back in 2010.ObamaCare is failing because it is a massive intrusion by the Federal It is centered on raising taxes, huge spendingincreases, and heavy regulations from Washington, It is straight from the BigGovernment, Washington-knows-best playbook, and that is what happens when Congress doesn't listen to the American people.  You know, Montanans have very good horse sense. They know when somebody from Washington, DC, shows up and says: We have this2,700-page bill from Washington, DC, led by Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and President Obama--Montanans know better. They knowthey should run for cover.  And that is exactly what ObamaCare is and what is happening now to the American people.  ObamaCare can't be tweaked. It has to be repealed. It needs to be replaced with better reforms. And we need to make surethat we do as much as we can as soon as we can so folks aren't having to deal with ObamaCare for much longer. People arehurting. It is time to replace it.  I urge my Democratic colleagues to work with us. Don't use scare tactics.  Unlike2009, we are focused on a path forward that conveys practical benefits, not hopeless ideology. I ask them to accept the realitythat ObamaCare is irreversibly flawed, it must be repealed, and it must be replaced with effective policies.  I know thereare comments out there about a plan and what is next. Well, for me, it is not that complicated. It is getting the costs down.You have heard the stories. The American people are asking for relief.  For the generation of Americans just now entering theworkforce--and that would be my kids; they are just entering the workforce--health care costs have increased by 77 percent. Thisis outrageous. It is unacceptable. These are supposed to be the easiest people to insure, yet ObamaCare seems intent on placinghealth care out of their reach.  I believe there are policies that are fundamental to any health care system, and it will beworking and fighting for provisions that provide access to affordable insurance, that protect people with preexistingconditions, that allow young adults to stay on their parents' coverage until age 26, that return decisionmaking authority backto the States, that will eliminate these harmful Washington regulations and mandates, that will empower the American people withgreater access to health savings accounts.  That was part of the health care system that was actually working pre-ObamaCare,and ObamaCare moved in and slashed health care savings accounts.  We need to make it easier to purchase health insuranceacross State lines, encourage and incentivize work among able-bodied Americans, and uphold fiscal responsibility by preservingand protecting Medicare for our seniors.  I very much look forward to working with the nominee for the U.Department ofHealth and Human Services, Tom I served with Price in the There is not a better leader at thispoint in time in our Nation's history to assume the leadership of the Department of Health and Human He is a doctor,has served in Congress, and will be able and ready to lead from day one.  We will work together to find the best solutions,Montana solutions, solutions that work for our respective States, for people like Terry, for Jeff, for Anthony, for Kenneth, andfor the thousands of other Montanans who have been harmed by this law.

41,topic-id,1086,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to address the nomination of Congressman Ryan Zinke to lead the Department of  As Secretary of Interior, Representative Zinke will be the steward of our Nation's precious public lands, national parks, tribal lands, and historical and cultural resources. These lands not only play an important role in preserving habitat, landscapes, and history, they also create jobs and invigorate nearby communities.  During his confirmation hearing, I was excited to hear Congressman Zinke refer to himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist.  We all know the important role Teddy Roosevelt played in protecting our natural resources. During his Presidency, Roosevelt established 230 million acres of public lands. In 1901, he created the U.Forest Service and established 150 national forests. In 1906, he signed into law the Antiquities Act, legislation that allowed either the President or Congress to set aside ``historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest'' in order to stop their destruction. With this act, he designated 18 national monuments, including several iconic areas.  A modern version of Teddy Roosevelt would be a wonderful selection to head the Department of But, after closely examining Representative Zinke's record, he doesn't appear to be a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist.  Last Congress, Representative Zinke voted in favor of an amendment to the House Interior appropriations bill that would have rolled back the authority of the President to use the Antiquities Act in seven Western He also supported a bill that would have effectively eliminated public review of hardrock mining activities on Federal lands. And he supported the Keystone XL pipeline.  Conservationist groups seem to have similar concerns about Congressman Zinke's record.  The League of Conservation Voters gave him a 3 percent rating for 2015 and a 5 percent rating for 2016--hardly what you would expect from a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist. This troubles me, as Representative Zinke, if confirmed, would be responsible for managing new monuments of great importance--namely, the Pullman National Monument and the Bears Ears National  The Pullman National Monument was designated by President Obama in 2015 in a Chicago neighborhood that has played a significant role in our country's African-American and labor history.  It represents the culmination of a collaborative effort by businesses, residents, and other organizations seeking to restore and preserve this unique community.  The Pullman neighborhood was originally developed a century ago by rail car magnate George Pullman as a factory town that would help shape our country as we know it today.  It was the birthplace of the Nation's first Black labor union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which is credited with helping to create the African-American middle class and making crucial civil rights advancements in this county.  Pullman workers also fought for fair labor conditions in the late 19th century. During the economic depression of the 1890s, the Pullman community was the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in the United States, which eventually led to the creation of Labor Day as a national holiday.  The Pullman National Monument not only highlights stories from communities that are rarely represented in other national parks, but its location on Chicago's South Side--easily accessible to millions of people by public transportation--also makes it particularly unique. Following its designation, the Pullman neighborhood joined the National Mall and the Statue of Liberty as one of the few DOI-managed lands in an urban area.  But Pullman now needs an Interior Secretary who is committed to dedicating resources that will ensure the monument is a driver of tourism and job creation in the community.  Public lands have certainly been a great economic driver in Utah, and the Bear Ears National Monument will no doubt build on this success.  The 1.35 million acre swath of land, declared a national monument by President Obama, covers forested mesas to redrock canyons and will protect the region's abundant cultural resources, which include well-preserved cliff dwellings, rock and art panels, artifacts, and Native American burials.  Bears Ears is special, as it is the first monument of its kind to be proposed and advocated for by a united coalition of five tribes, who sought its protection because of its important place in all of their respective cultures.  Congressman Zinke is well aware of the monument and has said his first priority as Secretary would be to go to Utah and make a recommendation regarding the status of the Bears Ears National  While this monument designation has been met with opposition from Utah politicians, the attacks on the Bears Ears Monument do not reflect the views of all  Recently, Utah's paper of record, the Salt Lake Tribune, called the political fervor a ``blindness.''[[Page S1467]]  ``That blindness can be sourced to Utah's one-party political system that has given us leaders who are out of touch with their constituents.'' It continues, ``The Bears Ears monument may be with us forever, and there is no bucket of gold waiting if it does go away. The presidential proclamation bent far toward the same boundaries and shared management [Utah Rob] Bishop pursued with his Public Lands Initiative.''  Sadly, attacks on monument designations are nothing new.  One of our greatest conservation Presidents, Teddy Roosevelt, faced a great deal of opposition to his designation of a national monument you may be familiar with, the Grand Most Americans can't imagine an America without the iconic Grand Canyon, a true national treasure.  But, at the time of its 1908 designation, groups were opposed to protecting this area. For years after its designation, oil and gas miners fought against additional protections for the Grand In the end, conservationists won out, and by 1919, the Grand Canyon was made into a national park to be protected for future generations.  Roosevelt said, ``It is also vandalism wantonly to destroy or to permit the destruction of what is beautiful in nature, whether it be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird. Here in the United States we turn our rivers and streams into sewers and dumping-grounds, we pollute the air, we destroy forests, and exterminate fishes, birds and mammals--not to speak of vulgarizing charming landscapes with hideous advertisements. But at last it looks as if our people were awakening''  Since Roosevelt's time, we have made a lot of progress in protecting our lands and waters, but still have a long way to go. That is why the next Interior Secretary needs to take a step forward in protecting more of our public lands, not backwards.

Not once.  Why would Russian dictator Vladimir Putin favor President Trump in the last election? Well, I just returned from a week visiting our allies in Eastern I can tell you, they are puzzled by this, too, and they are worried. They are worried that Donald Trump, the new President, is already advancing and will further advance policies sympathetic to Vladimir Putin's dangerous agenda, specifically weakening the Western transatlantic democratic alliance.  Regardless of the partisan leanings of who was in government in the nations[[Page S1468]]I just visited--populist, social democrat, conservative, liberal--the concerns in each of these nations of Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine were the same. Is the United States' history of championing democracy and collective security in Europe ending? Are we backing away from those values and commitments just as Russia is more aggressively challenging them? Is the American President really using phrases like ``enemy of the people'' to describe the free press in America?  You see, the countries that I visited were once in the Eastern bloc, Warsaw Pact, or Soviet They are familiar with that term, ``enemy of the people.'' That was a term used by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin that was so ominous that the Soviet Premier, Nikita Khrushchev, later demanded that the Communist Party stop using it because it eliminated the possibility of any kind of ideological fight.  Think of that. Here was Khrushchev saying: Stop using the Stalin term ``enemy of the people''; it is too divisive. Now it is being used to describe the media, a description that has been offered by the new President of the United Are the Trump administration's bizarre blinders to Vladimir Putin's aggression and true nature--and the silence of too many of his colleagues on this danger--a harbinger of some kind of Western retreat when it comes to Russian aggression?  It is hard to believe this is happening in 2017. President Trump has called NATO obsolete. That is a stark and completely wrong statement, so bad that it required the Vice President of the United States to travel to Munich, Germany, last week and reassure our allies who have been part of our alliance since World War II that NATO was not obsolete.  When has it happened in history that the President of the United States would make such a sweeping, erroneous, dangerous statement about the most important alliance in the world and then send his Vice President out on a repair job? The President has surrounded himself with people like Steve Bannon, who reportedly once called himself a Leninist and seems bizarrely sympathetic to Putin's dictatorial model and weakening the European alliance.  It turns out that the just-resigned National Security Advisor, LTG Michael Flynn, the one who was fired by the previous administration, the one who led chants unworthy of a great democracy about locking up Hillary Clinton, was, in fact, speaking to Russian officials before he or Donald Trump had taken office and, suspiciously, just after President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its attack on our election.  President Trump still refuses to release his tax returns to clarify what his son said in 2008 regarding Trump's businesses seeing ``a lot of money pouring in from Russia.'' President Trump even said yesterday: ``I haven't called Russia in 10 years.'' That is hard to verify. He spoke to Vladimir Putin on the telephone just a month ago, which was followed, incidentally, a day later by renewed fighting by the Russian-backed separatists in  President Trump visited Russia in 2013. He tweeted at the time: ``I just got back from Russia--learned lots & lots.''  Clearly, he did not learn enough about Vladimir As if that were not enough, this President still refuses to acknowledge Russia's attack or to criticize Vladimir You see, the President of the United States has trouble, a real habit of lashing out at everyone and anyone involved in a perceived slight, a dangerous and unbecoming behavior when granted the privilege to be President of this great  In fact, the vast number and range of those attacked or insulted via Twitter is so significant that I need considerably more time here on the floor of the Senate to list all of the targets of President Trump's attacks on So if you make any criticism or joke about President Trump, make any perceived slight, run a department store, lead a labor union, do just about anything, you may be a victim of one of his Twitter attacks, except, of course, if you happen to be a former Communist KGB official who now leads Russia, a nation that recently attacked our election.  How is it possible? How is it sensible? How is this not an abdication of the President's responsibilities? Russian President Putin launched a cyber attack and war on the United States and its democracy. November 8, 2016, is a day that will live in cyber infamy because of this Russian attack on the United States of  President Putin interfered in our election and tried to influence the selection of the American people in choosing their leader. The evidence is overwhelming. It has been available in increasing amounts for almost 5 months. The White House is silent, in denial.  Republican Senators are largely silent, and not one of them has come to the Senate floor to even address this issue. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin continues his aggressive military cyber disinformation campaign throughout  Just last week, the Washington Post reported that the White House led an effort to discredit news stories that described contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian Government officials. The House Intelligence Committee chairman, Congressman Nunes of California, a Republican, went so far as to dismiss these claims of Russian interference in the campaign for the President of the United States and to condemn the leaks that have brought this information to the attention of the American people. Rather than doing their part to ensure an impartial, independent investigation of these chilling facts, the White House has tried to spin it out of existence. In fact, yesterday, it was reported that the White House Press Secretary asked CIA Director Michael Pompeo and the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to help discredit news articles about the Trump campaign aides' contacts with Russian officials.  John Brennan, who was head of the Central Intelligence Agency under President Obama, was asked in an interview last night if he could imagine being contacted by the White House and asked to spin a story one way or the other. He said it was unthinkable. It just wasn't done under previous administrations. Here we are, not even 6 weeks into this Presidency, and it is already happening.  Can anyone here--anyone--imagine what would happen if the situation had been reversed? I can just imagine the howls of ``treason'' and ``impeachment.'' Not a single nominee would be confirmed until there were answers and accountability if this had happened and there was an effort by the Russians to influence an election in favor of the  What has happened to my friends on the other side of the aisle? When will they put the country that they are sworn to represent and to uphold above any partisan consideration? A Polish expert who I ran into during my journey summed all this up wisely when he said: If the United States does not respond to the Russian attack on its own election, Putin will feel he has a free hand to keep taking destabilizing actions in the  There was a time in Washington when national security issues were bipartisan. Politics used to stop at the water's edge. The security of the Nation meant putting aside partisan agendas to face a common threat. It is time to return to that tradition. We need an independent, transparent investigation of this Russian involvement in our Presidential election.  We know the voters list in my home State of Illinois was hacked. We know that some 17 different intelligence agencies have told us unequivocally that Russia did everything in its power to try to change the outcome of this last election. We are told that there could have been up to 1,000 Russian trolls sitting in headquarters in Moscow, trying to hack into the computers of people in the United States to influence the outcome of this election.  We know that, coincidentally, some 2 hours after a very controversial, negative story came out against Donald Trump, the Russians released information that they had hacked from the campaign of Hillary  Two hours. A coincidence? Not likely. There is a lot of information that needs to be followed up on. No conclusions can be reached until there is a thorough, independent, credible investigation. I worry about using the Intelligence Committees for this purpose.[[Page S1469]]These committees and their activities are important, critical, but they are largely invisible and their deliberations are interminable. We are waiting, hoping that they will come up with information to help us spare the United States from a future attack by Russia or any other country on the sovereignty of our  I yield the floor.

294,topic-id,1313,"Madam President, apparently anumber of our colleagues here are having second thoughts about the strategy on the floor. We have before us a budget resolution.It is setting the stage for a budget process called reconciliation. To put it in layman's terms, we are going to be moving fromthis budget resolution vote to a vote at a time to be announced later, possibly in the next 2 weeks, to repeal  There has been a lot of speculation about what the impact will be if we don't replace the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare,with something very quickly--for obvious reasons. We have seen 30 million Americans who now have health insurance because of thecreation of the Affordable Care  We have changed health insurance policies across the United States so that if you havesomeone in your family with a preexisting condition, you can't be discriminated against when you buy insurance.  Back in theold days, before ObamaCare became the law of the land, health insurance companies could just refuse to insure your family orcharge you a premium that was beyond reach. We also eliminated the caps that were built in--the limits that were built into thesehealth insurance policies. People were buying policies which covered up to $100,000 in expenses. Then, God forbid, there is adiagnosis of cancer or some serious illness, and $100,000 evaporates over a weekend.  So those limits are no longer allowedin health insurance policies. We said women should be treated the same as men when it comes to premiums. We also went on to saythat, when it comes to these health insurance companies, they have to be focused on keeping premium costs in control, and theyhave to justify any profits that go way beyond the reasonable.  Then we said: If you are a mother or father with a son ordaughter coming out of college and they are looking for a job, they are doing an internship, and they don't have healthinsurance, they can stay on your family policy until age 26.  That is pretty important for a lot of families. My family hasbeen through that with our kids. To know and have peace of mind that your daughter or son can continue to be covered by yourfamily plan--these things are all built into the Affordable Care Now, simply repealing that, even saying it will happen at alater date, throws into question, if not chaos, our health care system in  A lot of people are finally thinkingabout that. It is not just a protest vote about a President who is going to be leaving office in 9 days. It is a life-and-deathdecision for health care for millions of Now many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are starting towake up to that reality.  Senator Cotton of Arkansas said: ``It would not be the right path for us to repeal ObamaCarewithout laying out a path forward.''  Yesterday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Republicans want to repeal ObamaCare``concurrently'' with a replacement--``concurrently.''  Senator Lamar Alexander, my friend and colleague from Tennessee,who chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, responded by saying: ``To me, `simultaneously' and`concurrently' mean ObamaCare should be finally repealed only when there are concrete, practical reforms in place that giveAmericans access to truly affordable health care''--Senator  Newt Gingrich, the former Republican Speaker ofthe House, said: ``I don't think Republicans want to leave 23 million people out there worried that they are going to lose theirinsurance.''  So you go through the long list of Republican dissenters to this notion of repeal and we will get back to youlater: Senators Corker, Portman, Collins, Cassidy, They have come up with an amendment to this budgetresolution, and they have said: Let's postpone this whole effort until we have had time to put some work into it and come upwith an alternative to answer some of the basic questions about what a new version of the Affordable Care Act would look like.  But the problem with that approach is that they have had 7 years--7 years--to prepare something, and they have nothing. Sowhat are we going to do in the meantime?  We did the responsible thing, I hope. Let's find a way to make the Affordable CareAct even stronger, better, fairer. Sign me up. Make it a bipartisan effort. Don't repeal it. Sit down and rewrite it in a waythat is fair and makes it stronger and better.  The basic things we want to make sure of are that people can have the samebasic protection if they wish it in health insurance. Ensure that no one loses their current benefits, whether it is maternitycare, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment, which is now required to be covered by health insurance plans. Ensurethat no one's premiums or out-of-pocket expenses get out of line. Protect people with preexisting conditions and don't justsimply shift the cost to States--my State included--that could not afford to take this on. Keep drug prices down for seniors.  You see, that is a part I did not mention. Medicare is affected by the Affordable Care Under Medicare, the 60 millionAmericans under Medicare used to have something called a doughnut hole. It was on odd invention when this bill was written intolaw. It said that Medicare for seniors would cover the front end of their prescription costs, if they are high, and, then, theyhave to take the middle part out of their savings, and, then, late in the year, Medicare kicked back in.  It was costingseniors $1,000, $2,000 a year. We eliminated it with the Affordable Care Now, if you repeal that, what happens to seniorsand their prescription drug costs? Those are legitimate questions which need to be answered before we go blindly into repealingthe Affordable Care  Let's work together--Democrats and Republicans--to make this a better law. I have said it before andI will say it again. The only perfect law that I am aware of was carried down a mountain by ``Senator Moses'' on clay tablets.The rest of the efforts that we put into this are always subject to review, amendment, and improvement. The Affordable Care ActI would put in that category.  If there is a good-faith effort on the Republican side to join with Democrats, I want to bepart of it. I also want to salute my colleague, Senator Debbie Stabenow, who will be on the floor in a couple of hours totalk about the mental health protections and substance abuse treatment protections in the Affordable Care We used to havethis debate on the Senate floor about whether health insurance policies should cover mental illness. We debated that. For thelongest time, they did not. People with those problems and challenges have long-term care, in some cases.  But because of thebipartisan effort of Mr.Paul Wellstone, the late Senator[[Page S226]]from Minnesota, and Mr.Pete Domenici, the retired Senator fromNew Mexico--Democrat and Republican--we have included it in there. Senator Stabenow wants to make sure that whatever we writein the future is going to cover mental illness and substance abuse treatment.  Facing mental illness challenges acrossAmerica, facing an opioid and heroin epidemic, we can do no less. Let me tell you a story about Lori Myers in Freeport, Shesent me a letter. Here is what she said:       I am writing to ask you to fight to preserve the ACA . .      .it has literally saved our daughter       Brianne has been insured through the ACA since its      inception. . . .

Lori writes:       It is imperative that she continue to have health coverage      in order to remain a functioning andproductive adult. . . .      She has excellent policies purchased through the      Marketplace--with BlueCross BlueShield, and she receivesa      subsidy to assist with cost.       The increase in premium this year was offset by an increase      in the subsidy. She is actuallypaying $20-$30 less for her      policy this year than she did last year for basically the      same coverage.

311,topic-id,974,"Madam President,the most popular dictionary defines an act of war as an act of aggression by a country against another with which it isnominally at peace. Let me repeat, an act of aggression by another country against another with which it is nominally at peace.  On Friday, America's intelligence community issued a damning, detailed assessment concluding that Russian strongmanPresident Vladimir Putin ordered an attack on our Nation's electoral system to sow mistrust and favor one candidate overanother. The evidence was sweeping, overwhelming, and troubling.  The key findings, quoted directly from the public versionof this report from the intelligence agencies, said as follows:       Russian efforts to influence the2016 U.presidential      election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's      longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-ledliberal      Democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a      significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and      scopeof effort compared to previous operations.       We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an      influence campaign in 2016aimed at the U.presidential      election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in      the U.Democratic process, denigrateSecretary Clinton, harm      her electability and potential presidency. We further assess      that Putin and the Russian Governmentdeveloped a clear      preference for President-elect       We also assess Putin and the Russian government aspired to      helpPresident-elect Trump's election chances when possible by      discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting      herunfavorably to him.  They go on to talk about the types of influence Moscow inspired.  I am not going to stand hereand argue that if the Russian efforts had not taken place, there would have been a different outcome in the election. No onewill ever know that. And when asked directly, the intelligence agencies, despite these strong statements, say there is noevidence of direct vote tampering or tampering with election equipment, thank goodness. That isn't the point.  The point is,Vladimir Putin and the Russians did what they could to influence our election. Americans should stand up and listen because whatis at stake is the sovereignty of our Nation and the reliability and integrity of our election process.  What the Russiansdid was truly staggering and momentous--a foreign adversary intentionally manipulating America's democracy and election. I don'tknow if it is an act of war by classic definition. It is an attack on our Nation by any definition. It should not go unanswered.  For those who have been following Vladimir Putin's bullying actions over the last several years, this is no surprise.Instead of building a modern global economy based on the great talents of the Russian people, he and his closest neighbors havecreated false enemies in the West, sadly and dangerously creating a narrative that domestic Russian problems are really theresult of NATO, the United States, and the  He has tried to discredit the West and its Democratic free marketinstitutions. He has used manufactured enemies of Russia to rally domestic support for his tactics and leadership.  It is,ultimately, a tired narrative that when combined with domestic political repression and manipulation, helps keep Putin in power.  Let's not be fooled into thinking his actions are merely annoying. The threats are real and dangerous, and they go directlynot just at the United States but many of our strongest allies.

In fact, Russian forces and their proxies still hold captured land in Georgia and Ukraine, and from that spotin Ukraine separatists shot down a civilian airliner 2 years ago, murdering 283 innocent passengers, including 8 children.  This is our adversary. This is the man who is trying to undermine the American electoral system. We cannot take it lightly.  Twenty years ago, when I was elected to the Senate, I was a member of the Government Affairs The first hearing wehad was a lengthy investigative hearing. What was the basis of it? We had just concluded a Presidential campaign, andallegations were made that the Chinese Government 20 years ago was trying to insert itself into the Presidential campaign of theUnited States, specifically in support of the Clinton-Gore ticket.  Fred Thompson was chairman of that committee, a prettywell-known man who has since passed, but he was a pretty outstanding lawyer in addition to being a pretty famous actor. He wasmy chairman. He spent months in public hearings investigating whether the Chinese tried to insert themselves in any way, shape,or form in the election of Clinton-They found virtually no evidence, other than a handful of Buddhist nuns writing checksto the campaign, which nobody ever really explained. But there was no evidence that the Chinese Government was involved in thisin any specific way. We spent months on that theory in open hearings, and then published reports--conflicting reports onconclusions from that committee. We took it that seriously 20 years ago.  What are we doing about this? Well, SenatorMcConnell, the Republican leader, said that we will do the regular order; we will let the regular committees go about theirbusiness and figure out what might have happened in the course of that. That is not good enough. Regular order may put thisinvestigation in the Intelligence Do you know what that means? It means you are not going to see their hearing. Youare not going to be able to see their witnesses and listen to their testimony, and much of the evidence that is going to bepresented will never be shared with the public.  I understand the need to protect classified material. We must do that. Iinsist on that. But at the same time, we need to answer some basic questions about what Russia tried to do in this last electionand to make it clear to them and to the world that the United States is not going to be a sucker. We are not going to allowanyone who can hack into our systems to try to undermine the electoral system of the United We are proud Wewill handle our own elections, thank you. Keep your hackers out of business in the United  Recently, we have hadallegations--and I underline the word ``allegations''--of other involvement of the Russians with the Trump campaign and thepreparation of certain documents, which have not been collaborated as of this date. They may lead to nothing, but they certainlydeserve investigation so that we know what the facts may be.  Yesterday at the Senate Judiciary Committee, I asked SenatorJeff Sessions of Alabama, a man who is aspiring to be Donald Trump's Attorney General, if he could recuse himself frominvestigations into Russian connections with the Trump campaign. He had just said earlier he was going to recuse himself frominvestigations involving Hillary Senator Sessions said, ``I would review it and try to do the right thing as towhether or not it should stay within the jurisdiction of the attorney general or not.''  I hope that Senator Sessions,if he in fact becomes the Attorney General, will have some second thoughts. It is far better to consider a special counsel inthe Department of Justice in light of the political circumstances of these allegations.  Secondly, we need to have a selectcommittee--not the Intelligence Committee--of either the House or the Senate that will meet and consider this information andinvestigate it in a responsible way. In fact, I think it is of such gravity that we ought to consider a public-privatecommission--a commission of elected officials, as well as private citizens, whom we respect. I think of the names of GeneralColin Powell and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as chairs and cochairs of that effort, people ofunquestionable integrity who will make the right findings for America and not for any political reasons, as far as I amconcerned.  Today, I asked Michael Mukasey, former Attorney General under President George Bush, whether the AttorneyGeneral has the authority to shut down an FBI investigation, and he answered very simply, ``yes.'' So we need more information.We need to make sure that this is taken seriously and that we address it in a serious manner because it is a serious issue.  What, in fact, has been the response from the other side of the aisle? With a few notable exceptions, that party of RonaldReagan, the 40th President--who really understood the old Soviet regime--has greeted this information with near silence. That isright. Except for a few voices--my colleagues Senators Graham and McCain in particular--there has been near silence.  How in the world did an attack ordered by a former Soviet KGB official on our Nation become a partisan issue that is largelyignored by a majority of one of our Nation's two great political parties? How did the Republican Party, which now controls bothChambers of Congress, decide that repealing health care insurance for millions of Americans was the most urgent, first priorityto deal with amid this sweeping evidence of a Russian attack on our democracy? Ronald Reagan must be rolling in his grave.  Does anyone remember his clarity about standing up against attacks on the West and its allies when the Soviets shot down acivilian Korean airliner in 1983? This is what President Reagan said:       And make no mistake about it,this attack was not just      against ourselves or the Republic of This was the      Soviet Union against the world and the moralprecepts which      guide human relations among people everywhere. It was an act      of barbarism born of a society which wantonlydisregards      individual rights and the value of human life and seeks      constantly to expand and dominate other nations.  There was a time in this town when national security issues were truly bipartisan, when security meantpatriotically putting aside partisan agendas. Can anyone here imagine for a second--just one second--the debate we would be havinghere now if the situation were reversed? The House alone spent millions of dollars on countless and ultimately fruitlessinvestigations into the tragic events of Here we are, with overwhelming evidence of an actual attack on our Nation,and the majority party is largely silent. That is incredible. It is quite simply an abdication of political responsibility notto address a verified national security threat to our  With the release of Friday's report, I urge my colleagues toread both the public and classified reports. The classified version contains the same damning and sweeping conclusions Imentioned here today from the public document, but it goes into detail. As such, I urge this body to come up with an appropriateresponse to this attack. I have joined in bipartisan Russian sanctions legislation with Senators Cardin, McCain, Menendez,Graham, Shaheen Rubio, Klobuchar, Sasse, and We urge that we quickly advance as an urgent priority Russiansanctions to make it clear that what they have done is reprehensible, unacceptable, and will not be tolerated.  This Congresscan also do what many tried to do in the past and failed--which is certainly timely--and that is pass meaningful cyber securitylegislation.  We have to maintain our strong NATO Alliance, stand firm against Russian meddling or attacks, and tell ourfriends in the Baltics and Poland, in particular, that we stand by their side, that nothing has changed, and that our friends inUkraine can trust that we will be with them as they establish democratic sovereignty.

I don't want people to be confused as the evening goes on. This is not the bill that repeals ObamaCare.This is the bill that sets up the process that will repeal This is a preliminary step that is necessary in order todo what everybody is claiming will be done tonight, and that is not accurate.  So we will hear a bunch of things that peopleare concerned about, but this bill in it has budget numbers. The budget numbers reflect where we are--not where we would like tobe and not where we have been. They are just the numbers of where we are. Then, in the resolution, there is a requirement thatthe Finance Committee save $1 billion, and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee save $1 billion, and they get todo that with some privileged legislation, as long as we keep it privileged. There will be a number of attempts tonight to see ifthey can get rid of the privilege by using corrosive or nongermane amendments. Consequently, wewill have to vote down some of those amendments. It might sound logical, and it is because they are not in the bill.  I guesswe are still waiting for the unanimous consent agreement so at this point I will yield the floor.

323,topic-id,426,"Mr.President, for some additional informationof what is happening, we are organizing lists of what tranche the votes will be in. Just because they are not listed in thisfirst group, doesn't mean they are not going to be considered. In fact, under a budget resolution, we have what is called avote-arama. Actually, any amendment can be turned in until we finish voting. Unlike other activity that we usually have where weknow what votes there will be well in advance, this is a special exercise and it is handled a little differently and it is a lotmore confusing.  We will begin in a while. We will begin processing these amendments one at a time. For debate, just sopeople know for sure which amendment we are on, the proponent for the amendment will get 1 minute and the opponent for thatamendment will get 1 minute. At the end of those 2 minutes, we will vote. The first vote is supposed to take 15 minutes. TheSenate is seldom held to 15 minutes. After that, we often go to 10-minute votes, which in the Senate usually only takes about 30minutes.  That is the way we do it here. We make sure everybody gets their chance to vote. We hope people will be around sothey can get here punctually and cast their vote. We think the amount of time from 10 minutes can be reduced if people areinterested in reducing the amount of time to do them.  I got the signal that we now have the final list.  Mr.President, Iask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following amendments and have them reported en bloc: Manchin, 64;Nelson, 13; Baldwin, 81; Tester, 104; Klobuchar, 172; Casey, 61; King, 60; Menendez, 83; Gillibrand,82; Manchin, 63; and Stabenow, 94.

I further ask unanimous consent that at6:15 p.m., all time be yielded back and the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed, except for the followingamendments, which will be voted on first: Nelson, 13; King, 60; a Barrasso side-by-side amendment, the text of which isat the desk; Manchin, 64; that there be no second-degree amendments in order to these four amendments prior to the votes;finally, that there be 2 minutes, equally divided between the managers or their designees, prior to each vote and that all votesafter the first in this series be 10 minutes in length.

150,topic-id,644,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding the time to me.  While I support the underlying bill, I want to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that this bipartisan legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, can be made in order for consideration and a vote.  The legislation is very simple. It is not pages and pages and pages. It simply states that there will be a requirement that the President of the United States, all future Presidents, and Presidential nominees of the major parties publicly disclose their tax returns. For decades, Republican and Democratic Presidents and Republican and Democratic candidates of both parties have voluntarily disclosed this information, but not this  Now, this tradition began in 1973, with President Richard Nixon who, while under audit by the IRS, publicly released his tax returns and submitted them for review by Congress because there was a mini scandal at that time regarding his claims of charitable giving. He released his tax returns and, shortly after, gave what became a famous speech: ``People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook.''  The Joint Committee on Taxation, at that time, ultimately found numerous errors in the President's return, and that he owed about a half a million dollars in back taxes, and he paid them.  Now, since then, every President has voluntarily released their tax returns. But this tradition is now being tested by a President who continues to hide his finances and faces an unprecedented number of potential conflicts of interest relating to his business empire.  Now, through his financial disclosure forms, we know that he has some 564 businesses around the world and inside the United This is a legitimate question being posed by the American people, and that is: If we don't know, whose interest is he operating under? Who is he there for?  Is he making decisions relative to trade that will benefit his business? We don't know. Why? Because a tax return is highly instructive. Tax returns disclose to whom you owe debt, what the debt is, where your businesses are, whether they are in the United States or in a foreign country, whether you have made charitable donations, whether you have paid taxes, whether you have avoided taxes, whether you have used loopholes, whether you have dollars in offshore areas. So this is an essential.  I want my Republican friends to think of something. This is not a partisan issue. This should concern you just as much as it concerns your constituents. The American people across the country, 74 percent, say that his tax returns should be disclosed.                              {time}  1300  We are now moving into an area of questions about national security.  Who is the President doing business with?  Whose interests come first? Is it the national security of the United States of America by the Commander in Chief, or is it for some Trump business?  These are very serious questions that you should want answered.  In a democracy--in a democracy--transparency is essential. They go hand in hand. We are not a banana republic. We don't have people in charge of the government that stand above the law or just disregard it.  In this case, it is not the law. It is a beautiful tradition that patriots on the Republican side and the Democratic side honored. Why did they honor it? I think they honored it because they wanted to honor the American people. That is what this effort is about.  Now, it is important to note that the President wasn't always opposed to this important transparency. As far back as 2011, he said that he would release his tax returns if he ran for  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

So all of these issues should concern all Members of Congress because, as I said a moment ago, transparency is essential in a democracy.

267,topic-id,399,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to deliver my first remarks on the House floor.  Before I became mayor of West Point, I watched my hometown almost fall completely apart. I saw what happened when badWashington policies almost destroyed my hometown by creating the environment for manufacturing jobs to go overseas. I watchedFederal programs that were failing to meet the needs of my friends and neighbors try to take the place of good jobs.  The Federal programs weren't fixing the underlying programs in my hometown. They were simply catching people in the cycle ofpoverty, and we surely didn't want a handout. We wanted jobs.  I was faced with a choice of whether or not to move my dental practice and my family away from my hometown to a moreprofitable community or get involved and be part of the solution. I chose to get involved and work to better the lives of myneighbors and my hometown.  Instead of being satisfied with one-size-fits-all government programs that simply perpetuated the existing problems, weworked to bring manufacturing jobs back to West Point, Georgia, by making targeted investments in economic development andinfrastructure.  We attracted a Kia Motors manufacturing plant, and the automotive industry brought with it suppliers and other relatedbusinesses that produced over 15,000 jobs in just a few years.                              {time}  1815  The city of West Point and the surrounding area today is revitalized not because of Federal Government programs orregulations, but because we worked at the local level to find solutions to meet the needs of our area.  I ran for Congress so that I could apply these lessons at the Federal level. We need policies that make America the mostcompetitive place in the world to do business instead of creating policies that incentivize companies to take their jobsoverseas. We need policies that help get people out of poverty instead of trapping them in a multigenerational cycle ofproperty.  I know firsthand that more government programs do not make communities, schools, or individuals great. In fact, I have livedthrough and governed out of the dependence created by bad D.policy and government programs that continue to trap people inpoverty.  What we have collectively done to those in poverty with these policies is morally wrong.

165,topic-id,537,"Mr.President, one of the most important elements of the rule of law is the promise of swift access to the courts, but that promise has been broken in my home State of That is because Arizona falls under the jurisdiction of the U.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a circuit that is both oversized and overworked.  With the jurisdiction encompassing 13 districts spread across nine States and 2 U.territories, the Ninth Circuit covers 1 in 5 It hears roughly 12,000 appeals each year. The next busiest circuit doesn't even hear 9,000, and for the thousands of cases under its consideration, the average turnaround time exceeds 15 months.  Now, if excessive delays weren't bad enough, it turns out the Ninth Circuit is overturned by the Supreme Court 77 percent of the time when the Supreme Court grants cert--77 percent of the time. That is obviously higher than any other court. So not only is the court excruciatingly slow, but in many instances it is simply wrong.  The court, itself, is unusually large. It has 29 authorized judgeships. That is 12 more than the next largest circuit.  The Ninth Circuit is so big that it can't even rehear cases as a whole body, like every other appeals court does. Instead, cases are reheard with limited en banc; these are panels of 11 judges each. That means that only one-third of its judges are deciding law for the entire court--only one-third.  Of the States suffering under the weight of the Ninth Circuit's crushing backlog, Arizona shoulders a uniquely heavy burden. Per capita, Arizona has the busiest Federal docket in the circuit. That puts Arizonans at the back of an already long line just to get their day in court.  As if the deluge of cases continues to fill the Ninth Circuit's docket, the line keeps getting longer and longer if you happen to live in  With problems like these, we are left to ask: Is the Ninth Circuit simply too big to succeed? If you are an Arizonan, the answer is unquestionably yes.  Arizonans deserve better, and that is why today I am introducing a bill to break up the Ninth  With the support of my colleague from Arizona, John McCain, and the support of Doug Ducey, I have introduced the Judicial Administration and Improvement This bill would create a new Twelfth Circuit by moving Arizona, as well as Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington, out of the Ninth Doing so would create two smaller appellate courts where one dysfunctional court stood, all the while establishing stronger local, regional, and cultural ties. This would help alleviate the Ninth Circuit's enormous caseload and ensure a more timely and accurate judicial process for both circuits.  Now, importantly, the bill would also free the new circuit from the Ninth Circuit's precedent. That means States like Arizona would be able to chart their own legal course, consistent with their local needs and traditions.  A fair and functioning judiciary is one of the pillars of our democracy. Geography shouldn't limit a citizen's access to the courts.  The Judicial Administration and Improvement Act will right this wrong by restoring faith in our judicial system and securing the access to Justice that Americans deserve.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgS657.txt,1633,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,2.0,January

301,topic-id,5441,"Mr.President, I come to thefloor today to discuss the continued broken promises of ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--that passed in the most partisan offashions several years ago, and to discuss the process by which we are putting together a repeal-and-replace package and thepieces we will be voting on tonight and over the next several weeks and months.  ObamaCare's failures are simple. Thepromises that have been broken are clear. While partisan supporters of the administration's plan continue to promote the successof this poorly conceived law, Coloradans know far better.  Time and again, hundreds of thousands of Coloradans have felt theconsequences of the Affordable Care Act in their pocketbooks, in their workplaces, in their doctor's offices, and in the choicesthey have for health care. The past 6 years have been marred by higher costs, fewer choices, and less competition in Coloradoand across the  It is now time that we stand up for the American people to restore reliable and stable health care,as well as health care markets and insurance markets, and to undo the damage done to our health care by the failed law known as Let's just review the broken promises we have seen--not just a broken promise that the President himself made tothe American people but broken promises echoed by the partisan supporters of President Obama assured the Americanpeople over 35 times: Don't worry about ObamaCare because if you like your plan, then you can keep it, period. It is on video.It is on YouTube, and you can probably find it on It is available to find, this first broken promise.  AsColoradans began to receive cancellation notices, they quickly learned that this promise was far from the truth. In late 2013,nearly 335,000 small group and individual policies in Colorado were canceled due to requirements in the Affordable Care Act.These cancellations also included my family's cancellation, because we had chosen to stay in the private market in Butin August of 2013, we received the letter that 335,000 others received in Colorado saying that our policy had been canceledthanks to  But, unfortunately, those cancellations--those 330,000-plus cancellations in August of 2013--were justthe beginning, because in January of 2014, the Colorado Division of Insurance canceled an additional nearly 250,000 plans forthe same reason.  Again in 2015, Coloradans were made abruptly aware of the failures of ObamaCare when another 190,000 moreplans on the individual and small group market were canceled. In total, according to the Congressional Research Service, over750,000 health insurance plans were canceled in Colorado between 2013 and 2015.  The promise that if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it was so bad--that promise was so broken--that the fact-checking organization PolitiFact named it the``Lie of the Year'' for 2013. PolitiFact didn't really need to name it the ``Lie of the Year,'' becauseover 750,000 people in Colorado got a letter in the mail telling them it was a lie.  Broken promise 2 from ObamaCare:Americans were told that the Affordable Care Act would reduce costs for families, businesses, and our government. In fact,President Obama said that under his new health care law, a typical family would save up to $2,500 a year on premiums by the endof his first term. Look it up on video, on However, hit with the rising costs, Coloradans became acutely aware this toowas yet another broken promise. Statewide, premiums in Colorado will rise by 20.4 percent on average for plan year 2017 on theindividual market. That number is even higher in some of the more rural areas, like the Western Slope of Where is theWestern Slope? That is what most people think of when they think of Colorado, an area with mountains, forests, and great beauty.That area has been harder hit than many areas across the country with higher premium increases.  A year prior to this nextplan year, in 2016, the Colorado Division of Insurance found that premiums on the individual market rose a whopping 25 percenton the Western Slope, plus the higher than 20 percent premium increases.  One woman living in Colorado on the Western Slopesaw her premium rise from just a little over $300 a month to $1,828 per month, or nearly $22,000 a year. Here is her quote:       It's actually like another mortgage payment. I have friends      who are uninsured right now becausethey can't afford it.      Insurance is hard up here.  That is the Western Slope of Colorado, where people have seen mortgage-payment-size health insurance bills being added to them because of a bill that the President promised would lower their healthcare costs.  An increase of nearly 26 percent is devastating for most families, but in 2014 an Americans for Prosperity studyshowed that nearly 150,000 Coloradans saw their health insurance become 77 percent more expensive. These sharp increases inprices and coverage have left Coloradans reeling, and we have a duty--a duty--to make sure we provide them with the financialrelief they deserve and the health care we know we can put together.  Broken promise 3 of the Affordable Care Act was themenu of options that was promised--the choices that the Affordable Care Act would bring to the marketplace. President Obamapromised Americans that a greater choice and a menu of options to choose from would be right around the corner as a result ofthe Affordable Care Act, but Coloradans again found out that wasn't true. Of the 64 counties in Colorado, 14 counties have onlyone carrier to choose from and 29 counties have only two plans for the year 2017 on the individual market. We can see the plansright here. That is the western part of Colorado that I was talking about seeing such high premiums--77 percent and a higherpercentage next year. Here, we can see counties with only two carriers to choose from, and 14 counties only have one to choosefrom.  So the President's signature health care law failed in this respect to create the menu of options, but it did succeedin creating monopolies.  President Obama also insisted that competition would increase through consumer-run coops. TheFederal Government spent a great deal of money to prop up the consumer coops and to make sure they had the marketing in place.Over 80,000 Coloradans felt the impacts of this broken promise when the Colorado health coop was declared to be insolvent byColorado insurance commissioner Marguerite Eighty thousand people had their insurance coops declared insolvent becauseof the poor Affordable Care Act law.  Not only did the failure of this promise leave 80,000 people scrambling to findcoverage, but it forced the coop to default on its Federal startup loan, valued at an estimated $72 million. So 80,000 peoplewere out of coverage because of the failure of the Affordable Care Act, and $72 million went out of the American taxpayers'pockets because of the Affordable Care Act--money the American taxpayers will never see again. What is more, it cost taxpayersnearly $40 million to shut the coop down. Of the 23 original coops, only 6 are remaining and 17 consumer-run coops as a resulthave failed. The 23 startup insurers received a total of roughly $2.5 billion in loans under the Affordable Care Act, and only 6remain. That means that even more money the American people gave to this government to be good stewards of--through their hard-earned tax dollars, through their premium taxes--will never be seen again. This is an unacceptable and egregious use of taxpayerdollars.  But the careless spending under ObamaCare doesn't just stop there. An audit was released 2 weeks ago by the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, and it found that Connect for Health Colorado, Colorado'sState exchange,[[Page S233]]misspent and mishandled nearly $9.7 million in grants to establish its marketplace. The audit concluded byrecommending that the marketplace be required to repay the $9.7 million identified by the Federal The audit foundthat Connect for Health Colorado did not adequately document $4.4 million, improperly transferred costs totaling nearly$300,000, and made $164,000 in overpayments to subgrantees without identifying a reason.  Furthermore, Connect for HealthColorado spent more than $211,000 on bonuses to executives without providing performance evaluations. The kicker on the $211,000in bonuses--the largest of which was $18,500 for the CEO--back in 2013, when the exchange was trying to get started, was that thethen-CEO of Connect for Health Colorado wanted a raise even though the exchange had enrolled far fewer than half the people itwas supposed to. So we have an executive asking for a raise in an exchange that hadn't even met the lowest of the lowpredictions for what it would do. Here we are, with a new audit from the Office of Inspector General saying that $9.7 millionwas fraudulently spent. To quote a member of the board at the time:       Given the poor performance forthe first two months of      enrollments, I think it's incredibly audacious for the      executive director to request a salary increase.       I think most people would feel like if you're a CEO and you      are significantly underperforming the goals you helped set,      thenyou layer on that the money comes from public funds, I      think it is highly inappropriate.  I have heard colleagues in theHouse and the Senate talk about how CEOs are overpaid for the work they do. If the stock prices are low or dividends aren'tthere, then they shouldn't be as highly compensated as they are. But here we are, a government-funded program from the Coloradohealth exchange and others around the country using Federal dollars to give bonuses to people who haven't even met the basicprojections they were supposed to. It is an unacceptable use of funds.  But the problem is that it is not just funds wastedsomewhere else. It is funds wasted that came from the American people's pockets--hard-earned dollars that are being misspent.  The Affordable Care Act has had a negative impact on business owners and individuals. Let's talk about some of the effectson businesses. I will share a letter given to me, from a small business owner to his customers, letting them know how theAffordable Care Act impacted his prices.       Dear Valued Customer,       There is never a good time toannounce a price increase but      we have to. Effective February 1, 2017 we will have a 2%      across the board increase for a reasonbeyond our control.       We've had many challenges over the years but none like      this. 100% of this price increase is due to onething only,      the Affordable Care       The Affordable Care Act has caused our health insurance      premiums to skyrocket by 42%and our choices of insurance      providers to dwindle down to one.       Some of you may be faced with a similar challenge. It      seemsto be a problem all over the U. So now we have the double whammy on the American consumer. Not only are they requiredby law to buy insurance they can't afford, but they then go buy consumer goods whose prices have increased as a result of theAffordable Care So they are squeezed at home because they have to pay higher insurance premiums--thanks to the brokenpromises of ObamaCare, thanks to the lack of choice they have with Now they have to pay higher prices at the grocerystore or the implement dealership--wherever it is--because they have had to increase their prices--the people who make those goods,the people who manufacture those goods, the foundries, the equipment dealers. They have to pay for their insurance premiums thatthey are required, under a broken law, to search and find.  But it is important that we talk more than just about thebusiness impact of the Affordable Care Act, because, day after day, I hear stories from Coloradans who have felt the brunt ofObamaCare's failures. Whether it is letters or emails to the office or whether it is town meetings across Colorado, I hearstories, and I wish to take this opportunity to share some of these from my constituents that demonstrate the impacts of A letter I received from an individual residing in Aurora, CO, said:       Cory--As abusiness owner who pays for my own insurance,      ObamaCare is not working. Last year, my premium went up 20%      for less insurancewith a higher deductible and less coverage.       This year we just got a cancelation notice that our      insurance plan will nolonger be offered and we must start      looking for a new plan yet again.       I read that moreand more insurance companies are pulling      out of the Colorado marketplace.       The system is broken, it has only cost us more andmore      money for lower quality health care.       Please--do everything you can to stop this failed program.  That is from aColoradan who has struggled under the burdens and broken promises of  Let's talk about a letter we received from afamily living in Lafayette,       I have a ``Bronze'' HSA plan covering myself, my wife and      my twodaughters.       I just received my renewal notice from [the] insurer      informing me that my premium for 2017 will increase by38.9%.       To put that in perspective our family went from $1,200 per      month or $14,400 per year to $1,667 or $20,000 per year.       While the premium is increasing, the benefits are reduced      as annual deductibles for individual and family plans      areincreasing to $5,000 and $10,000 respectively. This is      unconscionable!       The cost of my health insurance coverage has morethan      doubled in the last three years and benefits have reduced      with each successive premium increase.       The ACA needs to berepealed immediately!  That is a letter from a family of four who saw a dramatic increase in price, both from the amountthey pay every month to nearly $20,000 a year, to a deductible that has gone from $5,000 to $10,000.  Here is another storyfrom a young woman residing in Colorado Springs, CO:       This is the third time since 2010 that I willbe losing my      health insurance plan because of  This is the third time. Do remember the promise that if youlike your plan, you can keep your plan?  This woman from Colorado Springs already has had her plan canceled three times.       Now I am losing the option of being in the plan I want to      be in.  There is the secondpromise--that if you like your plan, you can keep your plan; you get the choice of keeping your doctor--broken promises.       I must settle for being in an HMO, and still pay 400% what      I was paying for premiums in 2010.       Ialso just learned that my carrier is raising rates by 25%      next year on the individual market.       My premiums are already fourtimes higher than they were      before the Affordable Care My deductible and out of      pocket amounts are also much higher.       Obamacare is nothing but a heavy tax for us. Our income      doesn't qualify us for an Obamacare credit.       Since our premiumshave quadrupled I figure we are now      paying for the insurance for three or four other families      when we pay for our premiums.       I am very disappointed in Congress for letting this go on      and on and on.       Year after year now my premiums skyrocket and Ihave fewer      choices in plans. Pretty soon there will be no incentive left      to work hard and earn money in this country.  The government will take it from you and give it to people [to spend irresponsibly in Washington, DC].  To this youngwoman in Colorado Springs, we are doing something--finally. Last year, we put on the President's desk a repeal of ObamaCare, andof course it was vetoed. But this week, we will be able to start the process to repeal and replace ObamaCare, signed into law bya President who will indeed sign it.  Another story I would share from a family in Fort Lupton, CO:       It is impossible to afford health care for us.       We are right above the Medicaid limit by $400, and my      husband has gonewithout health care for 2 years. They keep      taxing him.       Soon we will be a family of 4 with no health insurance. We      will bepaying so much to afford health insurance we will      struggle to buy food. We need help and we don't know where to      find it.  These stories demonstrate what Americans are experiencing as a result of ObamaCare and its broken promises. No familyshould have to decide between purchasing health coverage and putting food on the table. We owe it to these strugglingfamilies--stories we just heard, about anyone who is sick or might get sick--to roll up our sleeves[[Page S234]]and provide realsolutions and to recognize that the Affordable Care Act was a failure, it caused calamity, and it continues to destroy and crushour health care market.  ObamaCare was a poorly designed law that was rushed through Congress on the most partisan of votes. Its nearly 20,000 pages of regulations have had a devastating impact on many hard-working Thatis why I will continue to work hard to find solutions that will relieve the financial burden this law has imposed on Coloradansand Americans throughout the country.  We need a health care system that promotes competition, increases flexibility,encourages innovation, and puts Americans back in control of their health care--one that gets ``Congress'' out of thepicture, one that safeguards the doctor-patient relationship, preserves Medicare for our seniors, and one that protects the mostvulnerable among us.  I will continue to fight for all of those in Colorado and across the country who are looking for realhealth care reform, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to do so.  We have a chance this week toact, and I look forward to replacing ObamaCare with something that actually fixes and makes this system work again.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cotton). The majority whip.  Mr.Mr.President, soon the Senate will vote to repeal This is for at least two reasons. One is that ObamaCarehas been an abysmal failure when you look at the promises that were made to sell it and actually what has been delivered interms of higher premiums, higher deductibles, and more challenges for ordinary Many Americans now find that theirdeductible is so high that they are effectively self-insured.  I remember like it was yesterday--actually, it was some 6 yearsago--that President Obama said: If you like what you have, you can keep it, in terms of your health coverage. He said: If youlike your doctor, you can keep your doctor. He said: The average family of four would see their premiums go down by $2,500.  None of that has proven to be true. ObamaCare was sold under false claims, false promises. We know that many headlines todaydemonstrate that premiums are higher than people can afford. They can't keep the insurance plan they had and they liked, andthey have to go find another doctor, sometimes as often as each year because the insurance coverage they have is no longer beingwritten because insurance companies simply can't survive in this marketplace. In many instances, they end up having to leaverural parts of the country, particularly rural parts of places like rural  A lot of this has to do with redtape. A lotof this has to do with the companies that have been forced to pass along higher costs to consumers or leave, and that is exactlythe sort of thing that happens when the government intervenes in the marketplace, unintended consequences occur.  I mentionedincreased rural access to health care. That was actually supposed to be one of the selling points of ObamaCare, and now it isjust another example of how this law has truly failed. Even so, even having acknowledged some of the failures of ObamaCarethemselves, our Senate Democratic colleagues are refusing to acknowledge the catastrophe they created because this law waspassed on a purely partisan basis, without any votes on the other side of the aisle, and signed by President Obama into lawwithout any participation by Now, having created this mess--creating this crisis really--they made clear they want nopart of fixing the problem. Apparently, they would rather ignore the harmful effects brought about by ObamaCare and try to thenassign blame to those who are trying to rescue the American people from the failure known as  We are confident theAmerican people know the truth. They know President Obama made promise after promise to get ObamaCare passed. They know thereality is a lot different, and it is a lot dimmer than the picture he painted. In my mind, such widespread public deceptionamounts to nothing more and nothing less than a simple case or, actually, I should say a colossal case of consumer fraud.  Inmy former job as attorney general of the State of Texas, we had a consumer protection bureau that went after scam artists andothers who deceived the American consumer, Texas consumer, and promised them one thing and delivered another. That is nothingmore or nothing less than what happened here where President Obama promised the American people the Moon when it came to healthcare, and they found out that those promises were hollow indeed.  That is why the American people want ObamaCare to become athing of the past. One recent poll showed that about 8 out of every 10 Americans wanted to change the law in significant ways orsee it replaced altogether. The truth is, ObamaCare is a terrible law that continues to hurt many American families trying toget by.  Americans all around the country are asking for help, asking for relief from this terrible law, and demanding abetter health care system that actually delivers results, not just empty promises. We can't get to that replacement until weactually repeal ObamaCare, which will start with the budget resolution we will pass this evening or late tonight.  This isnot a rushed or hurried response; it is merely the first step in a deliberative process that Republicans in both Chambers ofCongress have been working on for years. The only difference is now we will soon have a President in office who understands thatpeople are hurting, asking for change, and are in need of promises that are actually delivered.  It is not too late for ourDemocratic colleagues to work with us to get this job done and move forward with a solid plan that helps all Iunderstand the temptation, after creating this legislation, this health care debacle known as ObamaCare, to now say it is yourbaby, you deal with it and then try to assign blame if things don't work out exactly the way we hope. The fact is, we always dobetter here, and the American people are always better served when we try to work together in a bipartisan way, on a step-by-step basis, to deliver on the promises we made.  This budget resolution that we will be voting on tonight is not aboutIt is not about cutting health care for millions of people. Rather, the opposite is true. We are actually going to tryto save the American consumer from falling through the cracks or finding out that the promises that have been made to them aresimply not true or that they are burdened with health care policies that they simply can't afford.  What we are about isgetting rid of a failed policy that now 6 years in is still making life harder for millions of I am eager to makesure we keep our promise. That is the second part of this. We promised the American people that if they gave us an opportunityby electing a new President, by retaining the majorities in the House and the Senate, as they have, that we would deliver byrepealing and replacing That starts with tonight's vote.                      Nomination of Rex Tillerson  Mr.President, this morning I had the honor of introducing Mr.Rex Tillerson,President-Elect Trump's nominee to be Secretary of State, at his confirmation hearing before the Foreign Relations Iwas joined by my colleague Senator Cruz from Texas, former Senator Sam Nunn, and former Secretary of Defense Mr.Allof us said that Mr.Tillerson is an inspired and outstanding appointment by President-Elect  I have come to learn thatMr.Tillerson is a person whom I both respect and admire the longer I have gotten to know him. He has proven over his decades-long career in the top echelons of a large global company that he has what it takes to represent the United States on the worldstage. True, to this point, his responsibility has been toward shareholders of the company he has represented, but I have everyconfidence he can transfer that same sort of diligence, that same sort of acumen, and those relationships, from which a largemultinational corporation has benefited, now to the American people, and the United[[Page S235]]States of America can resume its placeon the world stage with him as our top diplomat.  I said before that one of my biggest frustrations with the currentadministration is it regularly ignores our allies while intentionally propping up or strengthening our adversaries. I have everyconfidence that Mr.Tillerson will flip that narrative, and he will help the United States regain our leadership role in theworld by unapologetically supporting our allies and friends while keeping our enemies in check. He is the right man to lead theState Department, and I hope we confirm him soon.                      Nomination of Jeff Sessions  Mr.President, let me add, today we are engaged in the second day of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding thenomination of Senator Jeff Sessions, our colleague of longstanding, to be U.Attorney  Some people whohaven't had the benefit of working with Senator Sessions know him by his record. Frankly, given some of the testimony, Idon't recognize the person who is being described by those who, for various reasons, are opposing his nomination. We know thathe has an outstanding record of service, both to the people of Alabama, to the United States as U.attorney, and then in theU.Senate for the last 20 years.  It is ironic that we are having a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on thequalifications of Senator Sessions to serve as Attorney General, a committee on which he has served for 20 years. Ourcolleagues across the aisle don't need to have a hearing to know Jeff Sessions because they already know him well. Theyknow him to be a man of honor, a man of principle, a man who is true to his word, and who believes, above all, that the role ofthe Attorney General is to enforce the law of the land--something we have not seen in the last 8 years during the Obamaadministration, where the Justice Department has become a political arm of the White  I have every confidence thatSenator Sessions, as the next Attorney General of the United States, will restore the reputation of the Department ofJustice and the Office of Attorney General to one that respects the rule of law and dispenses equal justice under the law.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, over the past few days, we have been listening to the health care horror stories from across the country,such as families earning an annual income of $50,000 who opted for high-deductible coverage and are facing up to $6,000 or, inone case, $10,000 of out-of-pocket costs before their coverage even begins. That is not affordable insurance.  Nearly 7 yearsafter the enactment of ObamaCare and 3 years into implementation, one thing is crystal clear: ObamaCare has failed, butRepublicans are working to fix the damage. Over the past several years, it is clear that this law is simply unworkable formillions of hard-working Insurance markets are collapsing, premiums are soaring, and health care choices aredisappearing, but the answer isn't to ignore the problem. With ObamaCare getting worse by the day, it is time for us to act. Therepeal resolution we are debating this week promises relief from ObamaCare and provides the tools necessary to immediatelyrepeal this failed law while ensuring a stable transition period to a patient-centered health care system that gives Americansaccess to quality, affordable care. The resolution includes instructions to authorizing committees sothat repeal legislation can move through a fast track process and can pass with a simple majority in the House and Theseinstructions to committees are provided to allow immediate action on repeal with the intent of sending legislation to the newPresident's desk as soon as possible.  Headlines from across the Nation highlight the urgent call to action. The New YorkTimes says: ``Obamacare Premiums Set to Rise Even for Savvy Shoppers.'' The Wall Street Journal says: ``Insurers Move to LimitOptions in Health-Care Exchange Plans.'' The Baltimore Sun says: ``Marylanders face hefty rate increases for ObamaCare.'' TheOmaha World Herald says: ``Health insurance rate increases may have some Nebraskans in sticker shock.'' The Miami Herald says:``Florida's ObamaCare premiums to rise average 19 percent in 2017, the State says.'' And the Bergen County Record says: ``NewJersey left with just two ObamaCare health providers for 2017.''  My own State of Wyoming is down to one insurer in theindividual market, both on and off the exchange. That is a national scandal. We have heard from people who talked about countieswhere there are no insurers. We have heard people talk about the costs they have both for the premiums and the deductibles. Andjust talking about the premiums, in New Mexico they had some counties where the average cost of a house payment is less than themonthly cost of their health care--much less, about 50 percent less in one instance.  It is also important to look at thefacts surrounding Some on the other side of the aisle like to focus on how many people are insured under the law, butlet's look at how many are not insured. Almost 28 million Americans remain without insurance under Even withinsurance, many still can't afford the care due to surging deductibles. If you can't afford the deductible, you really don'thave insurance. If you can't afford the insurance, you don't have insurance. And it isn't the insurance that is important; it isthe availability of providers that can take care of you. Most of the newly insured gained coverage only through a flawedMedicaid program that is providing inferior quality and threatening to bankrupt States across the  According toresearch from the architect of ObamaCare, Jonathan Gruber--he explicitly said that most of the newly enrolled beneficiaries wereactually eligible for Medicaid before In fact, his research showed that two-thirds of new people signing up forMedicaid were brought into the program, not through ObamaCare but by increased Medicaid advertising.  As America soondiscovered, the President and congressional Democrats focused exclusively on coverage and mandates that were handed down fromWashington instead of patient-centered reforms. Coverage was the silver bullet for them because coverage equaled health care.They forgot a key detail though: The cost of the plans that were mandated made it nearly impossible for many to pay for theinsurance or, if they had coverage, to pay for care with the sky-high deductibles. I know that some people on my staff hadhealth savings accounts that gave them catastrophic coverage. They didn't have to worry about going bankrupt over health care.Their deductibles were lower than the ones that we have with this health care.  Focusing on and highlighting the number ofpeople now enrolled in ObamaCare doesn't translate into anything more than phantom insurance, which, for users plagued byinadequate coverage, is coupled with huge out-of-pocket costs. We are seeing families now having to forgo medical care, notbecause they don't have insurance but because it is simply too expensive to go to the doctor with their ObamaCare health plan.  Normally I would say that you get what you pay for. But with ObamaCare, you seem to just pay without getting much at all. Itis kind of like buying a bus ticket, but when you show up for the trip, they tell you that to get a seat, you are going to haveto spend a little bit more, and then you have to chip in for the gas.  For years, Republicans have pledged to repeal thisdisastrous law. Passing this resolution is just the first step in keeping that promise, clearing the way for consideration ofrepeal legislation that will be signed into law by the new While providing immediate relief from ObamaCare,Republicans will ensure it is a stable transition in which those with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage.This will allow the Nation to move to a patient-centered health care system that gives hard-working Americans access to quality,affordable care. The goal is a more modern health care system where there is innovation to improve the health of all Americans,where insurers are offered new and affordable options, and where families have a more direct say over their own health caredecisions.[[Page S236]]  Unwinding partisan gridlock to make these changes will not be easy. As I noted in my earlier remarks, ourNation has made great strides in improving the quality of life for all Americans, but these transforming changes are alwaysforged in the spirit of bipartisan compromise and cooperation. We still need health care reform, but it has to be done the rightway. Passing this resolution will start building a bridge from ObamaCare's broken promises to better care for each and every Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk willcall the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgS224-2.txt,99999999999999,BAN ON REFUGEES,2017.0,11.0,January
296,topic-id,714,"Mr.President, I rise in favor of amendment 82. This amendment would make it so anyone inCongress trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act would not be allowed to touch women's health care services.  I have beenlistening to my colleague from Montana and my colleagues in this Chamber speak about health care in our country, and after manyhours, I am worried there is a lack of concern. I am worried there is a basic lack of empathy of what is going to actuallyhappen to millions of Americans, and I am particularly worried about what will happen to women and their children and theirfamilies. So I want to spend a moment just talking about what the ACA actually provides for women and what actually will happenwhen it is no longer there.  I am very concerned that we are barely 1 week into the new Congress and too many of mycolleagues have already made it clear that their most urgent priority this year is to take our country back to its darker dayswhen women could be denied coverage and charged higher health care premiums just because they are women. I am outraged by this,and I stand with millions of American women and men, moms and dads, sons and daughters who are outraged too. The Affordable CareAct uniquely gave women access to health care on a level that was unprecedented. In fact, 9.5 million more women now have accessto basic health care because of that law.  In my State alone, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, women can now have access tocontraceptive care, cancer screenings, and mammograms. Millions of women who were pregnant or survived diseases like cancer areable to keep seeing their doctors without fear that their health insurance companies will take it away, but too many people inthis Chamber don't seem to understand that consequence or seem to care about that consequence. After years of talking about it,some of my colleagues now seem determined--even entitled--to take away this lifesaving health care for millions of women.  Theelection in November was not about women's health care. No one came to Congress with a mandate to take away women's access tomammograms and cancer screenings, but now we are one big step closer to once again making it impossible for millions of Americanwomen to see a doctor when they need to in order to access basic medicine and reproductive health care services so they can livehealthy, happy, productive lives. For some, there is a very real risk that if they do get cancer or some other life-threateningdisease, they will have to declare bankruptcy just to pay for the health care they need. This is something we must standtogether to stop. It will show the American people that we understand what is happening to them. The consequences are too realand too dangerous, and for too many families the consequences are actually life or death.  We should never go back to thedays when insurance companies can tell a woman: You are no longer economic for us. We can't make money insuring pregnant women.We cannot go back to the days where insurance companies can tell a breast cancer survivor to go elsewhere because theirinsurance costs too much. I don't think we can ever go back to the days when insurance companies can simply charge women morefor the same plan than men. We should not turn back women's basic health care rights.  My amendment makes it very clear thatthe Senate would be forbidden from directing the committees to cut funding for basic women's health care services. It wouldensure that the women's health care protections we put into the Affordable Care Act would stay there and women would have accessgoing forward. It protects vital services such as disease screenings and comprehensive reproductive care that millions of womenin my State rely on.  If my colleagues destroy the Affordable Care Act, it will have real, direct, and painful consequencesfor a lot of women and the families who love them. I think it would be what we call the ultimate overreach by Congress, and itwould take years to fix.  I urge my colleagues to not let these protections be taken away from American women and theirfamilies, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very simple amendment.

But Senator Scottand I are going to take a moment or two to talk about a topic that I think millions of Americans appreciate: college football.  In the South, where Tim and I come from, it is as close to being a religion as you can get, and we are here tocelebrate Clemson University becoming the national champion in college football, beating Alabama in the best college footballplayoff game I have ever witnessed in my life.  To the people of Alabama: You had one heck of a ride, a 26-game winningstreak, something you should be proud of.  To the Tigers: You beat the best team in the country, and, to me, the way you wonis as important as the outcome.  DeShaun Watson is probably going to go in the very top of the draft to the I would sayhe is the best college football player in What DeShaun has won for Clemson is unbelievable. The way he has done it iseven more unbelievable. He graduated in 3 years. He is one of the nicest young men I have ever met in my life. His faith means alot to him.  He threw the ball to Hunter Renfrow, who was a walk-on--a young man from a small town in South Carolina whowalked on to the Clemson University team. Because of Coach Dabo Swinney, he had a shot at making the team and wound up catchingthe winning pass to win the national title.  How is this possible? It is possible because of leadership at the top. PresidentClements, our new president, has a vision of Clemson University as aggressive and bold off the field as Dabo has had on thefield. I think Dabo Swinney represents the best in college sports. The Clemson team is truly a family.

The Clemson program is a model for college athletics. Dabo has an uncanny ability to take people from different backgroundsand mold them into a team. He loves his players and they love him.  I live 5 miles from Clemson University and went to theUniversity of South Carolina, and most of you don't know what that means: the biggest rivalry.

Given the academic standards at Clemson, that is the only way Iwould have ever graduated from  So I want to tell the Tiger Nation that all of us in South Carolina are so proud ofyour victory on the field, but equally proud of the way you conduct yourself off the field. Clemson University is in the top 20public schools in the country, with no end in sight.  Next year, if I were an Alabama fan, I would be very optimistic.

The people of Alabama should be proud of their footballteam and their coaching staff because you have been on top of the mountain for a very long time.

Even before ObamaCare, Medicaid was plagued by quality issues and the law didnothing to address these problems. Instead, under ObamaCare, able-bodied adults not previously eligible, including someprisoners, are now covered by Medicaid which has strained already limited resources at the State level.  Republicans arecommitted to working with States, stakeholders, and the American public to improve the quality of the Medicaid Program, ensuringits long-term sustainability. That is reflected in my amendment. My amendment would create a reserve fund to allow for reformsto Medicaid and ensure the program has the right priorities.

40,topic-id,1260,"Mr.President, last November, I was in Maui celebrating the 100th anniversary of Haleakala National The weather at the summit of the volcano was terrible. It was raining in sheets, with 40-mile-per-hour wind driving the rain sideways, but I was there with over 40 schoolchildren to plant Haleakala silverswords--a special, threatened plant that only grows in the harsh climate at the summit of Haleakala volcano. The silversword can live for almost 100 years before it flowers, spreads its seeds into the wind, and dies.  Silverswords have dotted the landscape of Haleakala's summit for millennia, but invasive species, human activity, and climate change have pushed the plant to near extinction. In the early 1900s, scientists estimated that as few as 50 plants remained on the volcano, but this changed after Haleakala became a national park in 1916. In the 100 years since, park rangers and visitors have made a concerted effort to protect the silverswords from feral goats and sheep and to make sure hikers don't go off the trail and trample their shallow root systems.  After the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the silversword became listed as a threatened species. Through the law, conservationists have provided resources to help restore the silversword population on Haleakala for the hundreds of thousands of people who visit the park every year. Groups of students, including those whom I joined on that cold November day, have planted over 1,000 silverswords to supplement the population of silverswords. They were there to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Haleakala National  I share this story because it demonstrates many of the reasons the Department of Interior is so important in the role it plays in preserving our public lands.  Business is booming at our national parks. In 2015, our national parks hosted 305 million visitors--a new record--and these visitors generated $17 billion in economic activity in nearby communities.  Our national parks are suffering from an overwhelming deferred maintenance backlog of $12 billion. Our national parks are also understaffed. Because of sequestration and a variety of other factors, 10 percent fewer people work in our national parks today than 5 years ago. This is at a time when visitors to our parks are ever growing. This means fewer rangers and support staff dedicated to maintaining parks like Haleakala and protecting species like the silversword. To add to this, the administration has put a 90-day hiring freeze in place that threatens nearly 2,000 permanent vacancies that are critical to helping our national parks function.  We need an Interior Secretary capable of standing up to the President to make preserving our public lands a priority. But during my meeting with Nominee Zinke and his confirmation hearing before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, on which I sit--and his record as a Member of Congress--I did not receive the assurances and commitments I needed to support his confirmation as Interior Although he expressed some support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, or the LWCF--an important program that funds land purchases to add to protective areas like our national parks--he said the program could benefit from some ``changes.'' The only change I wish to see is to permanently reauthorize and fully fund the LWCF, which has suffered from chronic underfunding throughout its history, and I will continue to work with my colleagues, like Senator Maria Cantwell, who is ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in the Senate, to accomplish this goal.  We also need an Interior Secretary committed to preserving our public lands, not exploiting them for fossil fuel production. Congressman Zinke and the Trump administration are too wedded to the fossil fuel industry and fail this test as well.  Supporting alternative and renewable energy development is an issue people in Hawaii and, I would say, a lot of people in the rest of our country care about.  Earlier this year, I received a letter from Michael from Pahoa, who said that Representative Zinke ``has consistently voted for carbon heavy energy sources. His anti-environmental record shows a leaning that could well move exploration and extraction to areas formerly closed to exploitation. With interests in oil pipelines, he has a conflict of interest in moving away from fossil fuels and into alternative and renewable resources. We have destroyed enough of the country for the enrichment of the 1% with little to no benefit to the rest of our citizens. He is a destroyer, not a fixer. Not someone for the environment or the people.''[[Page S1466]]  Congressman Zinke also does not share a commitment to protecting endangered and threatened species like the silversword. While in the House, Congressman Zinke voted to block funding for any listed endangered species on which the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to conduct a 5-year review. It didn't seem to matter to Congressman Zinke that the reason these reviews did not take place was because Republicans in Congress failed to appropriate the necessary funding to conduct these reviews. Cutting funding in this way would devastate conservation and recovery efforts for as many as 850 species across the Nation, 137 of which are in Hawaii and 1 of which is the Haleakala silversword.  During the confirmation process, I asked Congressman Zinke if as Secretary he would work with Congress to ensure that the Fish and Wildlife Service would receive sufficient funding to conduct these reviews and recover our Nation's endangered species. He responded by saying that he would ``work closely with Congress to ensure recovery programs are appropriately funded.'' I don't know what he means by ``appropriate,'' but I do have a feeling that my view of sufficient funding, which is the question I asked him, and his answer that he would support appropriate funding are probably very different. In fact, I wonder if, under Secretary Zinke, there would have been the funding necessary to help Maui students plant their 1,000 silverswords on Haleakala's summit. This is wrong.  Congressman Zinke also does not share a commitment to combating climate change or supporting research that will help in that effort.  Washington, DC--do you notice how warm it is? It is It is 60 degrees. Washington, DC, is on track to have experienced the warmest February on record. We have a new administration stocked full of climate deniers. As Secretary of the Interior, Congressman Zinke will be leading the U.Geological Survey, the USGS, an agency that lists climate change as one of its top mission areas.  During his confirmation process, I asked Congressman Zinke if he would try to limit the USGS's work on climate change in any way. Unfortunately, Congressman Zinke did not provide a definitive answer--only saying that he would need to learn about the USGS's role in climate change research. His answer did not reassure me that he will allow USGS and other agencies in his Department to continue to make climate change research a priority or to protect the right of these scientists to pursue their research without interference. This is particularly concerning in light of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to silence our Federal workers, including those within the National Park Service, who are speaking out about the threat of climate change.  We need a Secretary of the Interior who will protect our public lands, make investments to conserve our endangered and threatened species, and who will continue to confront climate change. His record of past statements demonstrates that Congressman Zinke is not the right person to lead the Department of Interior at this juncture, at this critical stage. I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgS1463-2.txt,1844,SUPPORTING AMERICA'S,2017.0,28.0,January

137,topic-id,1686,"Mr.President, during last week's hearing on Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, I raised serious concerns about what is at stake for the future of our country. It is a mistake to think that the confirmation process for a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Court is only about the nominee. It isn't.  The real focus and the real heart of this decision lies in the struggles that working families, women, people of color, the differently abled, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, students, seniors, and our Native people face every single day. These are the everyday Americans who will be impacted by the decisions Justice Gorsuch would make. These are the people who would have been hurt by Donald Trump and the Congressional Republicans in their failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care  Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress fought for a plan that would callously throw Americans by the tens of millions out in the cold without health insurance and would make the lives and health of millions more precarious. It was only through the voices of Americans who were loud and steadfast in confronting TrumpCare that TrumpCare failed. These are the people for whom the need for justice is often most urgent. An understanding of these people, their lives, and how they would be impacted by the Court is what I found to be missing from Judge Gorsuch's view of the law. It is these same voices I am listening to now.  Judge Gorsuch should have been more open with the Judiciary Committee about how he would approach the difficult and important cases that come before the Supreme But time and again, Judge Gorsuch avoided answering questions, telling us his judicial philosophy and his view of the law were irrelevant to our consideration of his nomination.  The well-funded campaign to put Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court fueled by millions of dollars of money from unnamed donors has attempted to create a narrative about Judge Gorsuch and the stakes of this nomination. This is a narrative woven with Ivy League credentials and endorsements but not revealing at all about Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy--the heart he would bring to his view of the law.  During the hearing, many of my Republican colleagues echoed the view that credentials are enough and that our real questions about Judge Gorsuch's record and philosophy are somehow irrelevant or even inappropriate. Certainly, Judge Gorsuch did his part, telling us time and again in his words, his views, his writings, and his clearly expressed personal views that these writings had no relevance to what he would do as a judge. I disagree.  In my view, there is a great deal of difference between how Judge Gorsuch, as Justice Gorsuch, would approach the kinds of tough cases that reach the Supreme Court and how, say, a Justice Merrick Garland would approach these cases.  We know that Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, both legendary jurists and close friends, would reach dramatically different results in cases that matter deeply in the lives of millions--cases like Shelby County, like Lilly Ledbetter, like Hobby Lobby, like Roe v. Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg differ in how they view important cases that came before them. That is why a Justice's judicial philosophy is important in our considerations.  Donald Trump knew this, too, when he set forth his clear litmus test for his Supreme Court pick. To paraphrase the President, he wanted a Justice who would adhere to a broad view of the Second Amendment, who believes corporations are entitled to ``religious freedom'' at the expense of the rights of their employees, and who would overturn Roe v. Wade, to quote the President, ``automatically.''  In Judge Gorsuch, Donald Trump selected a nominee who passed his litmus test. When we asked Judge Gorsuch about his opinions in specific cases like that involving the terrible choice facing Alfonse Maddin between freezing to death or being fired, the judge told us we should look instead at his whole record. When I examined his whole record, I saw too little regard for the real-world impact of his decisions and a refusal to look beyond the words to the meaning and intent of the law,[[Page S2040]]even when his decisions lacked commonsense.  When we asked about decisions where Judge Gorsuch seemed to adopt strained interpretations that narrow laws meant to protect worker safety, he said simply that he was a judge and he didn't take sides. Yet too many times, his narrow interpretations led to decisions that were on the side of big corporations and against the side of the little guy. When asked to respond, he said that if we didn't like the result, if we didn't like his decisions, it was because a statute was too limited or unclear, and that Members of Congress should do better.  We asked Judge Gorsuch about his decision in Hobby Lobby, which found an expansive new right to religious liberty for a corporation that employed thousands of people. He did not explain how he assessed the terrible impact this decision had for thousands of working women at the company who would now be denied access to contraceptive coverage.  When I met with Judge Gorsuch, he told me he had a heart. After 4 days of hearings, I still don't know what is in his heart. I would have liked Judge Gorsuch to have been more open so we could have had a real conversation about what the law is and who the courts protect. What we got instead were platitudes about the work of the courts that came straight from a Norman Rockwell painting.  I did agree with the judge that article III courts are there to protect minority rights. Article III of the Constitution protects the independence of the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts and gives enormous authority to judges and Justices to determine how to apply the law to the cases before them to protect minority rights.  It is critical that before we decide to grant Judge Gorsuch a lifetime appointment to the Nation's highest Court, the Senate is able to gain an understanding of his approach to the law. At our judiciary committee hearing, I asked Jeff Perkins, the father of a young boy with autism, about the impact of Judge Gorsuch's decision on his son's education progress at and outside of his new school. The case involved the protections of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, which Judge Gorsuch's decision narrowed to point that these comments under the law were deemed virtually meaningless.  The new school that Luke Perkins attended made little effort to ensure that the skills he developed in school were translating at home. As a result, Luke severely regressed. Experts in autism, psychology, and occupational therapy testified on Luke's behalf that the school was seriously neglecting his needs. An impartial hearing officer, an administrative law judge, and Federal district court all agreed Luke's regression showed that the school was not providing him with a ``free appropriate public education'' as required by the  Judge Gorsuch disagreed and decided the school had ``merely more than de minimis'' responsibility to do better for Jeff Perkins, Luke's father, said that he knew Judge Gorsuch's decision would negatively impact thousands of families with special needs children like It broke his heart.  Judge Gorsuch's extraordinarily narrow interpretation of the IDEA was rejected unanimously by the U.Supreme Court last week. In his opinion for the unanimous Court, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the minimal standard determined by Judge Gorsuch was clearly at odds with the purpose of the law for children who are not progressing along with their peers. Justice Roberts wrote:       The goals may differ, but every child should have the      chance to meet challenging objectives. . . . When all is said      and done, a student offered an educational program providing      ``merely more than de minimis'' progress from year to year      can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.  When asked by my colleague, Senator Durbin of Illinois, why the judge wanted to ``lower the bar so low'' in his decision, Judge Gorsuch, referring to Luke's case, responded:       If anyone is suggesting that I like a result where an      autistic child happens to lose, that's a heartbreaking      accusation to me. But the fact of the matter      is what is bound by certain precedent.  Heartbreaking or not, Judge Gorsuch still found against the autistic child. Thankfully, the Supreme Court disagreed with Judge Gorsuch's wrong decision. It was wrong because remedial legislation such as IDEA should be broadly interpreted in favor of the group being protected. And it was wrong because the courts are not innocent bystanders. Their decisions have real-world impacts for thousands or even millions of people beyond the parties in a particular case before the  This is especially true of the Supreme Court, which issues decisions that don't just reach those cases in front of them--the frozen trucker, women who work at Hobby Lobby faced with lack of critical healthcare. They also reach millions of others impacted by interpretations of the law made by the Court in those decisions. The Supreme Court does not just interpret our laws. The Supreme Court is an affirmation of our country's values. The Supreme Court shapes our society.  When we began the hearings on Judge Gorsuch's nomination, I said the Supreme Court vacancy isn't just another position we must fill in our Federal judiciary. A Supreme Court vacancy is a solemn obligation we must fulfill for the future of our country and for our future generations. The central question for me, in looking at Judge Gorsuch and his record and listening carefully through 3 days of hearings, is whether he would be a Justice for all or Justice for some. Regrettably, I do not believe Judge Gorsuch would be a Justice for all of us.  I will oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. This vacancy is simply too important for the future of America and our values to do otherwise.  I yield back.

147,topic-id,904,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise, and I do feel like, to clarify, the bill title of H.1219 is Supporting America's Innovators  Our colleagues have seen time and time and time again that the other side has wanted to come to the floor and talk about everything other than what we are dealing with. But I do want to lay out, as one of the senior members of the committee, what has happened in Financial Services when we have dealt with this.  Last Congress, this exact bill passed 52-2 in the committee, with the ranking member supporting the bill. There were no dissenting minority views that were offered. And now, with this particular piece of legislation, H.1219, there were no amendments even offered at the Rules  So which is it? My friends across the aisle complain when we don't do regular order. They complain if this had gone on suspension. I am kind of reminded of Groucho Marx in his movie, ``Horse Feathers.'' Whatever that is, I am against it. That seems to be their attitude.  But I do look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to make sure that they join me in supporting government funding when we are going to be dealing with that here shortly.  So on to our bill here, H.1219, unless the opposition, the other side of the aisle, would like to continue to talk about a lot of nongermane things; I will keep bringing up Susan Rice and her illegally unmasking people if they would like to do that. We can continue with that conversation.  I would prefer to talk about H.1219. So we know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are the heartbeat of the American economy, and access to financial capital is vital for entrepreneurs seeking startup money, or to operate, or to expand their businesses. However, gaining access to capital has remained an enduring challenge for small businesses.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession made the situation worse as capital became increasingly hard to access from institutional banks and various capital players. And while conditions have improved somewhat in the recent years, many entrepreneurs continue to struggle with accessing the capital that they need to compete and to grow.  In order to succeed, these companies need capital and credit, which is the lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet the government continues to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing as smaller companies are caught in a sea of regulatory red tape created by Washington bureaucrats oftentimes.  As we had a similar bill yesterday, I made the point at that time as well. We know that 60 percent of all net new jobs that have been created here in the United States, 60 percent of all net new jobs that have been created here over the last 2 decades, have come from these small businesses.  Congress has made strides in tailoring the regulatory environment for these smaller companies--most notably when we passed, with strong bipartisan support, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, in 2012. That was a bipartisan bill that was signed by President  The JOBS Act's benefits are notable as more and more companies use its provisions to raise investment capital in both the public and the private markets. And the JOBS Act raised the cap on investors in a privately held company from 500 to 2,000 investors, but the limit on the number of investors acting as a coordinated group to invest in a company remained at 100, where it has been since 1940, some 77 years ago. I think it is about time that we update that.  As noted by Kevin Laws, of AngelList in his written testimony before the Capital Markets Subcommittee: ``With online fundraising and general solicitation becoming more common because of the JOBS Act, companies are bumping up against the limit more frequently. The current limit . . . now acts as a brake on the amount of money the company wanted to raise, leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table that did not go into startups.''  Well, H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives Patrick McHenry and Nydia Velazquez, would amend the cap currently contained in the Investment Company Act to allow 250 investors, instead of that 100, for a qualified venture capital fund, and, therefore, enhance angel investors' ability to provide important funding to our small businesses.  This bill is a very modest increase to the current exemption which has been in place for nearly 77 years, since 1940. Modernizing the cap is long overdue and reflects today's capital markets realities and the increasingly important role that angel investors play as they commit the funds necessary to help these small businesses grow.  The Securities and Exchange Commission continues to ignore the backlog of good ideas to spur capital formation recommended by entrepreneurs, small businesses, and market participants at the SEC's annual government-business forum on capital formation. So in the SEC's absence, Congress must act to promote market efficiency and capital formation. That is what we are here to do today, and I do think that that is an extremely important thing for us to do here in  I think that we can all agree that we support smart regulation that protects investors and maintains orderly and efficient markets.

Right now, my Republican friends are behind closed doors somewhere in the Capitol debating healthcare legislation. And what I am against is this whole process. This is backwards.

In the scheme of things, this is a relatively minor piece of legislation, compared to my Republican friends' plans to repeal the Affordable Care  Yes, we should be debating Russia and all the ties that the Trump administration has with The question[[Page H2712]]used to be: Who in the administration has ties with Russia? Now the question is: Who in this administration doesn't have ties with Russia? Yes, those are important things we ought to be talking about. But, come on.  What we are objecting to is you bringing filler to the floor while, in secret, you are trying to dismantle health care in a way that we believe will harm millions and millions of Americans; that will take away their protections, those who have preexisting conditions; that will throw millions of people off of their insurance; that will take away essential health benefits. Yeah, that is important to us, and it is important to the American people.  What we are objecting to is a process where you debate these issues in secret and you bring stuff like this to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, this week, President Trump signed a bill to allow internet service providers to sell their customers' sensitive information. This information includes location, financial and health data, information about customers' children, Social Security numbers, web browsing history, app usage history, and the content of their customers' communications, such as emails and video chats.  Yet, amazingly, President Trump's tax return information is still off limits to the American people. Every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information. These returns have provided a basic level of transparency that has helped to ensure the public's interest is placed first.  So the message from President Trump and the Republican Party is clear: It is okay for companies to profit off your medical and financial information, or information contained in your private emails, but the American voter is not allowed to know if the President has any conflicts of interest. That is right. Donald Trump's privacy matters, but your privacy doesn't.  Internet companies can auction off your private, personal information to the highest bidder. But information related to Donald Trump's business life must be kept secret.  Mr.Speaker, the American people deserve better, and it is incumbent upon us, as the people's elected Representatives, to hold the executive branch accountable.  So I am going to ask people to vote ``no'' on the previous question. And if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, which will require Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to release their tax returns.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, this is a big deal.

153,topic-id,786,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend from  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to support the rule providing for consideration of H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that has seen productive debate and almost no opposition when it was considered by the House Financial Services The House considered a very similar bill last July that received 388 votes here in the House in support.  Congressman Patrick McHenry has been steadfast in his dedication to finding opportunities to update our securities laws so we can harness the true power of our capital markets. In recent memory, this started with the JOBS Act, which was very bipartisan and has been crucial to reinvigorating our capital markets. However, there is still more we can do.  The Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017 increases the limit on the number of individuals who can invest in certain venture capital funds before those funds must register with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Currently, the act limits the number of investors in an investment company fund to 100 if the fund is to be exempt from registration with the This registration is an extremely costly regulatory requirement that is not always appropriate.  The Chamber of Commerce describes this as a fix to what has come to be known as the ``99 investor problem,'' that is, the requirement that certain venture capital funds register with the SEC once they reach their 100th investor. Increasing this low threshold, originally set in the 1940s, would allow venture capital to continue to play the important role in the economy that it has in the past.  Unless Congress updates this threshold, startups, the driver of job creation and economic growth in our districts, will continue to be choked off from what should be easily accessible and affordable capital.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to be clear so that my good friend from Colorado understands where I am coming from.  I don't really care about this bill. I think it is a noncontroversial bill that, quite frankly, probably could be approved by voice vote if it were brought up that way.  The point I am trying to make is that this is a relatively minor bill compared to some of the important issues that we need to deal with. It is troublesome to me that, on this bill, which my friend from Colorado said involved years of hearings and where the sponsor of the bill consulted with Democratic colleagues--I favor all of that. But what I am really outraged about is that, while we are talking about this relatively inconsequential bill and about how wonderful this process around this bill is, there are meetings going on in secret, right now, with my Republican colleagues, on dismantling health care in this country, conversations that might result in tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance, conversations involving taking away essential benefits from insurance packages, conversations that would basically remove protections for people who have preexisting conditions.  All of this is going on in secret. We are reading about it in the press. I am sure my colleagues know about it because they are reading about it. Maybe they are proud of these secret meetings. I want to know where these secret meetings are.  I am simply saying to my friends on the other side of the aisle, on something as big as health care, you ought to be having these meetings out in the open. There ought to be hearings. You ought to bring in patients and patient advocate groups. You ought to bring in doctors, nurses, and heads of hospitals. You ought to bring in people who are going to be affected by any kind of changes you make in our healthcare policy.  Instead, it is being done behind closed doors, in secret, and I think the American people are outraged by that. That is one of the reasons why the bill you brought to the floor recently only had 17 percent support amongst the American people.  So what we are objecting to is the fact that we are not bringing to the floor matters that are urgent, like keeping the government running and like an infrastructure bill. We are also objecting to the fact that we are reading that my Republican friends are, once again, behind closed doors negotiating another healthcare bill that we think will do great damage to the health care of a lot of people in this country.

It will be short, and it will be sweet, but it will be to the point.  I was here in 2009when we passed In fact, as the Presiding Officer will remember, it was at 9 o'clock in the morning on Christmas Evein 2009. I opposed it at that time for a particular reason. The reason was that I saw it driving ustoward a single-payer health care system, which I personally opposed. But the votes were there. It passed, and it passed on thepromise that if you liked your doctor, you could keep him; if you liked your insurance, you could keep it. And because everybodyis going to be insured, rates will go down and everything is going to be wonderful.  What has happened over the last 8 yearshas been pretty incredible. Rates have gone up tremendously. People have not been able to keep their insurance. We findourselves on the cusp of being forced to a government single-payer health care system because the private markets arecollapsing.  In my State of Georgia, where we have 159 counties, up until this year every county had at least two or moreproviders providing health insurance. Today in 2017, 96 of our 159 counties have one carrier. Next year half of them will bedown to no carrier, and we will be forced into a system that we don't know what it will look like. Prices have gone up not justby a little bit, but they have gone up by an awful lot. The end-user market in Georgia is approaching the breaking point.  Iwill give you a couple of examples. Two parents in Georgia picked the least expensive plan available this year to their familyof four. It comes out to be a $6,500 deductible and $2,400 a month for premium--unsustainable.[[Page S240]]  A couple in theirsixties had a similar plan but were just outside the subsidy limit of $96,000 for their family. So they are paying over 50percent of their income for health insurance.  Hard-working families deserve better. Although President Obama promised thislaw would reduce premiums and make health care more available, it has done the opposite. ObamaCare is unsustainable. Now, thatis the practical answer, and that is exactly what got us to where we are today.  We are in the process of attempting to getthe budget reconciliation act before us so that we can repeal ObamaCare, but we must also talk about what we replace it withbecause repealing it without a replacement is not an acceptable solution. It is not a solution. It is a conundrum.  We mustprioritize returning the oversight of individual markets to the States and provide them with the flexibility to design theirMedicaid programs in ways that enable them to cover most people and tailor benefits to meet the needs of the unique populationsin their  We have proven in the past that regulation by the State insurance commissioners work. We need to returnassociation health plans to be competitive in the United We need to allow the sale of interstate insurance across Statelines and stop the prohibition against that. We need to open the opportunity for entrepreneurship in the private sector to fillthe void that is being filled by the vacuum that has been created by the mandates of  We need to also preservethose things in ObamaCare that made sense--preexisting condition, absolutely; insurance coverage up to the age of 26 whilestaying at home with a parent, absolutely. Those things can be done, and we ought to do them because they were the right thingto do when we did them, and they are the right thing to preserve now. But it is absolutely essential that we see to it that wereturn insurance to the private sector and regulation to the If we fail to do so, we will have higher premiums or nopremiums at all and no plans at all.  So as we talk about repealing, we must also end up landing on a replacement. It isunsustainable and impractical, and it is wrong for us to say we are going to repeal ObamaCare without replacing it with a planthat we know works and has the opportunity. Let's address that which caused ObamaCare to happen. Let's fix the breaks that havetaken place. Let's bring back competition, State regulation and authority, and let's see to it that health care in America isaccessible and is affordable. It is important for us to do it. It is essential for us to do it, and I plan to commit myself toseeing to it to do my part to repeal We replace it with a sustainable program, we return the program to the States,wherever possible, and we see to it that Americans have health insurance coverage at a competitive and fair price.

23,topic-id,603,"Mr.President, article 2 of chapter I of the Charter of the Organization of American States, of which Ecuador is a party, states that one of the OAS's purposes is ``to promote and consolidate representative democracy, with due respect for the principle of nonintervention.''  I mention this because the second round of Ecuador's Presidential election is scheduled for April 2, less than 2 weeks away. In the first round, Lenin Moreno, who is supported by outgoing President Correa, received 39 percent and his opponent, Guillermo Lasso, received 28 percent, so it is a hotly contested election.  But democracy is about more than elections. There is no institution more fundamental to democracy than a free and independent press. A free press helps protect the rule of law, to ensure that no person or group is above the rules and procedures that govern a democratic society. A free press helps ensure transparency to prod governments to be honest and accountable to their citizens.  Although wavering at times, Ecuador has a history of democratic government of which its citizens can be proud. It has a long tradition of recognizing the importance of freedom of the press. Ecuador's first constitution, written in 1830, stipulated that ``every citizen can express their thoughts and publish them freely through the press.'' Ecuador's 1998 constitution guaranteed the right of journalists and social communicators to ``seek, receive, learn, and disseminate'' events of general interest, with the goal of ``preserving the values of the community.'' Even Ecuador's current constitution protects the right ``to voice one's opinion and express one's thinking freely and in all of its forms and manifestations,'' and the right to ``associate, assemble and express oneself freely and voluntarily.''  Yet, since President Correa was first elected, freedom of the press has been under assault. He has called the independent press his ``greatest enemy.'' He sought to intimidate and silence his critics in the media and civil society, like Janet Hinostroza, El Universo, Vanguardia, El Comercio, Xavier Bonilla, and He publicly vilified Catalina Botero, a respected Colombian lawyer and former OAS Special Rapporteur for Freedom of He pursued criminal charges against columnists and newspaper owners who had criticized his policies. During this period, the number of state-owned media organizations exploded, growing from just one government-run news outlet to a media conglomerate that today is made up of more than a dozen outlets echoing the government's self-serving declarations. These actions are a threat to democracy, and they damaged relations with the United  On April 2, when the people of Ecuador elect their next President, they alone will decide Ecuador's future. What is important at this stage is to ensure that the electoral process is free and fair, that the press can participate freely, and that the election is open to international observers, including the  Whoever wins on April 2, I hope Ecuador's next President is someone who genuinely believes in the freedoms of[[Page S1885]]expression and association that are enshrined in Ecuador's I hope he defends the right of a free press, an independent judiciary, and the right of civil society organizations to function without government interference. These rights are part of the foundation of the representative democracy referenced in the OAS The alternative is unaccountable government. That is, in fact, where Ecuador was heading, after President Correa orchestrated the adoption of a new constitution in order to run for reelection in 2009 and again in 2013.  I hope the result on April 2 will signify a commitment to uphold Ecuador's Constitution and the beginning of a new relationship with the United States, based on a common devotion to the fundamental rights of citizens.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1884-3.txt,1383,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,21.0,January

253,topic-id,1518,"Mr.President, I am truly saddened that I must address what I fear is a growing threat to our Republic--the silencing of political debate by totalitarian mob violence on college campuses.  I was not in Burlington, VT, last Thursday to witness what happened at Middlebury College, but I would like to read from accounts that have been provided by two people who were, in fact, there and who saw these things unfold. They were the targets of the mob's violence. Their names are Allison Stanger, professor of political science at Middlebury College, and Charles Murray, the author of several groundbreaking books, including the work ``The Bell Curve'' and a scholar at the American Enterprise America deserves and needs to hear their stories.  On Saturday, 2 days after the incident, Professor Stanger wrote on her Facebook page as follows:       I agreed to participate in the event with Charles Murray      because several of my students asked me to do so. They are      smart and good people--all of them--and this was their big      event of the year.       I, actually, welcomed the opportunity to be involved      because, while my students may know I am a Democrat, all of      my courses are nonpartisan, and this was a chance to      demonstrate publicly my commitment to a free and fair      exchange of views in my classroom.       As the campus uproar about his visit built, I was genuinely      surprised and troubled to learn that some of my faculty      colleagues had rendered judgment on Murray's work and      character while openly admitting that they had not read      anything he had written. With the best of intentions, they      offered their leadership to enraged students, and we all know      what the results were.       I want you to know what it feels like to look out at a sea      of students yelling obscenities at other members of my      beloved community. . . . I saw some of my faculty colleagues,      who had publicly acknowledged that they had not read anything      Murray had written, join the effort to shut down the      lecture. All of this was deeply unsettling to me.       What alarmed me most, however, was what I saw in student      eyes from up on that stage. Those who wanted the event to      take place made eye contact with me. Those intent on      disrupting it steadfastly refused to do so. It was clear to      me that they had effectively dehumanized me. They couldn't      look me in the eye because, if they had, they would have seen      another human being. There is a lot to be angry about in      America today, but nothing good ever comes from demonizing      our brothers and sisters.       When the event ended and it was time to leave the building,      I breathed a sigh of relief. We had made it. I was ready for      dinner and conversation with faculty and students in a      tranquil setting. What transpired instead felt like a scene      from [the TV show] ``Homeland'' rather than an evening at an      institution of higher learning. We confronted an angry mob as      we tried to exit the building.       Most of the hatred was focused on Murray, but when I      took his right arm both to shield him from the attack and to      make sure we stayed together so I could reach the car, too,      that's when the hatred turned on me.       One thug grabbed me by the hair, and another shoved me in a      different direction. I noticed signs with expletives and my      name on them. . . . For those of you who marched in      Washington the day after the inauguration, imagine being in a      crowd like that, only being surrounded by hatred rather than      love. I feared for my life.[[Page S1633]]  The next day, on Sunday, the American Enterprise Institute's website published this account from Charles  Murray wrote:       If it hadn't been for Allison and Bill Burger [Middlebury's      Vice President for Communications] keeping hold of me and the      security guards pulling people off me, I would have been      pushed to the ground. That much is sure. What would have      happened after that I don't know, but I do recall thinking      that being on the ground was a really bad idea, and I should      try really hard to avoid that. Unlike Allison, I wasn't      actually hurt at     all. . . .       In the 23 years since ``The Bell Curve'' was published, I      have had considerable experience with campus protests. Until      last Thursday, all of the ones involving me have been as      carefully scripted as kabuki: The college administration      meets with the organizers of the protest, and ground rules      are agreed upon. The protesters have so many minutes to do      such and such. It is agreed that, after the allotted time,      they will leave or desist. These negotiated agreements have      always worked. At least a couple of dozen times, I have been      able to give my lecture to an attentive or, at least, quiet      audience despite an organized protest.       Middlebury tried to negotiate such an agreement with the      protesters, but for the first time in my experience, the      protesters would not accept any time limits. If this becomes      the new normal, the number of colleges willing to let      themselves in for an experience like Middlebury's will plunge      to near zero. Academia is already largely sequestered in an      ideological bubble, but at least it's translucent. That      bubble will become opaque.       Worse yet, the intellectual thugs will take over many      campuses. In the mid-1990s, I could count on students who had      wanted to listen to start yelling at the protesters after a      certain point, ``Sit down and shut up. We want to hear what      he has to say.'' That kind of pushback had an effect. It      reminded the protesters that they were a minority.       I am assured [he continues] by people at Middlebury that      their protesters are a minority as well, but they are a      minority that has intimidated the majority. The people in the      audience who wanted to hear me speak were completely cowed.      That cannot be allowed to stand. A campus where a majority of      students are fearful to speak openly because they know a      minority will jump on them is no longer an intellectually      free campus in any meaningful sense.  I suspect that most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may not necessarily be fans of Charles There is nothing wrong with that, but I am confident they at least would be honest enough and self-respecting enough not to condemn any scholar's work without ever having read it, like many of Middlebury's faculty members apparently did. More importantly, I am confident my Democratic colleagues would join me in denouncing the violence of the Middlebury campus protesters who sought to silence On countless occasions, I have heard my Democratic colleagues come to the Senate floor to condemn violence in all of its forms. Why would this time be any different?  We do not agree on everything, but I am confident that if Murray were invited to testify here on Capitol Hill--perhaps at a committee of the United States Senate--my Democratic colleagues would eagerly join in an open and respectful debate that would ensue as a result of that visit. I am confident they would reject any effort to silence or to do harm to those with whom they might disagree. In fact, I am confident that if any outburst like that happened, whoever was chairing that committee and the ranking personnel associated with that committee would immediately bring the disruption to a close so an open, honest, respectful discussion could occur within that meeting.  I know tensions are high in America today, and I know what it is like to be on the losing side of a bitterly fought Presidential election as we, as Republicans, found ourselves in just a few years ago in the wake of the 2012 election cycle and in the wake of the previous Presidential election cycle before that in 2008, but that does not and cannot give anyone the license to shout down a fellow American, let alone to physically assault him just because he holds a different opinion.  Democracy and freedom--the republican form of government--depend on open, tolerant, and civil political discourse, and sustaining our democratic freedoms is, perhaps, the sole reason the government subsidizes institutions of higher education in this country.  It is embarrassing that teachers and students at an elite college like Middlebury should need reminding, but speech is not violence, and violence is not speech. Totalitarians who fail to recognize this core fact of decency and tolerance are goose-stepping into some of the darkest corners of the human heart.  If there is anything that should unite us in these polarized times, it is that the kind of violence we saw on Middlebury's campus last week must not be tolerated. That is why I commend the 44 Middlebury College professors who have signed a ``Statement of Principles'' on ``Free Inquiry on Campus.'' I hope more Middlebury professors will join them. In any event, I hope all Americans will join them in standing up for free, open, honest, respectful debate.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1625-4.txt,1501,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,7.0,January

I heard from one constituent whose mother had two devastating lung diseases. While she had good insurance, unfair lifetime spending caps priced her out of receiving the lifesaving treatment she needed. When the Affordable Care Act passed, we ended the cruel practice of lifetime spending caps. With these new protections, she was able to resume her treatment and stay healthy to spend time with her daughter and granddaughter.  Mr.Speaker, the ACA works. It reduces healthcare costs, enables young people to stay on their parents' insurance, and ensures low-income and struggling families that they can access the care they need.  If Republicans repeal this law without a viable replacement, there will be real consequences to real people. Let me be clear: by repealing the ACA, Republicans would end healthcare coverage for millions of families, put the insurance companies back in charge, and, yes, make America sick again.

These are not stories from wealthy Utahns who have simply had to pay higher taxes, norare these stories from low-income Utahns who already have insurance through Medicaid.[[Page S246]]  These are letters are from thetoo often invisible victims of ObamaCare--those middle-class families who used to be able to afford health care when they neededit but are now forced to pay for it and to pay for what amounts to, in some cases, one of their largest payments or even theirlargest payment they make each month for a so-called insurance plan that never seems to pay out because of high deductibles.  Jenica from Davis County, UT, writes as follows:       I am an ordinary mother raising my kids andstriving to live      within my means. For the first time, my family is facing a      year with no health insurance. Our gross incomefalls a few      hundred dollars per month too high for us to receive help      through CHIP or UPP programs, but we cannot afford topurchase      health insurance through my husband's work or through the      After this year's premium increases, the      mostinexpensive plan offered to us on the Marketplace is a      full quarter of our gross income per month (before taxes),      and if we putthat into our budget we will not be able to save      any money to pay deductibles as healthcare needs arise.       We face the sameproblem with my husband's work insurance;      it would be even more expensive, and we cannot wisely budget      a quarter or more of ourincome toward health insurance      premiums.       I know this problem is not limited to my family, and I want      you to be aware ofthose of us who are falling in the gap this      year. We earn barely too much to receive any assistance, but      not enough to actuallypay for insurance premiums. It seems      the wisest course for us is to withdraw from insurance and      save our money to pay formedical expenses in cash, as well as      saving to pay the fine on our taxes next year.       It is a decision I do not make lightly,as I know that the      insurance companies need more people, not less, to      participate to make the system work. However, my familycannot      afford to participate this year.       I know you will represent us well and take our needs into      consideration as you workwith the other members of Congress      to make our country's healthcare system work for all of us.      Thank you for serving our stateand our country. May God bless      you in your efforts.  May God bless you, May God bless you for having the courageto write these things down and to share them with your fellow Utahns and your fellow  I promised Jenica that Iwill do everything I can, everything within my power, to make sure that you and families like yours are not forgotten when werepeal this law and replace it.  Trevor from George, UT, had a similar story. He writes:       Irecently got a new job and I'm trying to get healthcare.      None of the 3 plans my employer offers are affordable to me,      eventhough the government claims they are. Even if I were to      buy the cheapest plan, I would never be able to use it      because of thehigh deductibles.       I do not qualify for Medicaid, and earn $1,000 per year too      much to qualify for subsidies.       In anutshell, I can't afford to buy insurance from      anywhere, and by not buying it, I can't afford the penalty      levied by the federalgovernment. What is someone in my      position supposed to do?       The ACA is not helping the very people it was designed to      helpand is in fact throwing a terrible burden upon me and my      family. We need a new healthcare system. This one is not      working.Please share my story so that others will be aware      that people in my position (and there are many of us) are      struggling.  I will share your story, Trevor, and soon we will be one step closer to a new type of system, a system thatwill put patients and doctors back in charge of health care decisions rather than having those decisions made by governmentbureaucrats in  The last letter I would like to share today comes from Washington County, Ron from WashingtonCounty writes as follows:       Today I received a letter from my health insurance carrier      indicatingthat the premium for me and my two kids--yes, only      three people--is increasing from $1,020 per month to $1,706      per month, anincrease of slightly over $8,200 per year. My      annual income for 2017 will not be increasing, let alone to      cover eight grand.       Later this afternoon, I am contacting my travel agency (a      local small business) and asking Judy to cease her research      intomy family vacation for the summer of 2017. Why would I      cancel my vacation and also take away revenue from a local      smallbusiness? The answer is ``67.26%.'' That is the      percentage increase for my health care insurance.       I need you to see thatthis is real. It greatly and      negatively impacts my family and it subsequently impacts      local businesses as more of my money isdrained from the      economy. I make roughly $60,000 per year. My medical premium      is now one third of my gross income! Plus, I stillhave to pay      out deductibles and copays.       Even the bronze programs, which are worthless, are designed      to bankrupt a family andend up costing more in the long-run,      have exceeded the cost of the mortgage I took out on my      George home in 2014. More thanmy mortgage! Repeat more than      my mortgage. That should send shivers down anyone's spine.       One of the most important aspectsof America's middle class      is the ability for a family to purchase a home. Now that      insurance premiums have exceeded the mortgagepayment of a      median priced home in the US, I suspect that the dream is now      slipping out of the hands of many  Ron, you are absolutely right. Thanks to ObamaCare, the American dream is now slipping out of reach for far too manyfamilies throughout the State of Utah and throughout the entire country. These are not just the stories of a few isolatedThese are not just stories from a few statistical outliers. There are fewer affordable options for Utahns throughout the In 20 out of Utah's 29 counties, Utahns can only choose a health plan from one insurance company. They have just onecompany to choose from, and the options available are not always as robust as they should be. Within those options that theyhave, the costs have risen far too much each year. For 2017 plans, insurance rates across Utah increased at least 30 percent, onaverage. This is after multiple years of substantial premium increases in the other years leading up to this.  Fortunately,help is on the way. Thanks to President-Elect Donald Trump's victory this November--and thanks to the outcome of House and Senateraces throughout the country--we now have the opportunity to uproot this ill-conceived health care law, root and branch.  Theold system, to be clear, is far from perfect. After we repeal ObamaCare, we still have much work to do unbundling health carefrom employer-provided health insurance so doctors, nurses, patients, and innovators can do the work of bringing down prices andincreasing quality. That is what happens when we allow the free market to operate. We get competition. When people compete, twothings happen that are important for consumers: Prices go down and quality goes up.  That is what the American people havecome to expect and basically every other sector of our economy. Sadly, we have seen the opposite become true with respect to ourhealth care system under ObamaCare because we have restricted free market forces, and we have impeded competition. As a result,prices have gone up and quality, in some cases, has gone tragically down.  Step one involves repealing this health care law.Trevor, Jenica, and Ron, I want you to know that I hear you. I hear you and I hear all Utahns who have contacted me to sharetheir experiences with this health care law. My colleagues in the Senate have heard you too. We will repeal this health care lawand we will bring reform and competition to our Nation's currently broken health care system.  Madam President, I yield thefloor.

64,topic-id,152,"Mr.Speaker, at the 11th hour, the Obama administration's Labor Department issued a rule that stonewalled bipartisan changes to the unemployment insurance program. These changes were made so that tax dollars would be used in a more efficient and more effective manner.  It has been 5 years since Congress passed legislation giving the States the discretion on drug-testing policy for unemployment applicants. Using delay tactics, the previous administration prevented that law from ever being implemented as designed.  This kind of executive overreach impedes the ability of States to ensure that the unemployment insurance program accomplishes its intended purpose, and that is to promote reemployment.  In Texas, we take the job of fiscal responsibility very seriously. This week, Congress is responding to that overreach by the previous administration. We hope that Congress will take that responsibility very seriously. I urge my colleagues to vote against the executive overreach and to vote for H.42.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1137-6.txt,1806,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,14.0,January
270,topic-id,2230,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Collins) for including me in this Special Order tonightand for yielding to me and for becoming a friend of mine.[[Page H457]]  Mr.Speaker, it is with tremendous honor and humility that I rise to represent the hardworking values of the 18thCongressional District of Florida, with communities like Palm Beach Gardens, home of the PGA tour; Stuart, Florida, home to theU.Sailing Academy; Port Lucie, the spring training home of the New York Mets; and Fort Pierce, Florida, the home of theonly Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in the entire country. It is an amazing place for anyone to go to.  Before I go any further, I do want to--and I know I am joined by the rest of my freshmen colleagues, and probably the entirebody, when I say that our thoughts and our prayers have been with our new colleague, Mr.Rutherford from the FourthDistrict of Florida, the sheriff as I call him. He is a friend and a patriot. I know that we are all praying for his speedyrecovery.  As I talk to people in my community, there is one issue that keeps them up at night more than any other issue, and that issue is the water quality in our area, or rather, the lack thereof. I can tell you, it isnonnegotiable. It is a nonnegotiable priority for me, that we allow the water in our community, water that used to be so bluethat it looked like something out of a postcard, to once again become clean for this generation and for future generations.  When I was studying at Harvard, I studied the environment. I did very specific work in watershed infrastructure. I can tellyou, it doesn't take an academic to know that these waterways are irreplaceable treasures. They are central to the economy andthe quality of life in our region. It is why most people I know make our 18th District home, why they call it some place thatthey want to live for the rest of their life. It is the water and it is the weather. To tell you the truth, if you take thewater away, the weather isn't always that comfortable.  Right now there is water being discharged from the center of our State, Lake Okeechobee into the Treasure Coast of Florida,destroying our community, putting our people out of business, killing sea life, and making people sick. What makes our communityso beautiful is literally being robbed from us, and this cannot continue. Our lagoon and our estuaries have to be restored. Iwill work endlessly to strengthen the partnership between our local, State, and Federal agencies to upgrade that infrastructure;not just talk about it, but actually get it done because this is life or death for the community that I represent.                              {time}  1830  Mr.Speaker, if I sound heated over this, it is because I am heated over this. When I look back at history and see that thePanama Canal took less than a decade to build once the United States Government got involved, that the Hoover Dam was built andopen in 5 years, as far as I can tell, construction technology has only improved since the 1930s, but the infrastructurerestoration surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Everglades is taking decades. It is an absolute embarrassment that thewater infrastructure projects in Florida are taking so long and at such a great social and economic cost to communities like myown. We can't afford to wait any longer, and this will be my top priority.  Another issue that I hear about constantly is from people in our community talking about the role America's weak foreignpolicy over the last 8 years has played in destabilizing the Middle East and making our country and communities--places like FortPierce, where the terrorist who attacked the Orlando nightclub lived, where he worshipped--making our country less safe.  As a Member of Congress, I will work every day to provide the men and women of our armed services with the tools and theflexibility that they need to do their job and to come home alive.  When I was serving in the Army, I had the honor to work alongside the best men and women that I have ever known. I worked asa bomb technician in our highest level of military special operations; and under the cover of darkness in Afghanistan, our jobwas to kill or capture the most menacing targets each and every night that we could find.  I witnessed firsthand the extremists that want to literally destroy our way of life. My scars and the scars of my fellowveterans and peers, they should be a continual reminder of the enemy that we are fighting and why the work that we are doing isso important.  For me, on September 19, 2010, I found my last explosive device, and it wasn't that much different from so many others thathave claimed the lives of friends of mine. It was homemade explosives encapsulated in pieces of glass--nails, ball bearings,shrapnel that was meant to detonate whenever it was stepped on.  Mr.Speaker, the people that put that bomb there, that manufactured that device, who have killed or wounded our bravest menand women, their goal is to wipe our country and our allies off the face of this Earth, to bring that same war to our hometownsas they have done in so many places already, places like New York and Boston and Chattanooga, San Bernardino, Fort Hood, and Eight years of failed international leadership has created a vacuum of power that is being filled by ISIS and otherterrorist groups. ISIS right now has more money, more land, more resources than al Qaeda did at 9/11.  Sitting back and waiting for peace, that is not a strategy. Containment, that is not a strategy. We need an aggressivestrategy to root out extremists, eliminate any safe haven to prevent future attacks on the United States of  I can tell you, Mr.Speaker, I am as well aware as anybody that defeating those who come against us out of a hatred, itcomes at a cost. Friends of mine--too many friends of mine--have lost three or four limbs, have been blinded, have been covered ontheir entire body with burns, have had massive head trauma or some combination of all of the above injuries.  Sadly, I am also aware of how often the VA fails these men and women, and I can tell you that it is not an option. We haveto do better. We owe our veterans better than the care that they are getting right now.  Improving care for our veterans, it starts with reforming the Department of Veterans I strongly believe that thebest way to do this is to give veterans the flexibility to choose anytime, anywhere medical care. The increased competition willforce the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide a higher quality of care to our servicemen and -women.  Beyond this, we have to eliminate the corruption and the incompetence at the Department of Veterans Affairs to reduce theclaims backlog currently plaguing the VA hospitals across the country. These pending claims make it nearly impossible for themen and women who fought in places like Iwo Jima, the Chosin Reservoir, Saigon, Mogadishu, Kandahar, Mosul, and any other placesto live their life, as they have to wait years for a decision from the Department of Veterans Fixing these problemswill ensure that the future generations of servicemen and -women are not burdened with the same challenges that today's veteransare facing.  In addition to physical health care, we have to do more to help veterans with mental health care. There is a stat that isthrown around all too often that there are more than 20 veterans a day who take their own life. I have known some of them. Icould tell you how that is an unacceptable rate that far exceeds the average of the civilian population. But the fact is, tolose just one veteran from suicide is completely unacceptable.  This is very personal to me. I have seen firsthand the impact that war can have on soldiers returning home, all of whomdaily work through the trauma of having friends whom they are forced to remember who didn't come home with them.  Not a week goes by where I don't get a call from someone who wants to talk about the fact that they want to step in front ofa bus or go to sleep in their garage with the car running and never wake up. Often this call comes after a traumatizingexperience that they have just had at the Department of Veterans  We need to be there for one another, and we need to be there for our veterans. I think often about something that PresidentKennedy once said. He said:[[Page H458]]         The cost of freedom has always been high, but Americanshave      always been willing to pay that price.  Our veterans, they do pay that price. They make tremendous personal sacrifices. But just because they are always going to bethere and they are always willing to make these sacrifices for our freedom, that doesn't mean that we can take their service forgranted, which is exactly what is happening every single time one of our veterans is failed.  I am committed to doing all that I can to increase mental health resources for our veterans and doing anything, whether thatis legislatively or personally, to reduce veteran suicide rates.  But we also have to do more to assist returning veterans in finding jobs and starting new careers once they do exit themilitary. I know that the men and women that I served with were among the most talented and hardworking men and women that Ihave ever met in this entire world.  Veterans know what it is like to work in high-pressure situations, to be held to a standard of excellence. They know thestress of loading their body down with hundreds of pounds of equipment and trekking that across long distances, working togetheras a team. They know what it takes to go out there and get the job done, no matter what challenge is placed in front of them.And they know what it is to not just risk the bottom line, but to actually go out there and put their own life on the line.  Veterans are among the most qualified employees for any position. But veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan,they face an unemployment rate that is substantially higher than the national average. I am committed to working with localbusinesses and community leaders to discuss ways to reverse this troubling trend, as well as supporting legislation that willhelp our veterans use the very unique skills and talents that they have developed for the rest of their life.  Mr.Speaker, following my service in the U.Army, I made a very conscious choice to volunteer with the Israeli DefenseForces because our countries share common ideals of freedom and democracy and mutual respect for all people, something that Iknow firsthand is not common in most of the Middle  During my time in Israel, I served alongside soldiers driven by love for their fellow man rather than by hatred for theirneighbors. I learned with each family that I got to know just how much each family truly desires peace with every neighbor ofIsrael, regardless of their religion or their history with those countries. The same cannot be said of Israel's enemies.  For the United States, the choice is very clear: we either stand with a historic friend and ally who shares our values, orwe cave to groups like the Palestinians or countries like Iran who represent everything that the United States is not.  I have found that the most important time to stand for what is right is when it is the most difficult time to stand for whatis right. This moment in history is no different. We have to be proud of who we are, and we have to stand with those who standwith us and stand against any terrorist regime who seeks to threaten even one of us.  Mr.Speaker, the last thing that I want to say tonight is simply that it is a tremendous honor to have the opportunity toserve the people of Florida's 18th Congressional I know very well that the office that I occupy, it doesn't trulybelong to me. It belongs to those people. And the simple fact is that the status quo has not been good enough for them. Familiesacross the country, they are hurting, and I know that we have a lot of work to do.  I have laid out a number of priorities to help the 18th District and to strengthen our country, but I also know this: theproblems Washington, D.is facing, they cannot just be fixed with bills and laws.  One of the most important lessons that I ever learned in the military, that I ever learned in combat, was that inspirationmatters. Military leaders that I had who displayed courage and valor and selflessness, they drew the exact same thing out ofevery single soldier that surrounded them. And that is my goal as I am here in the Halls of Congress, every day, that I work to,above all, inspire each peer that I have here, Republican and Democrat, to have courage and to make sure that their sense ofduty is to America above anything else, and to make sure that we serve selflessly and, every day that we are given the honor toserve here, to make this country and our communities that much better.

As Majority Leader McCarthy said:       If youwalk on the floor of this House and you don't get      goosebumps, it's time to go home.  Standing here at this podium, I have goosebumps.  People often ask me why I ran for Put simply, I ran with the goal of helping people achieve their American For too many, the idea of the American Dream is just that: an idea, a fantasy, a fairytale.  I believe in the American Dream because I have lived it. I was born in South Boston to a working class family. Opportunitytook my family to Michigan when I was 11. My dad got a good job building trucks on the line at General Motors, and my mom workedat the Salvation My parents worked hard to provide for me and my six younger siblings. I learned the value of hard work ata young age watching my parents.  I was the first of my extended family to go to college and worked full-time to pay for my education; and then I dedicated mycareer to workforce training, helping people build the skills necessary to get good jobs to begin their careers to support theirfamilies. There is something about the pride that comes when someone gets a job. Their whole world changes when they see whatthey are able to achieve and what their work does for their families.  Over the last several years, failed policies and an unstable economy have put the American Dream out of reach for many.Though overall unemployment rates are down, long-term unemployment is high; labor force participation rates have droppeddramatically, and wage growth is anemic.                              {time}  1845  Instead of getting ahead, many Americans are just getting by.  In the November elections, Americans screamed for relief. My message to the people of Michigan's 10th District is that yourvoices have been heard. We are already working here in the House on measures to roll back regulations to support families,businesses, and the economy, and to breathe life back into the American  In order to make it possible for more people to achieve their American Dream, we must give them the freedom and the tools tosucceed. This begins by stemming the extreme regulatory overreach, fixing our healthcare system, and strengthening our workforce[[Page H459]]while restoring our critical infrastructure.  As we have learned in the last 8 years, we cannot regulate our way towards a stronger economy. The opposite is true:government overreach cripples our economy. From my years of running a business, I have firsthand knowledge of how excessiveregulations make it harder to succeed. Time and resources that could be better spent on growing a business and creating jobs arespent navigating a never-ending and confusing maze of Federal regulations.  Many of those regulations have been imposed without a cost-benefit analysis, placing costly burdens on families andbusinesses while providing little benefit. Regulators have exceeded their authority by placing undue burdens on those strugglingto make the economy work.  The House has already acted by passing the REINS Act and the Midnight Rules Relief Each of these measures would putaccountability where it rightly belongs: with the people's elected Representatives in Congress, not with unelected bureaucrats.  We are also reforming health care in American to prevent further harm to families and businesses. Patients and doctorsshould be in charge of their health care, not the government. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed, patient choice andaccess to care has declined while costs are ever increasing.  Despite all of the promises, many people who had plans or doctors they liked could not keep them. Insurance carriers areforced to severely narrow their networks to combat cost.  Our healthcare reform is a better way to increase accessibility and patient choice, in addition to reducing cost. We will dothat by allowing purchase of coverage across State lines, authorizing businesses and individuals to band together to increasepurchasing power and negotiate prices, allowing health savings accounts, and expanding risk pools. Our plan focuses on puttingpower where it belongs: with the people, with the patients.  Government overreach does not stop with our health care. I know that surprises you. The one-size-fits-all approach toeducation legislation in recent years has failed America's students. It is time to put parents and individuals in control oftheir education and give them options that will best suit their needs. I am eager to advance solutions that will help studentslearn and be better equipped for future jobs, to create flexibility for working families and prepare the workforce for a moderneconomy.

52,topic-id,1831,"Mr.President, we have the nomination of Representative Ryan Zinke to be the Secretary of the Interior as the business before the body today, and I wish to spend a few moments this afternoon speaking about him, his qualifications, and why I believe he will be a strong Secretary of the  Of all the Cabinet-level nominations that have an impact on my home State of Alaska, the Secretary of the Interior is almost certainly the most important and the most consequential. Two-[[Page S1472]]thirds of Alaska--nearly 224 million acres--is under Federal management. To put that into perspective, that is more land than is occupied by the entire State of Texas, and it is an area about 177 times larger than the State of The vast majority of that land is controlled by agencies within the Department of the Interior, from the Bureau of Land Management, to the National Park Service, to the Fish and Wildlife Again, significant parts of Alaska--more land than is occupied by the State of Texas--are held under Federal management. It is for this reason we in Alaska call the Interior Secretary our ``landlord.'' He might not necessarily like that fact, but that is what he is effectively.  While it might sound strange if you are from an Eastern State such as Massachusetts or New York, which have hardly any Federal lands within their borders, the decisions that are made by the Department of the Interior literally determine the livelihoods of thousands of Alaskans, as well as the stability and the success of our When the Department of the Interior chooses to work with us, Alaska is able to grow and prosper, even as our lands and our waters remain protected under the most stringent environmental standards in the world. When the Department chooses not to work with us, as was all too often the case in the last administration, the people of Alaska suffered. Our State's economy, our budget, and our future are all threatened at the same time. I start with that context to help the Senate understand why I take this confirmation process so seriously whenever a new Interior Secretary is nominated.  I consider whether the nominee is right for the job and whether he or she will do right by the people of Alaska, as well as other western states. I talk with the nominee and ask him or her questions about everything from ANCSA and ANILCA to wilderness and wildlife management. When I make a decision, I am making it as a Senator for Alaska and as the chairman of both the authorizing committee and the Appropriations subcommittee for the Department of  Today, after a great deal of review and careful consideration, I am very pleased to be here to speak in strong support of our new President's nominee for this position, Representative Ryan I believe Representative Zinke is an excellent choice to be our next Secretary of the Maybe I am a little bit partial here, but the fact that he is a fellow westerner, hailing from the Treasure State of Montana--that helps with my decision. He is a lifelong sportsman. He loves to hunt and fish. That also resonates with me. I also understand he is a pretty good downhill skier, and I like that too. He is a trained geologist. He has worked as an energy consultant. Even more notably, he has dedicated his life to the service of our Nation, including more than two decades as a Navy SEAL, a term in the Montana Senate, and most recently as the sole U.Congressman for his home  Representative Zinke's life and career have prepared him well to serve as Secretary of the He was born in the He lives in the He understands it. He understands its people. He has substantive knowledge of the challenges facing the Department and truly a firsthand experience in trying to solve them. He has also shown that he understands the need for the Department to be a partner for Alaska and other western states, which contain the vast majority of our nation's Federal lands.  We had an opportunity in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a hearing to consider Representative Zinke's nomination on January 17. It seems like an eternity ago now, but what I remember very clearly from that morning is the positive and very compelling vision he shared with us.  Representative Zinke told us he grew up in a ``small timber and railroad town next to Glacier National Park.'' He explained that he believes the Secretary is responsible for being ``the steward of majestic public lands, the champion of our great Indian nations, and the manager and voice of our diverse wildlife.'' He did show us--and spoke to it in the committee hearing--that he understands the purpose and the value of Federal lands, invoking Teddy Roosevelt and pledging to follow the multiple-use doctrine.  As other colleagues have come to the floor today to speak about Representative Zinke's nomination, several have spoken to the issue of the Antiquities Act, speaking more directly than to the issue of multiple-use as it relates to our public lands. Yet, in outlining the concept of multiple-use that Representative Zinke believes and follows, it is probably best to look to his own words that he said when he was before us in the committee. On multiple-use, Representative Zinke said the following:       In multiple-use, in the spirit of Roosevelt, it means you      can use it for multiple purposes. I am particularly concerned      about public access. I am a hunter, a fisherman. But multiple      uses are also making sure what you're going to do, you know,      and you go in with both eyes open, that means sustainability.      That means that it doesn't have to be in conflict if you have      recreation over mining.       You just have to make sure that you understand what the      consequences of each of those uses are. It's our public land.      What I have seen most recently is our access is being shut      off, roads are being shut off, and we're all getting older.      And when you don't have access to hunting areas, traditional      fishing areas, it makes it an elite sport.       And I'm particularly concerned about the elitism of our      traditional hunting, fishing, and snowmobiling. Making our      public lands accessible in the spirit of multiple-use. Single      use, if you look at the Muir model of some of our national      parks and some of our areas, I agree. There are some areas      that need to be set aside that are absolutely appropriate for      man to be an observer.       There are special places in our country that deserve that      recognition. But a lot of it is traditional uses of what we      find in North Dakota and Montana where you can hunt and      fish, you can drill an oil well. Make sure there is a      reclamation project. Make sure there is a permit, make      sure there's If you are doing something that's more      intrusive, make sure you monitor the water. Everyone      enjoys clean water and we should. I don't think      necessarily they are in conflict. I think you have to do      it right.  I think it is important to put those comments of Representative Zinke on the record because it is clear that, again, he recognizes the multiple uses of our public lands--recognizing there are certain places that are special but ensuring, again, that the doctrine of multiple-use is respected as initially intended.  Representative Zinke also told us that he would have three main tasks if he is confirmed as Secretary of the The first, he said, is to ``restore trust by working with rather than against local communities and states.'' The second is to address the multibillion dollar maintenance backlog at the National Park Service so that we preserve the crown jewels of our public lands for future generations. And the third is to ``ensure the professionals on the front line, our rangers and field managers, have the right tools, right resources, and flexibility to make the right decisions that give a voice to the people they serve.''  So those were the three priorities as outlined by Representative Zinke, and I believe all three of those missions are necessary. I am hardly alone in supporting Representative Zinke as the right choice to fulfill them. Within the committee, he drew bipartisan support when we reported his nomination to the full Senate on January 31. He has drawn widespread support from dozens and dozens of stakeholder groups all across the country: from the Alaska Federation of Natives, the Blackfeet Tribe, the Choctaw Nation, the National Congress of American Indians, Safari Club International, Ducks Unlimited, the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, the National Rifle Association, the Public Lands Council, and the American Exploration & Mining These are just a few of the many stakeholders that have praised or endorsed Representative Zinke to be our next Secretary of the  I am glad we are finally here today on the verge of confirming Representative Zinke to this position. I would remind the Senate that despite many substantive differences, we confirmed President Obama's first nominee for Interior Secretary on inauguration day back in 2009--not so with Representative It has now been 6 weeks since we held his nomination hearing and almost a full month since we reported his nomination from our committee--again on a strong bipartisan basis. I am disappointed, of course, that it has taken this long to get to this point, particularly with regard to a nominee who I think, by all accounts, is not controversial or unqualified.  Now we need to confirm Representative Zinke without any further delay,[[Page S1473]]so that he can select his team and get to work addressing the range of issues that he will inherit. From the maintenance backlog of the Nation Park Service, to the need for greater balance in Federal land management, to life-and-death issues in remote Alaska communities, and from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to U.S.-affiliated islands, Representative Zinke really has his work cut out for him, and he needs to be allowed to get started as soon as he can.  Again, I will repeat that I believe Representative Zinke is a solid choice for this demanding and critical position. While we may not agree on every issue, I believe he will work with us in a thoughtful manner that is reflective of a true partnership. I believe he understands what the job requires, he has the experience necessary to succeed in it, and he will show that the Department of the Interior can still work with local stakeholders to achieve positive results.  I thank Representative Zinke for his willingness to continue his service to our Nation and for his patience during this process. On behalf of Alaskans, I look forward to working with him after he is confirmed with bipartisan support, and I urge every Member of the Senate to support his nomination.  With that, I see the other Senator from the great State of Alaska is here with us today.  I yield the floor.

246,topic-id,1203,"Mr.President, I come to the floor actually on behalf of students across the country, and for those who are so passionate about their education that they want to dedicate themselves to teaching, and to urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and support strong and accountable teacher preparation in America today.  While this rule may not be the rule that any of us would have written on our own, it is important.  Let me say at the outset that there are many great teacher prep programs that exist around our country, and they are doing a great job preparing our teachers to succeed in the classroom, but there are also teacher preparation programs out there that are struggling and need support to help make sure they produce great teachers for our schools.  Now, as a former preschool teacher and as a mom, I know how important it is to have great teachers in our classrooms, and I understand how a good education, with an amazing teacher, can change a child's life. I am sure all of our colleagues think back on that one special teacher they had who shaped their mind and changed their life. They teach us not only how to read and write and do arithmetic, but good teachers teach us how to think critically, how to be creative, how to form an argument. I know I am not alone in saying that I owe much of what I have to the quality of the public education I received growing up, and I have spent my career fighting to make sure every child in America has the same opportunity I did.  Unfortunately, too many teaching students today are forced to take out huge amounts of student loans to afford continuing their education so they can realize their dream. They are willing to make this sacrifice. They don't complain. The very least we can do for those who want to become teachers is to make sure they are actually getting their money's worth when they make an investment in themselves.  That is what this rule does. It helps make sure students can make informed decisions about the quality and preparedness of their education.  Here are a few of the ways this rule does that--and I am hoping my colleagues will see that this shouldn't be controversial. This rule strengthens and streamlines reporting requirements of teacher prep programs to focus on employment placement and retention of graduates. It provides information from employers to future teacher candidates so they can make an informed decision about their education by choosing a school that improves the likelihood they will find employment after graduation. It makes sure that prospective teachers can access this information they need before they take out massive amounts of student debt.  When teacher programs are struggling, this rule helps States identify at-risk and low-performing programs so States can provide them the support they need to adapt or adjust their programs and help their teaching students succeed.  There is one more reason I would urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution today. Simply put, it would put more power into the hands of Secretary DeVos, and many of us don't yet have the trust that she would use that power to promote the best interests of students in higher education. Secretary DeVos does not come from a higher education background. We don't know whether she supports providing information on teacher placement rates and retention rates before prospective teachers take out student loans. We have no idea what she would do if this rule went away, and I believe it would be too risky to find out.  By investing in our teachers, we are investing in our future generations. Our future teachers have the right to know whether they are receiving a quality education, and they deserve to know that before they take out massive amounts of student debt.  It helps to improve teacher prep program accountability and gives prospective teachers the information they need to make an accurate decision on which program is most likely to make them a successful teacher in the classroom.  It ensures that Secretary DeVos does not have more power to implement unknown policies that could hurt students and reduce the number of qualified great teachers in our public schools.  Without this rule and the information that it ensures, students will have a hard time finding a quality teacher prep program that will help them get a job after they graduate. I think that is simply wrong. We should be working to make sure teaching students have full access to information and options. This rule would give them less.  For all the future teachers out there, I urge my fellow Senators to vote against this CRA because every young adult deserves to know that the program they enroll in is actually preparing them to be a successful teacher in the classroom, and every student deserves to have an amazing teacher in every classroom.                      Every Student Succeeds Bill  Finally, Mr.President, I wish to bring up one more thing that is very important to me--the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act--and a potential serious threat to it. It seems that Republicans are thinking about bringing to the floor another CRA that would eliminate the rule that provides States with flexibility and guidelines to create their State plans. I want to be very clear. I hope Republicans reconsider that approach.  The Every Student Succeeds Act is a critical part of our bipartisan education law. It is an important part of the civil rights protections it offers, as well as the assurances it made that every student would have an opportunity to succeed, no matter where they live or how they learn or how much money parents make. Jamming through that resolution would weaken it, and it would be a major step toward turning our bipartisan law into another partisan fight.  Rolling back the Every Student Succeeds Act rule less than a month before States have to submit their plans to the Department of Education will cause chaos and confusion in the States, and it will hurt our students, our teachers, and our schools. It will also give Secretary DeVos greater control over that bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act and give her the tools to implement her anti-public education agenda.  Secretary DeVos's lack of experience and expertise, as well as her damaging track record on school privatization, leaves her unqualified to implement this bipartisan law that governs public education and public schools without the important guardrails that rule ensures. Given her record and her comments, she would almost certainly push for measures that disregard key civil rights protections in the Every Student Succeeds Act and could allow unequal, unfair, and unreliable accountability for schools across the country.  The Every Student Succeeds Act rule is supported by Democrats and Republicans, by teachers and businesses, and by parents and communities. We should not go backward.  I urge my colleagues to reconsider moving forward with that resolution, which I understand they want to bring up later this week, and work with us to continue building on that bipartisan progress that we all worked toward for our students.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.[[Page S1628]]  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1625-4.txt,1409,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,7.0,January

Chronic diseases are the leading cause of preventable deaths and disabilities, and they cost the U.economy more than $1 trillion per year.  This crisis is so severe that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has deemed chronic disease to be ``the public health challenge of the 21st century.''  We can reduce lifestyle-related chronic disease and end this crisis, but that means improving and sustaining health-related behaviors. That is where the health coaches come in. They step in to fill the gap between healthcare provider recommendations and sustainable lifestyle changes. By helping to improve individual health and wellness, health coaches get to the root of this Nation's health crisis.  I want to give my deepest thanks to the health and wellness coaches who are making the people of this Nation healthier. We should all support them in their efforts.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-13-pt1-PgH1116-3.txt,2097,VOTE ON MOTION TO ADJOURN,2017.0,13.0,January

168,topic-id,717,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Capito, Van Hollen, and Isakson in the introduction of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research, STAR, Act of 2017. This legislation is an extension of ongoing bipartisan efforts in the Senate over the past decade to get us closer to the goal of hopefully one day curing cancers in children, adolescents, and young adults. Representatives McCaul, Speier, Kelly, and Butterfield are introducing the companion legislation in the other body.  I first started working on this issue after meeting the Haight family from Warwick, Rhode Island in June of 2004. Nancy and Vincent lost their son, Ben, when he was just nine years old to neuroblastoma, a very aggressive tumor in the brain.  With the strong support of families like the Haights for increased research into the causes of childhood cancers and improved treatment options, I introduced bipartisan legislation that eventually was signed into law in 2008 as the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer  This was an important step. Yet, more work remains. The STAR Act seeks to advance pediatric cancer research and child-focused cancer treatments, while also improving childhood cancer surveillance and providing resources for survivors and those impacted by childhood cancer.  If a treatment is working, doctors elsewhere should know immediately. The same should happen if a treatment isn't working, or if other major medical events occur during the course of a particular treatment. It is critical that doctors, nurses, and other providers are able to effectively communicate information about the disease, the treatment process, and what other health and development impacts children can expect to experience with a particular course of treatment.  As such, the STAR Act would reauthorize the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act, creating a comprehensive children's cancer biorepository for researchers to use in searching for biospecimens to study and would improve surveillance of childhood cancer cases.  This legislation also includes provisions dealing with issues that arise for survivors of childhood cancer. Unfortunately, even after beating cancer, as many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors are likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment; as many as one-fourth experience a late effect that is serious or life-threatening, including second cancers and organ damage.  We must do more to ensure that children survive cancer and any late effects so they can live a long, healthy, and productive life. This legislation would enhance research on the late effects of childhood cancers, improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are better able to care for this population as they age, and establish a new pilot program to begin to explore improved models of care for childhood cancer survivors.  Lastly, this bill would ensure more pediatric expertise at the National Institutes of Health to better leverage the research investment to improve pediatric cancer research by requiring the inclusion of at least one pediatric oncologist on the National Cancer Advisory Board and improving childhood health reporting requirements to include pediatric cancer.  Last year, Senator Capito and I were able to get a provision of this bill included in the 21st Century CURES Act, which was signed into law at the end of the year. That provision will provide some clarity for patients and their physicians attempting to access new drugs and therapies from pharmaceutical companies. When a patient has run out of other options, the last thing they and their families need is to spend months being given the run-around trying to access a potential treatment.  I am hopeful that we can build on this momentum. Indeed, it was heartening to see the House of Representatives pass the Childhood Cancer STAR Act as one of its last acts of the 114th Congress by a unanimous vote. While, the Senate was unable to follow suit as time ran out at the end of the year, HELP Committee Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray have committed to working with Senator Capito and me to move the legislation this year.  The Childhood Cancer STAR Act has the support of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Baldrick's Foundation, and Children's Oncology Group, among others. I look forward to our continued work with these stakeholders to build support for the bill and with the HELP Committee to see this bill advance through the legislative process.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgS657.txt,1982,LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY,2017.0,2.0,January

From enlisted private, to academy graduate, to two-star general, MG Camille Nichols has demonstrated the Army values of duty, integrity, selfless service, and dedication to country. Many of my colleagues and I have had the pleasure of working with Major General Nichols on a number of issues and programs, and it is my distinct privilege to recognize her accomplishments.  MG Camille Nichols began her military career in 1975, as an enlisted soldier in the U.While serving in Germany and at the insistence of her leadership, she applied for acceptance as a cadet candidate to the U.Military Academy Preparatory School, thus enabling her to join the U.Military Academy Class, USMA, class of 1981. Upon her graduation from USMA, Major General Nichols was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Throughout her years of service, Major General Nichols attended numerous advanced military and civilian schools, receiving three masters degrees, and while working full time, earned a Ph.in engineering management from George Washington  After serving in several command and high-level staff positions, General Nichols developed expertise in contracting and acquisition procedures and systems. These demonstrated abilities were recognized by her selection as one of the general officers named to stand up the U.Army's Contracting It cannot be overstated that, in all her leadership and staff roles, Camille Nichols positively influenced the lives of thousands of military personnel while she did the Nation's bidding around the world and at home. From Korea to Saudi Arabia; from Operation Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn to commanding general of U.Army Contracting Command, Major General Nichols has been out front, pressing hard to ensure the Army is well-equipped with a 21st century fighting force capable of defeating the enemy.  As the director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Major General Nichols' undeterred leadership, soldier-scholar depth and breadth of knowledge, commitment to eliminating sexual assault, and commonsense approach to problem solving have contributed immeasurably to the improvement and execution of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program and the DOD-wide strategy. She also spearheaded specialized policies and strategies focusing on prevention efforts, combating retaliation, and addressing the needs of male victims. Major General Nichols' efforts have been instrumental in shaping and articulating program initiatives, plans,[[Page S1445]]and objectives to Congress, senior defense leaders, and the American public, earning the respect of both her superiors and peers.  I ask that you and our colleagues join me, as well as Major General Nichols' family, many friends, and peers in saluting this distinguished officer's many contributions and sacrifices in the defense of our great It is fitting that today we publicly recognize her service and wish her health, happiness, and success in the years to come.

50,topic-id,3265,"Mr.President, I know we are working through these nominations, and there is an important one before us now, but as we continue to debate it, I thought it would be a good time to talk about the overall function of the Federal Government and some of the important things it does.  Today I had occasion to meet with individuals on behalf of the ONE organization. It is a fantastic group I learned about for the first time in 2010. I was running for the U.Senate, and a group of activists in black shirts with a round white symbol on the shirt that said ``ONE''--and I didn't know what it was. I thought it was maybe a protester or someone of that nature. They were very polite, and in the end they approached me and started talking about it. They are a group of supporters of global engagement on behalf of the United States, cofounded by Bono, the front man for the band U2, which I think is familiar to most people at this point. So they are here again today, and we had an opportunity to meet with them early this morning. Many of the Members around here perhaps have seen them visit around the  That brought to mind something I want to talk about today, and that is the broader issue of U.foreign aid, the State Department, and engagement in the world. Let me back up and tell you what I think I hear--that most people hear around here as well from a lot of people. This has been going on for a long time. I don't blame people because people have real lives, businesses to run, and families to raise so they are not watching the Federal budget, line by line, on a regular basis.  There is a perception out there that the U.Government spends an extraordinary percentage of our overall[[Page S1470]]budget on foreign aid. I saw a poll recently, a legitimate poll conducted, and it asked people: How much of the Federal budget do you think goes out of the country? And the average was 26 percent. That is what people thought. Of course the truth is, it is nothing even close to that.  I want to begin by saying that today foreign aid as a part of our overall budget is less than 1 percent of the total amount the U.Government spends--less than 1 percent. The second thing people bring up is: Well, but we have so many problems in We do. We have real issues we need to confront. Why do we spend so much money on these other countries when we have so many problems here at home? That is a legitimate question. People should ask that. I think it is important for those of us who believe in global engagement and believe in the function of foreign aid to justify it, to never take it for granted, and to constantly examine it to make sure the money is being spent well and that it is worth spending at all. That is what I wanted to come to the floor to do today for a few minutes.  I know we are soon going to end a budget cycle. There will be debate, and every dollar in the budget should justify itself. I want to explain for a moment why I believe global engagement and foreign aid are so critical.  Here is the first reason. The world has always been interconnected, especially for We are not a small, obscure nation. We are the most influential, the most consequential nation on the planet. I can tell you that almost without exception, if there is a major crisis anywhere on this planet, it will eventually have a nexus to life in America in one way or another.  You think about one of the controversial issues that has been debated in Washington and being discussed politically is the Syrian refugees. I remember a couple of years ago that people would tell me: Well, it is very sad what is happening in Syria, but what does that have to do with us? Well, 2 or 3 years later, I think we all know the answer; that is, when refugees are created anywhere in the world, it is natural that a significant percentage of them want to come to the richest, freest, safest nation in the world, and that is the United States of  It also impacts our allies. We have seen it in Europe where a tremendous strain has been placed upon our allies in A significant amount of the budget in Germany, where I was recently just visiting, is being spent on dealing with the refugee crisis and the impact it is having on them. I would tell you that what happens in the world has a direct consequence to the United  Here is another fact for why it matters to This is a key fact that I was able to pull up today--or my staff was. Twelve of the fifteen top trading partners of the United States were once recipients of U.foreign assistance.  I think the best way to justify foreign assistance is to understand the history of it. Let's go back in time. Let's go to the end of the Second World Europe was in ruins. Japan was in ruins. The United States, had it behaved like most great powers in history, would have either abandoned those nations itself or the United States would have conquered them and made Japan a colony or made Germany a dependent on the United Instead, through the Marshall Plan the United States rebuilt Western Europe and in particular Through additional assistance, the United States provided aid to rebuild post-war For the Japanese, between 1946 and 1952, the United States invested $2.2 billion--or $18 billion in today's dollars--in Japan's reconstruction efforts. That amounts to more than one-third of the $65 billion in goods the United States exported to Japan just last year, in 1 year alone.  What is the result of this aid? Here is the result. Today we have a prosperous, unified Germany, which is a strong member of NATO and a strong ally of the United We have in Japan the world's third largest economy and one of the most important allies of this great country of ours in the Asia-Pacific region. This would not have been possible without U.assistance. Did it help the people of Japan and the people of Germany? Did it help the people of the United States? Without question.  Is the world a better place today because Germany is a free democratic nation involved in trade, involved in alliances with us, deploying troops around the world for NATO missions? Without a doubt. Is the world a better place because Japan is the third largest economy and a strong ally of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region? Without a doubt. That is an example of the fruit of U.engagement.  Some would say to me: Well, that was after the Second World That was a catastrophic event, but as a matter of course, what else has borne fruit? Isn't this just money we throw down a hole and never see results of? I would tell you that is not the case.  I would point to South It is hard to believe, but just a few decades ago South Korea was poorer than North South Korea had less money, less of an economy, less prosperity than North Today, South Korea is an industrialized, fully developed economy--one of the largest economies in the world. A nation that not long ago was a military dictatorship is now a vibrant, functioning democracy and a strong American ally.  Again, another example--do you want one in our own hemisphere? Look at the country of Not long ago, Colombia was basically a failed state. That country had been overrun by drug gangs, the cartels--the Medellin Cartel, the Cali The government was on the verge of collapse. Presidential candidates were being assassinated--an extraordinary source of instability in the Western Colombia still has challenges, but in helping them move forward with Plan Colombia, today trade between the United States and Colombia is at $14 billion, and as of last year, it actually was a surplus.  What is more, Colombia is now a force multiplier for our cousins. For example, if you visit Honduras, as I did during the summer, and you see the Honduran police and the Honduran special forces being trained to take on the criminal elements and cartels in that country, do you know who is there training them alongside of our people? The Colombians--the Colombian military units who have the same uniform, the same training, the same weaponry, and the same practices as the Green Berets of the United States, and they are a force multiplier. Today, Colombia is doing the things America once had to do because of the aid we provided them, and they are perhaps our strongest ally in the Western  It goes on and on from a human perspective. You think about America and America's Feed the Future It is an initiative that has trained thousands of farmers in Tanzania over the last decade. Now our country exports to them, and exports to Tanzania from the United States have increased by 500 percent.  An important point, by the way, is that there have been reductions in foreign aid over the last few decades. Today, we spend 50 percent less on foreign aid than we did as a percentage of our gross domestic product when President Reagan was in office, which was near the end of the Cold There is rationale for this, as well, for our economy and for our national security.  From an economic perspective, 95 percent of the consumers in the world--95 percent of the people on this planet who buy things--live outside of the United Seven of the ten fastest growing economies happen to be in the developing world. So if you are an American company that makes things--and I know we want to make things in America again--you have to sell them to someone. If you can only sell them to 5 percent of the world's population that happens to live in the United States of America, that is one thing, but imagine how much more you could sell, how much more money you could make, how much more value you would have for your shareholders, how many more employees and jobs you would create if you could sell to more of that 95 percent of the people around the world. You cannot sell to people and people cannot be consumers if they are starving. They cannot be consumers if they are dying of HIV/They cannot be consumers if they are dying of malaria. They cannot be consumers if they live in an unstable country.  So there is an economic rationale for our investment around the world. We[[Page S1471]]are helping people to emerge from poverty and to ultimately become members of a global consumer class that buys American goods and services. We are, in essence, planting the seeds for markets to develop that we can trade with and that we can sell to. That is one of the reasons it is so important. That is one of the reasons that today one out of five American jobs is tied to international trade and that one in three manufacturing jobs in America is tied to exports. You cannot export unless there are people on the other end of the deal to buy it from you, and we want as many people in the world as possible to be able to afford to buy things from us. In many places around the world, it begins by ensuring that they are alive and then by ensuring that they have the education they need to develop an economy so that their people can become consumers and trade partners with us.  The list goes on and on in terms of the accomplishments it has had.  Our global anti-malaria program has saved over 6 million lives, primarily those of children under the age of 5. PEPFAR, which is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, has saved more than 11 million people and has prevented 2 million babies from being born with The number of school-age children worldwide who are not going to primary school dropped to 57 million children in the year 2015. That is still too many, but the number was nearly twice that--100 million--just 7 years ago. There has been a 99-percent reduction in polio cases thanks to the efforts we have led in the vaccination program. The list goes on and on.  There is a national security component to this, and here it is: Imagine for a moment that you are a child born in Africa, that your parents had HIV, and that they survived because of American assistance. Imagine if you yourself were someone who survived HIV or malaria because of American assistance or that you got to go to school because of American help or that because of American assistance you didn't contract polio the way your relatives used to. Imagine if you were one of these young people around the world whose lives are better because of the help of the American taxpayer. This is never going to be 100 percent for sure, but I promise you it is going to be a lot harder to recruit someone to anti-Americanism and anti-American terrorism if the United States of America is the reason one is even alive today. That is the national security component, apart from allowing countries to become more stable and provide for their people and for themselves.  By the way, when we talk about the international affairs budget, it is not just foreign aid; it is everything--diplomatic relationships with the global community, security assistance with key allies--As an example, it provides them $3 billion in military assistance as they are a key ally in a strategic part of the world.  We have talked about the health clinics in the schools and the humanitarian relief efforts. I remember going to the Philippines about 3 or 4 years ago. One of the first things people mentioned to me was that after that horrible storm that killed and hurt so many people, they woke up one morning and saw a U.aircraft carrier off the horizon, and they knew things were going to be better because America was on the case. Think about the power and what that means for our Nation and the impact it has on people around the world. This is part of it.  By the way, when we travel abroad--when you are an American and you are in another country and you lose your passport or your wallet gets stolen or you have any sort of an issue--you have to work abroad, as do many people whom I know, and we get the calls in our office from people who have kids who are studying abroad and have an issue and have to go to the consulate or the Embassy--this is the budget that pays for that stuff. This is the budget that pays for that.  If you are a company that decides ``I want to do business in this new country. I want to fly to this country and find some customers and maybe come back to America and hire 20 more people so that we can build products to sell. I want to expand our reach,'' it is our U.Embassies and the agencies working within them that are helping to make those connections for American businesses. That is part of this budget.  When we talk about this, I think it is critical for us as leaders to explain to the American people just exactly what it is we are talking about. We always want to put America first. We always want to think about the American people first. That is our obligation. But I think this is part of that. If you really want to help the American people, you have to ensure that the world we live in is a more stable place.  I close by saying that this always gets back to the argument that some make: Why does it have to be us? We have been doing this for so long. We have been involved in this for so long, and we have spent so much money and so much blood and treasure around the world for the cause of freedom, democracy, humanitarianism, and the like. Why does it have to be America?  I think that gets to the fundamental question of, what kind of country do we want to be? The choice before us is that it has to be America because there is no alternative. That is the point I hope people remember and understand. There is no alternative for America in the world today. If America decides to withdraw from the world, if America decides to step back, if America declines and our influence around the world becomes less palpable, what will replace it?  There are only two things that can replace it--not the U.There are only two things that can step into whatever America leaves if it steps back. 1 is totalitarianism. For the growing movement around the world led by China and Russia and North Korea and Iran, it is the totalitarian regimes. That is the first thing that can step in and fill the vacuum. The other is nothing. The other alternative to America is nothing. It is a vacuum, and that vacuum leads to instability, and that instability will lead to violence, and that violence will lead to war. That will ultimately come back and impact us whether we want it to or not. This is the choice before us.  Without a doubt, I am the sponsor of a law that we passed last year, foreign aid accountability. I want to make sure that every dollar of American taxpayer money that is invested abroad for these purposes is spent well and is not going to line the pockets of corrupt dictators. I 100 percent agree with that. Yet this idea that somehow we can just retreat from our engagement in the world is bad for national security, it is bad for our economy, and it isn't good for policymakers who want to put the American people first. By the way, it doesn't live up to the standards of who we are as a people.  I have said this many times before, and in this I am guided by my faith. I believe that to whom much is given, much is expected. That is what the ancient words and Scripture teach us. I think that principle is true for people, and I think that principle is true for nations. I believe in the depth of my heart that our Creator has honored America's willingness to step forward and help those around the world, and I believe He will continue to do so as long as we use our blessings not just for our good but for the good of mankind.  I hope that in the weeks to come, as we debate the proper role of government and the proper way to fund it, we understand what a critical component foreign aid and the international affairs budget is to our national security, our economic interests, and our very identity as a people and as a nation.

304,topic-id,601,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Delaware for yielding.When we talk about the health care crisis in this country, it is not just health care, it is also the outrageously high cost ofprescription drugs. I know in my State of Vermont, and in fact throughout this country, millions of people today are unable toafford the medicine they need.  In fact, almost one out of five Americans who go to the doctor and get a prescription areunable to afford to buy the medicine their doctors prescribe. Frankly, that is insane because what happens if you don't take themedicine your doctor prescribed, often you are going to get sicker. Sometimes you may die. Sometimes you may end up in theemergency room. Sometimes you may end up in the hospital. It is literally beyond comprehension that almost one out of fiveAmericans today are unable to afford the medicine they need.  Meanwhile, while so many of our people cannot afford themedicine they need, the top five drug companies last year made $50 billion in profit--$50 billion in profit. The top 10 CEOs inthe pharmaceutical industry earned over $300 million.  So what we have is a scenario in which the American people pay thehighest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Millions cannot afford the medicine they desperately need, but at the sametime the drug companies make out like bandits, and their CEOs earn exorbitant compensation packages.  I happen to live 50miles away from the Canadian border. A number of years ago, I took a busload of Vermonters across the Canadian border, not justto do some sightseeing in Montreal, which is a beautiful city, but to go there to purchase the same exact medicine thatVermonters, many of whom were dealing with breast cancer, were buying but yet buying it in Montreal, Canada, for a fraction ofthe price they were paying in the United  In fact, on that particular trip, many of the women who were dealing withbreast cancer purchased the medicine they needed for one-tenth of the price they were paying in Vermont--one-tenth of the price.Let me take a moment today to review the costs of some of the exact same drugs sold in the United States compared to their costsin  Here in the United States, EpiPen, as we all know, costs more than $600 a set. That price has skyrocketed inrecent years. In Canada, the same exact set costs $290, less than half of what we pay in the United  Crestor, apopular drug to treat high cholesterol levels, is $730 here but $160 across the border. We are not talking about generics. Weare not talking about another drug. We are talking about the same exact same drug manufactured by the exact same company.  Imay be mispronouncing it, but I think it is Abilify, a drug for depression, is more than $2,600 for a 90-day supply here in theUnited States but only $436 in  I can go on and on and on. By the way, let's be clear--  Mr.President, I askunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart of drug prices around the world which will show that prices in theUnited States are not only almost always higher than in Canada but higher than in the UK, Spain, and the Netherlands as well.

305,topic-id,1131,"Mr.President, perhaps people then will ask a simplequestion: How does it happen? How does the same exact same medicine sold in the United States sell in countries around the worldfor a fraction of[[Page S238]]the price that we have to pay? The answer is severalfold. 1, we are the only major country on Earth,of course, that does not have a national health care system guaranteeing health care to all people. We are the only majorcountry on Earth not to have that.  As part of that problem, we are the only major country not to negotiate drug prices withthe pharmaceutical industry. You can walk into a drug store today, and the price could be double or three times what you paid ayear ago. There is no law to stop them. They can and they will raise prices as high as the market will allow. If people die as aresult of that, not a problem for them. If people get sick, not a problem for them.  Perhaps next to Wall Street, thepharmaceutical industry is the most powerful political force in this country. They have spent more than $3 billion on lobbyingsince 1998, and they have 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol We have 100 There are 435 Members of the Yet thedrug companies have 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol They have lobbyists all over the country in every State capital.  Theseare no small-time lobbyists. These are former leaders of the Democratic Party, leaders of the Republican Party, people who haveenormous contacts. So the drug companies are able to raise prices to any level they want because we as a nation, uniquely amongmajor nations, do not negotiate prices with them. The reason we do not negotiate prices with them is they got lobbyists and theymake very hefty campaign contributions to make sure Congress, in fact, does not pass legislation which will lower drug prices inthis country.  The pharmaceutical industry is an industry that is not only incredibly greedy, but they have a business modelwhich is largely based on fraud. Like Wall Street, their business model is largely based on fraud. Almost every major drugcompany, not widely known--but almost every major drug company in this country--multi, multibillion-dollar corporations--have beenfined for illegal activities and for cheating consumers in our country and all over the world.  Since 1991, with laxenforcement--it is not like we have a vigorous Attorney General's office that really goes after these guys. With relatively laxenforcement policies, drug companies over the years since 1991 have paid over $35 billion in fines or reached settlements forfraud and misconduct. Imagine that. This is just when they are caught, and I suspect that most of thetimes they cheat, they don't get caught--but $35 billion in fines or settlements since 1991 from the major drug companies in thiscountry.  Let me give you just a few examples of some of the settlements and fines the major drug companies have made inrecent years.  In 2013, the Justice Department ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $2.2 billion in fines because they``recklessly promote drugs for uses that have not been proven to be safe and effective.''  According to the U.attorneyhandling the case, Johnson & Johnson's ``promotion of Risperdal for unapproved uses threatened the most vulnerable populationsof our society--children, the elderly, and those with developmental disabilities.''  In 2010, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals paid$520 million to resolve allegations that it illegally marketed the antipsychotic drug Seroquel for uses not approved as safe andeffective by the Food and Drug  In 2009, Eli Lilly was fined over $1.4 billion for its off-label promotion ofanother antipsychotic product known as According to Federal investigators, Eli Lilly's ``illegal activity increasespatients' costs, threatens their safety and negatively affects the delivery of healthcare services to the more than nine millionmilitary members, retirees and their families who rely on''  Very interestingly--and I am sure many of the Memberssaw it--President-Elect Trump had a press conference this morning, and in his press conference, he said that pharma is ``gettingaway with murder.''  Mr.Trump: Pharma is ``getting away with murder.''  Do you know what? Mr.Trump is exactly right.Pharma is getting away with murder. Pharma has gotten away with murder for many decades.  The interesting issue is, with aRepublican President-elect telling the truth, that pharma is getting away with murder, will the Republicans, will all theDemocrats have the guts finally to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and their lobbyists and their campaign contributionsand fight for the American consumer and end the disgrace of having our country pay, by far, the highest prices in the world forprescription drugs?  The good news is--I say to my fellow Republicans and to Democrats--the good news is that tonight you aregoing to have that opportunity because as part of the so-called vote-arama, I will be offering a very simple amendment which Ihope wins strong bipartisan support. In fact, there have been a number of Republicans over the years--in the House and in theSenate--who have supported the concept of reimportation for many years.  What this amendment will do is allow pharmaceuticaldistributors and pharmacists and those involved in the pharmaceutical industries--those people who sell drugs--to import low-costmedicine from Canada and other countries which will be FDA-approved. In other words, all over this country people ask a verysimple question: We can eat fish and vegetables that are grown all over the world, but somehow we cannot get into this countrybrand-name prescription drugs manufactured by some of the largest drug companies in the world from an advanced country likeCanada? The reason we can't do that is for one reason and one reason alone, and that is the power of the pharmaceuticalindustry.  I would hope that tonight, both Democrats and Republicans will stand together and demand that this country be ableto import safe, low-cost medicine from Canada and from other countries.  I should also mention that I will be introducinglegislation with Representative Elijah Cummings from Maryland in the coming days on this very issue, on the issue ofreimportation and also another issue that Mr.Trump touched on, I believe, today; and that is, the need for Medicare and thegovernment, in general, to negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry. The VA does it. Clearly, Medicare should be doingit as well. I believe we are going to have an amendment on the floor tonight. I would hope people support that amendment. I willbe introducing legislation on that issue as well as reimportation.  When we talk about the health care crisis in America, oneof the issues of concern to most Americans is the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. The question is whether theCongress has the guts to take on an enormously powerful industry, the pharmaceutical industry, with all of their lobbying andall of their campaign contributions. I certainly hope we will do the right thing, and tonight we can begin that process.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Toomey). The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgS224-2.txt,1010,EXECUTIVE CALENDER--Continued,2017.0,11.0,January
321,topic-id,841,"Mr.President, tonight is an important nightbecause it allows what is very rare here in the Senate--for Members of the body to bring forth amendments and ideas that are veryimportant to them, and that, unfortunately, don't often get debated or voted upon here on the floor.  I know I speak forvirtually all Democrats in saying that we have deep concern about the Republican proposal that would repeal the Affordable CareAct without having any alternative plan in place. We think the idea of throwing some 30 million Americans off of the healthinsurance they have and significantly reducing funding for Medicaid will not only be very, very problematic for lower incomepeople but also impact middle-class people who depend upon Medicaid to help pay for the nursing home care their parents get. Weare deeply concerned about the possible privatization of Medicare, making Medicare into a voucher program. We are concernedabout the increase in prescription drug costs for seniors that would occur. If the Affordable Care Act were repealed, seniorswould have to pay far more than they are paying right now, at a time when many seniors cannot today afford the high cost ofprescription drugs. What we find is outrageous is that, in the midst of all these attacks on the middle class and workingfamilies of this country, the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act would end up providing hundreds and hundreds ofbillions of dollars in tax breaks for the top 2 percent. I believe there are very few people in America who think we shoulddevastate the health care programs that millions of Americans depend upon and at the same time give huge tax breaks to the very,very wealthy.  Tonight we are going to hear a number of Senators on the Democratic side come down to the floor and offervery, very important amendments which I hope can receive bipartisan support.  We are going to hear Senator Manchin talkabout the need to protect rural health. As a Senator from a rural State, I understand very clearly that if the Affordable CareAct is repealed, it will be devastating to rural hospitals all across this country.  Senator Nelson is going to talkabout the high cost of prescription drugs and what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean in raising prescription drugprices. Senator Baldwin will be talking about the need to make sure that, as is currently the case, young people 26 yearsof age or younger can continue to stay on their parents' health insurance. Senator Tester is going to be offering anamendment which will oppose limiting veterans' ability to choose.  I will be offering an amendment making certain the peoplein our country do not have to pay more for medicine than the people in Canada and in other countries. Senator Casey isconcerned about protecting individuals with disabilities and chronic conditions. Senator King is concerned about protectinghealth insurance for people, many of whom are working in very dangerous occupations.  Senator Menendez is concernedabout protecting Medicaid expansion. Millions of Americans have received health care, in some cases for the first time in theirlives because we were able to expand  Senator Gillibrand is concerned about protecting women's health. TheAffordable Care Act has gone a long way in terms of equity for women, in terms of the health care they receive, and I hopenobody wants to see that disappear.[[Page S249]]  Senator Manchin will address a very important issue about the opiate epidemicthat exists in West Virginia and all across this country.  Senator Stabenow will be speaking about the need to protectmental health services. We have a major crisis in mental health care in this country. We need to do a lot more than we arecurrently doing, and we certainly do not need to do less.  Senators Cantwell and Carper will be talking about theneed to protect delivery system reform. Senator Brown will be talking about the need to protect the Children's HealthInsurance Senator Coons will be talking about the need to make sure there are no limits on the health insurancepeople with serious illnesses receive.  So there are a lot of very, very important amendments that will be offered, and Ilook forward to an interesting evening of discussion.  I would just conclude my remarks to say that I find it beyondcomprehension that at a time when we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people--weare the only one--that at a time when we pay significantly more per capita for health care than do the people of any othernation, that at a time when we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs--what we need is to have ahealth care system that protects the needs of the middle class and working families of our country, not just the insurancecompanies and not just the drug companies. In fact, the votes tonight are really about whether we are prepared to stand up forordinary Americans or whether we are going to continue to kowtow to the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry.

245,topic-id,1776,"Mr.President, I rise in support of S.26, a resolution to disapprove the Obama administration Department of Education's regulation on teacher preparation issues. This resolution is simple. It overturns the last administration's overreach into scores of States and territories, into thousands of college and university teacher preparation programs, and into millions of American classrooms.  Last night, I drafted a fairly detailed statement on some of the problems deep inside this regulation, but I have decided to skip past most of that. Why? Because the problem with this regulation is actually much more basic than all of the substantive problems in the regulation. This regulation actually makes the assumption that bureaucrats in Washington, DC, are competent to micromanage teacher training programs in That is what this regulation ultimately does, and that is absurd.[[Page S1626]]  So I would like to ask three questions of folks who plan to vote to defend this regulation. First, do you really think that bureaucrats in this city know better how to run teacher training programs than people who have spent most of their lives inside actual classrooms with actual future teachers and with students? How many of you have ever run a teacher training program? Has anyone in this body ever run a teacher training program? Because I have--almost. I have spent a lot of my life around these programs. As a kid, with my dad, who was a lifelong public schoolteacher and coach, and I have been in many of these classrooms with him when he was getting master's and continuing education programs; then with my wife who is also a public high school teacher; and then I was a college president at a university that had multiple teacher training programs. I know Keith Rohwer, and I know the other deans of education that have been at Midland University and at many other colleges and universities across Yet, even though I have been around a lot of these programs in some detail, I wouldn't possibly think I am ready to decree all the details inside those programs from thousands and thousands of miles away.  Question 2, has anyone actually read this regulation that folks are going to say they want to defend on this floor? Because I have been reading in it. I will not claim I have read it, but I have read in it. This is the 695 pages of the regulation itself. There is actually a lot of guidance material as well, but I didn't bring that because I didn't want to have both of my hands occupied. This is the 695 pages of the regulation we are talking about today, and it is actually really silly. If you read inside it, it is filled with enough specificity that if you tried to explain it to thoughtful, generally educated Americans, I submit to you that you would blush. There is a level of detail and a level of specificity in this that we are not possibly competent to defend at the micro level.  Question 3, can the folks who think this is what Washington, DC, ought to be doing right now--please show me somewhere in this document, the Senate version of the Constitution--show me somewhere in this document where we are given the specific authority to micromanage local programs like this from here. Because, honestly--I mean this sincerely to my colleagues who plan to vote to defend this rule--I don't see how you can defend this document and think that this is conceivably our job from here. We are not competent to do this.  Now, a couple of qualifications are in order. Am I suggesting that all teacher training programs in America work well? Heavens, no. There are some that are fairly strong, and there are actually a lot that are really, really poor and weak, but having a good intention to make them better is not the same as actually having accomplished something that will make them better. Good intentions are not enough. For us in this body to act because we have compulsory governmental powers, we would need not merely good intentions, we would also need competence and authority. We have neither of those about teacher training programs.  Everyone in this body agrees that education is darn near the center of the future of our country. We all want and we need good teachers. Most of us can remember specific teachers who stood out because of her or his creative presentation, because of their unexpected humor, because of their charm and their compassion, because of their tireless drive, because of their inspired mentorship. None of us in this Chamber who has the privilege of serving our fellow country men and women regret or are unaware of the fact that the skills and the guidance and the abilities that we have are the function of the mentorship and the pedagogy of life-changing teachers early in our lives. We have benefited from and we need good, prepared teachers.  If we all agree teachers are critically important to our future, and since we all agree teacher training programs are important and we also agree that some of them aren't very good, the question would be, What would we do about that? What kind of debate should we have about why much education in America isn't good enough? Does anyone in this body sincerely believe that the big, pressing problem in American education is that there aren't enough rules like this coming out of bureaucracies in Washington, DC?  Because if you believe that, I would humbly suggest that you should go and meet with some of the ed school faculties back in your State and ask them if you can read them these 695 pages so you can tell them that we have the answers. Read it to them, and then please come back and tell us in this body that they agree with you, that what we really need is more 700-page regulations from Washington, DC, micromanaging things as specific and local as teacher preparation programs.  Oh, and one more thing, which is actually kind of big. This regulation explicitly violates the plain language and the congressional intent of the Federal education law that was passed in this body last year. You will all recall that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in this Chamber with overwhelming bipartisan support last year. I think it got 83 votes. The act prohibits the Secretary of Education from prescribing ``any aspect or parameter of a teacher, a principal, or other school leader evaluation system within a State or local education agency'' or ``indicators or specific measures of teacher, principal, or other school leader effectiveness or quality.'' There is nothing ambiguous about this language.  In addition, the Higher Education Act is clear that the levels of performance used by a State to assess teacher training programs ``shall be determined solely by the State.''  This rule overrides State authority over literally tens of thousands of discipline-specific teacher preparation programs across the Nation, burdening States with a federally defined and expensive mandate. Under this regulation, States would be required to create elaborate new data systems that would link K-12 teacher data to data on evaluations of teachers and administrators in particular schools and then on to the data back into the teacher preparation programs. This regulation's goal would be to measure the success of teacher preparation based largely on teachers' students' subsequent test scores, and it would all need to be backlinked in the data. This is data that is not currently gathered.  Rube Goldberg is smiling somewhere because this sounds like a bureaucrat's dream, a paperwork trail monitoring all the strengths and weaknesses of some vast machine spitting out layers and layers of new data over which Washington's experts could then postulate and tinker. Again, I have no doubt the bureaucrats who wrote these 700 eye-glazing pages--pages about rules, about data to be gathered that States are not currently gathering--I have no doubt the people who wrote this mean well. I also have no doubt the people who are going to defend this rule as somehow commonsensical--then why is it 700 pages--also mean well, but those good intentions don't change the fact that what they have actually done in this rule--what they have actually done--is build a much larger requirement set of paper trails, demanding further burdens on our teachers, on our principals, and on the professors who are teaching teachers, and then require all of them to report back through new or expanded bureaucracies at the State level, though the States have not chosen to gather this data, and then pass this data on to a bureaucracy a couple of blocks from here.  These Rubik's Cubes of rules and data collection are not being done today, and supposedly we are going to make teacher preparation programs better by all of the specificity that comes from this rule.  The fact that these regulations will likely cost States millions of dollars to implement simply adds insult to injury. Let's be honest. Education is not some vast complex machine that just needs a little bit more tinkering from Washington-level intervention before it will be at utopia. It isn't true, and this rule is not an effective way to actually help the teachers who care so much that they are investing their lives in our kids.  Nebraska's parents and educators and locally elected school boards are better equipped and better positioned to tackle the most important educational challenges. They are better equipped and they are better intentioned, even than the smartest, the[[Page S1627]]nicest, and the most well-meaning experts in Washington, If you disagree, again, I humbly challenge you to go and try and read this rule to elementary and secondary school teachers in your State and to those who are running the programs that train them. Read the 695 pages to them and then report back to us that they actually share your view that the really big problem in American education is not enough 700-page rules from educational bureaucrats from  Good intentions are not enough. Federal intervention and reforms should never make problems worse, and that is what this rule would do.  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and to rededicate ourselves to the duties that really and fundamentally are ours, to the duties the Federal Government is exclusively and monopolistically empowered to carry out because it isn't this. We are not competent to displace the expertise of the district and the State level, and we should not be trying to regulate teacher training programs from Washington, We are not competent to do this.  Thank you for your consideration.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgS1625-4.txt,2289,INTRODUCING REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN,2017.0,7.0,January

45,topic-id,678,"Mr.President, 20 is the number of bomb threats that were called into Jewish institutions in our communities across the country yesterday--in just 1 day. In Alabama, Delaware, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia, and in my home State of Hawaii, in my Temple Emanu-El, where I grew up and was bar mitzvahed. No one wants to be the parent who picks up the phone and finds out that they need to pick up their child from school because people are threatening violence--and all because of their faith.  Since 2017 began, 100 bomb threats have been called into Jewish schools and Jewish community centers. It sounds like it is from another time, but this is what rising anti-Semitism looks like in our country. Granted, we knew weird stuff was happening: Pepe, David Dukes--this is not normal But now the threat of violence is real. It is coming through the phone lines of American schools every day, and it is loud and clear. This rising threat demands leadership. It demands that we regularly and quickly denounce anti-Semitism and do everything we can do to stop it from growing. But that is not what we have seen so far from this administration.  Now, the baseline expectation of an unequivocal, quick and regular disavowal of rising anti-Semitic or anti-Muslim rhetoric from the leader of the free world is no longer being met. Instead, we have to extract it from the administration. We have to ask for it when it doesn't come. We have to ask when it is coming. What is even sadder is that this administration has avoided any opportunity--even the easy ones, even the most obvious ones--to stand against anti- Just over a month ago, the world marked International Holocaust Remembrance The White House put out a statement without a single mention of the 6 million Jews who were killed in the Here is the crazy thing: The first draft mentioned The State Department drafted the initial statement which mentioned Jews, like every Holocaust Remembrance Day statement before it did. Then it went to the White House where someone thought: Let's make edits. Let's remove mention of Jews from a statement about International Holocaust Remembrance This was someone's decision. It was an intentional decision. Who would decide that, and why would that be done?  Why remove the mention of Jews? It is like mentioning slavery and not mentioning African It is like mentioning internment and not mentioning Japanese When you are talking about genocide, it is not irrelevant to talk about who did it and to whom. It is a requirement. But the White House didn't mention Jews, and it didn't apologize when people were rightfully confused. Only now that violence has been unleashed, that Jewish cemeteries are being desecrated, that people's children are being threatened on a daily basis are we seeing the minimum from the White House to recognize the rise of anti-Semitic sentiments and actions.  I am worried.  Local communities have taken it upon themselves to lead the way and stand up together. This is what leadership looks like. It looks like Muslim Americans showing up to cemeteries to help to restore Jewish headstones. It looks like local police raising money and people taking time to hold a vigil in solidarity with their Jewish neighbors. There have been far too many bystanders to the increasing anti-Semitism across the country. It is long past time to break the silence and to make it utterly clear that the United States is not a place for hate. It is un-American to hate Jews or Muslims or strangers in our midst. That is not who we are or what we stand for. That is not the United States of  This week, as Jewish communities are reviewing bomb threat guidance and looking at best practices for security, it is up to all of us to take action and to do everything we can to beat back rising anti- I yield the floor.

73,topic-id,484,"Mr.President, distance or delays should never be the reason that veterans don't get the healthcare they need, but that is exactly what is happening to veterans across the country. That is why the Veterans Choice[[Page S2140]]Program was started--so that thousands of veterans and their families can get the care they deserve when and where they need it. Instead of traveling long distances or waiting months on a list, veterans can use the Choice Program to get the healthcare they need in their own communities.  As the ranking member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, I want to give a little perspective on what would happen to our veterans if we don't pass the bipartisan Veterans Choice Program Improvement  Now, I know that the Choice Program is not funded through my subcommittee, but what we do today has an impact on the VA as a whole. If the Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act does not pass, the funding we appropriated to the VA will expire before it has all been used. It is not a small amount of funding. It is $1 billion, and the VA does not have $1 billion elsewhere in the budget to make up for this loss.  In other words, if we don't pass this bill, it is going to be a disaster for veterans because all of the veterans who use this program for their healthcare are going to have to go back to the That means the wait times that everybody was complaining about over the last couple of years will grow longer and longer and longer, and especially in rural America, where access to care is such a challenge, it will get worse and worse.  To manage the increase in patient load, the VA will have to scramble to find funding that can take away from other VA programs, including hospital maintenance and medical equipment. That is what is going to happen if we don't pass this bill. This is an urgent matter for veterans across the country. Whether you are a participant in the VA Choice Program or you go to a traditional VA clinic or hospital, one way or another, this is going to impact you.  Now, I know the Choice Program isn't perfect, but this temporary extension, coupled with the improvements in the system contained in the bill, gives Congress the time we need to develop a long-term, comprehensive solution. And while we are working on a solution, let's not punish veterans by cutting off $1 billion toward a program that is designed to improve services for people who have served our country.

56,topic-id,962,"Mr.Speaker, 100 years ago next month, on April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson stood in this Chamber and asked Congress to declare war on While the proximate cause for America's entry into World War I was Germany's campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare, Wilson and his supporters were also motivated by the belief that they, and the force of American arms, could deliver Europe from its intractable squabbles and, in so doing, make the world safe for democracy.  It was not until the following spring that the American doughboys were committed to the Western Front in large numbers, but they provided not only the additional combat power needed to break the exhausted Germans within months, but also imbued a sense of moral purpose into what had been nearly 4 years of futile slaughter.  A generation later, millions of American GIs returned to help free Europe from Adolf Hitler, while millions more pushed Japan back from its imperial conquests in This time we stayed--the living to keep the peace and prevent one form of tyranny being replaced by another and the dead as silent witnesses to the cost of liberation.  The United States worked to create the United Nations and a host of other international organizations designed to bind together humanity and avoid another catastrophic world war. We extended aid and friendship to our former enemies through the Marshall Plan and rebuilt Western Europe into an alliance of democracies, a shining contrast to the Soviet Union's eastern satellites.  America's commitment to peace was matched by an equally resolute willingness to defend freedom. When the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin in 1948, in an attempt to force the Western allies out of their half of the city, American pilots flew missions around the clock for 11 months to keep the city supplied until the Soviets relented.  Walls, barbed wire, and stifling oppression characterized the Soviet bloc and Communist Against this, the United States marshaled its greatest weapons--individual liberty, democratic governance, and a market economy to discredit and defeat communism.  When the Cold War ended four decades after it had begun, it was the fall of the Berlin Wall that symbolized the triumph of freedom and seemingly heralded a new era of peace and prosperity.  Nearly three decades have passed since communism's collapse and the global harmony that many hoped for has been replaced by an international order more challenging to American leadership and American ideals than any we have seen in my lifetime.                              {time}  1030  Intolerance, ultra-nationalism, and crude populism are rising across the developed world and threaten to undo the work of decades. After a century of American leadership of the international community, there was a sense among many here at home and around the world that we have lost our will to lead, that we will no longer honor President Kennedy's commitment to ``pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.''  The world sees President Trump's executive orders on immigration and asks: Where is the America that welcomed millions to its shores?  Well, I am happy to say that America is alive and well in communities across this great Nation, where people from every continent live together, eat each other's food, celebrate each other's holidays, and it also lives on in the hundreds of State Department officials who signed a Dissent Channel memorandum opposing that policy.  The world sees President Trump's threats to withdraw from Europe and Asia unless our allies ``pay up,'' and asks whether America will still defend its friends. That America, the one that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with NATO and South Korea, can be found in our troops stationed in the Baltics, Poland, and along the DMZ; and it can be found here in Congress, where there is broad support for our alliances and our allies.  The world sees President Trump threatening to drastically cut our foreign assistance budget, the literal difference between life and death for millions of the world's most vulnerable people, and asks: Where is America's legendary generosity?  That America, Mr.Speaker, is alive and well, too. Our USAID professionals, our Peace Corps volunteers, and the thousands of individual Americans working as medical missionaries or with NGOs are still making a difference around the globe every day.  The world sees President Trump's embrace of Vladimir Putin and his seeming disdain for key allies like Germany and Australia and wonders whether we will remain committed to democracy and the rule of law, or we will abandon principle in favor of expedience and flattery.  That America--the America that stood with Solidarity in Poland, with Nelson Mandela in South Africa, and with Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma--is still here, too. Millions of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, the old and young, still stand with those who seek freedom, and we will never allow this President to abandon our ideals.  And finally, Mr.Speaker, the world has seen the rise of Donald Trump and wonders whether Americans will still fight for their own democracy--are we still worthy heirs to Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt? The answer to that is on display every day across this country. From the millions who clogged our nation's streets on January 21st, to the calls pouring into Congress every day to demand a full investigation of the Russia scandal, the American people are engaged and ready to fight for our democracy here at home and for freedom around the world.  To those who doubt us, or wonder whether we remain true to our ideals, whether we will stand up for what we believe, and defend not only America but the beautiful idea it represents, let me borrow a phrase from John Paul Jones, the Revolutionary War hero. ``We have not yet begun to fight.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1398.txt,1635,NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE,2017.0,1.0,February

A program to stop jobs from moving overseas--not just tweeting about a few hundred jobs at Carrier plants staying in the United States--is nowhere to be found.  President Trump ran as a populist and still talks like one, but his first month has been a boon for corporations, the wealthy, and the elite in America and has provided absolutely no relief to folks who are struggling to make ends meet--no relief to the middle class and those struggling to get there. In fact, many of his proposals shift the burden off the backs of the special interests and keep it on the backs of working families. He likely isn't finished yet.  Tonight, the President might discuss his tax plan. He said that every decision on taxes would be made to ``benefit American workers and American families.'' It is another grandiose promise. But every indication we have gotten about the administration's plan is that it would give tax breaks to the wealthy and shift the burden onto the middle class and working class.  So no matter what the President says tonight, we will have to look at the details of his proposal and see who it really helps, and every American should, as well.  Tonight, if past is prologue, the President will use populist rhetoric in his speech, but he won't back it up with real actions. He will use populist rhetoric in his speech to hide what he is actually doing, which is helping the special interests and making it harder to stay in the middle class. He talks like he favors working people, but his actions ultimately desert them.  He will present himself as a President for the forgotten man, but he will forget him the moment it comes to governing. So while I hope the President offers a message of inclusivity and talks about some issues where Democrats and Republicans can perhaps find common ground, his speech tonight will mean nothing the very instant after it is delivered unless he backs up his words with real actions.  His speech tonight will be nothing if his Cabinet of billionaires and bankers, his main advisers who seem to favor the wealthy, and an agenda far away from what America wants, continue to govern from the hard right, which is very far from the American mainstream and even the Republican mainstream. His speech tonight will mean nothing if he continues to do as he has done these first few months since being elected--breaking promises to working people and putting an even greater burden on their backs while making it easier to be wealthy and well-connected in  I yield the floor.

320,topic-id,995,"Mr.President, I wish to speak briefly and pointedly about the budget resolution before us which will,at some late hour, culminate in a final vote. Whether that vote is tonight or in the dark hours of early morning, with it,Republicans are taking their first step into a box canyon.  Now, I hear my Republican colleagues talking more and more aboutdoing repeal and replace together, but let me be very clear. This budget resolution is not repeal and replace. It is one thingand one thing only: the first step of repealing the Affordable Care Act, ripping health care away from tens of millions ofAmericans, and throwing our health care system into chaos. It will, as many have repeated across the land over the last fewweeks, make America sick again.  Over the past few weeks, this fact has made some of my more thoughtful colleagues nervous. Iunderstand that. I would be nervous if I were them too. My friends, the Senators from Maine, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky,have all quite forcefully voiced their concern with repealing health care reform without a scrap of a plan of what to do next.  Now the President-elect has tweeted that they should do repeal and replace at the same time. Today he said Republicans wouldrepeal and replace the law essentially simultaneously, but that is not what this budget resolution would do.  We are herebecause the Republicans are flummoxed. It is a bit like an[[Page S248]]Abbot and Costello show. Republicans in Congress and thePresident-elect are pointing at each other, waiting for the other one to come up with the plan--``You do it. No, you doit''--because no one can come up with a repeal plan that keeps the benefits of  This confusion of the Republicans makessense because the Republicans are in a pickle and driving into that box canyon. They promised every conservative group andaudience in the country for the past 8 years that they would repeal health care reform ``root and branch,'' but actually it isonly their base that wants repeal. Most Americans want us to keep the law and work to improve it.  In a recentPolitico/Morning Consult poll, only 28 percent of Americans support repealing the law if there is no current plan for replacingit--less than one-third. This is the Republican base.  Two-thirds of Americans support the provisions that prevent insurancecompanies from denying coverage to patients with preexisting conditions, 63 percent support letting kids stay on their parents'plan until they are 26, and there are similar numbers on the other major benefits of health care reform. Those are the keyfeatures. Those aren't extraneous. Those are the heart and soul of the Affordable Care The Republicans are in a pickle.They cannot please their base and the broader public at the same time so President-Elect Trump says to Congress: You come upwith replace.  The Congress says to the President: You come up with replace.  Abbot and  No replace. Wehaven't seen one yet, and it has been 6 years.  From a policy perspective, our Republican friends can't repeal a law and keepin place the provisions that are overwhelmingly popular with the majority of That is why they are in such a pickle.  The Affordable Care Act is not despised by the American people, only the hard right of the Republican base, which isfervently anti-government. It is an ideology. It doesn't matter how much ACA helps people. If the government did it, we don'twant it. They oppose health care because they oppose everything that government does. They oppose Medicare, Medicaid, evenSocial  If Republicans go forward with this plan, they may mollify their base--the base will stop complaining--butthey will ostracize and hurt the American people and ultimately lose in the court of public opinion.  There is a much moreresponsible course of action that I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to consider: abandon repeal.  We Democratsare willing to work with our Republican colleagues on improving the existing law. We will even look at a comprehensivereplacement plan if they can come up with it. We don't care about credit. You can call it McConnellCare or RepubliCare orRyanCare or It doesn't matter so long as it covers as many people as the ACA, so long as it helps bring health carecosts down, and so long as it doesn't move our health care system backward.  We haven't seen one so far. I am skeptical thatwe ever will, but we will look at one if they can come up with it. Unfortunately, that is not the road we are on. The votetonight is the first step on the road to repeal, which leads straight into that box canyon.  I just want to sincerely urge myRepublican colleagues, especially those who have rightly expressed concern about the very serious consequences of repealingwithout replacement: Vote against this resolution. Put this irresponsible and rushed repeal plan aside. Work with us Democratson a way to improve health care in America, not set it back 8 years. Don't make America sick again. Don't put chaos in place ofaffordable care, which is what you will do if you follow through on this resolution.  The consequences of throwing our systeminto chaos, which the Republican plan will do, are enormous: denying 30 million Americans health coverage, blowing a $1 trillionhole in our deficit, depriving the college graduate from staying on their parent's plan, preventing women from getting fairtreatment, and telling the family whose daughter has a preexisting condition that they can't get coverage, and they will have towatch her get sicker.  That--all of that--falls entirely on the shoulders of my Republican colleagues. I think that is ascenario we all would like to avoid.

315,topic-id,521,"Madam President, I think it isimportant for us to realize and note that while Senator Graham did in fact grow up just a few miles from Clemson--whichmeans his affinity for the university is natural--it is consistent with his upbringing. For me, it is verydifferent. When you are born in South Carolina, and you are born on the coast near the Atlantic Ocean, the likelihood of yourbeing a Gamecocks fan and wearing garnet and black is about 75 percent. So I must concede that I still pull for the Gamecocks.That is a controversial position to be in when you are talking about the new national champions.  I would also like to say toSenator Shelby--a man of integrity, character, and long service--thank you for making the bet. I am so glad you lost.  Iwould also say to the Clemson Tigers--the ``Tigers Nation''--we are so incredibly proud of what you have accomplished. It isamazing, not only the successful season that you have had on the field but the character that has been the focus of so much ofthe conversation off the field.  We have talked specifically about 4, Deshaun Watson, and the amazing story about hisrelationship with his mother. I have a special relationship with my mom. So I appreciate his focus and determination to honorher when he is on the field and to continue to honor her when he is off the field. That story is a remarkable story thatdeserves more attention. It really does.  As to Coach Dabo Swinney, is an amazing coach, without any question, but he is alsoan Alabama alum. Having won the national championship as a part of the Alabama football team--I believe it was 1992--you have achampion come into Clemson University and making champions by loving compassionately, by challenging on the field, and byembracing these men and the entire apparatus around the university and college athletics. He has done a fabulous job.  Ithink of the walk-on receiver that Senator Graham mentioned. In every facet of the team--whether you are the so-called waterboy, whether you are the athletic trainer, whether you are a physical therapist--people win because of the team that they are on.There are no self-made success stories.  We should remember that as we focus on these young athletes. I know their lives willbe meaningful because of the team they played on and not simply the victories they celebrated.  I do want to take a fewseconds and mention the president, Jim Clements, who is a fantastic guy and one of my dearest friends. Jim and I were having aconversation through text before the game, and I decided, since we can't use our phones on the floor of Senate--I know they frownon that kind of stuff, technology; it is an interesting concept here--I decided to print the text.

Those accolades would be deserved if his actions bore any resemblance to his words. But, instead, we were subjected to a barrage of third grade sound bites, falsehoods, and half-truths, just like always.  The President condemned the vandalism at the Jewish cemeteries. Yet, earlier the same day, he suggested that these anti-Semitic acts were a ``false flag'' operation possibly committed by Jews themselves; which is very similar, by the way, to what White supremacist talking points circulated by David Duke are all about.

The President says he wants to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure, but congressional Republicans have already implied they won't give him the money.  The President said he supports the rule of law, but he is violating the Constitution's Emoluments Clause every single day.  And worst of all, the President says he supports the troops. Then he blames the military for his own botched raid. This disgraceful abandonment of responsibility makes a mockery of the grief of Chief Petty Officer Owens' widow, who wept in front of all the American people watching the speech on TV last night.  His comments earlier in the day blaming the military are really indescribable. I agree that we must never forget Ryan Owens' sacrifice, and that is why we must understand the circumstances that led to his death and follow through with his parents' request for an independent investigation.

For the last 6 years, I have listened to folks stand on this floor and talk about repealing health care, repealinghealth care, repealing health care.

And if we repealthis bill without a plan that increases accessibility and affordability across this Nation in urban and rural and frontierareas, we will have big, big problems.  I have been visiting for the last--well, it has been over a year but, morespecifically, since the election, with folks across rural America on the impacts of repealing this health care bill. These arefolks who work to feed our country, farmers and ranchers. These are folks who work with their hands to manufacture products thathave that ``Made in the USA'' stamp on it. These are folks who teach our children, who help keep our families safe, who operateretail businesses on Main These folks, in my opinion, are the backbone of this country.

These are towns where often thehospital is the largest employer and it is the only source of health care, that foundation that keeps families healthy.  I amhere to talk to you about how this Affordable Care Act has been so important to those families in rural areas in States likemine. By the way, all of Montana is rural.  Today, more Montanans have health insurance than ever before. That is undeniable.Folks are no longer denied coverage by insurance companies because they have preexisting conditions like diabetes nor are theyforced to pay higher premiums because they have common ailments like high blood pressure. Children are able to stay on theirparents' insurance policies for a time until they finish their college career or launch lives of their own. Folks who have life-threatening diseases like cancer can now finish the treatments without hitting an arbitrary cap and being kicked off theirinsurance plan. Now they are required to be able to stay on it. And seniors can get out of the prescription drug doughnut holefaster, which was costing them millions of dollars each and every year. In fact, since the ACA was signed into law, Montanaseniors alone have saved $56 million in prescription drug costs and there is enough money in the bank, as I said in my opening,to keep Medicare above water through 2028.  These reforms have made incredible impacts on people in rural But don'tjust take my word for it; listen to everyday I have been traveling across that State, hearing their stories, hearingtheir struggles, hearing their successes.

He picked up the phone, called his doctor--a doctor who he had, thanks to the insurance he received under the Luckily, he survived his heart attack, was able to get the treatment he needed, and was able to come to my roundtablethat I had in He told me: I know myself, if I did not have insurance, and I could not afford to get it without theACA, I would not have called the doctor, and I would have died. As pointedly as that, he would have died.  I have traveledaround I have found that this story is not unique. I can take you to a coffee shop in Havre--population 8 to10,000--where seniors have told me that they no longer have to choose between prescription drugs and heating their homes.  Ican take you to the grocery store in Great Falls, where a man came up to me and said: ``I finally have peace of mind that Iwon't lose my home if I get sick.''  Or I can introduce you to my best friend growing up in Big Sandy, who now lives inSeattle, who no longer can be denied coverage due to the fact that he has diabetes, a preexisting condition.  These are realsuccess stories and real-life impacts across Montana and across this country. But rather than build on the successes of the ACAand fix the problems with the ACA, there are folks in this body who want a full-scale repeal, ignoring any of the progress thatwe have made.  They want to go back to the old health care system. And here is what that would look like in Montana: 152,000Montanans with preexisting conditions will be at risk of losing their health care plans; 61,000 Montanans enrolled inMedicaid--just in the last year because that is when the Medicaid expansion actually went into effect--will lose their health carecoverage. Montana seniors will lose help paying for their prescription drugs. Insurers will be allowed to subject every Montananto lifetime and annual caps on their coverage. And women will lose important protections that prevent them from being chargedmore for coverage than men.  It doesn't stop there, folks. Their plan to repeal health care coverage without presenting areplacement doesn't just impact families. It will wreak damage on our rural hospitals and clinics too.  I will tell you thatif we lose these hospitals and clinics--and we all know how rural America is drying up--it is another nail in the coffin of ruralFolks will not be able to live there if they are over the age of 50 because they will have no access to health care.  The Affordable Care Act has provided rural hospitals and clinics a level of certainty that, quite frankly, they have neverhad before. Every day in rural communities, folks rely on their local hospitals and clinics for everything from basic checkupsto emergency treatments. I know. And as folks age, they have the peace of mind to know that they can visit their hometownprovider without being forced to travel long distances.  But if folks in Congress take us backto the old health care system, they put these local hospitals and clinics at extreme risk.  Take Mineral County in Superior,The county is home to just over 4,000 people--not a lot by national standards but a lot by Montana standards--nurses,schoolteachers, construction workers, all folks who want reliable access to affordable care. According to the Mineral CountyHospital CEO, a repeal of the ACA would mean a real loss to that community. The hospital would be probably shutting its doors.  Without a hospital in that community, folks would be forced to travel over 100 miles to deliver their baby or take anexpensive air ambulance ride, which is a whole other problem, for emergencies that come down the pike, like a broken arm. And ifI am a new parent or senior, I will not be taking that risk. I am going to be moving closer to a hospital. But there are a lotof folks who can't afford to leave their homes--in some cases, homesteads, where their families have lived for generations--tomove somewhere closer to medical care.  I can tell you that in my small community, there are a lot of folks, who, when theyhit age 65, have to move to a bigger town to be able to have access to the kind of specialty care they need. You can move thatage down to age 50 if we lose these hospitals in these rural areas. These rural hospitals not only keep patients alive; theykeep communities alive too. A repeal of the ACA--I am told by the hospitals--would kill those rural hospitals which, as I saidbefore, would be another nail in the coffin of rural  Let's take, for example, the Billings Clinic, which isMontana's largest health care provider. They are responsible for innovating and providing critical resources to rural areasthrough things like telemedicine. But the Billings Clinic will not be able to make this large-scale impact anymore if theirpatients are no longer able to pay their medical bills because they lost their access to Medicaid, cost-free preventive care, orinsurance from the marketplace. Repealing the ACA will restrict their ability to provide quality care and jeopardize theirstanding as a pillar in  It is not just hospitals either. It is community health centers serving over[[Page S228]]100,000Montanans every year, fully one-tenth of our population. They are at risk of losing 70 percent of their Federal funding.  Letme repeat: If health care progress is repealed, the community health centers in Montana will be at risk of losing 70 percent oftheir Federal funding. These devastating impacts are not unique to Montana, but this is how it is going to play out across thiscountry in rural areas with hospitals and clinics--more uncompensated care, more trips to the emergency room without insurance,more hospitals facing the grim reality of having to close their doors.  Oftentimes I wonder if it really matters to Congress.It looks as if they intend to go through with their plan, which will have devastating impacts on the patients, and, by the way,it will have devastating impacts on their taxpayers.  Repealing this health care coverage without a replacement will add anadditional $350 billion--$350 billion--to the deficit and the debt over the next 10 years, and this budget resolution will saddlethe next generation with an additional $9 trillion in debt over the next decade.  You know, it is amazing. When I came tothis body, there were folks talking about the debt all the time. In the last 2 years, I have heard little talk about the debt.With the exception of Rand Paul, everyone who was supposedly a deficit hawk voted to increase our deficit and debt by $9trillion over the next decade. This would push our total national debt to nearly $30 trillion by year 2026. I stand with RandPaul on this one. Hamstringing the next generation with additional debt is unacceptable, especially when you are taking awaytheir health care coverage to boot.  As folks try to jam this bill through Congress, I have barely heard a peep about thisincrease to the deficit. Oh, my, how times have changed.  The folks who are normally card-carrying Members of fiscalrestraint are now swiping the credit card of the next generation. I dare those Members to go back home and tell their neighborsthat you are going to take away their health coverage, and, oh, by the way, you are going to add about $9 trillion to the debttoo. Try to do that with a straight face.  I will be the first to tell you that the ACA isn't perfect. I have heard that alsoin my travels across Costs have gone up. Premiums are rising. Many hard-working middle-class families cannot affordhealth care. That is unacceptable. So we ought to do something about that.  Let's tackle rising premiums. Let's hold healthinsurance and drug companies accountable. Let's put patients before profits. But I am telling you, repealing all the progress wehave made will not do that. We need to build on the successes we have had in the last few years, not tear them down.  Membersof this body, quite frankly, this is not just a debate about health care. It is a debate about our economy, our growing deficit,the foundation of our rural communities.  The folks in this Congress who are pushing to repeal without a replacement willkick families off their health insurance, close down rural hospitals and clinics, and add $9 trillion to the debt if theysucceed.  Rather than go down this dangerous path, I have a suggestion. Let's roll up our sleeves and work in a bipartisanmanner to increase access and affordability, to lower the cost of care, to bring down prescription drug prices. I will tell you,I am willing to work with anyone: Republican, Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, whoever wants to have a serious conversationabout improving our Nation's health care system. But I am not going to allow folks inthis body to take us back to the old days, the days when our friends and families couldn't afford to get sick.

He is Christopher He has been mychief of staff for 6 years. After 6 years of extraordinary service, he has decided that he is going to move on to the privatesector. I want to say a few words about Christopher's background and his contribution to my office, to our country, and thepeople of  Christopher is actually from New He is a native of Rye After growing up in NewHampshire, he earned his degree in biology at Brown University and then went on to get a law degree from I can assureeveryone he has recovered from his educational experience to a very extensive degree.  He went into law and practiced at thelaw firm of Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles and He had a very successful time there, but he decided he wanted tocome to Washington and work in government and, specifically, work on the He went to work for Judd Gregg, Senator Greggfrom New Hampshire, and Christopher Gahan, I understand, had almost every job that a Senate office has. He started at the verybeginning, but because of his enormous talents and his ability and hard work, he relatively quickly rose and became chief ofstaff for Senator  When I was elected to the Senate in 2010, I got a call within a matter of weeksfrom Christopher, and he said he wanted to come and meet with me and discuss the fact that I needed a chief of staff. He droveup to We had lunch, and I decided almost immediately that this guy would probably do a great job. He clearly had theattributes that I was looking for.  I should also point out some of the things that are perhaps not as widely known aboutChristopher outside of my office. One is that he is a tremendous athlete. He has been for a long time. When he was in college,he was on the varsity men's water polo team. He was cocaptain at Brown, he was All-Ivy League, and to this day, he gets up at 4or 5 o'clock every morning and usually goes for a run. He occasionally bangs out a marathon and thinks nothing of it. He hasquite a diverse range of talents.  He also has a very peculiar taste in certain things. He loves all things related to cats,except the animals themselves. I don't understand that. Maybe it is an allergy; I am not sure exactly what it is. If you look athis desk area, he has funny photos of cats, little porcelain cats, little masks of cats, and a calendar of cats. He loves allthings cats, except the animals themselves. It is quite remarkable.  Having said all of that about his background, what Ireally want to say is how fortunate Pennsylvania and I have been to have Christopher Gahan serving in this capacity. As I said,from the day that I had lunch with Christopher, I knew he could do a great job. I knew he had that ability. I had very highexpectations for what he could do, and he has exceeded those expectations every day. It has really been quite amazing. He is avery intelligent man, but more importantly, he has great judgment and a great ability to work with people.  The role he hasplayed in my office has been absolutely tremendous. For example, he is very knowledgeable about a number of issue areas, but healways understood that his role was to help the legislative assistants who had responsibilities for those areas. Christopher'srole was to make sure that they were able to do the work they were assigned to do and to really shine and get a chance to exceland to grow personally. While he could have inserted himself in that dynamic, he never did. He always chose to empower[[Page S225]]thepeople who worked under him, and he created an environment where people loved to come to work every day. They loved to workhard. They wanted to do well for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is they wanted to continue to earn the respect ofChristopher  Needless to say, he is extremely well liked, both within the office and on the I know how oftenother chiefs, other Members, people who come to us with concerns from Pennsylvania--they have praised his even-handed, verythoughtful, very hard-working approach. He has truly enabled us to have a very successful office for these last 6 years, and Iam very grateful to him.  He is moving on to the private sector, and I understand that. He has served me and my office, ourState and our country very well. He deserves the change that he has embraced, and I think he is going to do very well. I am surehe will, and I wish him every success. My only insistence is that he stay in touch because he has become a very good friend andhe is just a great source of advice.  Lastly, he is a great patriot. He loves this country. He has served it well, and we aregoing to miss him.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

126,topic-id,657,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Jonah Min Hwang, another victim of a senseless act of gun violence. Jonah was only 8 years old when he was killed last week in a drive-by shooting in my home city of  Jonah, his parents, and his brother were enjoying dinner hosted by friends of his parents, two schoolteachers, when a bullet ripped through the house and hit Crimes like this are heartbreaking.  A talented soccer player, an avid reader who loved superheroes, Jonah was an adopted child from a Taiwanese orphanage just 3 years ago. It eats at your soul to think that such a young child with his whole life ahead of him could be taken so ruthlessly. Perhaps most frustrating is that Jonah's killer is still at large.  When I first heard of Jonah's death, it brought me back to a similar tragedy when I served as mayor of my home city of In 2006, little Ethan Esparza was shot and killed while he was playing in his front yard during his birthday party. He would have turned 4 years old.  Ethan's murder shocked our community and was a stark reminder of the violence that plagues our city. Sadly, over 10 years later, we are still fighting those same battles.  The murders of Jonah and Ethan were completely senseless, but they are not rare. In fact, Pomona was recently ranked California's eighth most dangerous city, which doesn't surprise those of us who have seen gangs take ahold of our city.  Our local police department puts their lives on the line every single day to try to keep us safe, and our local officials have made significant investments in law enforcement. During my time as mayor, we implemented gang injunctions to try to get hold of the problem.                              {time}  1015  But as the number of guns on the streets continues to rise and ruthless gang members get their hands on these deadly weapons, it often feels like a losing battle. We are alone fighting these battles.  As a matter of fact, today marks the 23rd anniversary of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, better known as the Brady bill, which has blocked more than 3 million people who had no business owning a gun from buying a gun from a federally licensed dealer.  As the new President makes his first address to Congress today, it is especially infuriating that, despite the countless gun-related tragedies occurring across our country, this Congress and this new administration have not taken one single step to reduce gun violence. I have come to this floor before demanding action, and I stand here before you yet again today, Mr.Speaker, to demand action on behalf of Jonah, of Ethan, and of the millions of innocent lives lost.  There are steps that we can take immediately to expand the Brady bill to save lives and make our communities safer:  First, we should close the loophole that allows guns to be sold online or at gun shows without background checks.[[Page H1361]]  Second, we should make sure that there are resources available to research gun violence--research. We can't find effective solutions if we can't research and understand the problem.  Lastly, we should enhance the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, and make sure that States are inputting records in a way that allows Federal agencies to run complete background checks on individuals. Background checks are only as effective as the quality of the records in the background check system.  There is no excuse for making it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a deadly weapon. It is my deepest hope that this Congress will take action on gun control so that none of us has to attend another vigil in Pomona--or anywhere else in America--to honor the memory of another child taken from us much too soon. We owe it to the victims and to their loved ones to act.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1360-2.txt,2231,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,28.0,February

251,topic-id,1769,"Mr.President, this is my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech 159. In giving these speeches, I have come to realize that some of my colleagues seem to have a hard time wrapping their heads around the basic understanding of climate change. Some of President Trump's Cabinet nominees seem to have the same problem.  They say the scientific community is split on the issue. It is not.  They say the climate has always been changing. Not like this, it hasn't.  They say we can't trust projections and complex computer models. But overall, they have actually been right.  And, of course, they have the notorious ``I'm not a scientist'' dodge. Well, if a colleague doesn't understand this, then perhaps he ought to trust the scientists at NOAA and at NASA, at our National Labs, and at universities in Rhode Island and across the country--the scientists whose job it is to understand this.  I must say, in addition to trusting the scientists, I also trust Rhode Island fishermen who see the changes in their traps and nets and our shoreline homeowners watching the sea steadily rising toward their homes. You don't need fancy computer models to see the ocean changes already taking place; you just need a thermometer to measure rising temperatures, basically a yardstick to measure sea level rise or a simple pH kit to measure the acidification of our oceans.  Let's look at ocean acidification. The oceans have absorbed about one-third of all the excess carbon dioxide produced by humans since the industrial revolution, around 600 gigatons' worth. When that carbon dioxide dissolves into the ocean, chemistry happens, and it makes the oceans more acidic.  Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid. Carbonic acid isn't stable in ocean water, so it breaks down into bicarbonate ions, a base, and hydrogen ions, an acid. The increase in acidic hydrogen ions is the crux of the chemistry of ocean acidification. More hydrogen ions lower the water's pH,[[Page S1630]]and the lower the pH, the higher the acidity.  Regular viewers of my ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches or people who spent the night up with us while we objected to Administrator Pruitt's nomination may remember that I demonstrated this in a simple experiment on the Senate floor just a few weeks ago. I took the glass of water on my desk, and I used the carbon dioxide in my own breath. Blowing through an aquarium stone, I was able to show, with the help of a little pH dye, how easy it is to actually measure the effect of CO2 on the acidity of water. With just a few breaths into the water, I was able to visibly make this glass of drinking water more acidic.  That little experiment is a microcosm of what is happening in our oceans right now, except, instead of bubbles blown through a straw, it is a transfer of excess CO2 from the atmosphere into the surface waters of the ocean all around the globe.  Scientific observations confirm that what the laws of chemistry tell us should happen is actually happening. Massive carbon pollution resulting from burning fossil fuels is changing ocean acidity faster than ever in the past 50 million years.  Now, you start talking in big numbers, and it all goes into a blur--50 million years, compared to how long the human species has been on the planet, which is about 200,000 years. So 50 million years is, what, 250 times the length of time that our species has inhabited the  This chart shows measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory in That is the redline of climbing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And it shows carbon dioxide in the ocean, which is the green measure, which is also climbing in tandem with the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Finally, it shows the pH of ocean water in the sea. Of course, as the chemistry would tell us, as the carbon dioxide goes up, the pH comes down, and the acidity rises; the water becomes more acidic.  We measure that surface seawater on the Earth's oceans has, since the industrial revolution, become roughly 30 percent more acidic. NOAA predicts that oceans will be 150 percent more acidic than now by the end of the century. Coastal States, like Rhode Island and Florida, will feel the hit.  Ocean acidification disrupts life in the sea when those loose hydrogen ions we talked about latch onto free carbonate ions. Usually that carbonate is plentiful in ocean water. Shell-forming marine creatures, like oysters and clams, use this loose carbonate to help form their shells. But if the carbonate they need is bound up by hydrogen ions, they can't get enough carbonate to build their shells.  We have even seen acidification scenarios in which shells start to dissolve in the water. Shellfish hatcheries on the west coast have already seen devastating losses of larval oysters due to acidic waters. When ocean pH fell too low, baby oysters couldn't form their shells, and they quickly died off. Julia Ekstrom, the lead researcher for Nature Climate Change's 2015 study on ocean acidification, told PBS that it has cost the Pacific Northwest oyster industry more than $100 million and jeopardized thousands of jobs. Her research flagged 15 States where the shellfish industry would be hardest hit, from Alaska to Florida, to my home State of Rhode  Toward the bottom of the oceanic food web is the humble pteropod. Pteropods are sometimes called sea butterflies because their tiny snail foot has evolved into an oceanic wing. In 2014 NOAA found that more than half of pteropods sampled off the west coast were suffering from severely dissolved shells due to ocean acidification, and it is worsening.  This is a pteropod shell degrading over time in acidified water.  Of course, we are here in ``Mammon Hall,'' where it feels laughable to care about anything that can't be monetized. We talk a good game here in the Senate about God's Earth and God's creation and God's creatures, but what we really care about is the money. So let's monetize this.  Who cares about this humble species? Salmon do. As the west coast loses its pteropods, that collapse reverberates up the food chain, and the salmon care because many of them feed on the pteropods. The west coast salmon fishery is a big deal, so salmon fishermen care about this.  Another foundational marine species, krill, is also affected by ocean acidification. In the Southern Ocean, nearly all marine animals can thank krill for their survival. From penguin diets to whale diets, krill is king.  A 2013 study in Nature Climate Change found ocean acidification inhibiting the hatching of krill eggs and the normal development of larvae. The researchers note that unless we cut emissions, collapse of the krill population in the Southern Ocean portends ``dire consequences for the entire ecosystem.''  Closer to home, the University of Alaska's Ocean Acidification Research Center--yes, ocean acidification is serious enough that the University of Alaska has an Ocean Acidification Research Center, and it warns that ocean acidification ``has the potential to disrupt [Alaska's fishing] industry from top to bottom.''  Turning to warmer waters, coral reefs are also highly susceptible to ocean acidification. A healthy coral reef is one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth, home to 25 percent of the world's fish biodiversity. Those reef-building corals rely on calcium carbonate to build their skeletons.  Since the Presiding Officer is from Florida, I know how important coral reefs are to the tourism industry in his  Coral depends on a symbiotic relationship with tiny photosynthetic algae, called zooxanthellae, that live in the surface tissue of the coral. There is a range of pH, as well as temperature, salinity, and water clarity, within which this symbiosis between the coral and the zooxanthellae thrives. Outside that comfort range, the corals get stressed, and they begin to evict the algae. This is called coral bleaching because corals shed their colorful algae. Without these algae, corals soon die.  The effects of acidification on sea life are far-reaching. Studies have found ocean acidification disrupts everything from the sensory systems of clownfish--those are little Nemos, for those who have seen the movie--to phytoplankton populations, to sea urchin reproduction, to the Dungeness crab, another valuable west coast specialty.  I asked Scott Pruitt, our ethically challenged Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, about ocean acidification. He gave these answers: ``The oceans are alkaline and are projected to remain so,'' and two, ``The degree of alkalinity in the ocean is highly variable and therefore it is difficult to attribute that variability to any single cause.''  Let's look at those answers.  The first answer is plain and simple nonsense because the harm to ocean creatures from acidification comes from the dramatic shift in ocean acidity, not from where along the acid-based spectrum the shift takes place. The observation he made is irrelevant to the question.  His second answer is no better. It exhibits purposeful ignorance of the role humans' carbon pollution plays in damaging the ocean, because the chemical principles at issue here are indisputable. You can replicate them in a middle school laboratory in any Florida school. As I showed in my little demonstration, you can replicate them even here on the Senate floor. Like its carbon cousin, climate change, ocean acidification doesn't care whether you believe in chemistry. It doesn't matter to chemistry if you swallow the propaganda pumped out by the fossil fuel lobby. The principles of science operate notwithstanding. The chemical interactions take place by law of nature whether you believe them or not. If you believe in God, then you have to acknowledge that these laws of nature are God's laws, the basic operating principles He established in His creation. But, of course, here at Mammon Hall, it is always about the money.  Any decent EPA Administrator is obliged to trust in real science and to take action to protect human health and the environment. I am deeply unconvinced that Administrator Pruitt will live up in any respect to those obligations, but I would welcome being proven wrong. Likewise, I similarly challenge my colleagues here in the Senate.[[Page S1631]]  This Chamber and our Nation will be judged harshly by our descendants, both for our pigheaded disregard for the basic truths, the basic operating systems of the world we live in, and for the shameful reason why we disregard them. Mammon Hall indeed.  Mr.President, it is time for the Senate to wake up before it is too late.  I yield the floor.

299,topic-id,3634,"Mr.President, I have crossed through and beyond150 ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches. People sometimes ask me how I come up with the material. It is actually easy, even week afterweek after week, because it only takes reading the news. If we look back at the headlines and dubious milestones of 2016, wefind plenty to talk about.  Last year was hot. NASA and NOAA are expected to certify later this month that 2016 was thehottest year in recorded history, exceeding the previous record set by 2015 and the previous record set by 2014. What this meansis, 2014, 2015, and 2016 have each succeeded the last as the three hottest years on record.  The United Nations WorldMeteorological Organization found that the world was 1.2 degrees Celsius or over 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in 2016 than it wasbefore the Industrial Revolution and the dawn of wide-scale fossil fuel use.  We are careening closer and closer to the 2-degree Celsius mark which scientists say brings, to quote Donald Trump in 2009, ``catastrophic'' and ``irreversible'' climateeffects.  In 2016, climate change continued to make some places almost unrecognizable. Up north in the Arctic things gotbizarre. Thermometers spiked in mid-November to almost 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, with a 37-year low in thenearby sea ice. The peaks were about 50 degrees above normal, and around Christmas it actually rose above freezing at the Imagine, the snow was actually beginning to melt at the North Pole just as Santa was loading his sleigh with  In the tropics, undersea forests of once colorful coral stood bone white as the Great Barrier Reef experienced thegreatest bleaching and coral die-off on record. What happens is that the superwarm water stressed the corals. That forces themto expel the tiny algae that lives symbiotically with the coral, providing them their food, and that is what gives coral reefstheir beautiful color and their life. When the algae go, the coral structures turn ghostly white. They often do not recover.  It is not just the Great Barrier My clips today included a story from Japan, whose biggest coral reef has just beendetermined to be 70 percent dead.  The researchers in Australia found severe bleaching throughout the Great Barrier TheGuardian reported in March that ``93 percent of the 3,000 individual reefs [had] been touched by bleaching, and almost a quarter. . . [had] been killed by this bleaching event.''  By November, around two-thirds of the northern portion of the GreatBarrier Reef had died, with some atolls suffering complete devastation. Warming is at the heart of that catastrophe.  We alsoknow from the physical laws of thermal expansion that as ocean water warms, it does something else. It expands. The oceans alsoare taking in melting water from our shrinking glaciers. Together, those factors are causing sea levels to rise worldwide. Lastyear, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicted that at our current pace, over 90 percent of the world'scoastal areas will experience almost 8 inches of sea level rise by 2040. Year 2040 is not that far away. On the Atlantic coastof the United States, it will be more than 15 inches. By 2040, a house that you bought on the coast today could be literallyunderwater before you paid off your 30-year mortgage. The real estate business is starting to take notice.  Zillow, theonline real estate marketplace, has released a tool for users to show how potential sea level rise by 2100 would affect the over100 million U.homes in its database. Around 1 in 50 homes in the United States, or just under 2 million properties, will findtheir ground floors underwater by 2100 if we don't get ahead of this. Thirty-six U.cities would be considered ``completelylost''--those are their words--``completely lost,'' and another 300 cities would lose at least half their homes. This doesn't eveninclude commercial or public properties.  Government-backed mortgage giant Freddie Mac is girding for broad losses fromclimate-driven flooding. ``The economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually,'' it wrote in an April 2016 report,``but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.''  Let me saythat again. The economic losses ``are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and GreatRecession.''  The report says some of the effects of climate change may not even be insurable and, unlike our 2008 housingcrash, owners of homes that are subsumed by rising seas would have little expectation of their homes' values ever returning and,therefore, little incentive to continue to make mortgage payments through the crisis, and that, in turn, adds to steeper lossesfor lenders and insurers.  Remember that Donald Trump signed, along with his children, this full-page ad in the New YorkTimes in 2009. Here is what it said, speaking as Americans:       [W]e must embrace the challenge todayto ensure that future      generations are left with a safe planet and a strong economy.      . . .  He said to the President inthis advertisement:       We support your effort to ensure meaningful and effective      measures to controlclimate change, an immediate challenge      facing the United States and the world today.  It went on:       Please don't postpone the earth. If we fail to act now, it      is scientifically irrefutable--  Let me repeat hiswords--     scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic      and irreversibleconsequences for humanity and our planet.  That is what Donald Trump and his family said in a 2009 ad, ``catastrophic andirreversible.''  We have been warned.  President-Elect Trump also pledged to ``drain the swamp''here in Washington of corporate insiders and special interests. But we don't see that. We see an alligator pack of climatedeniers, oil executives, and Koch brothers flunkies nominated to fill his Cabinet, his White House, and his executive agencies.  The Koch brothers, Exxon, and other special fossil fuel interests stand on one side. On the other side stand our military,our National Labs, and  Let me put in a little footnote on They have a rover driving around on the planet Marsright now. Do you think their science might be OK? And, on the other side, also, I think, is every university in the UnitedStates of That is the choice: The fossil fuel guys, led by the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil, and the whole array ofphony baloney front groups that they have stood up to try to mask their hand, or the virtually complete science establishment ofthe world, every Nation, our military, our National Labs, and all of our universities. Who are you going to believe?[[Page S230]]Theones with the huge conflict of interest or the people who know what they are talking about?  Well, too many people in thisroom have made the wrong choice, but we need to fix it.  In Rhode Island, some good things happened last year. After over 8years of work, we have the Nation's first offshore wind farm. Thirty megawatts, five turbines came online in December 2016--theBlock Island Wind I am proud of Deepwater Wind for getting it done. I am proud of Rhode Island for establishing a processfor siting an approval that is now a national model. It is part of a transformation that happened, emphasized in 2016, and thatwas jobs in the renewable energy industry taking off.  At the end of 2016, we had 400,000 wind and solar jobs, and by 2020,that number is expected to be 600,000. As employment climbs in these industries, costs for renewable technologies continues todrop compared to fossil fuels.  Last year we saw new records for electricity generation from renewable sources. Texas windgeneration hit a record 15 gigawatts in December of last year, meeting 45 percent of the State's power needs, with 18,000megawatts installed and another 5,000 megawatts under construction.  In Iowa, MidAmerican Energy is planning to add 2,000megawatts of new wind by 2019. Once installed, 85 percent of the energy MidAmerican generates will be renewable.  Wecontinued to make real progress internationally in 2016 as well. Earth Day was the signing ceremony for the historic Parisclimate agreement. Nearly 200 nations pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. By October, we met the threshold forratification of that agreement, when over 55 countries officially joined, and the agreement was fully adopted in  Just this week, over 630 companies and major investment firms, with a combined 1.8 million employees and $1.15 trillion inannual revenue, called on President-Elect Trump, us in Congress, and global leaders to continue to participate in and implementthe Paris Agreement to ``create jobs and boost U.competitiveness.''  This is the business community saying that the ParisAgreement will create jobs and boost U.competitiveness.  Signatories included food giants General Mills, Kellogg's,Campbell's Soup, and Mars; apparel companies VF Corporation, Nike and Levi's; and other corporate heavy weights like Monsanto,DuPont, Intel, and Johnson &  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the ``Business Backs Low-Carbon USA''letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I sure hope President-Elect Trump will heed this callfrom the leaders of the business community.  Closing word: Secretary of State Kerry, in addition to providing greatleadership through this, has also started doing something that I know is precious to him and that is important to me and many ofour colleagues; that is, to give oceans the global attention they deserve. In September, more than 90 countries convened here inWashington for the Our Ocean Nations, nonprofit organizations, foundations, and big corporations all came togetherpledging over $5 billion for marine conservation and committing to protect more than 1.5 million square miles of ocean.Secretary Kerry secured the legacy of the Our Ocean Conference by locking in hosts for the conference for the next 3 years.  So 2016 was a year of worsening climate effects but also of heartening climate action. The dramatic changes taking place inthe Earth's climate are now undeniable, but so is the growing spirit of action among men and women of good conscience across theUnited States and around the world. One can hope that 2017 will be the year when we in this Chamber finally wake up.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record, as follows:                     Business Backs Low-Carbon USA       Dear President-elect Trump,President Obama, Members of the      US Congress, and Global Leaders:       We, the undersigned members in the business and      investorcommunity of the United States, reaffirm our deep      commitment to addressing climate change through the      implementation of thehistoric Paris Climate       We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered      by low-carbon energy. Cost-effective and innovative solutions      can help us achieve these objectives. Failure to build a low-     carbon economy puts Americanprosperity at risk. But the right      action now will create jobs and boost US competitiveness. We      pledge to do our part, in our ownoperations and beyond, to      realize the Paris Agreement's commitment of a global economy      that limits global temperature rise towell below 2 degrees            We call on our elected US leaders to strongly support:       1.Continuation of low-carbon policies to allow the US to      meet or exceed our promised national commitment and to      increase ournation's future ambition       2. Investment in the low carbon economy at home and abroad      in order to givefinancial decision-makers clarity and boost      the confidence of investors worldwide       3. Continued USparticipation in the Paris Agreement, in      order to provide the long-term direction needed to keep      global temperature rise below 2 deg.C       Implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage      businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars      inexisting low-carbon investments into the trillions of      dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity      to all.       Wesupport leaders around the world as they seek to      implement the Paris Agreement and leverage this historic      opportunity to tackleclimate change.       22 Designs, 3P Partners, 3Sisters

309,topic-id,1479,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to join my colleagues inexpressing support for 3, the budget resolution which, as most Americans now know, is the vehicle we will use tobegin the repeal and replacement of  This is a matter of keeping our word to the American people. This is a matterof keeping our promises that we have made, not only during the last campaign cycle but repeatedly since I voted against thisbill some 8 years ago. It was enacted in January of 2010.  Republicans on this side of the aisle and many Americansrepeatedly opposed the ObamaCare expansion of Federal power. We said it wouldn't work. We said the President would not be ableto keep his promises to the American people and when we got a chance to go back into the majority, we would repeal that act. Onthis side of the aisle, this is a followup on years and years of determination on our part to right this wrong, to keep ourpromises, and come up with a better plan to help Americans have coverage they can afford and a doctor they can keep.  Iintend to support the chairman of the Budget Committee in the votes we will have today and tonight. We have what some peoplecall the vote-arama tonight. A number of votes will be taken in rapid succession, and we don't know how many will actually beoffered by our friends on the other side of the aisle. I believe I will be able to vote against all of these amendments becauseI think keeping a clean bill makes it more likely we will be able to pass this legislation, send it to over to the House ofRepresentatives where it can be tweaked but passed and get back to us for final approval, and actually get a bill to President-elect Trump after he takes office, repealing ObamaCare so we can replace it with something that works.  This is ouropportunity to keep our campaign promise. This is our opportunity to help the President-elect and the Vice President-elect keeptheir campaign promises and show to the American people that elections have consequences and that at least this group of publicofficials intends to keep our word with regard to this piece of legislation. It was well intended, no doubt, but it could notpossibly have worked to do the things that President Obama said it could do.  In 2009 and 2010, the President told us: If youlike your health plan, you get to keep it. It turns out that is a promise that was not kept because it could not be kept.  The President said: If you like your doctor, you can keep that doctor. Again, this is a promise this administration and ourDemocratic friends on the other side of the aisle were unable to keep. That is why so many people around the country are opposedto keeping They want it to be repealed. They want a drastically different approach involving market principles to beput in its place so it will work for patients and work for the American people.  ObamaCare is not working. It is not workingin my home State of It is not working for millions of Americans who lost their health insurance. It is it is notworking for millions of Americans who saw their premiums rise and their deductibles go to unimaginable heights.  Of course, Iknow the Presiding Officer and I have heard from constituents at home, and I am going to take this opportunity to share with yousome of the views I have heard from people in Mississippi who are looking to us in the House and in the Senate to rectify thissituation with regard to this disastrous piece of legislation.  A 62-year-old individual from Madison, MS, wrote to mesaying:       Please explain the term ``affordable'' in the Affordable      Care . . . I recently went toHealthcare.gov to look at      possible health insurance plans. . . . The estimates range      from over $18,000 to over $26,000 per year.That is anywhere      from 13.5% to 18.6% of our gross salary. So forget about      saving for retirement. The system is flawed.  Another Mississippian wrote to me:       I have read in many publications about the increases      inpremiums for ObamaCare, but that is actually a moot point      when the only insurance . . . that my doctor and my wife's      doctor willtake is PULLING out (of the exchange) leaving my      wife with no choice but to possibly return to work just for      the insurance.  A third constituent from Saltillo, MS, wrote:       I just applied at themarket place for health insurance. My      quote was $415 monthly with a deductible of $6850. I work      less than 30 hours a week inretail. There is no way that I      can afford that.  This constituent from Saltillo goes on to say:       What am I supposed to do? I have a car payment and I need      to eat.  Well, I think help is on the way. The action weare going to take this week in sending this resolution over to the House of Representatives is a form of keeping our promise andproviding assistance to this constituent of mine.  These stories go on and on. For a woman in Gulfport whose husband lost hisjob, the cheapest plan in the ObamaCare exchange was $1,042 with a $13,000 deductible. This constituent calls ObamaCare``legalized extortion.''  A 60-year-old constituent was understandably upset when his insurance went up by $113 a month. Hethen noticed that coverage he didn't request had been added to his policy without wanting it or needing it. Pediatric dentistryand birth control were required on this plan, two things neither he nor his wife want to use or want to pay for.  So I wantto remind my colleagues that ObamaCare is hurting individuals--individuals who have written to me, and individuals who havewritten to all of my colleagues, but it is also hurting small businesses in Mississippi and small businesses in Pennsylvania andaround the country. I would remind my colleagues that most jobs in the United States are created not by large corporations, notby the big-ticket manufacturing plants that come into our States and districts that we like to have, but by smallbusinesses--businesses of under 200 people.  A small business owner in South Mississippi wrote to me. Following her husband'sretirement, she had to find health care through the exchange. Her county borders Louisiana, and many Mississippians travelacross State lines for work. The health care network that she has used for 20 years is no longer an option for her becauseObamaCare policies do not allow beneficiaries to use networks in different That is also something we need to addresswhen we finally put in place the replacement portion of this mechanism.  The plan for this nonsmoker, with no preexistingconditions, under the exchange cost her $900 a month in premiums and she was not able to keep her doctor.  It is not justconstituents in my more or less Republican State, among my more or less Republican constituents in the State of Mississippi whoare telling the truth about I want to quote Bill Clinton, speaking on behalf of his wife in Flint, MI, on October 4of last year. Former President Bill Clinton said this:       You've got this crazy system where all of asudden 25      million more people have health care, and then the people who      are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week,wind up      with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.      It is the craziest thing in the world.  PresidentBill Clinton said that just last year in Flint,  I think if we come to grips with this, we will admit that this is acrazy system. It was well intended by some of my Democratic friends but one that has failed; one that has failed the Americanpeople and one that has failed to keep the promises that were solidly made when the bill was rammed through on a strictlypartisan basis. Every Democrat was supporting it. No Republicans were supporting it at all.[[Page S243]]There was no Republican input,no bipartisan input on overhauling one of the most significant systems in our country.  It is time for us to move forward,and tonight is a step forward. We certainly aren't going to get it all done in one fell swoop, and even when we get the billsigned into law by our new President Donald Trump, it will take a while for it to be put into place. Tonight we show that wemeant what we said and we said what we meant, and we are going to follow through. We are going to pass this resolution tonightand begin the process of keeping our promises to the American people to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something thatworks for the millions and hundreds of millions of Americans out there who depend on us for good policy.  Seeing no other Members seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerkwill call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

25,topic-id,213,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the many veterans and the work that Congress is doing to support and represent them on the House floor this week. These are the heroes who keep us safe and secure each and every day.  This week, this body passed a few important bills to streamline access to care for veterans as well as provide new and better opportunities for veteran-owned businesses and veterans seeking employment.  Last month, the unemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans increased to 6.3 percent, marking the fourth time in the last 7 months that group's percentage has been higher than the overall veteran unemployment rate. That means that about 211,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are still looking for work. That is 211,000 too many.  That is why one of the bills we passed this week establishes a Federal program recognizing private businesses that employ veterans and engage in community service to help our veterans.  Mr.Speaker, helping our Nation's veterans who have sacrificed so much for us is a critical priority and remains one of the most important objectives of this I will continue to use my time and effort to fight for every opportunity to support them when they return home to give them the hero's welcome they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1192-5.txt,2021,"CONCURRENTRESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,15.0,January
99,topic-id,189,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, which was observed this week inhonor of the contributions countless men and women in uniform have made to keep our communities safe and secure.  This year's observance was particularly difficult for our Kansas community. Over the last year, three police officers in mydistrict made the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty. Brad Lancaster, Dave Melton of Kansas City, and Brandon Collinsof Overland Park each lost their lives while protecting our community.  Law Enforcement Appreciation Day is a day to remember them and to honor the men and women who remain in the field each daykeeping our children and families safe. They are the ones who run into danger when others run away. They are the true heroes,and we should always regard them as such. It is also a day to honor the United States Capitol Police to keep Congress, ourstaff, and our visitors in this very Chamber safe.  Mr.Speaker, let us never forget the service and sacrifice of our law enforcement officers, and let us continue to honorthem with the gratitude and respect they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH315-5.txt,2021,LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY,2017.0,11.0,January
