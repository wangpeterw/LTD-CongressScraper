               RECOGNIZING ROTARY INTERNATIONAL'S SUCCESS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, through my service to 
South Carolina's Second Congressional District and as past Cayce-West 
Columbia Rotary Club president, I appreciate Rotary International's 
work in promoting worldwide Service Above Self.
  In coordination with national governments, Rotary International 
created the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, producing Polio Plus 
as one of the most successful public-private health initiatives in 
history. The initiative has provided immunizations for more than 2.5 
billion children, spared 15 million from disability, prevented over 1.5 
million deaths, and has reduced polio illnesses by 99 percent.
  Earlier this year, I introduced H. Res. 165, recognizing Rotary 
International's work on the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and 
supporting their ongoing services.
  While we have made remarkable strides, more work remains. I am 
grateful to support the current president of the Global Polio 
Eradication Initiative with Rotary International President John Germ 
and past Vice President Anne Matthews of Columbia, South Carolina.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to the 
family of National Review conservative stalwart Kate O'Beirne.
