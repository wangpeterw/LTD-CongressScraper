                   TIME FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM IS NOW

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the time for immigration reform is now.
  If we want to increase the growth rate of our economy, fixing our 
broken immigration system will do that.
  If we want to restore the rule of law and improve our national 
security so we know who is here, immigration reform will do that.
  If we want to prevent undocumented workers from undermining wages for 
American workers, immigration reform will do that by making sure that 
people who work here are registered and get right with the law and can 
move forward in a legal manner.
  There are so many reasons to pass a bipartisan immigration reform 
bill similar to the one that passed the United States Senate with more 
than two-thirds support just a few years ago.
  I hope that my Democratic and Republican colleagues hear the outcry 
from across this country that says enough is enough. Let's fix our 
broken immigration system.
  We are, after all, a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. It is 
the work of this body to reconcile those two to make sure that, moving 
forward, we can do immigration in a legal way rather than an illegal 
way, a way that benefits our economy, American workers, and American 
businesses.
  Let's move forward on comprehensive immigration reform now.
