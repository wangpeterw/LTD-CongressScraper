                                 RECESS

  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
recess until 2:15 p.m. and that the time during the recess be charged 
equally to both sides on the joint resolution.
  There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:35 p.m., recessed until 
2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer 
(Mr. Flake).
