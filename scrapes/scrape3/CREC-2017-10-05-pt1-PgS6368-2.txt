  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Hassan, and Mr. Hatch) 
submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 288

       Whereas police officers are indispensable members of the 
     community who put their lives on the line to protect others;
       Whereas promoting strong relationships founded in trust and 
     mutual respect between law enforcement officers and the 
     communities they serve helps ensure the safe and effective 
     execution of the law;
       Whereas law enforcement officers and communities that work 
     together to address public safety concerns can create lasting 
     solutions to difficult challenges;
       Whereas a long-term commitment to community policing is 
     necessary to eliminate the underlying causes of crime;
       Whereas the advancement of community policing should be 
     supported to ensure that State and local law enforcement 
     agencies have necessary resources; and
       Whereas community policing has been recognized as an 
     important tool for improving the relationship between law 
     enforcement officers and the communities they serve: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week of October 1 through 7, 2017, as 
     ``National Community Policing Week''; and
       (2) supports community policing and encourages the people 
     of the United States, law enforcement agencies, and elected 
     officials to identify ways in which communities may improve 
     public safety, strengthen relationships, and build trust.
