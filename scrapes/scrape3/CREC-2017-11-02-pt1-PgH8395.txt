                  SUPPORT FOR THE NEW TAX REFORM BILL

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, first, a hearty congratulations to my Texas 
colleagues from northern California, Giants country. Orange October 
feels good, doesn't it, especially when you defeat the hated southern 
California franchise?
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of the new 
tax reform bill that was released just today by the Ways and Means 
Committee. This legislation contains many provisions that Congress has 
been promising the American people a long time: doubling the standard 
deduction, lowering the corporate tax rate, cutting taxes for small 
businesses.
  That is what these reform measures are about: saving money for 
millions of Americans and simplifying the act of doing your taxes, as 
well as creating an environment for American business to thrive and 
come home and bring the jobs with them here in America and invest in 
the American economy.
  The American people want tax reform, they need tax reform, and they 
have waited a long time, indeed since 1986. They shouldn't have to wait 
more years than actually the last time the Dodgers won the World Series 
to kick start their economy and help American jobs.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to make this happen now.
