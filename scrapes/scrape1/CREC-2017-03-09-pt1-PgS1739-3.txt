          REMEMBERING SHERIFF CHARLES EDWARD ``FUZZY'' KEESEE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of 
the longest serving county sheriff in the history of Kentucky, Pike 
County Sheriff Charles Edward Keesee. After more than 40 years of hard 
work, ``Fuzzy,'' as he was affectionately known, passed away at the age 
of 89.
  A veteran of the Second World War, Fuzzy became a lasting icon in 
Pike County. Deputy Judge/Executive Brian Morris said ``You can't serve 
for more than four decades and not personally touch every household in 
Pike County.'' He was a compassionate public servant, a dedicated law 
enforcement officer, and a good man. The community will surely remember 
Fuzzy's impact and miss him deeply.
  Elaine and I send our condolences to Sheriff Keesee's wife, Easter, 
his brother, Alben, and his sister, Nancy Jo.
