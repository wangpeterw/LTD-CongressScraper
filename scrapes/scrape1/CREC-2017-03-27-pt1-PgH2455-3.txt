                       VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL

  (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, 35 years ago yesterday, ground was broken 
on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Today, there are 58,272 names listed 
on that memorial. We still have work to do.
  There are 1,615 names listed as MIA. As a Vietnam veteran, I want to 
call your attention to all of the men and women who served, the 2.7 
million who served in Vietnam, a lot of whom are with us today, and a 
lot of those who will continue to celebrate the losses of our comrades.
  Please remember that we all served honorably at the request of our 
government, and we will continue to serve as long as the cause is just.
