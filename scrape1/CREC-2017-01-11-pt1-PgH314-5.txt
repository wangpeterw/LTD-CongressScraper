                       TRADE IS A TWO-WAY STREET

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend hisremarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, some people have expressed 
concern that President-elect Trump will start a trade warif he gets 
tough on trade. But what they are not admitting, or perhaps it has 
never occurred to them, is that we have been in atrade war for many 
years, and we have been losing.
  China has followed a China-first policy for years to their great 
benefit, while we have sent millions of good jobs to othercountries and 
several million of our young people now can find jobs only in 
restaurants.
  With only 4 percent of the world's population, we buy 21.7 percent of 
the world's goods. We used to buy about 25 percent,but we have more 
competition around the world now as most countries are trying to move 
away from socialism while we seeminglymove toward it. But we still have 
tremendous leverage on trade that we have not used because every 
country wants desperatelyinto our markets.
  We need to negotiate trade deals that will create more jobs in this 
country. We need, Mr. Speaker, to tell foreign leadersthat we want to 
buy things from them, but they need to start buying from us, too. 
Friendship is a two-way street.
