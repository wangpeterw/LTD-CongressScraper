                    RECENT CHEMICAL ATTACKS IN SYRIA

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, dozens of Syrians suffered yet 
again at the hands of Bashar al-Assad when he employed chemical weapons 
in an attack that left children gasping for air and suffering in the 
middle of the streets. In the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since 
2013, the death toll has now surpassed 70 and continues to rise.
  This attack was morally reprehensible, but let's be clear: this 
attack is the fault of President Assad, and it is a war crime. He must 
be held accountable for his actions, as must the Russian regime that 
continues to enable his acts of carnage.
  Such barbarism is an attack on our collective humanity, and a 
chemical attack of this nature must never happen again in Syria or 
anywhere else in the world, and the world must not look the other way.
  Mr. Speaker, I condemn this attack and these actions in the strongest 
possible terms. I am grateful to the humanitarian groups and the 
medical personnel who are tending to these wounds today. My heart 
breaks for the victims who were injured and killed in Syria.
  Let us speak out as a world with one voice to condemn this attack and 
say: Never again.
