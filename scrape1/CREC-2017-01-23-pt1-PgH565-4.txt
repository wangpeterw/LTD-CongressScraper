                  MORTGAGE INSURANCE HURTS HOMEOWNERS

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I was really disappointed that, on his first 
day in office, President Trump took action through executive order to 
make it more difficult for hardworking families to own a home.
  With this executive order that the President signed, again, on day 
one, he canceled a scheduled FHA directive that would have saved 
American homeowners hundreds of dollars a year.
  Under President Obama, millions of Americans were set to receive 
hundreds of dollars in reduction in those fees, saving on their 
mortgage payments, saving on their monthly payment.
  Under this executive order, not only will Americans with mortgages 
pay more than they would have, but it will also prevent many Americans 
from being able to own a home.
  In fact, according to the National Association of Realtors, 40,000 
American families who could have purchased a home will not have access 
to that part of the American Dream because of this executive order by 
President Trump. This has a real impact.
  Rather than obsessing about the size of crowds at inaugurations, we 
ought to focus on this. This is real news.
