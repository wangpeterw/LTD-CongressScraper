         MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING VICTIMS OF HUMAN SMUGGLING

  (Mr. CASTRO of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my 
condolences to the loved ones and families of the 10 victims who died 
in the tragic human smuggling incident that took place in my hometown 
of San Antonio, Texas, over the weekend. Many before them have sought 
to come to our country by land and sea, and have perished.
  These were not Americans, but they are children of God. This was, 
above all else, politics aside, a human tragedy.
  Please join me in a moment of silence to remember the victims and the 
countless others like them who have lost their lives in pursuit of the 
American Dream.
