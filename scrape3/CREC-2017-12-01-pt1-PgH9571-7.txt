                       HONORING REGINALD F. LEWIS

  (Mr. CUMMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of a native son of 
Baltimore, Maryland, Mr. Reginald F. Lewis.
  Let me also acknowledge the presence of many of the Lewis family 
members in the gallery, including his mother, Carolyn; widow, Loida; 
daughter, Leslie; and brother, Anthony.
  From November 30 to December 1, 1987, 30 years ago, Mr. Lewis 
negotiated the $985 million leveraged buyout of Beatrice International 
Foods. At the time, it was the largest leveraged buyout of an American 
company's overseas assets, and it led to the creation of what the New 
York Times identified in 1993 as the largest corporation in the United 
States led by an African American.
  Mr. Lewis' accomplishments changed the face of American business 
forever and opened new doors of opportunity on Wall Street. His 
substantial philanthropic gifts have also continued to benefit 
Baltimore and, indeed, the Nation. They help young Americans of color 
to dream bigger, and in Lewis' own words, to ``keep on going, no matter 
what.''
  I invite everyone to join me in celebrating and honoring Reginald 
Lewis' memory and extraordinary accomplishments.
