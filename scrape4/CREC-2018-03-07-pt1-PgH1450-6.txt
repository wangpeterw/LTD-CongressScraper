                      YOUNG VOICES ON GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share excerpts 
from a letter I received from a 15-year-old in my district of San 
Diego. It shows the impact the Parkland, Florida, school shooting is 
having on our young people.
  This young person writes: ``I have never been in a school shooting 
nor do I know anyone who has, yet I feel every time I think about it or 
have a dream about it, I experience it.
  ``I'm only 15 years old, why am I terrified to go to places I used to 
love because someone could shoot me?
  ``Why is it so easy to buy and make guns in this country?
  ``Why can nobody seem to do the right thing and put a stop to this?
  ``Why does nobody pay attention to the kids in this country who have 
never been in a shooting but live in constant fear and do not feel 
safe?
  ``I am asking you to do something about the gun policies in this 
country so people stop dying and younger generations of people can feel 
safe.
  ``Put us first, not guns.''
  Mr. Speaker, what is the Chair's answer to this young voice?
