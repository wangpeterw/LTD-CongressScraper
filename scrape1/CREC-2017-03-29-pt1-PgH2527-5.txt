                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on tax reform. Many 
of my colleagues know this is a matter that I am the most passionate 
about.
  Mr. Speaker, I am a second-generation small-business owner, and my 
daughters are third-generation. I understand firsthand the impact that 
unfair, job-killing taxes and regulations have on Main Street.
  I know what it is like to nearly lose a family business that was 
built from the ground up just because the Federal Government believes 
in a death tax.

This, my friends, is a tax that strips families of the American Dream 
they worked so hard to achieve.
  The inheritance tax takes money from folks who know how to use it to 
create jobs and donate to charities and puts it in the hands of those 
responsible for a $20 trillion national debt.
  Mr. Speaker, I came up here to speak on behalf of the job creators 
that employ more than half of America's workforce. These are the men 
and women who suffer directly from politicians' knee-jerk reactions, 
politicians who have never met a payroll and have never worked in the 
private sector.
  Congress has talked about tax reform for decades, but we haven't seen 
major reforms in 30 years. Again, I am asking this Congress and this 
President to act now.
  In God we trust.
