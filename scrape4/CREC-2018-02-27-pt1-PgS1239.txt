                        TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY STOKS

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of 
my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Anthony 
Stoks. Anthony hails from Adelaide, Australia, and is a law student at 
Flinders University.
  While interning for the Commerce Committee, Anthony assisted the 
Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness. He is a dedicated 
worker who was committed to getting the most out of his internship. I 
extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Anthony for all of the 
fine work he did for the committee and wish him continued success in 
the years to come.
