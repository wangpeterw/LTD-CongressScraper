     RECOGNIZING THE BEST BUDDIES FRIENDSHIP WALK IN SOUTH FLORIDA

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, since its creation in 1989, Best 
Buddies has grown into a leading nonprofit entity that has provided 
countless opportunities for people with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities. Through its eight programs, participants are able to 
learn social skills, leadership development, integrated employment, and 
so much more. Today, Best Buddies has a presence in all 50 States and 
has spread internationally across many continents.
  I am also proud to say that the founder and the chairman of Best 
Buddies, Anthony Shriver, is a Floridian and a constituent.
  This Saturday, Best Buddies will be hosting its South Florida 
Friendship Walk which will take place at Museum Park, located in my 
congressional district, and I pray for a safe and successful event.
  I would like to express my tremendous appreciation to Best Buddies 
and the truly great people who support its cause.
