                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We ask Your blessing as we approach the end of the first session of 
this 115th Congress. You know well the contentiousness of this session. 
Look into the hearts of all the Members of this people's House to 
discern the good will within. May the good will You find be rewarded 
with Your grace. May any contrary spirit be banished.
  In the days that come, help each Member to understand well and 
interpret positively, as they are able, the positions of those with 
whom they disagree. Grant to each the wisdom of Solomon and, to us all, 
the faith and confidence to know that no matter how difficult things 
appear to be, You continue to walk with our Nation, as You have done 
for over two centuries.
  May all that is done in the people's House be for Your greater honor 
and glory. Amen.
