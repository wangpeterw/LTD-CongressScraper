 THANKING STENOGRAPHERS DURING NATIONAL COURT REPORTING AND CAPTIONING 
                                  WEEK

  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate National Court 
Reporting and Captioning Week.
  As an attorney, from firsthand experience, I can say that court 
reporters have had and continue to have an enormous impact on our legal 
system, both in a practical matter but also in an important historical 
sense. As we attorneys talk away, court reporters tirelessly capture 
every single word. The importance of this cannot be underestimated. 
Without their record, there would be no Brown v. Board of Education, 
Miranda v. Arizona, or countless other legal decisions of importance to 
the American people.
  Captioners also do wonderful work to help better the lives for 
millions of Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing by providing 
captioning realtime.
  So, on National Court Reporting and Captioning Week, I want to thank 
the thousands of Americans who work in this industry for their hard 
work and dedication.
