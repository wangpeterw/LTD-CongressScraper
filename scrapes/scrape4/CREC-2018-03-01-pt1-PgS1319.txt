       Whereas reading is a basic requirement for quality 
     education and professional success and a source of pleasure 
     throughout life;
       Whereas the people of the United States must be able to 
     read if the United States is to remain competitive in the 
     global economy;
       Whereas Congress has placed great emphasis on reading 
     intervention and providing additional resources for reading 
     assistance, including through the programs authorized under 
     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
     6301 et seq.) and through annual appropriations for library 
     and literacy programs; and
       Whereas more than 50 national organizations concerned about 
     reading and education have joined with the National Education 
     Association to designate March 2, the anniversary of the 
     birth of Theodor Geisel (commonly known as ``Dr. Seuss''), as 
     a day to celebrate reading: Now, therefore, be it

     of the commitment of the Senate to building a country of 
     readers; and
