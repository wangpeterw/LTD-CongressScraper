                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, thank You for giving us another day.
  As the Democratic Caucus prepares to leave for its retreat, bless 
each Member with skills and the vision to fashion pathways to bringing 
about what is needed for the benefit of our Nation.
  Bless the Republican Conference, which remains at the Capitol, with 
the same gifts, consistent with their own defining skills and vision.
  In Your wisdom, bless both parties with the grace that is needed to 
work together to benefit our people. May we all be faithful stewards of 
the Nation bequeathed to us by our American ancestors.
  Please keep all who work for the people's House in good health, that 
they might faithfully fulfill the great responsibility given them in 
their service to the work of the Capitol.
  Bless us this day and every day. May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
