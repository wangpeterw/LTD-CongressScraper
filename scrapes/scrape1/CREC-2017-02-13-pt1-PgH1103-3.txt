                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  During this Black History Month, we are made aware again of the 
history that has formed our Nation and affects us still. With the craft 
of mass communication and the skill of good teachers and of artists, 
You have brought to life again powerful stories of African-American 
heroes, scholars, artists, and outstanding leaders throughout our 
Nation's history.
  Much of this artistry, delightful spirit, strong determination, and 
hard work, was inspired by religious faith in You and the promise of 
the Holy Bible and, in recent decades, for many, the Holy Koran. Their 
witness to undying hope and peaceful resolution carry the hope of 
forming a better United States forever.
  Lord, we praise and thank You for the African-American communities 
across this landscape who have shared our past, bless our present, and 
endow our future with hope, laughter, memorable music, and other 
contributions to our common good. Bless them, and bless our Nation with 
peace and reconciliation.
  And here, in the people's House, may all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
