               PAYING TRIBUTE TO PRIVATE RUDOLPH JOHNSON

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Arkansas native 
Rudy Johnson. Former Private Rudy Johnson will be laid to rest at the 
Arkansas State Veterans Cemetery in North Little Rock this Friday, 73 
years after he was killed in action during World War II.
  Private Johnson was drafted into the Army in 1943 and was assigned to 
the 93nd Division, nicknamed the Buffalo Soldiers and the only African-
American division to see combat in Europe during World War II.
  Rudy was stationed in northern Italy, fighting against German forces 
when his unit reported that he was killed in action in 1945 at the age 
of 20. Private Johnson's remains were finally identified after DNA 
analysis in 2016, and he was flown home this week to rest where his 
journey began.
  Rudy's sacrifice for Arkansas and America will never be forgotten, 
and I join his family and all Arkansans in welcoming him back home for 
his final rest.
