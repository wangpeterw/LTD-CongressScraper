                   THANKING OUR WORLD WAR II VETERANS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Bost) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I had the honor of 
welcoming to Washington, D.C., more than 50 of our Southern Illinois 
veterans. The visit was put together by the Honor Flight of Southern 
Illinois, a nonprofit organization that transports veterans to 
Washington to visit the memorials honoring their service and sacrifice.
  According to the VA, an estimated 640 World War II veterans leave us 
each day. It is time to express our thanks, and that time is running 
short.
  We owe a debt of gratitude to those heroes and those who serve in 
defense of freedom and liberty. I will never forget the opportunity to 
welcome them to this Nation's Capital and thank them for all they have 
done for this country.


         Recognizing McKendree University Women's Bowling Team

  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, today I proudly also recognize the McKendree 
University women's bowling team for winning the 2017 NCAA Women's 
Bowling Championship. These young women made history by becoming the 
first NCAA Division II program to win that championship.
  The Bearcats' 4-0 triumph was also the first sweep in the 14-year 
history of the event. I extend a heartfelt congratulations to the team 
members, coaching staff, school officials, and family and friends on 
this incredible journey. Southern Illinois is proud of you.
  Go Bearcats.
