                    REMEMBERING DR. STEPHEN HAWKING

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary 
life of Dr. Stephen Hawking, who passed away last week at the age of 
76.
  Stephen Hawking was a brilliant student of the universe, a giant of 
the world stage, an inspiration to me personally and to us all. Through 
his discoveries about black holes and quantum mechanics, Professor 
Hawking challenged humankind to ponder the mysteries of the cosmos. He 
was curiosity personified, having once remarked: ``My goal is simple. 
It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and 
why it exists at all.''
  Yet Professor Hawking, who was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou 
Gehrig's disease, at the age of 21, also personified the unconquerable 
human spirit. He took on the challenges of his disability with 
unparalleled tenacity and a trademark sense of humor, all the while 
reminding us ``to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.''
  Mr. Speaker, in short, he was a force of nature. He made a 
difference.
