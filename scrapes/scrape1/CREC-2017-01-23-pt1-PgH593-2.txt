             A POSITIVE MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Friday marked a positive 
new era for American families, as Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 
45th President of the United States, with Mike Pence serving as the 
48th Vice President.
  President Donald Trump and Vice President Pence will work alongside 
Speaker Paul Ryan to create jobs, replace ObamaCare with a patient-
centered alternative, and promote a national defense so that American 
families can be protected, policies that were clearly outlined in his 
inaugural address.
  In an op-ed published in Forbes, President Trump's speech was 
described as ``revolutionary.'' The article went on to detail how ``he 
has defined a new role for the government, for the public, for 
patriotism, for America first.''
  President Trump confirmed: ``This is your day, your celebration . . . 
What matters is that your country is ruled by you, the people.''
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. The hateful 
protesters who assaulted my inaugural guests from New Jersey with water 
balloons will fail again, as President Trump with Speaker Ryan prevail 
creating jobs.
