7089,topic-id,932,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.Langevin) for his dedication to the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and for organizing this Special Order today.  As the 12th Congressional District Representative from North Carolina, as a practicing professional artist, as an arts educator, a curator, and a retired 40-year visual arts professor, I am pleased to join with all of my colleagues expressing my support for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the I want to associate myself with the previous comments made by my colleagues from North Carolina and New Jersey as well.  I have learned throughout my professional arts education and arts management careers that, yes, the arts are nice; but beyond being nice, they are absolutely necessary and essential to enriching our lives.  Artists connect the past to the present. They convey our unique experiences. And they are presented in many forms, sometimes familiar and other times unfamiliar.  A universal language, the arts speak to people everywhere to help them understand diversity and cultures and some of the most complicated issues.  The arts and humanities are critical for adding value to our shared culture. They are not just used to mark celebrations, but to challenge perceptions of society.  Museums function as tools to house and preserve our collective history as a nation and bind us together as one community. Visual artists reflect on our society and they force us to reconcile our past. Writers record history and expose and challenge readers to different ideals presented in our society. Musicians transcend social and cultural boundaries to connect the listener through the sound of their instruments.  Time and time again, we have made a conscious decision to fund the arts and the humanities, signaling that we intrinsically value the arts as being crucial to our collective identity.  The NEA and the NEH have been and continue to be necessary to the success of the arts and humanities in my home State of North As a Representative of Charlotte, one of the largest cities in the South, I understand how important the NEA and the NEH is to Charlotte's unique and thriving art culture.  In 2016, the NEA invested $60,000 in grants in Charlotte for programs such as the Children's Theatre of Charlotte Inc.'s performance of the ``Journey to Oz'' and the McColl Center for Art and Innovation's exhibition and residency featuring Latino and Hispanic artists. NEA grants make these cultural events possible not just in my State, but in States throughout this  The arts not only provide entertainment, but they also encourage us to think critically. Advocates and researchers have shown that the arts have a positive impact on a young person's development. And because of this understanding, the arts and music were included in the Every Student Succeeds Act as part of a well-rounded education.  The NEA is a critical component to ensuring strong arts education in our schools. Through direct grants, the NEA is able to support crucial preschool through 12th grade education projects.  By establishing partnerships with our colleges and universities, the NEA is able to engage with our institutions of higher learning to provide necessary grants to preserve and restore historic works of art.  As a college art professor, I had the privilege of working with the NEA to secure a matching grant, which allowed the college to preserve and restore a historic painting by Aaron Douglas, the father of the Harlem  In order to continue to ensure that our students remain competitive in a global society, we must continue to fund the arts.  In addition to the cultural and educational impact of the arts, they play an important role in helping our veterans transition to civilian life and combat physical and mental illnesses. Through the NEA Military Healing Arts Partnership, the NEA has worked with the Department of Defense to create an art therapy program to treat servicemembers with traumatic brain injuries and associated psychological health issues at the Walter Reed National Military Medical This program places art therapy at the center of a multidisciplinary treatment approach.  Through art therapy, our brave servicemen and -women are able to receive specialized treatment that enable them to heal both their physical and their mental wounds. Participants in the program have found relief and have seen vast improvements in sleep, communication, pain, and their ability to confront emotional challenges. This program has also invested in critical research on the impacts and the benefits of this treatment.  The NEA's budget for fiscal year 2017 was $148 million, just .004 percent of the Federal budget, a small amount.  Through a relatively small investment in the arts, we are able to yield large returns. Not only do the arts serve us culturally in terms of being significant, but the nonprofit arts and the cultural sector is an economic driver, supporting about 4.13 million jobs and contributing to a gross domestic product of 4.2 percent, or about $729 billion.                              {time}  1145  The arts are crucial. They are critical to our culture. They are crucial to our education and to our economy. And in all respects, it is the arts that make us human. So funding for NEA and the NEH must remain in the Federal budget.  I would urge my colleagues to support us in that effort to keep the arts as a viable part of our budget, which means that it will be a viable part of our communities.  I thank the gentleman so much for putting together this Special Order and for allowing me to have input today.  ",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2770-5.txt,2201,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,6.0,August

7283,topic-id,236,"Mr.Speaker, we are here tonight to honor the memory of a legendary Kentucky statesman, a baseball Hall of Famer, a man of this House, and a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Senator Jim Bunning, who recently passed away at the age of 85.  The Members who are joining us tonight, many of them who hail from Senator Bunning's home in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, extend our deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Mary, who was his best friend for many years; his nine children; his 35 grandchildren; and his 21 great-grandchildren.  Those who met Senator Jim Bunning walked away with an impression, and that impression was: That has to be the most competitive person I have ever met.  In a recent op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader, providing a great tribute to Senator Jim Bunning, one of his very best friends, sports marketing executive Jim Host, wrote that Jim Bunning was ``full of integrity'' and, ``the straightest arrow I ever met.''  In that op-ed, he recounted a story where a reporter of the Louisville Courier-Journal wrote that former U.Senator Jim Bunning was ``one of a kind,'' and Jim Host, in remembering his friend, said, ``I agree, but more than that, he was an original. No one in politics in Kentucky or, for that matter, nationwide has been or ever will be like him.''  Mr.Speaker, I yield to Congressman Hal Rogers, the dean of the Kentucky delegation.

7290,topic-id,1040,"Mr.Speaker, when you think about U.Senator Jim Bunning and when you think about his remarkable baseball career before politics, Jim Bunning could have gone anywhere and he could have done anything, but it is important to remember that those early days during his baseball career--and I will have to recount a story that was in that tribute that Jim Host wrote about the Hall of Famer Jim  And he said that, after his career had ended, it had been about 15 years, and he had not yet been named to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the baseball writers, though when he retired, he was second in strikeouts to the famed Walter Johnson, he had won 100 games in both leagues, he had a perfect game in one of those leagues, and he had a no-hitter in the other league.  He had never pitched for a pennant winner.       A prominent sportswriter told me, quoting Jim Host, that      the writers would have never elected him because he never      developed relationships with most of them.       But this wrong was corrected the first year that the old-     timers committee of the Hall could vote on him. Probably his      greatest thrill, other than the birth of his nine children,      was the call he got from Ted Williams and others saying they      were correcting a tragic wrong by voting Jim Bunning into the      Hall of       When he called Jim Host to tell him the news, his voice was      filled with emotion unlike any that he had heard from him      before.  And here is what Jim Bunning said to Jim Host:[[Page H5101]]         I am glad those writers--he used another word--did not vote      me in, being voted in by the players means more anyway.       In his acceptance speech, he attacked the ills in the game      he loved so much that the commissioner and others were not      addressing. The officials of Major League Baseball sat on the      stage quite uncomfortable. Vintage  But you know, after that remarkable baseball career and after that wrong was corrected and he was ultimately voted into the Hall of Fame by the players, he chose to come home to Kentucky where he dedicated his life to his family and to public service.  He served on the Fort Thomas City Council and in the Kentucky State Senate before serving in this body, in the House of Representatives, as a Congressman from Kentucky's Fourth Congressional District, and he did so for six terms in a very distinct fashion.  And he capped off his remarkable career in public service by serving two terms and very consequential terms in the United States Throughout his entire career, he remained a principled conservative, and he was an unrelenting fighter for the causes he believed in and for the people of the commonwealth. Just as he was unafraid to face the boos and the jeers of tens of thousands of opposing fans in Major League Baseball stadiums around the country, Jim Bunning was unafraid to stand alone in Congress for the causes that he felt were right.  And a great example of this--and I like telling this story as the current chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee in this Jim Bunning was a fighter for accountability and transparency of the Federal And when so many just took the Fed for their word, Jim Bunning stood up and he challenged then-Fed Chairman Alan And many of his colleagues looked at him in dismay because they believed that the Fed just deserved deference, and this great economist should always be taken as being right in what he was doing.  But Jim Bunning, in the end, was right, as Fed policies ended up being one of the causes of the Great Recession of 2008. Senator Bunning's legacy lives on in his amazing wife, Mary, and their many children and grandchildren, including his grandson Eric Bunning, who has been an important part of my team since I first took office.  And I just have to tell one story from the campaign trails. Many of my colleagues have told these stories, but I have got to tell one that is personal to me. Jim Bunning was a legend, and we all revered him. And when I made my first run for Congress, it was kind of coming down the home stretch, and we were the underdog, but I really respected Senator Bunning, and I wanted his political experience and his advice.  And as we were going down the home stretch of the campaign--it was a tight election--Jim Bunning approached me at an event, and he said: ``Andy, how are you doing?''  And I said: ``We are doing great. We have got the momentum. We are moving forward, and it is really tightening up, and I really feel like we have got the momentum, and we are going to get over the top.''  And in his way that only Jim Bunning could be, as honest as he was, he said: ``That is not what I hear. I hear you are down by 10 points, and you are going to lose in a landslide.''  Well, as it turned out, a few weeks later, it was a close election, and we only lost that campaign by a few hundred votes. But you know what? Just a few days after that concession speech that I had to give, you know who called? It was Senator Jim  And even though he was certainly candid in that conversation a few weeks before election day, he said: ``Andy, you ran a great campaign. You are a tenacious campaigner. Don't give up. Keep fighting. Be persistent. Do it again. The next time you are going to win.''  And you know, that embodies the character of Jim Bunning: tenacious, persistent, determined, principled, a man of integrity.  And so, Mr.Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in praying for the extended Bunning family as we remember a respected former member of this House and a great  Mr.Speaker, it has been an honor to join many of my colleagues from Kentucky, and all of the other fellow members of this body, to celebrate the life and the legacy of Senator Jim  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5099-2.txt,2238,"PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE",2017.0,22.0,June

7320,topic-id,492,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2866, and I want to congratulate my good friends, Representatives Sewell, Kelly, and Smucker for this legislation to reduce barriers for relative caregivers.  Ironically, in the 1990s, when the crack cocaine epidemic hit, that was the first time that women started using drugs equal to men. It hadn't happened before, and so families fell apart. One of the things that happened, in the early 1990s, was in the middle of the night a grandmother might be called and three grandchildren delivered to her by Children's Protective The grandmother would take the children without any support and without any knowledge of how to deal with the trauma that the children faced.  During those years, we actually discriminated against relatives. We said very negative things about them such as: the apple doesn't fall far from the tree; and, if your daughter wound up on drugs, why should we give the children to you?  So during those years, we would rather pay a stranger--and there can be wonderful foster parents--but a stranger to take care of children instead of families.  One of the things we did in Los Angeles was we organized the grandmothers, and we trained them how to go before the board of supervisors and advocate on their own behalf. That happened all around the country. So there really was a movement of relatives who rose up and said: We want our children; we just need help. We might be on a fixed income, and we can't really support the children.  It is actually more expensive to put a child in foster care. So there began a national movement for relative caregivers to fighting for their rights and for services. So over the years, we really evolved to the point where we have legislation like this where we recognize the benefit of having relatives take care of children.  Ironically, the last piece of legislation we were talking about was about children aging out of the system. Before we prioritized relatives, what would happen is a young child who was aging out of foster care, we would put them on the street, and the first thing they would do would be to go look for their families because they might have family somewhere, and they would often do that.  This legislation, I think, is extremely important to allow flexibility for licensing of relative caregivers. Examples of grandmothers who I worked with directly who wanted to take in their grandchildren but they were told they didn't have enough bedrooms in their house, and so we were going to put the children in more expensive foster care and break them up and send them to different foster homes instead of leaving them with the grandmother or assist her in moving.  So legislation like H.2866, I believe, will begin to address some of these challenges and do what every child needs, which is to be in a loving home with family.

7240,topic-id,673,"Mr.Speaker, right now we are having a fierce debate in the Republican Conference over the Durbin amendment, which is a price control on debit swipe fees. Retailers have claimed that the Durbin amendment is about competition. They have claimed that it is about restoring a broken market. They have claimed that Visa, MasterCard, and issuing banks are engaged in price-fixing on swipe fees.  This is a key element of this debate. A vote to keep the Durbin amendment is a vote that rests on the idea that Members are sure that there is price-fixing in the debit card market. There is $6 billion to $8 billion per year at play here, and the violation of a core free-market principle, which is the notion that government should not be telling people what they can or can't charge.  My point would be that, if you do that, if you support that degree of command and control in the economy, you have got to be sure.  And should we be sure?  I go back to the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlaws price-fixing. This is a criminal law. Hundreds of people have been put in jail for it. You can go to jail for up to 10 years for violating it, and the law has stood for more than 100 years.  Payment networks and retailers have been fighting over whether or not Visa, MasterCard, and issuing banks are violators of the Sherman Antitrust Act for 30 years. And one of the earlier rulings goes back to 1986.  There is ongoing litigation now. In fact, there are more than 15 different cases out there on this. Litigation, I would add, that the retailers have never won when cases went to trial. In the major cases that we have managed to find, they are 0-3.  They are actually in the middle of another big case right now. There was a settlement, and later a higher court set it aside. A sentence of that ruling reads:  ``Discovery included more than 400 depositions, 17 expert reports, 32 days of expert deposition testimony, and the production of over 80 million pages of documents.''  Eighty million pages. I have studied this issue for months, and I have not read 80 million pages. I am a retailer, and I have paid thousands of dollars in swipe fees, so I know the difference between point of sale and Square mobile payments. I have used these systems, but I still don't know.  That is why I oppose the Durbin amendment: because I am not sure that this price control is necessary. Therefore, I put the Federal Government in the role of judge, jury, and executioner for the payment industry. For me to do that, I would have to be sure.  I know that the government wasn't sure when they came up with the regulation. They originally came up with 12 cents per transaction. Then the final rule finally came in at 24 cents.  Were they right the first time?  Were they wrong the second time?  There is no way to know for sure.  I guarantee you that when we walk down to this floor and we vote on this issue and choose to uphold a policy which many free-market think tanks have said harms consumers, Members will not have read 80 million pages. If we are honest with ourselves, most will not have read 80 pages. There is no way we could, given everything that is in front of the Federal Government, even if we wanted to.  Economist F.Hayek got at this in his criticism of the planned economy. He said that socialism doesn't work because of what he called ``the unavoidable imperfection of man's knowledge.''  Hayek was referring to human beings at large. I would offer that the knowledge of politicians--speaking for myself, in particular--must be that much more imperfect.  You don't have to believe that the banks are angels, and you don't have to disbelieve the retailers to oppose the Durbin amendment. You just have to feel a bit of doubt either way.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgH4321-2.txt,,GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEGISLATION,2017.0,18.0,July

Mr.Speaker, now that the gentleman's motion to adjourn has been defeated by a wide, bipartisan majority, the House can get back to work and do the people's business. I want to go back over some statistics we talked about earlier. This rule makes in order for floor consideration 210 amendments which are on top of the 275 amendments that were offered in the Armed Services  Now, let's go back to the days when the NDAA was considered on this floor and this floor was under the majority's control on the other side of the aisle.

In 2010, 129 were offered; only 69 were made in order.  In 2011, 193 were offered; only 82 were made in order.  And we are making in order in this rule, and yesterday's rule, 210. This has been an open process by any measure.  The gentleman also referred to the fact that there are other needs in America that are not being met because we are spending money on defending the United States of  Let me go back and remind what I said earlier. Only 16.8 percent of next year's Federal outlay will go to defending America if we adopt the National Defense Authorization Act as passed by the committee, less than 20 percent. That means almost 85 percent of Federal outlays are going to go to every other thing that we do in government. If there is a problem with something not being paid for, it is not because of the money we are spending on national defense.  Then finally, the gentleman's comments about the need for us to make sure that we are properly authorized as we engage in military activities abroad; I do agree with him. We have had some mission creep over the last several years.

I think that his issue comes within the broader question about the authorization of military force in various parts of the Middle I think he raises an important point. There is an amendment made in order under this rule that will put in place a process to get us to that debate.  I appreciate what he just said. I hope that he will hold that idea, and when we have that debate on the floor, will bring it back so we can consider it among those other items we will consider at that time.

Mr.Speaker, I would like to just take 1 minute to address something the gentleman from Alabama raised a while ago, and that is: Why would we be raising the issue of apprenticeships and workforce training as part of the Defense Authorization bill.  There are a couple of reasons why. One is because we are routinely blocked from bringing any meaningful legislation to the floor, and we are routinely blocked from bringing amendments to the floor that I think can help with this issue.  The gentleman mentioned the action we took in a bipartisan, unanimous way on the issue of Perkins loans and a few other programs. Those are important. But it is the beginning. We need to do much, much more in this country. We need to be able to prepare a workforce that can meet the needs of our manufacturers and be there for the jobs of tomorrow. That is why we brought this up. That is why we are bringing it up in this fashion.  I would just go one step further to say, when we talk about national security, I think we ought to broaden that definition to include not just the number of bombs we have, but the quality of life that our people in this country enjoy: whether or not people have the security of a job, whether they can afford a college education for their kids, whether they can afford to buy a home, whether they can afford to put food on the table.  We live in the richest country in the world, and there are 42 million Americans who are hungry, and yet we somehow can't get the political will to address that problem or fix some of these challenges.  We are going to take any opportunity we have to bring to the floor serious ideas that we think will benefit the American people, uplift the American people, and that is why I think that this bill that we are trying to bring up, H.2933, authored by my colleague, Mr.Pocan, is appropriate.

This is a separate, different vehicle designed to provide for the defense of the American people.  I appreciate the gentleman's comments. We need to take those comments up at another time as we take into consideration other bills that work on our workforce development.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It is that same thinking when it comes to war.

We ought to respect the men and women who we put in harm's way enough to make it a priority in this Chamber, and we don't even talk about it. We can't even bring amendments to the floor to deliberate on that. What we are told is: Well, we will vote on a study, another study. After 16 years? That is the best we can do?

Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Congressional Record a letter from 14 conservative and liberal national organizations opposing a defense bill that busts the budget caps.                                                    July 10, 2017.       Dear Representative McGovern: As organizations representing      Americans across the political spectrum, we are writing to      voice our strong opposition to attempts by Members of      Congress to increase the Pentagon's fiscal year 2018 budget      above both the budget caps set by the Budget Control Act and      the President's budget request. The Pentagon is currently      funded at a higher level than at almost any time since World      War II, and the budget problems it faces should be solved by      better fiscal management, not by adding more money to an      already bloated and wasteful department.       The challenges facing our military are partially the result      of years of failing to make the necessary, tough choices our      nation's security requires. Rather than prioritizing basic      needs of the warfighter, lawmakers have pursued huge,      expensive weapons systems that fail to meet technical      specifications and may never be ready for combat. Waste and      unnecessary overhead abound, with a Defense Business Board      study showing that the Department of Defense could save up to      $125 billion over five years just by eliminating excess      bureaucracy and inefficiencies.       Claims of a so-called ``readiness crisis'' are exaggerated.      As former DoD Comptroller Robert Hale said in February, these      claims are just the services ``putting their worst foot      forward'' in the hopes of securing funding increases. General      David Petraeus has also said that this idea of a readiness      crisis is a myth. By opposing important cost-saving measures      like base realignment and closure which could save several      billion dollars a year just by closing excess infrastructure,      Congress is demonstrating that it is not prioritizing fiscal      responsibility or making the choices that will actually keep      us safe. Moreover, the Pentagon cannot be sure what it is      spending as it is the only federal agency that has never      passed an audit.       Budgets necessitate tradeoffs. Pentagon spending increases      shortchange other important priorities, from domestic needs      including education, health and nutrition and affordable      housing, to paying down the national debt. Further increasing      the Pentagon's budget by tens of billions of dollars without      a clear strategy will do little to solve national security      challenges. Rather, it will simply guarantee further wasteful      spending at the We hope that you will oppose any      attempts to increase the Pentagon's budget for fiscal year      2018.

American Civil Liberties Union,                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2017.     Vote NO on Hartzler Amendment 315 to the NDAA--         Discriminatory and       Dear Representative: The American Civil Liberties Union      (ACLU) is strongly opposed to Hartzler Amendment 315 to      the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018      (NDAA), H.2810. This amendment would bar transgender      members of the Armed Forces and military families from      receiving appropriate and medically necessary health care.      This is a discriminatory, unconstitutional attack on      transgender service members and their families, plain and      simple. It should be overwhelmingly rejected by members of      the House of       Barring access to appropriate and medically necessary      health care, including transition-related care, for      transgender service members and their families is not only      discriminatory, but runs counter to scientific evidence and      contemporary medical standards of care. It also puts the      health of certain service members at needless risk and      undermines the ability of military medical professionals to      provide necessary care for their patients.       There is a clear and overwhelming consensus among the      leading medical organizations--including the American Medical      Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the      American Psychological Association--that transition-related      care is safe, effective, non-experimental, and medically      necessary. If a military doctor determines that transition-     related care (e.g. hormone therapy) is medically necessary      for a transgender service member, then that treatment should      be provided just as it would be for any other medical      condition for any other service member.       Members of the House of Representatives should      overwhelmingly reject this discriminatory attempt to deny      necessary health care to certain service members and their      families. All of the members of our Armed Forces willingly      put their lives on the line in defense of our nation. The      least that Congress can do is ensure that the health care      needs of our service members and their families are being      met.       Accordingly, the ACLU is strongly opposed to Hartzler      Amendment 315 to the NDAA and urges all members to vote      NO on it.       Please contact Ian Thompson, legislative representative.           Sincerely,     Faiz Shakir,       National Political     Ian Thompson,       Legislative  Mr.Mr.Speaker, it is ironic to me that we have time to debate a bill that discriminates against transgender members of the Armed Forces and military families, but we can't find the time to debate war. It really is sad. It is a sad commentary on the way the Rules Committee conducted itself last night.  Mr.Speaker, if the gentleman believes that what we are doing in Afghanistan is consistent with what was envisioned 16 years ago, he can go on thinking that, but it isn't. And if he thinks it is okay that that authorization is used to justify every military involvement we have all around the world, he can go ahead and think that way. I think he is very much mistaken.  Mr.Speaker, Congress has to stop kicking the can down the road. It is unconscionable that the Republican leadership continues to prevent meaningful debate on these wars. But let me say one thing about why our House colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, keep bringing these issues up, despite the opposition from the Republican leadership. And that is because it is our job.  The American people sent us to Washington to debate the uncomfortable issues and to take difficult votes. Now, there were some in Congress--maybe my friend is included in that--who think that it is acceptable to give this administration a blank check to continue these endless wars. Why anybody--no matter who is President, but especially with this President--would feel comfortable giving him a blank check is beyond my comprehension.  There are others who would like to end them and bring our servicemen and -women home. And then there are others who look for a different policy somewhere between these two positions. This is why we need to debate these wars. This is why we need to bring updated AUMFs to the floor for a vote.  If that is a debate that you would rather not have, if that is a vote that you would rather not take, then Mr.Speaker, let me suggest that you should look for a new job. You should go into a different vocation.  I am sure that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that protecting the lives and well-being of our uniform men and women is one of the highest priorities, if not the highest priorities, of this But they deserve more than a ``thank you'' on Veterans  We do not respect their service and sacrifice and that of their families when we refuse to debate and take any responsibility for sending them year after year into war. They deserve a thoughtful, reasoned, and engaged debate. They deserve a debate. They deserve a little attention in this Chamber, not excuses and not more reports and not more, ``We will get to it in the future.''  And that is why, along with many of my Republican and Democratic colleagues, we will continue to demand that the Republican leadership of this House allow a debate and a vote on the future of these wars.  I just want to say, finally, Mr.Speaker, I have been raising this issue not just when Republicans have been President, but when Democrats have been I really believe that Congress has forfeited its constitutional responsibilities. We have abrogated our constitutional responsibilities. We have acquiesced time and time again to Democratic and Republican administrations when it comes to war.  We can't allow that to happen. That is not responsible governing. We have an obligation to make sure that whatever we are doing with regard to our military, that it is the right thing to do.  The idea that we once again come to the floor with the National Defense Authorization bill and we are told we cannot debate any of these things, we can't vote on any of these things, I mean, give me a break. What are you thinking? Why is this such a big, difficult thing to overcome with the leadership?  Again, if my friends don't want to take uncomfortable votes, then do something else. Don't vote. But it is not the right thing to do. We should be ashamed of this process. There is no justifying shutting out debate on war.  Mr.Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and vote ``no'' on the underlying bill, and vote ``no'' on the rule, too.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

7157,topic-id,1241,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman said we can't debate anything.

And that is on top of 275 amendments in the committee of jurisdiction, the Armed Services  This is the most debated piece of legislation we have every year, and it should be for the very reasons the gentleman from Massachusetts itemized, because what we are doing here is of profound importance.  Now, I know that there are other issues that people try to stick into this bill every year that, frankly, distract us from the underlying importance of the bill; and that is, we are trying to do everything we possibly can to protect the American people. The threats the American people face today are more diverse, more profound than we have seen since the end of World War  So, yes, this bill authorizes a lot of very important and expensive things. I acknowledge they are expensive. But it is even more expensive if we don't do them, or don't do them right, and we leave the American people exposed.  Just take into account one of our threats, Kim Jong-un in North That missile test he did recently was an ICBM, an intercontinental ballistic missile. He does not need such a missile to hit South Korea or He needs that missile to hit us, to hit Alaska, to hit the West Coast of the United States, and ultimately to hit the entirety of the United States.[[Page H5782]]  It is a direct threat to the safety of the people of the United This bill authorizes an increase in missile defense, just one of the things that it does.

The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 440 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       Sec 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     2933) to promote effective registered apprenticeships, for      skills, credentials, and employment, and for other purposes.

Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.2933.                                  ____        The Vote On The Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

7037,topic-id,922,"Mr.President, it is my honor today to recognize George Keller II for his outstanding achievements in the areas of engineering, innovation, and leadership. Keller was born and raised in Charleston, WV, and has a bachelor's degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and a master's degree and Ph.in chemical engineering from Pennsylvania State Keller's wisdom is evidenced in his personal life as he has been married to his wife, Judy Keller, for decades, allowing for his legacy to live on through his many children and grandchildren.  Keller served as a lecturer in President Eisenhower's ``Atoms for Peace Program'' in Chemical and Nuclear Engineering from 1958 to 1959. He went on to have an illustrious and highly accomplished 36-year career at the Union Carbide Corporation in research and development at the South Charleston Technical Center and achieved national and international accolades for pioneering contribution in separation science, reaction engineering, catalysis, and novel process technology development.  After retiring from the Union Carbide Corporation, Keller became the cofounder and vice president of New Carbon, LLC, with the purpose of commercializing various aspects of the WVU Chemical Engineering Department's coal to advanced carbon products programs. Keller also inspired leadership under the BIDCO organization for local economic development, which ultimately led to the birth of the Mid-Atlantic Technology Research & Innovation Center, MATRIC, Inc., in 2003. Keller served as MATRIC vice chairman until 2014, as well as MATRIC's chief engineer. He currently serves on the MATRIC board of directors and continues service as the company's chief engineer.  In 1988, Keller was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, NARE, for his invention and insightful analysis of novel separation processes. Recently, Keller was recognized as ``one of the nation's top 100 chemical engineers of the modern era'' by the premier industry association, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers,  He is a recipient of many prestigious awards including the Chemical Pioneer Award by the American Institute of Chemists for his breakthrough work in long-range hydrocarbon technology, as well as the Institute Lecture Award, the Clarence Gerhold Award, and the Institute Award for Excellence in Industrial Gases Technology, all awarded by the The Chemical Engineering Magazine awarded Keller's team with the Kirkpatrick Honor Award for the most innovative chemical technology successfully commercialized in the world: development of highly efficient pressure-swing parametric pumping for gas-gas separations. Pennsylvania State University also awarded Keller with the Outstanding Engineering Alumnus Award in 1989.  George Keller has coauthored and edited more than 35 publications in refereed journals and is the coauthor of two major books in the area of industrial separations. He also holds 21 U.patents in key technologies. Keller has lectured at more than 30 universities around the world and has served as chairman for many prestigious international conferences. At West Virginia University, Keller serves as chair of the visiting committee of the College of Engineering and Mineral Resources, as well as a longtime member of the visiting committees of several chemical engineering departments at WVU, Virginia Tech, Penn State, University of Wisconsin, University of Texas, and University of He has also served on the National Research Council's board on chemical science and technology, BCST, and as an adjunct professor of chemical engineering at WVU and Virginia  In addition to George Keller's many awards, honors, and service, he also has an abundance of major technical accomplishments. Keller was a pioneer in discovering ways for converting methane to hydrocarbon feedstock for the chemical industry and was awarded by the American Institute of Chemists for doing so.  When Keller joined Union Carbide in 1961, he was a trailblazer in implementing amongst the first computer-controlled pilot plants in the industry worldwide. Under his leadership, the separations and process fundamentals skill center developed such disparate processes as the most advanced technology for producing oxygen via miniature adsorption units in the homes of people with severe lung problems in the 1970s, creating a better and longer life for countless millions around the world, and the world's largest commercial pervaporation facility in the 1990s.  Keller's personal expertise in membranes, adsorption, distillation, and extraction operations has resulted in reducing the generation of process wastes, developing more cost-effective ways to treat industrial waste streams, and, in some cases, resulted in recovery of valuable coproducts from traditional waste streams. In addition to his Carbide contributions, Keller has also worked on several next-generation technologies for carbon capture from fossil fuel combustion. His work in this area will be impactful for years to come, especially in industries touched by the development of shale gas in the United  Keller has recruited exceptional, diverse talent to WV and to Union Carbide, including over 100 of the world's premier doctoral-level engineers and scientists. He has served and continues to serve as an excellent mentor to countless individuals. In turn, this aspect of Keller's efforts paid exceptionally rich dividends to Union Carbide and West Virginia in developing and sustaining a world-class, market-driven, R&D technical center at South Charleston for many decades. This culture still lives on today at The company is a growing multidivisional company with long-term strategy levering both market opportunity and its own internal expertise. It is noteworthy that MATRIC has delivered more than $95 million to the West Virginia economy that would never have existed without exceptional leaders like George  It is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the U.Senate to recognize the accomplishments and dedication of George Keller Keller is an excellent example of perseverance and commitment to innovation, enhancing the lives of others and inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgS2678.txt,1676,"FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017",2017.0,2.0,April

7223,topic-id,1351,"Madam President, this Thursday, the Sydney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins is hosting an event that includes a memorial cancer research symposium and a dinner in honor of the late Albert Owens, Jr., who died this past January at the age of 90. It is fitting to pay tribute to Al Owens, who served as president of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and was one of our Nation's pioneering oncologists.  Al Owens was born into a medical family. His father, Albert Owens, Sr., was a dentist; his mother, Grace Masters, was a head surgical nurse at Mount Sinai He originally matriculated to Harvard University, but his college education was interrupted by his service as a medical officer in the Navy during the Korean war. He subsequently earned his bachelor's and medical degrees from the Johns Hopkins University and the school of medicine, respectively.  He joined the faculty in 1956. A year later, McGehee Harvey, who was head of the school of medicine's department of medicine, established a cancer research and treatment division within the department. He asked Al to head the new division. There was a slight problem: The Johns Hopkins Hospital did not have available space. So Al moved inpatient, clinical, and research oncology activities to Baltimore City Hospitals, now Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical He opened Johns Hopkins' first cancer chemotherapy unit at Baltimore City Hospitals in 1961, making it one of the first university-based centers of its kind nationwide. In 1973, Al was named the first director of the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, which had won Federal designation as one of the Nation's first comprehensive cancer centers. In 1977, he moved the center from Baltimore City Hospitals back to the main campus, where it was housed in a brand new facility, named the Oncology Over the next decade, the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center--now named the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center--became one of the most prestigious cancer centers in the country.  Al was named president of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1987, but he relinquished the presidency after only 18 months so that he could devote all of his time to developing a new oncology center for the hospital, but during his brief tenure as president, he decreed that the hospital would become smoke-free. We take smoke-free buildings for granted now; 30 years ago, it was a revolutionary move.  Thanks to Al's tireless devotion, the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Building was completed in January 2000, followed shortly thereafter by the opening of the Bunting Family and Jacob and Hilda Blaustein Family Cancer Research In 2006, the David Koch Cancer Research Building opened. These two research buildings are connected by the Albert Owens Auditorium, which was named in his honor.  Al was a beloved teacher and mentor, as well as a superb doctor, researcher, and administrator. His enthusiasm about cancer research was limitless. He frequently would visit young faculty members--unannounced--asking them to describe the most exciting research project they were working on that day. Al is survived by his wife, Sally MacConnell; children Albert Henry Owens III, Elizabeth Ann Owens, David Tilden Owens, and Sarah Louise Owens;[[Page S3285]]and five grandchildren. The Baltimore Sun ran an obituary at the time of his death; I ask that it be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There is an epitaph to Sir Christopher Wren, who is buried in Paul's Cathedral in London, which he designed. The epitaph reads, ``Si monumentum requiris, circumspice.'' The English translation of the Latin is ``if you seek his monument, look around.'' This is a fitting epitaph for Albert Owens, Jr., too, but it is not just the buildings dedicated to cancer research that you will see. Look around, and you will see people, probably including members of your family and your friends, who are alive today because of Al's unrelenting dedication to finding treatments and cures for cancer. They are his living monuments. I encourage my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this wonderful and extraordinary man.  The material follows:                [From the Baltimore Sun, 26, 2017]Albert Owens Jr., Pioneering Oncologist and Former Hopkins Hospital                             President, Dies       Albert Owens Jr., a pioneering oncologist who helped      establish new ways to fight cancer and was a former president      of Johns Hopkins Hospital, died of congestive heart failure      13 at The Churchville resident was 90.       Born on Staten Island, N.Y., he was the son of a dentist,      Albert Owens Sr., and Grace Masters, a Mount Sinai      Hospital head surgical nurse. He was a graduate of a high      school in Port Richmond, N.      His studies at Harvard University were interrupted by his      Navy service in Korea, and he earned bachelor's and medical      degrees from the Johns Hopkins       He became a Hopkins researcher and worked in liver      metabolism. Hopkins colleagues said that in 1957,      McGehee Harvey, who headed the Hopkins medical department,      created a cancer research and treatment division.       Harvey asked Owens to head the new oncology      division.       ``At first, they gave him a card table, a secretary and a      PH meter,'' said Donald Coffey, a colleague for many      years who is a professor emeritus of urology, oncology and      pathology. ``Up to this time, there was no treatment for      cancer other than surgery and radiation. Al went to work      immediately and started drawing blood from his patients.''       The hospital did not have room for the new treatment      service, and Owens saw his patients and conducted      research at the old Baltimore City Hospitals, now Hopkins      Bayview Medical       ``He found a place in the backwater of the old buildings      there and soon assembled a first-class team,'' said      ``His great genius was his ability to bring great      scientists and clinicians together. He would also say, `We      have to do everything right for this patient.' ''       He recalled Owens as a quiet listener who would talk      about patients as though they were his own children.       ``Al Owens was one of the great figures in cancer. . . . He      should receive a great deal of the credit for what cancer      care and research have become today,'' said William      Nelson, Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center director. ``He was a      wonderfully thoughtful person and was not prone to hyperbole.      He liked people who worked on cancer seriously. And like      great leaders, he distributed the credit.''       A Hopkins statement described Owens as ``a slightly      bashful, bow tie-wearing researcher and clinician.'' In 1973,      he became the first director of the Johns Hopkins Oncology      In 1977, he moved his work back to Hopkins' East      Baltimore campus and a new oncology center. Much expanded,      the facility is now named the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive      Cancer       ``Al was an exceptional leader who believed that the best      way to foster science that would improve patient outcomes was      to put basic scientists and clinicians into the same building      so they would naturally bond as team members sharing      projects, discoveries, frustrations and coffee on a daily      basis,'' Hopkins professor Stuart Grossman said in a      statement. ``He radiated interest and enthusiasm when it came      to cancer research and frequently dropped unannounced into      the offices of young faculty members, asking them to describe      the most exciting research project they were working on that      day.''       Owens was named Johns Hopkins Hospital president in      1987 and held the post for 18 months. He then resumed his      work fighting cancer, but not before he instituted a smoke-     free policy throughout the hospital. An auditorium at the      medical campus is named in his honor.       ``Owens was not only a superb oncologist and mentor,      but a first-rate gentleman,'' David Ettinger, Hopkins      professor of oncology, said in a statement.       Owens was a past president of the Maryland division of      the American Cancer Society, the Association of American      Cancer Institutes and the American Society of Clinical            Owens resided at Medical Hall, a historic Churchville      home, where he cultivated bee colonies.       Plans for a memorial service at Johns Hopkins Hospital are      pending.       Survivors include his wife of 20 years, Sally      MacConnell, a Johns Hopkins administrator; two sons, Albert      Henry Owens III of Washington, N.J., and David Tilden Owens      of Minneapolis; two daughters, Elizabeth Ann Owens of      Baltimore and Sarah Louise Owens of England; and five      grandchildren.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgS3284-2.txt,,TRUMPCARE,2017.0,6.0,April
7271,topic-id,617,"Mr.President, July 18, 2017, marks the 70th anniversary of the day that the ship Exodus 1947 arrived in Haifa,  The story of Exodus 1947 is as important today as it was 70 years ago. In 1947, the world was horrified and outraged by the British policy of violently preventing Holocaust survivors from reaching Palestine and forcing their return to Europe and refugee camps in Watching the British Navy ram the Exodus 1947, which had 4,515 Holocaust survivors on board, inflamed world opinion and prompted the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, UNSCOP, to scrutinize the actions of the Eventually the British were forced to end their policy of preventing Jewish immigration to Israel, and the State of Israel was born.  Why is the story of the Exodus 1947 so important that we are still talking about it 70 years later? After all, geopolitical transitions have launched multiple large-scale refugee migrations around the world in the 20th century, including Armenians in 1915, Russians in 1917, Chinese in 1949, Hindus from Pakistan and Muslims from India in 1947, East Germans between 1945 and 1961, Bosnians in the 1990s, Rwandans in 1994, Syrians in 2016--and many more.  The story of the Exodus 1947 is important to remember and consider today because it reminds us of our responsibility to protect human rights, help people outside of our own borders, stand up for Americans values, and work with our allies and international organizations to advance our goals. It reminds us that our work is not finished. It reminds us that, while it was the Jews on the Exodus 1947 70 years ago, political outrages around the world continue to require our leadership and our action.  As a U.Senator from Maryland and vigilant friend of the Chesapeake Bay and Maryland's Maritime history, I would like to highlight the fact that, prior to its service in support of Jewish refugees from the Holocaust, the Exodus 1947 was called the President Warfield and it sailed the Chesapeake Bay for the Baltimore Steam Packet The President Warfield changed hands many times, from the Baltimore Steam Packet Company to the British Navy to the U.Navy to the Potomac Shipwrecking Company, which was actually acting as clandestine purchasing agents of the Haganah who wanted the[[Page S2609]]ship because the conditions that made it ideal for navigating the Chesapeake Bay, shifting sand of 3 feet or less in depth, made it ideal for getting immigrants quickly and closely up to the coastal areas of  After the Haganah secured the ship, she was retrofitted in Baltimore from where she sailed towards France to pick up 4,515 Holocaust the refugees and deposit them in Palestine--a plan which was destroyed after the British rammed the ship, prevented the refugees from disembarking in Palestine, detained them in inhumane conditions, and eventually returned them to  The world witnessed the inhumane treatment of the Exodus's passengers and some righteous people cried out. We continue to talk about the Exodus 1947 to remind ourselves never to forget both our suffering and our empowerment.  I would like to acknowledge all who have made the creation of this memorial possible.

And she described kind of what her life had been before she became an artist.  We know the economic impact of the arts. In my congressional district,[[Page H2774]]there are 1,340 arts-related businesses that employ almost 7,000 people. We spend in this country a very modest amount, .004 percent, so four one-thousandths of 1 percent is the budget of the National Endowment for the So it is a very modest budget.  Forty percent of the programming for the National Endowment for the Arts supports activities in high-poverty areas. So the contributions it makes are enormous to our economy. For every dollar that is invested in the arts, it yields $51 in economic activity. So there are tremendous economic benefits to this.  In addition to that, as was referenced by Representative Price from North Carolina, arts, culture, and creativity are essential parts of the job skills for the 21st century. People want to employ people who are entrepreneurial, creative, problem-solving; and arts and music are some of the best vehicles to develop those skills.  So it is something which is important to the future economy of our country, to the kind of civilization that we will be a part of. It adds to the lives of everyone that we will represent.

7112,topic-id,1150,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman, my good friend, for yielding me the time and for those incredibly gracious and generous remarks.  Mr.Speaker, I certainly rise to support the rule and the underlying legislation. By the very nature of Rules debates, everything seems to be partisan because it seems to be sort of shirts and skins as it is on the rules. The reality is the legislation we are talking about has actually been requested by both parties. We had both the chairman and the ranking member in there requesting because they are working together in a bipartisan way to produce a major piece of legislation that will direct spending for the United States government in the range of about $1 trillion between now and September 30.  The important thing to note is that it is a very bipartisan negotiation between two very skillful legislators, Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Nita When they bring that legislation to the floor, as they will next week, it is going to have some pretty important and pretty major things on it.  We are not only going to adequately fund our military, we are going to increase that. We are going to give the President some things he has asked for in terms of supplemental money for defense to upgrade and improve our military.                              {time}  0930  We are going to give him some additional things for border security as well that, again, both parties have agreed on. I think we all want secure borders. We know there is always some debate about exactly how or what we should do, but, in this case, we have a bipartisan agreement.  We will actually give a very substantial increase to the National Institutes of Health, which, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions) mentioned, great work is done on behalf of the American people in that institution. Frankly, it has been Republicans that first doubled that back in the late 1990s and early 2000s and now have reignited the biomedical research engine by putting additional resources in there. It is[[Page H2949]]something our friends support, but actually it was Republicans who took the initiative to achieve.  We will see some really important increases in some education programs that give some of our less advantaged citizens opportunities to go: TRIO, GEAR Both prepare individuals for higher education and then have a chance to exploit the opportunity when it comes.  So that bill will have a lot of good things in it that will be bipartisan. My good friend from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern) mentioned--and I think appropriately so--that there is a certain amount of dysfunction in the appropriations process. Where we probably disagree is--I have got to tell you, it is not new. Since we passed the Budget Control Act over 40 years ago in 1974, budgets and appropriations have been completed on time exactly four times. It didn't matter who was in charge. So maybe we ought to go back and look at that defective process that was set in motion by our friends back when they controlled both Chambers in overwhelming numbers and rethink how we do this.  I do agree with the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern) that it is important to focus on first things first. And while tax reform is a very important goal that, I think, this Congress will achieve and while health care is a very important goal, which I certainly hope this Conference achieves and I think we are working toward, there is no question the most important thing we do around here is fund the government every day. We make sure that our military has what it needs to protect us and that our border control officials have what they need to make sure they are secure, that we do things like look for cures for Alzheimer's and cancer at the To me, that always is the most important thing it has to do.  So, in this bill and in the bill that will follow next week, we are actually doing what we should do. We are putting first things first. Let's make sure these basics are done for the American people, and then let's get about the important business of changing their Tax Code and making sure that they have the best health care in the world.  In my view, Congress could have--and to my friend's point--could have and should have done this months ago. It is important to note that the Appropriations Committee had reported out all 12 of the bills that fund the day-to-day operation of the budget. Five of them actually moved across the floor. We did run into problems in the United States Senate where there was a lot of obstruction, but the Appropriations Committee did its job. We just have to now, as a Congress, do our job and make sure those bills get to the floor in a timely manner, and that we do the right thing so that they pass.  The Appropriations Committee can only prepare them. They don't get to schedule them on the floor. They don't get to move them across the floor. That has to be done with all sides working together for the good of the American people.  Again, it is worth noting that we can do this process. Two years in a row, we have done all 12 bills. So I would hope in the future, as we make these decisions--and my friend is right, a decision was made in November or It is not one I agreed with--to wait and say let's let the new administration have some input on this. Now, there is certainly nothing wrong with that.  The new administration wants to come in, and there is a vehicle called a supplemental, where, if they want to tweak the budget, they can do that and they can bring it to the floor, and that is what we should have done. But we shouldn't ask them to write the budget for the very year in which they show up. They simply don't have their people in place. They are not ready to do that. They have got to get their Cabinet appointed. So I would hope, in the future, we remember that and do first things first.  Still, it is never too late to do the right thing, as my mom used to say. And the right thing to do today is to pass this rule, pass this bill, give our friends, the appropriators, the time that they need to negotiate a final bill. I am confident we will do that; I am confident we will do it on a bipartisan basis, Mr.Speaker; and I am confident we will be back here with a bill the American people can be proud of because that will have been negotiated in good faith, it will be bipartisan, and it will give us the stability that we need from now until September 30.

7315,topic-id,661,"Mr.President, today I am pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, in introducing the Reach Every Mother and Child Act of 2017. Our legislation would make it the policy of the United States to lead an effort to end preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, and young children in the developing world by 2030.  Due in part to American leadership and generosity, many lives have already been saved. Since 1990, the annual number of deaths of children under the age of five has been cut in half. Nevertheless, far too many mothers, newborns, and young children under the age of five still succumb to disease and malnutrition that could easily be prevented, if only we could reach the mothers and children with simple, proven, cost-effective interventions that we know will help them survive.  Every day approximately 800 women will die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. In addition, more than 16,000 children under the age of five will die each day of treatable conditions such as prematurity, pneumonia, and diarrhea--with malnutrition being the underlying cause in nearly half those deaths.  According to USAID, a concentrated effort could end preventable maternal and child deaths worldwide by the year 2030; however, U.leadership and support of the international community are critical to success.  To achieve this ambitious goal, our bill would require the implementation of a strategy to scale up the most effective interventions to save as many lives as possible. This idea is central to our bill. We do not have to guess at what interventions will work--the reality is that more than 16,000 children under 5 years old die each day of conditions we know today how to treat.  These life-saving interventions include clean birthing practices, vaccines, nutritional supplements, hand-washing with soap, and other basic needs that remain elusive for far too many women and children in developing countries. This must change.  In addition, our bill would establish a Maternal and Child Survival Coordinator at USAID who would focus on implementing the ten-year strategy and verifying that the most effective interventions are being scaled up in target countries.  The bill would also establish an interagency working group to assist the Coordinator in promoting greater collaboration among all the federal agencies involved in this effort.  To promote transparency and greater accountability, our bill requires that detailed reporting be published on the Foreign Assistance Dashboard, where it can be assessed by the public, Congress, and non-governmental organizations to track the implementation of the strategy and the progress being made.  Finally, our bill would encourage USAID to pay for successful programs run by non-governmental entities. The message we want to send to all our partners in the private sector, the non-profit sector, the faith community, and in local and international civil society groups is this: if you can figure out a way to increase the likelihood that mothers and their children will survive childbirth and the first five years of life, we want to reward you for your contribution.  Improving the health and well-being of mothers and children around the world has far-reaching social and economic benefits as well. An independent group of economists and global health experts from around the world, known as the Lancet Commission, found that for every $1 invested in health initiatives in the developing world, there is a return of $9 to $20 in growing the gross domestic product of the country receiving the investment.  Other bipartisan initiatives, such as the successful President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which was started by President George Bush, demonstrate that results-driven interventions can turn the tide for global health challenges. Applying lessons learned from past initiatives, our bill would provide the focus and the tools necessary to accelerate progress toward ending preventable maternal and child deaths.  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Coons and me in supporting this bill to save the lives of mothers and children around the world.[[Page S4775]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4769.txt,2121,FUND THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES,2017.0,2.0,May

Before coming to Congress, I worked for my dad in our family homebuilding business, and I have great respect for the work their members do in our communities. They truly are job creators, economic drivers, and dream makers.

When it comes to homebuilding and homeownership, we all share the same goal--let's keep home prices affordable.  Their advocacy has enabled millions of American families, like mine, to make one of the most important purchases of their lives: a home.

A lifelong resident of Rockford, Mickey Goral grew up on Rockford's west end graduated from Boyland High School and Northern Illinois University with a B.in political science. He served on the county board for 18 years before being elected Rockford township supervisor and has held that post for 20 years.  At 63 years young, Mickey decided not to seek reelection, but refuses to use the word ``retirement.''

His mission was always clear and simple: treat all people with respect, dignity, and compassion in providing basic human needs to families while they are on the road to self-sufficiency, and that is what he did. Mickey's years of service to the people of Rockford show that public service can make a real difference in people's lives.

We need more people like Mickey  I especially want to thank Mickey's wife, Tami, and twin daughters, Karley and Kiley, for sharing so much of their husband and father with the community.

7203,topic-id,938,"Mr.President, I rise to introduce the Gun Violence Prevention Order Act of 2017: At this time, I would also like to thank Senators Blumenthal, Gillibrand, and Markey for cosponsoring this legislation. Their support is sincerely appreciated.  Yesterday marked the 3rd anniversary of the horrific shooting that outraged the community of Isla Vista, California and the During this attack, the City of Isla Vista was struck by tragedy when 22-year-old Elliot Rodger went on a shooting rampage after fatally stabbing his two roommates and a friend. Armed with a Glock 34 handgun and two SIG Sauer P226 handguns, the assailant drove through the streets of Isla Vista, shooting and killing 3 young students and injuring 14 others near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus before taking his own life. The Isla Vista community was in shock, and we as a nation struggled to comprehend how this tragedy could have been prevented.  As more facts emerged about the assailant, we learned that he had a history of mental health concerns and violent behavior. He had been prescribed medications used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and at age 18 Rodgers had begun to refuse the mental health treatment he had been receiving. Local deputies had also encountered him several times through conflicts and fights he had with friends and roommates. And less than a month before his deadly rampage, a concerned friend had called a county mental health staff member, and, after speaking with the assailant's mother, law enforcement conducted a welfare check at Rodger's apartment. At that point, Rodger's murderous plot was well underway, and had the police searched his room, they would have found a stockpile of guns and ammunition along with papers detailing his plans to kill. This individual should have never been able to obtain a firearm--and the bill I am introducing today would enable law enforcement and family members to intervene and prevent attackers like this assailant from carrying out atrocious acts of gun violence in the future.  Over 30,000 people die each year from gun violence, and on average, 7 children and teens are killed by guns every day. We know that families and friends are in the best position to recognize early signs of trouble before tragedy occurs. However, family members and law enforcement officials commonly have no legal means of taking preventive steps to stop a troubled individual from committing an act of gun violence before it occurs. To solve this problem, the State of California enacted a law in the aftermath of the Isla Vista attack that enables family members or law enforcement officers to ask a court for a gun violence prevention order.  Modeled on California's existing laws on domestic violence, when a judge believes there is sufficient evidence that an individual is a danger to themselves or others, the gun violence prevention order temporarily prohibits an individual from purchasing firearms or ammunition. And under a higher burden of proof, a court can also issue a warrant to remove any firearms or ammunition already in the individual's possession. Based on this California law and other State laws, the Gun Violence Prevention Order Act of 2017 would create a new law enforcement grant under the Community-Oriented Policing Services Program at the Department of Justice and incentivize States to take intervening measures to prevent gun violence. Specifically, this legislation would ensure that families and others can seek a gun violence prevention order from a court to temporarily stop someone close to them who poses a threat to themselves or others from purchasing a firearm. This legislation also ensures that a court can issue a gun violence prevention warrant requiring law enforcement to take temporary possession of firearms that have already been purchased if the court determines that the individual poses a threat. Because criminal background checks are critical to preventing gun crimes, this legislation also requires the Department of Justice and comparable state law enforcement agencies to keep their background check databases up to date and requires courts to notify these agencies when a gun violence prevention order is issued.  Importantly, this legislation also protects due process rights by providing written notice and multiple opportunities for the court to make independent determinations on the matter.  Additionally, the Department of Justice and State law enforcement agencies would be required to protect the affected individual's confidentiality. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the victims and survivors of the Isla Vista attack and what this legislation means to their community. Many of the victims and survivors of this attack were students and young adults. They had their whole lives ahead of them. As communities across California and our Nation mark the third anniversary of this terrible tragedy, let us remember the lives of Weihan Wang, Cheng Yuan Hong, George Chen, Veronika Weiss, Katherine Cooper, and Christopher Michaels-The[[Page S3148]]families of these victims will never be the same again, and I will never forget hearing their stories in the aftermath of this attack. As a mother and grandmother, I cannot imagine the pain they have gone through. As the elected leaders of this body, we must never forget what happened in Isla Vista and take steps to keep our communities safe from the gun violence that continues to endanger them. We have seen the costs of inaction, and the Gun Violence Prevention Order Act of 2017 is a step we can take to protect communities across America and ensure that other communities do not experience the pain that Isla Vista went through. I hope my colleagues will join me in remembering the victims of this attack and supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3147.txt,1332,"FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017",2017.0,24.0,June
7188,topic-id,326,"Mr.Speaker, while our Nation faces many challenges, perhaps none is more pressing than that of growing our economy. The positive impact of strong, sustained economic growth has the potential not only to help families make ends meet, but it will also address the many other pressures we face. The time is now for Congress and this administration to act on meaningful tax reform.  The model is simple and straightforward. We need to simplify the ridiculously complex Internal Revenue Code, eliminate the loopholes that allow corporations and individuals to avoid paying their fair share, lower the rates for middle class families and small businesses, and broaden the tax base.  As a certified public accountant, an independent voice for the people of Bucks and Montgomery Counties, I intend to push vehemently to make tax reform a reality in this Moreover, this can and must be a bipartisan priority.  A 1.5 percent growth in GDP is simply unsustainable. If that trend continues, we will not be able to fund priorities such as bolstering our national security, taking care of our veterans, combating the addiction crisis, funding public education, preserving our environment, and a whole host of other priorities.  Economic growth has three essential aspects: tax reform, regulatory reform, and a balanced budget. The REINS Act and the upcoming vote on the CHOICE Act will start this process on the regulatory side, which will revive the ability of community banks to support local economies and advance infrastructure investment that puts Americans back to work by rebuilding roads, schools, bridges, as well as our IT infrastructure and the electrical grid.  The other critical component is tax reform, and we owe it to the American people to get this done. I call on my good colleagues from both sides to put politics aside and do what we were sent here to do, and that is to stand up for hardworking families and unleash the power of the American economy.

7094,topic-id,820,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for yielding and for leading this important conversation.  We come here today to call attention to a misguided turn that this administration proposes to take in our country's cultural history.  I am the only Ph.D physicist in Congress, so I frequently come to the floor to speak out in defense of science and scientific research, but I am here today[[Page H2776]]for another reason, to call attention to the grave threat that President Trump's budget poses to the future of our country's arts and culture.  What is it that makes a country great; and how will our country be viewed a generation from now, a century from now, or in the next millennia?  To answer this question, we can only look to the great nations of the past. Why was Athens great in a way that Sparta never was?  Why is Florence, under the Medici, revered and remembered in a way that its forgotten competitors never are?  It is because, after they defended their homeland, after they conquered their rivals in war, after they triumphed in commerce, those countries invested a significant fraction of their national wealth in things that had nothing to do with material conquest.  The Medici supported the science and the art of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and the Renaissance masters; and Athens supported the immortal accomplishments of the Greek storytellers, historians, artists, and philosophers, and that is what made them great.  For many decades, our country has supported the arts and humanities through the National Endowments for the Arts and the Now our President has proposed a budget that would cut these Endowments completely in favor of more defense spending and a useless wall on our southern border.  The National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities provide critical funding for students and organizations throughout the country, including in my district in His budget proposes that we wipe them away completely. These cuts might make the President feel like a hero in the short term, but they will be a disaster for our country's place in human history.  Programs that support understanding of the arts and humanities play a vital role in our society. They give us knowledge and a shared cultural base that we rely on every day, regardless of what career we go into. And they also help children and students of all ages embrace the complexity and the wonder of humanity.  History, literature, and the arts connect us to a common past and allow us to explore our differences and to understand places beyond our own imaginations. Simply put, the arts and humanities teach us how to be compassionate and understanding toward other people. This is what makes America truly great.  The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities help show us what it means to be human because, regardless of who you are and what you do, knowledge, empathy, and compassion are the national values and the human values that we need to defend, not with bombs and fighter jets, but with sustained support and the cultivation of knowledge and culture.  Now, for most of my career in science, I worked at Fermi National Accelerator The founding director of Fermilab, Robert Wilson, spoke eloquently about this over 40 years ago. Bob was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project and who walked away from his security clearance and dedicated his life to pure science, to building giant accelerators, experiments, international collaborations at Fermilab to explore the fundamental properties of matter.  He was also an artist who, after he made all of the magnets and particle accelerators, then filled his laboratory with graceful and imaginative art.  In 1969, he was called to testify in front of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to answer why it was that we were spending all of this money at Fermilab during the Cold War and what all this had to do with the national defense.  Robert Wilson looked the committee in the eye and said that all of the work at Fermilab, driven by natural human curiosity, has nothing at all to do with the national defense except, perhaps, to make our country more worth defending.  So I would hope that a President so bent on building his wall and increasing our defense budget by over $50 billion, to the detriment of funding for education, science, and the arts, would pause for a moment and heed those words from history so that a century from now, when our children and grandchildren look back on this time in our country's history, they will see that the human values of our country were always what made it more worth defending, in part, because of the greatness that the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities have sustained for decades.

7098,topic-id,1352,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues who, for the last hour, have talked about an extremely important part of America's social fabric: the Scouting programs of I thank them for bringing to Congress and to the American people the importance of Scouting at all levels. And for those of us who have achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, much was discussed.  Equally important are the men that enter and only spend a couple of weeks and do not pass beyond the Tenderfoot level because they, too, have achieved, at least in part, the opportunities that Scouting presents.  I will talk about that more in the future, and I will look forward to that discussion. In the meantime, let's see if we can now talk about other things that are before Congress and the American public.  Mr.Speaker, almost unnoticed as a result of all of the issues--all of the controversies surrounding the President here in the United States, the controversies of Russia and Russia's involvement in the election, the firing of Comey and the investigations now conducted by a new special counsel, and, of course, the President's foreign travels, with all of that, we have basically not heard much about another extremely important and quite possibly a much longer lasting thing that has happened.  Today the President presented his budget. A budget presented by the President is often just waved aside by the Congress and considered to be dead on arrival, and surely this one should be. But I want to back up for a moment and I want us all to ponder exactly what it is that the President has proposed.                              {time}  1900  Because, you see, the budget, whether it is a Democratic budget or a Republican budget, an Obama budget or a Trump budget or a George H.Bush budget, those budgets are a statement of priorities. They are a statement of the value, the values that is what it is that the President thinks is important and how that fits into the American society.  We need to really understand and value the statement that the President, President Trump, has made in presenting to us his priorities. We ought not just wave it aside and say it is of no consequence because, after all, we are going to rewrite it and we are going to write our own, which is the tradition. However, it would be a gross mistake not to analyze what it is that the President of the United States of America, the strongest, the wealthiest country in the world, has proposed.  Take a careful look, Don't just brush it aside. This is what the President wants. This is what he wants us to be. This is his vision of  I must tell you, it is awful--not my words only, but the words of many Republican leaders, of, obviously, the  Take a look, America, at what it is he is proposing.  I am going to run through some of this because we need to understand, Members of Congress, we Americans need to understand what it is that this President wants us to be, what it is he sees as I am going to go through just some things very, very quickly, and then we want to go into it perhaps in a little more detail.  Medicaid is a program that has been in existence for some 60-plus years. It is a program that provides healthcare to the poor. It is a program that provides care to seniors. It is a program that is relied upon all across this country by families so that the children and adults can get medical care.  The President has proposed, in his budget, a $610 billion reduction in Medicare on top of, in addition to, an $800 billion cut in what we know now as Trump and RyanCare, the repeal of the Affordable Care A $1.5 trillion reduction in medical services to the poor. And they are not all kids. They are not all families. More than half of that money goes to seniors in nursing homes.  This is the vision of the President of the United States: $1.5 trillion reduction in medical services over the next 10 years to working men and women just above the poverty level, to seniors who are in nursing homes, and to women and children who are below the poverty level. This is his vision of healthcare in  And that is not all. That is not the end of the story.  In the 1990s, we knew that children not covered by Medicaid or, in California, Medi-Cal were not getting medical services; and so the American people, through their representatives in[[Page H4497]]Congress and the Senate, created what we now know as the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP--Children's Health Insurance  And so what is the vision? What is the value? What is the moral purpose of our President?  He would cut $3.2 billion out of that program and effectively deny medical services for the 6 million children that are currently covered by the Children's Health Insurance  For the aged, blind, and disabled--the aged, blind, and disabled Americans--that receive supplemental Social Security programs, $64 billion would be cut from those aged, blind, and disabled who receive supplemental Social Security insurance.  Students? How many times on this floor of the House of Representatives have we heard Democrats and Republicans talk about the terrible problem of student loans, the huge cost of providing educational services? So what is in this budget?  Student loans, financial aid, and repayment, $143 billion reduction. How does that help our educational program? How does that help students who are suffering under the cost of higher education? I don't know what the answer is except it does not.  For men and women who are working at minimum wage or below minimum wage across the United States, there is a program that was established by Richard Nixon called the earned income tax credit to encourage people to work. Men and women that are out there working but at a low wage, minimum wage, the earned income tax credit was established to lift them up to a liveable amount of money and encourage them to continue to work.  What does the President propose? Well, let's cut, by $40 billion, the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit.  It goes on and on. This is President Trump's statement of what he values in  I think it is immoral. I think it is terrible public policy, and, when coupled with the rest of the story, it becomes an abomination.  The rest of the story, the rest of the story is the most massive tax cut ever for the wealthy in the United You take that tax cut that has been proposed in the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, and you couple it with the tax cuts that are embedded in the President's budget, and we are talking somewhere north of $3.5 trillion tax cuts, 80 percent of which goes to the top 20 percent of America's income earners.  All the discussion last year about income inequality from President Trump, from Hillary Clinton, from everybody else about income inequality and the problem it presents to America was somehow forgotten. Because, when you take the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which some call the American Health Care Act now, and you couple it with this budget, the tax cuts that are embedded in both of them amount to the largest transfer of wealth ever in tax policy from the poor, from the working Americans, to the top earners in America, to the superwealthy.  If you are concerned about income inequality, this is exactly backwards. It is from the working men and women, the middle class of America and the poor to the wealthy. That is exactly what is happening here.  Is that a rational vision of America? Is this a sense of value of what America is all about: more for the wealthy, less for the working men and women, the middle class, for the families that presumably--presumably--were at the heart of last year's election?  Yes, we heard Mr.Trump and we heard ",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgH4496.txt,1973,HAPPY 75TH BIRTHDAY EARL F. HILLIARD,2017.0,23.0,June
7287,topic-id,971,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to talk about my good friend, Senator Bunning, a mentor to me. I first came across Senator Bunning when I was a young boy watching baseball and watching him pitch for the Detroit Tigers and for the Philadelphia But I really got to know them--and when I say ``them,'' it is because most of us from Kentucky cannot talk about Jim Bunning without saying Jim and It is just Jim and They were grammar school sweethearts. I think the only people they ever dated were each other.[[Page H5100]]  It was wonderful to see Mary the other day, unfortunately under these circumstances, but a wonderful lady.  I have a couple of stories. When I first thought I might run for public office for the State senate--and my now 23-year-old was 5, and I had a 3-year-old son--I went to Oldham County, Kentucky, to meet Jim And, of course, you show up, there is Jim and And she said: ``Are you going to be our candidate in the 32nd District?''  And I said: ``Well, I just don't know. I am really concerned about it. I have got a young family.''  And she looked at me and she said: ``Young man, I have raised nine kids''--I think at that point 20-something grandkids--``we have done politics, we have done baseball, city council.'' She went through a whole list of things. And I will never forget she said: ``You are worried about your family because of the experiences that you have had, and you want them to have the same kind of experiences, but you have got to take your family and make your family experiences. Our kids have gotten to do things no other kid has gotten to do because of the positions and the things that we have done as a family.''  You know, when you start to run for office, you kind of want to talk yourself out of it. So I will never forget driving back home convinced that, yes, I am going to run for this office. I walked in, and the first thing my wife said is: ``Guess what. We are going to have our third child.''  I guarantee you, if I had not had that conversation with Mary Bunning, and after my wife telling me during the time of that decision we are going to have another one--now our 19-year-old--I wouldn't have moved forward.  My other story is Senator Bunning took me under his wing. I won my first race by 130 votes out of 27,000 cast. Jim Bunning was running in a fight for his life for the U.Bob Dole comes to Bowling Green, Kentucky, to have a rally for Senator Bunning, and he wanted me to speak. Well, then we see people around town like this that are operatives for our parties, and this one guy says: ``No State, no local candidates. Only Federal candidates can speak.''  I had to leave the podium because this young, 25-year-old guy said that. And Jim Bunning looks over--and they are all there for his rally--he says: ``If he is not speaking, I am not speaking.''  So the next thing I know, I got on the agenda. They said: ``Three minutes.''  So I had my 3-minute talk.  The final thing I want to say is that one of my favorite Jim Bunning stories is he did not like to sign baseballs made in That was just his thing. He didn't want to sign a baseball made in China, which I didn't know that, but I had two major league baseballs for my two oldest kids to get them signed. He was going to be in Bowling Green, I show up there. And on the way, my youngest daughter, which we didn't think even cared, started crying. Well, to buy a real major league baseball in Bowling Green, Kentucky, at the last minute is not very easy to do. So we went by Walmart, picked up just a little official league ball. And I walked to the restaurant and I hand Jim the first ball. He signs it. The second one, he signs it. The third one--and it is in my office today, because I may have the only one--he picks it up and he points to the ``China'' imprinted on the ball and just gives me this look like only he could give. And fortunately Mary was there, and she says: ``Jim, you are signing that ball for that little girl.'' So I now have it in my office in the Rayburn building, a Jim Bunning baseball that says ``Made in China'' on it. It is something I cherish.  His granddaughter has interned in my office, and she is a chip off the old block, both her grandmother and grandfather. During the spring, we were getting a lot of phone calls in our office because of some of the actions here on the House floor. She was wonderful and mature beyond her years at 20 or 21 years old.  So the old right-hander, as Mr.Hal Rogers said, is somebody we miss, is somebody that is important to me, somebody that leaves a fantastic legacy in Washington, in Major League But far more important, if you had the opportunity to go to the funeral home, just looking at those nine children, and with over 30-something grandchildren and now into the great-grandchildren, that is his legacy. His legacy is his family, and there is no other way he would want it from that first few days in grammar school when he first met his wife, Mary, till today. It is just a legacy that all of us should strive to have.  We love him. We are going to miss him. And we certainly love his wife, Mary, and his family.                              {time}  1715  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5099-2.txt,1922,FUND THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES,2017.0,22.0,July
7328,topic-id,814,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute to William Barclay Bates, a father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and veteran of the Second World Bill, as he liked to be called, passed away last December in Jackson, WY, at the age of 91. Next week, his family will gather at Wyoming Veterans Cemetery in Casper, WY, to commemorate his life and honor his contributions to our country. I wish to add a few words to what they will say about this brave and stalwart man.  Bill's life story typifies many of his generation. He was born on December 14, 1924, in Los Angeles, CA, to Jeffrey Otto and Clara Virginia His father, Jeff, served in the American Expeditionary Force in Russia during[[Page S3240]]World War His mother, Clara, was a telephone operator. When Bill was 5, he moved with his family to McAlester, This was during the middle of the Great Depression, and times were tough. Bill's father owned a radio repair shop and later ran a roller rink to provide for the family. As Bill said some years later, ``We never had much money, but neither did anyone else. We never missed any meals, but we ate a lot of beans, and a soup bone on Sunday was a real treat.''  In September 1941, at the age of 17, Bill enlisted in the It was 3 months before Pearl After basic training, Bill applied for and was accepted to airplane gunnery school. Following completion of his training, a request came in for a gunner for a group headed to As Bill later told the story, his captain ``flipped a coin between two candidates, me and Bill I lost and Bill Haygood went to North Africa and was killed within six weeks. A flip of a coin decided that I would live through the war.''  Instead of going to Africa, Bill was sent to Europe with the Eighth Air Force, 446th Bomb The 446th Bomb Group, which came to be known as the Bungay Buckaroos, led the Eighth Air Force on the first heavy bomber mission on D-Day, June 6, 1944, and later supported Allied ground forces as they moved east toward Berlin through France and  Bill served as a waist gunner and flew missions in B-17s and B-24s. In total, he flew 33 combat missions. This was very dangerous work. Of his original flight crew, only Bill and one other were still alive at the war's end. For his service, he received the Air Medal with three bronze oakleaf clusters and the Distinguished Flying  After receiving an honorable discharge as a staff sergeant in 1945, Bill returned to Oklahoma, studied business on the G.bill, and became a certified public accountant.  In 1951, he married Dorothy Lee Hartman in Fort Sill, Like Bill, Dorothy grew up in Oklahoma during the Great She was working as a nurse in Tulsa when they met. A year after Bill and Dorothy married, their son Bruce was born. Seven years later, another son, Jeff, was born.  In 1962, Bill and his family moved from Tulsa to Casper, WY, so Bill and Dorothy could pursue their love of the outdoors. During this time, Bill continued his work as an accountant, serving in the Casper Chamber of Commerce and as president of the Wyoming chapter of certified public accountants. He grew his firm, Bates and Hocker, into the largest accounting firm in the State of  After Bill retired, he and Dorothy moved to California, Arizona, and then Utah, returning to Casper every summer to hunt, fish, and enjoy Wyoming's cool summers. Bill became an avid safari hunter, traveling to Africa 15 times to hunt game.  After Dorothy passed away in 2012, Bill returned to Wyoming, where he spent many happy days in Jackson near his son Jeff and daughter-in-law He passed away on December 5 of last year, surrounded by family and loved ones. He is survived by his sons Bruce and Jeff, daughters-in-law Debbie and Vickie, six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.  I said at the outset that Bill's life story typifies many of his generation. He grew up during the Great Depression, when times were hard and money scarce. He served with valor in World War II, where he risked his life many times for his country and fellow servicemen. After the war, he went to college, got married, and started a family. He built a business and served in the community. He was a faithful husband and a steadfast provider for his children.  Men like Bill Bates are the reason America and her allies prevailed in World War Men like Bill Bates are the reason we enjoy such a prosperous and free country today. I am grateful for this opportunity to add a few words in Bill's memory and wish his family the very best.

7204,topic-id,416,"Mr.President, today I am introducing legislation to authorize a game-changing scale of investment in making America's infrastructure more resilient to natural disasters.  The BUILD Resilience Act would build on the National Disaster Resilience Competition first authorized in the 2013 Hurricane Sandy emergency supplemental disaster package. It would authorize $1 billion a year over 5 years to jumpstart large-scale investment in community resilience--supporting jobs, strengthening infrastructure, and reducing risk to communities from disasters like hurricanes and flooding.  This bill aims to follow the ``ounce of prevention'' principle. Cleaning up after a disaster is important, but if we invest in sturdier infrastructure before the disaster, there will be less to clean up after the disaster. This is borne out in two separate studies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that every $1 invested upfront in resilient infrastructure saves $3 on the back end. The Multihazard Mitigation Council of the National Institute of Building Sciences estimates $4 of benefit.  The Sandy Competition supported resilience projects in low-lying coastal areas of Virginia and Louisiana; in Sandy-affected areas of New York and New Jersey, in flood-prone Midwest regions like Iowa and North Dakota, and elsewhere. But Virginia's grant illustrates the scale of the challenge. This grant is supporting innovative flood-control projects but only in two at-risk neighborhoods of Norfolk, which is only one part of a broader Hampton Roads region. Neighboring localities like Newport News and Chesapeake submitted proposals to address their own infrastructure needs, but funding was insufficient. Since there will always be risk of another devastating storm, we must learn from Sandy and take steps now to protect our communities later. This bill tries to do that.  With a range from 1\1/2\ to 7 feet of sea level rise projected by the year 2100, the Hampton Roads region is the second largest population center at risk from sea level rise in the Nation, behind only New Residents are dealing with skyrocketing flood insurance premiums and flooding not only after a Sandy or a Matthew but from ordinary rainstorms. This is a direct Federal responsibility given the presence of the largest concentration of naval power in the world. An ODU study estimates that the main Norfolk city road leading into Naval Station Norfolk could be inundated by the tides a few hours per day by midcentury. That makes this not only an infrastructure issue but a national security issue.  I hope to work with the White House and Congress to advance a comprehensive infrastructure package that rises to this challenge.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3147.txt,2176,"FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017",2017.0,24.0,April

Mr.Speaker, today I rise in support of H.1162, the No Hero Left Untreated I rise today to stand with our Nation's veterans for whom the trauma from the battlefield does not always appear. Whether it is PTS, TBI, MST, chronic pain, or opioid drugs addiction, the pilot program established by this bill would provide an innovative individualized treatment for all-too-common diagnoses that our veterans face today.  Using a suite of FDA-approved medical tools, the magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy, or MeRT, is a nonpharmaceutical and noninvasive procedure that has already shown great promise. This bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish the pilot program, treat 50 veterans using MeRT at two different VA locations, and then come back with a report at the end of that.  Already at the Brain Treatment Center in California, 98 percent of veterans in recent trials have experienced at least a 10-point change in their military PTSD checklist, or PCL-M, which ranges from 17 to 80.  The Active-Duty military has already begun clinical trials using the MeRT procedure at Tinker Air Force Base, concluding that ``transcranial MeRT is a promising adjuvant treatment modality to help veterans suffering from PTSD.'' In fact, after 4 weeks of active treatment, MeRT reduced the average PCL-M score from 66 to 37.  U.Special Operations Command has also funded their own trials using the Brain Treatment Center's treatment modality and is conducting research at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida and Naval Special Warfare Command in my home State of California.[[Page H4471]]  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.1162 from AMVETS, the Veterans Health Council, the Association of the United States Navy, Veterans Advantage, The Patriot Project, Lines for Life, the National Foundation for Women Legislators, the PsychArmor Institute, STEADFAST Leadership, and the WestCare                                                       AMVETS,                                        Lanham, MD, April 5, 2017.

Magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy has successfully      treated more than 400 veterans with post-traumatic stress      disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma,      chronic pain, and opiate addiction. This small pilot would be      instructive to VA in understanding the benefits and deciding      whether to offer this promising therapy to those receiving VA      health care.       If it were fully understood how to treat these nuanced      disorders and health issues, VA would already be doing so--     and suffice it to say--the veteran suicide rate would most      assuredly be lower than it is now. It is imperative that we,      as a nation, look at new ways to help those who have stood up      and walked the walk, and suffer the consequences day after      day.       AMVETS is in full support of this measure and appreciates      your leadership in introducing this important legislation and      in striving to improve the lives of all veterans.

As a result of this treatment, we have      seen significant progress in addressing the symptoms      associated with his condition, in particular his depression      and anxiety have lessened. No other therapies have any effect      on his condition. He has made steady progress and is now on      the road to restoring his health.       The current state of treatment for TBI, mild Traumatic      Brain Injury (mTBI), and PTS, is woefully inadequate. While      hundreds of thousands of servicemembers suffer from these      conditions when they return from war zones and multiple tours      while serving our nation, there is a systemic failure to      address the emotional and physical effects of combat.

This non-pharmaceutical and non-invasive treatment has      helped hundreds of Veterans and their families who are      supporting and caring for these There is no one      treatment for every individual, and it is important to give      Veterans options so that they have the power to choose which      treatment is best for them and their situation. Veterans have      sacrificed so much for our nation; it is our obligation to      provide for them and their families.       We applaud your continued interest in exploring effective,      science-based and proven medical technologies to help our      Like you, we believe it is our obligation and duty      to ensure Veterans receive the treatment they need to have      their lives and livelihoods restored.

Steve Knight,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Knight: Recent elections have focused us,      once again, on the ``here and now.'' And rightly so. With the      elections behind us, we have a shared sense of relief. But      for combat veterans, the ``here and now'' is also often      defined by ``there and then.'' They carry courage into      battle, serve with honor and come home--often finding they      need new courage to confront a new foe. Veterans who confront      post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, and related      symptoms also deserve relief--and this Veterans' Day,      Congress is poised to give it to them.       Truth can be compelling when it meets you up close and      personal. You know that for many Veterans, there is new truth      afoot, and it is compelling--and hopeful. In recent years,      the specialized, little-publicized brain treatment program      for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) known as Magnetic      EEG/EKG-guided Resonance Therapy (MeRT technology) has      emerged. The unique treatment, much studied and now widely      corroborated, is powerful. It changes lives.       Just as the election was an inflection point, you have      recognized that Congress is in a position to change lives in      America for the better. If Congress can move beyond words and      intentions, beyond political jousting, America's veterans      will be forever grateful--and lives will be saved by the      thousands, and you are doing just that.       The chance to give life back to those on the edge, who      wrestle daily with PTSD and related life-stresses and opiate      addiction, is at our finger-tips. The Washington Post and      veteran publications have aptly described it, and time is now      for action. I cannot say this with more conviction: We must      act to save the precious lives, and every one at risk is      precious. We lose more than 20 young men and women daily to      PTSD, and we can stop this in a single congressional vote for      your bill.       The No Hero Left Untreated Act H.1162 can help to change      everything. Through pilot programs administered by the      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), veterans will turn a      critical corner. It will help to restore their mental health,      saving countless lives and those touched by those lives.      Without this act, our veterans will continue to languish      without access to this help. Seeing you, in a first post-     election act bringing fifty Members together to unify around      what matters, can only be applauded. Politics aside, Congress      acting now to pass H.1162 and a Senate companion bill      following immediately will begin immediately saving the      veterans most at risk. As your action clearly demonstrates,      there can no longer be any excuse.       As first reported by the Washington Post, this is an      inflection point--a show stopper, a real chance for      meaningful change. Tested through double-blind studies, 98      percent of MeRT-treated veterans experienced at least a 10-     point improvement in their PTSD Check List-Military (PCL-M)      score, and saw significant reduction in symptom severity,      after only 4 weeks of treatment. These results have been      mirrored in additional open label trials as well. Nothing      else I know of has come close to this success rate.       Congressman Knight, all this brings me to today and my      offering of my support for your efforts on behalf of my      brothers and sisters who have so ably served. I thank you for      making their futures your first priority in the 115th                Sincerely,                                                 Rebecca Halstead,     Brigadier General Retired, (USA retired).                                  ____                                          WestCare Foundation,                                                February 22, 2017.     Steve Knight,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Knight: The purpose of this letter is to      show full support from WestCare Foundation, Inc, for H.     1162, the No Hero Left Untreated This progressive piece      of legislation brings a critical health solution for Post-     Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury      (TBI), Military Sexual Trauma (MST), chronic pain, and opiate      drug addiction to our nation's Veterans through Magnetic EEG/     EKG-guided Resonance Therapy (MeRT technology).       The doctors of the Newport Brain Research Lab/Brain      Treatment Center (NBRL/BTC) have introduced a game-changer      addressing[[Page H4473]]     seemingly intractable behavioral health conditions through      their development of MeRT technology. The data from both open      label and double-blind studies of MeRT technology are      compelling. This protocol, offered as a first line treatment      of the physical brain through neuromodulation, can improve      the behavioral health outcomes for all of us who subsequently      provide evidence-based therapies that will further benefit      Veteran patients and clients as, together, we create a more      effective comprehensive continuum of care.       As a Veteran of the Vietnam War, myself, I am especially      interested in seeing the VA bring this work into their      practice of medicine. For over forty years later, we continue      to see the negative life impact of war on our men and women      who served without the advent of practice and protocols      sufficient for their full recovery. MeRT technology is      producing results that are saving lives and increasing the      potential for follow-on therapies to change the future      trajectory of the lives of our Veterans and their families as      well.       We owe our warriors the very best treatment available in      MeRT technology is clearly making a difference. I      commend you for offering this important legislation and urge      its passage as soon as possible! Every day without it can be      measured in loss of life, in loss of positive contribution to      our communities from our American heroes, and in loss of our      fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, friends and      neighbors.

7083,topic-id,1415,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to join a number of my colleagues in strong support of the National Endowments for the Arts and These venerable institutions, which both recently celebrated their 50th anniversaries, are a cornerstone of American cultural expressions. Sadly, they are also under attack.[[Page H2771]]  The President's recent budget outline called for the defunding and dismantling of the So I have gathered here with my friends and colleagues in the hope that we can help the President change his mind and demonstrate to him the immense benefit that the NEA and the NEH bring to our districts, our country, and, in fact, the world.  Being a Rhode Islander, I have always felt a special connection to the arts and humanities. Rhode Island was founded as a colony that welcomed free expression of religion, and that freedom of thought quickly translated into an independent mindedness that drove creative endeavors. It is no wonder, then, that into such an environment was born one of the 20th century's great statesmen and a champion of the arts, our late senior Senator, Senator Claiborne  Senator Pell was a mentor of mine, and I actually had the privilege of interning with him twice at one point. He is rightly lionized for many of his legislative achievements, including the Pell grants that bear his name. But I believe that no issue was closer to his heart than that of preserving and promoting American art and culture.  Anyone who knew the Senator knew that his own passion was reflected and redoubled by his wife, the indomitable Nuala Pell, one of the great supporters of the arts that my State and our country has ever seen. The National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities can trace their beginnings to the passions of the Pells, the vision of President Kennedy, and the determination of President  President Kennedy began his term with a focus on American culture, when he invited Robert Frost to read a poem at his inauguration. He soon followed this up by appointing August Heckscher his Special Consultant on the Heckscher's report entitled, ``The Arts and the National Government,'' led to the creation of the President's Advisory Council on the  Meanwhile, Senator Pell, the chairman of the Senate Special Subcommittee on the Arts and Humanities, was hard at work. He began his first hearing in 1963 with this statement: ``I believe that this cause and its implementation has a worldwide application; for as our cultural life is enhanced and strengthened, so does it project itself into the world beyond our shores. Let us apply renewed energies to the very concept we seek to advance: a true renaissance--the reawakening, the quickening, and above all, the unstinted growth of our cultural vitality.''  So over the next 2 years, working with legislators including Senators Hubert Humphrey and Jacob Javits and Representatives Frank Thompson and William Moorhead, Senator Pell crafted President Kennedy's vision into a reality. With the full support and assistance of President Johnson, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act was signed into law on September 29, 1965.  The first Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, incidentally, was another Rhode Islander, Barnaby Keeney, then president of Brown  Mr.Speaker, I begin this hour with a survey of history for a couple of reasons. First, I think that it is vital that both Members and the President understand the care and consideration that went into creating the So years of deliberation by some of our finest legislators went into the determination made in the arts and said:       While primarily a matter for private and local initiative,      the arts and humanities are also appropriate matters of      concern of the Federal  So there is no doubt that private foundation and corporate philanthropy are the bedrock of artistic funding in this country. Nonetheless, there is an important role for government at all levels to play, and the Endowment serves as the catalyst for governmental involvement.  Second, looking back helps remind us of the aspirations that drove the creation of the Endowments in the first place. Last week, we learned of the death of Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a Soviet poet who defied his totalitarian government. When President Kennedy brought poetry to his inauguration, it was in direct contrast to the Soviet Union, where literary dissidents were imprisoned or exiled and not given freedom to create.  What a message to send to the world in the 1960s, that the United States prized artistic expression, celebrated scholarly inquiry, and believed in the strength and progress embodied by multiculturalism. So the playwright in New York was not censored. He was cheered. A historian in North Carolina was greeted not with accusation, but acclaim. The painter in Nevada was not imprisoned; she was empowered.  Placed in context, the message sent by the creation of the Endowments was that America's culture was not just an asset to be protected, but a powerful tool for promoting freedom worldwide.  Just as importantly, the 1965 act recognized that American culture was not static. Rather, its evolution over time was the source of its power. However, I believe the most important reason to begin with the history of the Endowments can be found in the Arts and Humanities Act itself: ``An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone, but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.''  Why do we study the arts and humanities? Why do we promote them in the Halls of Congress? ``To achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.''  Mr.Speaker, I co-chair the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, a caucus that owes its very name to the work of an artist, William Gibson, who first coined the phrase ``cyberspace'' in 1984. Gibson helped create the lexicon that we use today to describe the internet as we know it and, in so doing, helped to shape its development and growth--a better view of the future, indeed.  For years, I promoted the STEM to STEAM movement, the concept of adding art and design to the STEM disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Incidentally, this movement is another product of my home State, courtesy of the brilliant minds at the Rhode Island School of Design, in particular, as I understand it, then former President John Maeda, who, as I understand, coined the term ``STEM to STEAM.''  Incorporating principles of art and design in STEM helps foster creativity, encourages collaboration, and can engender sudden, inspired breakthroughs, all by helping to better analyze the present.  So in my role in the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees, I am presented daily with new threats brought on by the advent of new technologies or fast-moving global events. The temptation to act quickly is strong, and sometimes immediate reaction is warranted; but more often than not, it is through examination of the past that I find a path forward.  These United States have weathered many crises over the centuries--some of our own making--but by better understanding of them, I can better analyze the present and better see a future of America peaceful, prosperous, and free.  Mr.Speaker, I know my colleagues have stories to tell of the great works that the NEA and NEH have supported in their districts, and I will share some of those stories as well. But I hope my words on the history of the Endowments have helped shape our understanding of their incredible purpose and ideals of President Kennedy, President Johnson, Senator Pell, and their colleagues.  America is better for the Endowments existing. The world is better for it. To cast them away in a budget outline that zeros them out without even a word of justification is a tragedy.                              {time}  1115  It dismisses the ideals of our forbearers as insignificant.

I would like to thank the wonderful leaders of the Rhode Island Arts and Humanities Council for helping to collect them so that I can share them with everyone here today.                              {time}  1200  The State of Rhode Island is deeply indebted to Randy Rosenbaum and Elizabeth Francis for their work in promoting the arts and humanities. The State councils are an essential component of the Endowments' efforts, and we are incredibly lucky in Rhode Island to have Elizabeth and Randy heading up our initiatives.  One of the stories they shared comes from FirstWorks, an NEA-supported organization that helps connect students experiencing new types of performance with artists premiering new pieces. FirstWorks recently helped bring together a Philadelphia hip-hop group with high school students in downtown The students participated in a workshop with one of the dancers one day and followed it up with a lecture and a matinee performance the next.  FirstWorks had just created a Spanish-language version of their student survey, which they administered after the matinee performance. Students were asked to rate their enjoyment and explain why they gave their answer. Two Spanish-speaking students responded that they loved the performance because it was ``the first time they went to one.''  The FirstWorks team weren't exactly sure what the students meant. Was it the first matinee? Was it the first time seeing the hip-hop group? So they followed up with the teacher, who wrote back: ``These students have never been to a live performance. It just goes to show you how important these opportunities are for our population. They will remember this forever.''  This is the kind of impact the arts can have on our communities.  Another story comes from an artist who has, with the help of State Arts Council funding, been working with underserved communities for 6 years. She helps students learn to apply themselves to art projects in a way that builds self-confidence and helps them learn the power of their imaginations. About an elementary school student named Danny, she wrote: ``When I first started working with him, he did nothing but whine and cry and insist he couldn't do anything. With my encouragement, he took his own ideas and went with them--in a puppet workshop, he made three stuffed animals instead. He sleeps with them every night now. They make him feel safe.''  There are hundreds of these stories in Rhode Island alone, and they would simply not be possible without the support of the  Of course, some projects supported by NEA and NEH are on a much larger scale. It is virtually impossible right now to find a Rhode Islander who, today, doesn't know about WaterFire, Providence's massively successful creative placemaking project. I have experienced this wonderful WaterFire many times myself.  For those of my colleagues who have not had the pleasure of attending a WaterFire--and, Mr.Speaker, I am happy to extend an invitation to all of my colleagues to come and to visit--it is a dynamic sculpture, basically, with dozens of these metal baskets or metal braziers transforming the rivers of downtown Providence.[[Page H2777]]  This groundbreaking artwork has completely transformed Saturday nights in Providence, with tens of thousands of people flocking downtown for each lighting and the performances, music, and camaraderie that accompany it. It is hard to describe it in words, but it has been transformative. WaterFire really has fundamentally altered the way Providence is viewed and the way the people of Providence view themselves. Support from NEA is helping WaterFire further explore creative placemaking, and it is incredibly meaningful.  A final thought to share comes from Professor Touba Ghadessi, a board member for the Rhode Island Council on the Professor Ghadessi was asked to share her thoughts on why NEH matters for all Rhode Islanders, and I truly cannot improve upon her words. This is what she had to say:  ``The Rhode Island Council for the Humanities uncovers beautiful stories about individuals and places and brings them to life--these stories become our history and make us understand that we, too, write the narratives that construct culture. The intentionally diverse programming that RICH supports builds communities that, eventually, will view diversity as normalcy--this normalcy is the one I aspire to construct for the next generation. RICH allows for our best selves to come forward and celebrate together what culture teaches us--from the struggles of social justice, to the legacy of first peoples, to the craft of filmmaking for children. All of these things matter. All of these things make us better human beings. All of these things turn us into ethical and engaged citizens of the world. Without an understanding of the humanities, opinions become facts and truth is debatable. History has offered us a roadmap to behaving with integrity--we can't ignore it or ignorance wins.''  Mr.Speaker, I cannot think of more important words for these times, and I would ask all of my colleagues to reflect on what it will take to view diversity as normalcy and why it seems today that the truth is debatable.  Mr.Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for being here today. I am proud to share my thoughts on why it is so important that we not zero out the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities and the incredible impact they have on our communities.  I have one more story from my district about the impact of the arts and humanities that I'd like to share.  It, too, relates to the legacy of Senator Pell, but it also points to the broader cuts to arts and humanities in the President's budget outline.  A decade after the passage of the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities Act, Senator Pell was again at the forefront of cultural preservation and promotion when he sponsored legislation creating the Office of Museum  While the Office was eventually rolled into the Institute of Museum and Library Services, it continues to support great work, which I saw firsthand last year in my district when the Tomaquaq Museum in Exeter was awarded the prestigious National Medal for Museum and Library  Recently, we in Rhode Island have been celebrating the 350th anniversary of our charter and Roger Williams's respect for the Indigenous People he lived among.  But far too often, this story treats Rhode Island's tribes as bit players rather than delving into their rich culture and history.  The Tomaquag Museum's founders recognized this flaw in the narrative in the 1950s, and while I'm disappointed it took the rest of us so long to catch up, I'm incredibly proud of all the recognition it's received of late.  The Tomaquag Museum remains the only Rhode Island institution dedicated solely to the history and culture of the state's indigenous population, and I have experienced its power to start conversations and change attitudes in our communities.  Unfortunately, IMLS, too, is slated for defending under the President's budget outline.  We are very lucky that my home state Senator, Jack Reed, has taken up Senator Pell's mantle in pushing for its reauthorization and full funding.  But it is important that all of my colleagues join together to protect the NEA, the NEH, IMLS, and support for the arts and humanities throughout the federal budget.  We must do so because of the lives touched and forever altered by these organizations.  We must do so in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.  We must do so because it is good policy.

7255,topic-id,355,"Mr.Speaker, there is no debating that our immigration system is in need of reform. The system doesn't meet the needs of our Nation, its businesses, or its families. There are sensible steps we can take to ensure that it works better and that the rules are followed.  But rather than work in a bipartisan and top-to-bottom fashion to fix our broken laws, today we consider a one-sided and enforcement-only approach that is rejected by the majority of  This bill would drastically expand and, indeed, compel local involvement with Federal immigration enforcement. Even though the majority often professes its fondness for states' rights and local governance, the bill actually prohibits States and cities from policing themselves as they think best, including by having community trust policies that disentangle local policing from Federal immigration enforcement. These are policies that have proven to engender trust in law enforcement and drive down crime.  The bill prohibits jurisdictions from declining immigration detainer requests, even when compliance would violate binding court orders. In fact, a lot of Federal district courts have found that, when it is time to release an inmate because their sentence has been served, it violates the Fourth Amendment to hold that individual upon a mere request by the Federal If you want that person, the answer is simple: Get a warrant. It is the Fourth  Indeed, the bill also likely violates the 10th Amendment by commandeering States to engage in Federal enforcement.  The bill, as has been mentioned, cuts off critical law enforcement funding, and that is why the Fraternal Order of Police has written its letter in opposition to the bill.  Taken together, the provisions of this bill undermine law enforcement's ability to keep communities safe, hurt victims and witnesses of crimes, and likely violate the U. It is no surprise this bill is a priority for the Trump administration. Anti-immigrant sentiment may have become the hallmark of the Trump administration, but it does not represent the values of our Nation, and, indeed, the majority of Americans strongly oppose President Trump's agenda.  Mr.Speaker, I urge our colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose the bill.  ",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgH5244.txt,701,TRIBUTE TO CAREN NELSON,2017.0,28.0,May

I am cautiously optimistic that we will complete this process. Although overdue, we will get our work done.  This is the third continuing resolution during fiscal year 2017. We should be voting today on a bipartisan omnibus appropriations act, not another stopgap bill to keep the government running. After all, we are 7 months into the fiscal year.  Federal departments and agencies have been operating on outdated funding levels and policies for more than half of the year. This is unacceptable, and it cannot continue. Assuming we get to a solution that lasts the remainder of the fiscal year, I do hope Chairman Frelinghuysen will help avoid this outcome in the future.  The continuing resolution we are considering today is a simple date change to continue government funding through next Friday and to extend health insurance for miners through the same day.  The backdrop of this continuing resolution is ongoing negotiations on an omnibus appropriations act. Democrats continue to work in good faith to develop a bipartisan omnibus that provides sufficient funding for critical priorities and rejects divisive poison pill riders. For many months, Democrats have been clear that we will not help pass an omnibus that fails to meet these basic standards, and that remains the case.[[Page H2956]]  As if this process weren't difficult enough, it occurs as the majority is seeking to strip health insurance from 20 million Americans and repeal protections against insurance company discrimination for millions more. Meanwhile, President Trump continues to tweet false and damaging comments about the omnibus negotiations.  It is my hope that these games will end so that we can come together to support investments that create jobs, improve infrastructure, provide a quality education for every student, and invest in technology and biomedical research that will benefit hardworking  To achieve this, we must make progress on eliminating poison pill riders and advancing shared priorities in an omnibus appropriations act. Next week, we must not consider a fourth continuing resolution, but instead have a positive, bipartisan bill after this unnecessarily lengthy process.

7197,topic-id,446,"Mr.President, this year we mark the 10th anniversary of the untimely passing of our friend Paul Paul was a trailblazer when it came to addressing the dangers of nuclear power and nuclear weapons. I personally relied on Paul's insight to craft my approach to preventing the spread of dangerous nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.  As a Senate staffer during the 1970s, Paul made major contributions to our Nation's security by working on two landmark laws.  The first was the Energy Reorganization Act, which created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the agency that later became the Department of Before this legislation, a single agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, was responsible for both promoting nuclear energy and regulating the nuclear industry, to the detriment of public safety.  Paul was also instrumental for passage of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, which required countries to adopt full-scope safeguards from the International Atomic Energy Agency before they could receive civilian nuclear technology from the United This requirement later became an international standard when the Nuclear Suppliers Group adopted it.  During the 1980s, Paul played an important role in helping to kill the Clinch River Breeder reactor, which shut down U.efforts to develop a full plutonium fuel cycle. Throughout this time, he was also a strong proponent of my efforts to close loopholes in U.nuclear nonproliferation law, including tightening nuclear export controls affecting China following Tiananmen He actively worked to ensure House passage of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, which imposed sanctions on those who knowingly contribute to efforts to acquire unsafeguarded fissile material or nuclear weapons.  Paul was ahead of his time in raising alarms about the threat of nuclear terrorism. His warnings about the need to reduce reliance on highly enriched uranium and to limit the use of plutonium for commercial nuclear power later formed the core of the global nuclear security agenda. His warnings about the flaws in nuclear cooperation agreements continue to reverberate in today's debates over the export of nuclear technology.  Today's ongoing nuclear challenges remind me of our solemn responsibility to carry out Paul's legacy.  The nuclear industry continues to push against stringent safety standards. The Trump administration wants to promote the export of nuclear technology and walk away from the Obama administration's nuclear security mission. The India nuclear deal continues to increase the risk of a nuclear clash in South Plans for commercial-scale plutonium reprocessing in East Asia threaten to create a new nuclear arms race in the region.  All of these challenges will require us to take inspiration from Paul's work to promote nuclear security and nonproliferation. To honor Paul, we must rededicate ourselves to fighting these threats to international peace and human survival.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgS2612.txt,735,"PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE",2017.0,27.0,April

But at the moment, a reliable broadband connection is out of their reach.  To keep and grow these jobs in our rural areas, we must make smart infrastructure investments that connect our rural residents: investments that don't duplicate what private enterprise has done, and investments that will carry far into the future.  For most businesses, including agribusiness, broadband services allow companies to access the global electronic marketplace. For consumers, broadband allows people to connect via social media, to download apps and stream videos, and to manage everything from a bank account to a college application. Beyond just access to resources, building out broadband in rural areas increases the quality of life for most citizens and promotes job creation and economic development.  As you think about infrastructure and technology, Mr.Speaker, and as the Small Business Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade hears testimony on the topic this week, I encourage my colleagues to keep in mind the value of our small rural telecom providers that connect rural Americans with the rest of the world and make every effort to connect rural consumers and businesses with a wide array of services.

7229,topic-id,4877,"Mr.President, our Nation and our government were founded on a principle that can be summed up in three words: ``We the People,'' the first three words of our Constitution, the three words that our Founders wrote in supersized font so that no matter who you were you would remember that this is the guiding mission of our form of government. This is the guiding mission of the  From across the room, you can't read the fine print of article I and article II and so forth, but you can see what the Constitution is all about: we the people.  Lincoln captured that notion when he spoke in his Gettysburg Address and said: ``We are a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' He didn't describe our system of government as of, by, and for the privileged. Our Founders didn't write ``We, the powerful and privileged'' at the start of our That is what makes us different from the governments that dominated Europe, where the rich and powerful governed on behalf of the rich and powerful. America turned that on its head with our system of government. Our system of democratic republic governance.  Therefore, we are at a very strange moment right now because just 20 days ago, 217 Members, a small majority over in the House, voted for a bill that was all about government of and by the powerful, for the powerful, of and by the privileged, for the privileged, not by the people, for the people. They voted for  We witnessed the House passing this horrific piece of legislation that will ensure that millions of low-income and middle-class Americans are worse off, will receive less care, and will have to pay more for their healthcare, assuming they can even get it. But, on the other hand, the bill delivers $600 billion in platinum-plated tax benefits to the richest  Picture the situation: our President holding a celebration at the White House, standing on a platform, crushing more than 20 million people in terms of their access to healthcare, while celebrating a golden plate with platinum-plated gifts to the wealthiest That is what happened 20 days ago in the House of That is not a pretty sight and certainly doesn't fit the mission of our  Franklin Roosevelt shared his vision of how we progress in the following fashion. He said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.''  But the Trump principle that was supported by 217 House Members 20 days ago is the opposite. The Trump principle is that the test of our progress is whether we add more to the abundance of those who have most, while taking away from those who do not have enough. That is what happened. That is the difference between Franklin Roosevelt and government of, by, and for the people, and President Trump and 217 House Members who passed a bill of, by, and for the powerful and the privileged.  It is astonishing to me that this happened. American citizens, when they heard about the first version of this bill, TrumpCare 1.0, they overflowed the inboxes, they proceeded to fill the streets, they flooded the phone lines, and people up here heard them and said: We understand. We don't have the votes to pass this TrumpCare 1.0 in the House because we hear you telling us how horrific this bill is.[[Page S3154]]  So they went back to work. But in TrumpCare 2.0 they produced a bill that is even worse than TrumpCare 1.0. They took an already bad bill, they made it more painful and more damaging, and they jammed it through without a hearing on the House side. They jammed it through without a CBO estimate of how many people it would hurt or what it would cost. They jammed it through because they didn't want to listen to the American people who said: What you are doing is diabolical and wrong. They didn't want to listen to the experts who said the same thing.  The experts weighed in from every direction--nonpartisans and analysts, health policy experts, the associations that work in healthcare, the groups that represent doctors, nurses, and patients. The American Medical Association said: ``We are deeply concerned that the AHCA,'' which I will simply call TrumpCare to keep away the confusion--``We are deeply concerned that TrumpCare would result in millions of Americans losing their current health insurance coverage,'' and that ``nothing in the MacArthur amendment remedies the shortcomings of the underlying bill.''  The AARP called the bill ``a bad deal for older Americans ages 50-64,'' because it ``would significantly increase premiums for all older adults and spike costs dramatically for lower- and moderate-income older adults.''  The AARP went on to state that the amendment that converted TrumpCare 1.0 into TrumpCare 2.0 was making ``a bad bill worse'' because it ``establishes state waivers that allow insurance companies to charge older Americans and people with preexisting health conditions higher premiums and weaken critical consumer protections.''  The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network weighed in; the American Diabetes Association weighed in; the American Academy of Pediatrics weighed in; the American Heart Association; the American Lung Association; the March of Dimes and many, many, many other groups that are familiar, household-known organizations. These groups that understand our healthcare system all came out and made it public that this plan, this TrumpCare 2.0, is a bad plan. It endangers Americans' health.  But 217 Members of the House didn't listen. The 217 Members voted for the Trump principle of crushing ordinary Americans to deliver $600 billion in platinum-plated benefits to the richest If the House had listened and put that bill 6 feet under with a stake through its heart, I wouldn't be standing here today, but they sent that bill over to the It is here for the Senate to consider. There are 100 Senators who now have to decide: Are they behind the principle of ``we the people,'' or have they decided that they want a different constitution--one that is about ``we the privileged'' and ``we the powerful''?  I know that when I took my oath of office, I liked the Constitution the way it was written. I liked the principle behind this So it is of major concern that the Senate might proceed to adopt TrumpCare 2.0 or modify it into TrumpCare 3.0.  Today, the Congressional Budget Office's score was released, which told us of and evaluated TrumpCare 2.0. It found that more than 20 million Americans--in its estimate, 23 million to be exact--will be uninsured under TrumpCare than under the Affordable Care That would bring the total of uninsured to a much higher total of 51 million people under the age of 65 by the year 2026--nearly double the number of uninsured. That hurts real people. It hurts every single one of those individuals who lose their healthcare.  In my State of Oregon, just one piece, one provision of this bill, which crushes the expansion of Medicaid--in Oregon, it is the Oregon Health Plan--strips the healthcare of about 400,000 That is a lot of human carnage. It is enough people that, if they were standing hand to hand, they would stretch 400 miles from the Pacific Ocean to the border with That is how many Oregonians would be impacted by this.  That is just the people who lose access to healthcare. There are many others who would go to their clinics or go to their hospitals and find that the clinics and hospitals have either limited their services or shut down because, you see, our clinics have gained tremendously from the investment under In addition, they have gained tremendously from the fact that the people who came in the door had insurance to pay their bills. It is the reduction in uninsured individuals who come through the door--the ones who cannot pay for their care--that has dropped so much. With more people paying for their care, the finances of the clinics and the hospitals are stronger. So TrumpCare not only hurts the 23 million who will lose insurance, but it hurts everybody, every American, by degrading our clinics and degrading our hospitals.  Individuals share their stories and their concerns, people like Lauren Rizzo in She is a single mother and small business owner who is alive today thanks to the health insurance she received through  About 2 years ago, Lauren was not feeling well, so she went to get checked out at a clinic. Lauren figured she would be given a prescription for antibiotics and sent on her way. Instead, she was told to head straight to the emergency room, where she received emergency surgery to remove a 7\1/2\-inch mass from her abdomen. If Lauren had not gotten insurance through the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, she would not have gotten checked out, and she certainly could not have afforded the $40,000 surgery bill and the nearly $60,000 in followup care without going bankrupt. Very likely, without insurance, she would have had this mass continue to grow in her abdomen and maybe threaten her life. This may have been a life-and-death issue for her.  Here is what Lauren has to say in her own words:       I am a healthy and contributing member of society who is      able to contribute and pay my way and continue to grow and      succeed rather than someone who is slipping through the      cracks and needing assistance to get by. It seems to me that      turning people who are getting by into people who are falling      behind is good for no one. Even if there is no compassion in      our leadership's healthcare plan, I would have hoped someone      would have injected a note of common sense.  Her point, made very poetically and poignantly, is that if you cannot get healthcare, you cannot remain a productive member of society. It is not just about your quality of life, and it is not just about the fact that you might suffer and that you might die, it is also about whether you can be healed and contribute. That is an important piece of why healthcare is so important.  Paul Bright of Sweet Home wrote to my office to share his story about finally having healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion. Paul wrote:       I'm one of those hardworking Americans the Republicans      praise mightily--an entrepreneur, self-employed, buying      American--and I'm on Medicaid thanks to the       Without the ACA--that is ObamaCare--I'd have no insurance      at all to cover my prescriptions that keep me healthy so I      can continue to work.       Do I want to be making so little income that I qualify for      Medicaid? I want to be making a good income.       The only way I can continue working 60 hours a week to      increase my household income is if I can keep my      prescriptions and doctor appointments.       Without the medicine I need, I will become permanently      dependent on government services, not just health insurance,      but I will start requiring food stamps, housing assistance,      utilities assistance.  He concludes:       The smart economic decision is to keep me healthy so I can      grow our economy.  Paul is right. Keeping him healthy isn't just the moral thing to do, it is a smart economic decision. Yet, under TrumpCare 2.0, Paul probably would not stay healthy because he would not be able to afford the appointments and he would not be able to afford the prescriptions. He would fall through the cracks.  Then there is a grandmother in Lake Oswego, OR, who wrote to me about her 12-year-old grandson who is living with a neurological disorder and who has been hospitalized three times over the past 5 years. The first time this woman's grandson was hospitalized at the age of 8, his father's insurance covered a 3-week hospital stay. At the time, that was enough to get the care he needed. But then we fast-forward to last year. Her grandson, now 12, needed to be hospitalized for several weeks, followed by residential treatment, followed by a brief period in a transitional school--a 10-month period in[[Page S3155]]total. Those 10 months were covered because of ObamaCare, because of the For the past several months, this young boy has been home and recovering successfully. The ACA made that possible.  Carol Nelson of Turner, OR, writes to me and shares her words. She does not know how she will manage if her husband is kicked out of his nursing home because of TrumpCare 2.0. She writes:       My husband lives in a nursing home. He does not remember me      after 33 years of marriage. I worry now. Will the new      healthcare laws and Medicare, which I will get in 2018, cover      us? Will he have to come home for me to take care of him even      though I cannot stand for more than a few minutes due to      congestive heart failure?  Carol continued:       I think there should be incentives to do what's best for      your health written into the law but not to take it away.      Without the ACA, I surely will die.  So here is a woman who has been married to her husband for 33 years, but he has dementia so badly that he does not recognize his wife. She would love to care for him at home, but she cannot. She has congestive heart failure, and his condition is extremely severe.  Medicaid funds more than half of the nursing home admissions in the United States of It is not simply about assisting struggling families or hard-working or low-income families; it is also about taking care of our seniors. She has a double challenge--her own care and her husband's care. ``Without the ACA,'' she said, ``I surely will die.''  Should that be the healthcare system we have in the United States and because of which people are at the point of losing their access to healthcare and putting their own lives at stake?  I think back to that issue of peace of mind. In a good healthcare system, all have the peace of mind that their loved ones will get the care when they are sick and that their loved ones will not go bankrupt when they get sick. We have made big strides in that direction. In Oregon, the 400,000 folks who are covered by the expansion of Medicaid alone represent a big stride in that direction, the tens of thousands who have gained access to care on the exchange because they can now get community pricing and not be fended off by a preexisting condition or blocked by a preexisting condition. They have more peace of mind.  We can do better. We could have a much simpler system, and we could have a much more efficient system, but let's not go backward and throw millions and millions of Americans off of healthcare.  Last night, I had the pleasure of speaking with Carol on the phone and talking to her a little more about her life. She told me about the cataract surgery she needed in order to be able to continue to see. She said that without that, she would have lost her license, and if she had not had a license, she could not have gone to the grocery store to feed herself and her son, because they live out in the country--an hour's drive from everything. She told me about the various preexisting conditions she has had to manage--conditions that would certainly prevent her from getting healthcare without her having the ACA, conditions that, without medical appointments and prescriptions, would cause her health to deteriorate rapidly without the That is what she means when she says: ``I surely will die.''  It is a powerful story, but it is certainly not unique. Every day, I am receiving stories like Carol's--story after story of folks who just want the peace of mind of having access to healthcare--as well as stories from constituents who are angry at President Trump and who are, quite frankly, angry at the 217 Republicans who voted for a government by and for the powerful and privileged over in the House 20 days ago.  They are also upset about the breaking of promises to the American people. They heard the promises over the past campaign year. The President made promise after promise on healthcare, and his healthcare bill breaks promise after promise.  President Trump promised his plan would provide healthcare for all, but it does not. According to the analysis we received just today, 14 million Americans would lose healthcare almost immediately. Within another 10 years, that would grow to about 23 million That is not healthcare for all; that is healthcare for 23 million fewer. Promise broken.  Over and over again, President Trump said his plan would make healthcare cheaper. The CBO estimates that premiums under TrumpCare 2.0 will go up 20 percent next year. Check this out. Here is the basic math. A 64-year-old man who earns $26,500 a year would have his monthly cost for healthcare go up from about $140 a month to about $1,200 a month. When you are earning $26,500, by the time you pay for your rent and your utilities and your car payment and your groceries, you do not have much left, but you can still get health insurance if it is costing you $140 a month. But if out of that little more than $2,000 a month you earn, you would have to pay $1,200 a month, there is no way you can afford that insurance. So President Trump promised that healthcare would be more affordable--promise broken.  The President promised that under his plan, Americans would have better healthcare. Currently you are guaranteed essential benefits, including emergency services, rehabilitation services, maternity and newborn care, mental health and addiction treatment, hospital treatment, pediatric services--essential benefits. Those are the things you expect, in a healthcare system, to be covered.  But TrumpCare throws out the requirement to have essential care benefits. It means a State could choose to let insurers sell barebones plans that cover virtually nothing.  So you are making your payment and you think you have insurance, and then you get injured or you get sick and you find out it doesn't cover anything. That is not healthcare. That is predatory insurance policies, and that is what is allowed under  So, Mr.President, you promised better healthcare and you delivered predatory policies--promise broken.  The President said he would make sure we kept the protections for preexisting conditions. He promised it. He repromised it. He triple promised it. He continued to promise it. But the amendment that he accepted for TrumpCare 2.0--passed 20 days ago by 217 Members of the House, in favor of government of, by, and for the powerful and the privileged--broke that promise and said States could allow the elimination of community pricing.  What that means is that you have preexisting conditions, but you can get the policy at the same price as everyone else. If you destroy community pricing, it means that when you file for your policy, the insurance company says: Well, let's see just what your problems are. Oh, we see you have asthma. We are going to charge you more. Oh, we see you have diabetes, we are going to charge you a lot more. We see you have delivered a child, which can create health problems. We are going to charge you more because you are a mother. We see that you had an episode of cancer. It is in remission--good news--but the odds of your getting it are higher than someone else; so we are going to charge you more.  That is because their goal is to make sure those people who have preexisting conditions are not in their insurance pool, because they will make more money. That is an assault on the premise that everyone will be able to have affordable healthcare because those folks are told: Because you have this condition or that condition, we are going to charge you more. The charges will be so high--and will be intended to be so high--that they will not be able to buy insurance. So they won't be covered.  That is part of the reason that the CBO has analyzed the fact that there will be 23 million more people without insurance come 2026 under TrumpCare than under current law. We can think of this as a tax. For those who actually can summon the funds, it is a set tax on sick people, and the sicker you are, the higher the tax bill you pay under  So when the President promised not once or twice or thrice but multiple times to make sure that we keep the protection for people with preexisting conditions, that was a promise broken.  The President promised not to cut As I was waiting to speak last night, I was watching a local television channel, and they were playing tapes of one rally after another where[[Page S3156]]President Trump went out there and said: I am different; we will not touch Medicaid or Medicare or Social He was emphatic. He was passionate. He was convincing.  He broke that promise under It cuts $880 billion out of On top of that, the budget he released yesterday calls for $600 billion more on top of the $880 billion. If you cut $1.5 trillion from Medicaid, that is the promise broken. It is not broken by a little. When the President said he wouldn't touch Medicaid, he didn't proceed to break that promise in a tiny little way. No, he smashed it with a sledge hammer. He demolished it. He turned it into dust because he cuts $1.5 trillion out of  Medicaid doesn't just help provide healthcare to hard-working, struggling families. It pays for nearly half of all births in It provides coverage for one out of three children--healthcare for one out of three children in It pays for nursing home care for more than half of the American seniors who need nursing home care. Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health and substance abuse disorders.  A lot of folks here have come down to this floor--from both parties--to talk about taking on the opioid epidemic, a substance abuse epidemic, a highly addictive drug doing great damage across Medicaid is the largest payer for substance abuse disorders in America, and TrumpCare cuts it by $1.5 trillion.  Two out of three school districts rely on Medicaid funds to provide services to children with disabilities.  So there we have it--one broken promise after another.  Now we turn to the Senate because it is time for this Chamber to respond. The only appropriate response is for us all to get together, dig a deep hole here on the floor of the Chamber, throw that House bill--TrumpCare 2.0--into it, light it on fire, drive a stake through it, and make sure it never sees the light of day. That is the only reaction that honors our ``we the people'' government. That is the only action that would honor the promises that President Trump made to the Nation while campaigning.  Now, a group of my colleagues are holding secret meetings far from the public to work out a new version of TrumpCare--TrumpCare 3.0. There is no bipartisan dialogue on this, and I am certainly not invited to listen in. So I can't tell you what they are coming up with, but I can tell you this: It is a process completely different than when we had a bipartisan, over a year-long process to debate and examine the question of the Affordable Care Act--The Finance Committee held 53 hearings. They spent 8 days marking up the bill. That was the committee's longest markup in over two decades. They considered 135 amendments. That was one of the two major committees that worked on The other was the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, known as the HELP They held 47 hearings--not secret meetings in some room but public and bipartisan meetings with all committee members welcome and the press welcome, hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs. Then, they had a month-long markup--a month long. I was there. I was on the committee. We had a square table--two sides with my Republican colleagues and two sides with my Democratic colleagues. During that markup, amendment after amendment was considered. Three hundred amendments were considered--bipartisan amendments, amendments from Democrats, amendments from Republicans--and 160 amendments were adopted from my Republican colleagues--160 amendments from across the aisle. That is the type of bipartisan work that was done.  Let's compare that to TrumpCare: no hearings in the House, no public display of the bill for a lengthy period for it to be publicly analyzed. There was virtually no chance for the public to see the actual text and weigh in. It passed under a process of rapid transit through the floor of the House, and then it came over here to the  Is the Finance Committee now holding hearings similar to what we did years ago on ObamaCare? We had 53 hearings. How many hearings has the Finance Committee had on TrumpCare 3.0? None, not one. The HELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--held 47 hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs. How many hearings has the HELP Committee had here in the Senate on TrumpCare 3.0? Not a single one.  Secrecy is the guiding principle of the day--secrecy that might produce another version of TrumpCare that will be devastating to millions and millions and millions of So, of course, they don't want the public to watch that process. Of course, they don't want to have weeks of hearings and markups that enable people to have hundreds of bipartisan amendments. If you are trying to push through something to destroy healthcare in America, you want to do it as secretly as possible. That is what is happening in the Senate at this very moment.  That is not the kind of process you should have in a democratic republic. That is the kind of process you have when you are about to do something diabolical and destructive that will hurt we the people.  ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act, isn't perfect. We could work together to make it much better. We could say no to all of the strategies that the Trump administration is doing right now to undermine the success of the marketplace.  Remember, the marketplace was the Republican idea. That was the Republican plan: Have a marketplace where private healthcare insurance companies could compete. That is what came from across the aisle. But now the Trump administration is doing everything it can to undermine that particular strategy. They are hesitating about whether to provide the cost-savings funds that allow the companies to provide lower premiums and lower deductibles. That hesitation means the insurance companies can't price out their policies for next year. So they either have to exit the exchange or they have to raise the price of their policies a lot higher.  The Trump administration is deliberately sabotaging the marketplace.  Then there is the fact that the whole point of the markets was to make it simple for an insurance company to go from one State to another State, to reach all of the customers at the same time of year--all making decisions--and you can reach out and talk to them. You can sell your policy easily. But the point is, a new company coming into the marketplace is concerned they will get a disproportionate share of those who are very ill, so there is an adjustment that takes place to say: You can come into this marketplace, and we will guarantee that you will get an adjustment if your patients end up being sicker than the average patients.  That is intended to make multiple insurers come in and compete with each other. But my Republican colleagues destroyed that provision. It is called risk corridors. They destroyed that provision. They are destroying the ability of companies to competently, responsibly come into the insurance marketplace and participate in the exchanges.  So not only do we have the diabolical TrumpCare 2.0 and the secret 13 proceeding to develop TrumpCare 3.0, we also have the administration destroying the ObamaCare exchanges, the marketplaces, which were the Republican idea brought into that bill.  I will do all I can to make sure we don't throw out healthcare for 23 million I hope every single Senator here, having come to this body and I know holding dearly this Constitution, will fight for ``we the people'' and not ``we the powerful and privileged'' and will fight against a bill that not only hurts healthcare for those 23 million people but also destroys healthcare institutions for everybody else because it undermines the financing of both the clinics and the hospitals.  In our own States, we are all hearing our Lauras and our Pauls and our Carols and our grandmothers talking about their 12-year-old grandsons. We are hearing them all say: Just say no. Do your job. Make our healthcare system work better. Live up to your commitment to ``we the people,'' a democratic republic, to fight for a nation of, by, and for the people.

It has been shown that exposure to the arts stimulates students' learning, their motivation, and their creativity.  Those students involved in the arts score significantly higher in the SATs than other students. Now, more than ever, the arts often seem to be one of the first programs cut from a school or a government budget.  In fact, this President has proposed eliminating both the Endowments entirely--the first time any President has proposed such a measure. This has been supported by Democrats and Republicans because it is meaningful to the entire  The NEA, the National Endowment for the Arts, has already sustained significant budget reductions. The NEA appropriation is 12 percent lower than it was in 2010. It declined to $19.5 million.  And while I understand, when everything is a priority, nothing is a priority, I understand that this priority affects the spirit of the greatest Nation in the world.                              {time}  1130  The importance of arts and humanities is not something we should even forget, even in the face of tough economic times. The arts support 4.7 million full-time United States jobs and, as you have heard, creates billions in economic activity each year.  In New Jersey, the National Endowment for the Arts last year provided over $1 million in direct grant funding to 13 arts organizations, community groups, schools, and artists, as well as enabled the New Jersey State Council on the Arts to award 171 grant and nongrant services totalling over $13 million. So there are consequences and a ripple effect to the few Federal dollars that are provided and targeted.  In my hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, the Council for the Humanities has awarded grant funding to the Hamilton Partnership for Paterson in support of their work for the Great Falls National Historical  Humanities organizations like these enrich the cultural and historical benefits of the Great Falls through programming and community involvement initiatives. That is why it is crucial that we ensure that they receive the funding and the recognition they deserve.  The budget proposal does damage to Americans across the board. One area taking a massive hit, if I may use a parallel, is health care. This budget would cripple the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, slashing funding by $5.8 billion, equal to 19 percent of the current $30.8 billion discretionary budget. The budget takes aim at vital antipoverty programs that directly impact health care because poverty causes poor health. So our physical health is going to take a toll.  But it is our mental health that could be improved through a strong arts foundation, helping to relieve stresses and lift American spirits. Spiritual health of Americans, supported by the NEA and the NEH, is a key piece of our overall well-being.  As an active member of the Congressional Arts Caucus, I have spent years opposing those who wanted to slash funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and  I will continue to work with my colleagues--and I pledge to you today that I will--on these Federal initiatives that possess widespread and bipartisan support.  Democrats and Republicans have always come together on this issue. It lifts our spirit as a culture and a nation. You mentioned Yevtushenko before, a Russian poet who came to New York City in the fifties. I only know a few words in Russian, but I went anyway because he was going to read his poetry in There was no interpreter there.  Yevtushenko had been in the midst of the Russian He had been in the midst of people trying to gain a voice. I just know a few words; nonetheless, I was moved by his spirit, like watching a painting or looking at a photograph or going to a movie. I understand without knowing the words. That is what a poem should be. It should be, regardless of meaning, in any language. Whether it is music, art, poetry, sculpture, cinema, photography, dance, it doesn't matter.  This is the heart of Our children are drawn to it. And we even use art and the humanities now to help those people through very distressing times, which is very interesting and fascinating.

This body--not the body at the other end of the building, this body--didn't have the guts to address it 4 years ago, 3 years ago, 2 years ago, nor this year. This is something that we need to address, even though it is not the bill itself.  I am a strong supporter of law enforcement. As co-chair of the Law Enforcement Caucus, I rise in total opposition to this bill and the rule. Here is what the misguided goal of this bill would do:  You are going to prove a point by penalizing law enforcement for immigration policies politicians in their city have to implement. That is what you want to do. So it absolves us down here in  This bill threatens the central Federal funding streams for law enforcement. You have heard all of those programs that are being endangered. Any grant administered by the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security that is substantially related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, or naturalization you are putting on the chopping block if this bill becomes law.  This bill would not make our communities safer. In fact, it undermines public safety.  The funding this bill puts at risk allows local police departments to purchase equipment and hire and provide training for officers.

Re H.3003.     William Pascrell, Jr.,     Paterson,       Dear Congressman Pascrell: The New Jersey State Policemen's      Benevolent Association (NJSPBA) represents over 33,000 law      enforcement officers throughout our state. It is no secret      that law enforcement officers risk their own safety every day      to keep our[[Page H5252]]     communities safe. And as a strong supporter of law      enforcement on the floor of the U.House of      Representatives, we would like to thank you for all your      efforts on behalf of the men and women that serve within the      law enforcement community.       It is our understanding that this week the House is voting      on H.3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' which      adds additional obstacles to funding for the hiring of      additional police officers in certain communities throughout      our state. Specifically, the bill restricts municipalities      from receiving grants administered by the Department of      Justice or the Department of Homeland Security if municipal      officials fail to notify the federal government with regard      to the presence of individuals as it relates to information      regarding citizenship or immigration status.       While we strongly agree that state and local law      enforcement should work closely with federal law enforcement,      cutting off funding for law enforcement to already      underfunded and understaffed police departments and law      enforcement entities undermines our collective efforts to      keep our members and the communities they serve safe.      Politics should not interfere with the safety of our members      or our ability to do our job.       On behalf of our membership, we appreciate your ongoing      efforts and hope you will continue to work with your      colleagues in Congress to assure funding for law enforcement      and prevent our government from punishing our membership for      something that is completely out of our control.

7145,topic-id,402,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to talk about a vital tool for ensuring workers are able to secure good-paying, family-supporting jobs, and that is apprenticeships.  I grew up in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a working class town with a very large skilled trade presence. I understand what good, middle class jobs look like, and the impact they can have on a community. A good middle class paycheck ensures people can afford a mortgage, have healthcare for their families, take a family vacation, and send their kids to college if they want to; and that is what we need right now are more higher-paying jobs.  But not everyone goes to a traditional 4-year college or university, nor does every job require this type of degree. That is why, for many, apprenticeships are the key to family-supporting wages.  Apprenticeship programs have proven very effective at helping prepare workers for careers in highly skilled professions. This bill would increase the number of highly skilled workers in the United States and strengthen apprenticeship programs as an effective earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and employers.                              {time}  1330  It is a win-win for workers and businesses. The LEARNS Act supports closer connections between registered apprenticeship programs, employers, and others offering good-paying jobs.  But there is a problem. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to talk about their support of apprenticeships. I hear the Secretary of Labor talk about them. I even hear the President talk about them. But that is all it is: talk.  As a new member of the Appropriations Committee, I was shocked to see that Republicans' newly released Labor-HHS funding proposal entirely eliminates Department of Labor apprenticeship grants. Again, that appropriations proposal cuts $95 million from apprenticeship funding, every singer dollar in the program. There is not a penny left to connect workers and businesses with apprenticeships.  You can't have it both ways. If you support apprenticeships and job training for workers, then you should support funding for job training and apprenticeship programs. It is pretty simple.  If Republicans are serious about job creation, about training workers for a 21st century economy, and they actually want to do more than talk about jobs and apprenticeships, then we should move forward to defeat the previous question in order the bring forward the LEARNS  Walk the walk, Mr.Talk is cheap. The American people deserve action. I urge all of my colleagues to defeat the previous question.  ",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgH5777.txt,2171,REMEMBERING WILLIAM BARCLAY BATES,2017.0,13.0,June

These two bills may sound ``tough,'' but they      would ultimately make the problems with our national      immigration system even worse than they already are.       H.3003 would unnecessarily and unwisely penalize states      and municipalities that are attempting to strike the delicate      balance between cooperating with federal immigration      authorities, on one hand, and respecting the constraints      imposed on them by the U.Constitution, on the other. At      the same time, it would do nothing to address the      constitutional concerns raised by the use of immigration      ``detainer'' requests, concerns that the Department of      Homeland Security (DHS) itself has recognized in the past.       Among its provisions, H.3003 would eliminate various      federal law enforcement grants to states and municipalities,      such as the ``Cops on the Beat'' program, unless      jurisdictions comply with all DHS detainer requests. It aims      to overturn local policies adopted by over 300 jurisdictions      across the country that have determined, as a matter of      constitutional law and sound public policy, including      community policing efforts, that they cannot hold individuals      beyond their release dates solely on the basis of a DHS      detainer request.       The senseless and tragic 2015 killing of Kathryn Steinle in      San Francisco has renewed the debate over so-called      ``sanctuary cities.'' Yet the term suggests, incorrectly,      that certain states and municipalities are refusing to work      with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The truth      is that state and local law enforcement agencies (``LEAs'')      throughout the country already aid in the identification of      individuals who are subject to immigration enforcement action      through the sharing of fingerprints of those who are taken      into custody. LEAs with limited detainer policies have      determined, however, that they cannot continue to detain      individuals for immigration enforcement purposes, under the      Fourth Amendment and pursuant to numerous court rulings,      unless DHS obtains a judicial warrant, as all other law      enforcement agencies are required to do.       H.3003 would not address the Fourth Amendment concerns      raised by the use of DHS detainers. Instead, it would leave      many state and municipal governments in an untenable      position: either they must disregard their constitutional      responsibilities and erode the trust they have built between      the police and the communities they serve, or they will face      the loss of vital federal law enforcement funding that helps      them fight crime in their jurisdictions. Congress should not      force such an arbitrary and unwise choice on cities.       H.3004, the other immigration-related bill expected to      come to the House floor this week, would significantly      increase sentences for previously-removed individuals who      reenter the country. While the bill is an improvement over      other bills by the same name, in that it does not include      mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, it would still lead      to a likely increase in the federal prison population without      any tangible benefits. The Department of Justice's      ``Operation Streamline'' program, upon which this bill would      build, has already shown that increased criminal prosecutions      do little but waste resources while failing to deter      unauthorized border crossings. It should be ended, not      expanded.       For these reasons, I urge you to vote against H.3003 and      H.3004.

This is despite the fact that      an ``increasing number of federal court decisions'' have held      that ``detainer-based detention by state and local law      enforcement agencies violates the[[Page H5257]]     Fourth Amendment,'' as recognized by former Department of      Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2014.       Disturbingly, H.3003 seeks to penalize the 600+      localities that abide by the Fourth These      jurisdictions have recognized that by entangling local      authorities and federal immigration enforcement, immigration      detainers erode trust between immigrant communities and local      law enforcement. In this way, immigration detainers      ultimately undermine public safety, as entire communities      become wary of seeking assistance from police and other      government authorities that are supposed to provide help in      times of need. Thus, by forcing jurisdictions to comply with      unlawful detainer requests, H.3003 will only make      communities less safe, not more.       H.3003 would also amend Section 287 of the INA to allow      the Department of Homeland Security (``DHS') to take custody      of a person being held under a detainer within 48 hours      (excluding weekends and holidays) ``but in no instance more      than 96 hours'' following the date that the individual would      otherwise be released from criminal custody. This, again,      raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns, as the Supreme      Court has stated that the Constitution requires a judicial      finding of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest. This      provision would disregard the Court's ruling entirely and      allow a local law enforcement agency to hold a person for up      to 7 days before requiring DHS intervention--and never      requiring the person be brought before a judge for a probable      cause hearing.       Protection against unreasonable detention by the government      is the bedrock of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which      provides that the government cannot hold anyone in jail      without getting a warrant or approval from a neutral      magistrate. This constitutional protection applies to      everyone in the United States--citizen and immigrant alike.       Immigration detainers, however, do not abide by these      standards. Detainers are one of the key tools that DHS uses      to apprehend individuals who come in contact with local and      state law enforcement agencies. An immigration detainer is a      written request from DHS to that local law enforcement      agency, requesting that they detain an individual for an      additional 48 hours after the person's release date, in order      to allow immigration agents extra time to decide whether to      take that person into custody for deportation purposes.       DHS' use of detainers to imprison people without due      process, without any charges pending, and without probable      cause of a criminal violation flies in the face of our Fourth      Amendment protections. Policies that allow DHS to detain      people at-will are ripe for civil and human rights violations      and have resulted in widespread wrongful detentions,      including detentions of U.citizens. That is why many of      the 600+ localities targeted by H.3003 have decided not to      execute a DHS immigration detainer request unless it is      accompanied by additional evidence, a determination of      probable cause, or a judicial warrant.       Unfortunately, H.3003 does nothing to address the      fundamental constitutional problems plaguing DHS's use of      immigration detainers. Rather than fix the constitutional      problems by requiring a judicial warrant, the bill      perpetuates the unconstitutional detainer practices and      forces the federal government to absorb legal liability for      the constitutional violations which will inevitably result.      This is irresponsible lawmaking. Instead of saddling      taxpayers with the liability the federal government will      incur from Fourth Amendment violations, Congress should end      the use of DHS's unconstitutional detainer requests.       H.3003 violates the Due Process Clause by allowing DHS      to detain people indefinitely without a bond hearing.       Section 4 of H.3003 radically expands our immigration      detention system by amending Section 236(c) of the INA to      authorize mandatory detention ``without time limitation.''      This empowers DHS to detain countless immigrants for as long      as it takes to conclude removal proceedings--even if that      takes years--without the basic due process of a bond hearing      to determine if their imprisonment is even justified. This is      a clear constitutional violation, as the federal courts have      overwhelmingly held that jailing immigrants for months and      years without bond hearings raises serious problems under the      Due Process       Although the bill claims to provide for the ``detention of      criminal aliens,'' it massively expands mandatory detention      to people with no criminal record whatsoever, including      immigrants who lack legal papers or who overstay a tourist      visa. The ``lock `em up'' approach to immigration enforcement      is cruel, irrational, and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court      has permitted brief periods of mandatory detention only in      cases where individuals are charged with deportation based on      certain criminal convictions. The Court has not endorsed the      mandatory lock-up of people who have never committed a crime.                         Kate's Law (H.3004)       H.3004 is piecemeal immigration enforcement that expands      America's federal prison population and lines the coffers of      private prison companies.       Increasing the maximum sentences for illegal reentrants is      unnecessary, wasteful, and inhumane. H.3004 envisions a      federal criminal justice system that prosecutes asylum-     seekers, persons providing humanitarian assistance to      migrants in distress, and parents who pose no threat to      public safety in returning to the U.to reunite with      children who need their care (individuals with children in      the United States are 50 percent of those convicted of      illegal reentry).       Current law already imposes a sentence of up to 20 years on      anyone convicted of illegally reentering the country who has      committed an aggravated felony. U.Attorneys' Offices      aggressively enforce these provisions. According to the U.     Sentencing Commission, immigration prosecutions account for      52 percent of all federal prosecutions--surpassing drugs,      weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes. Nearly 99      percent of illegal reentry defendants are sentenced to      federal prison time.       H.3004 would drastically expand America's prison      population of nonviolent prisoners at a time when there is      bipartisan support to reduce the federal prison population.      It offends due process by cutting off all collateral attacks      on unjust prior deportation orders, despite the Supreme      Court's contrary ruling in United States v. Mendoza-     Profiteering by private prison companies has been the main      consequence of border-crossing prosecutions, which the      Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of      Inspector General have criticized as lacking sound deterrent      support.       H.3004 is an integral part of this administration's mass      deportation and mass incarceration agenda. Longer sentences      for illegal reentry are not recommended by any informed      federal criminal-justice stakeholders; rather they represent      this administration's anti-immigrant obsession and would      expensively expand substandard private jail contracting      despite the life-threatening conditions in these facilities.       In conclusion, H.3003 and H.3004 are fraught with      constitutional problems that threaten the civil and human      rights of our immigrant communities, undercut law      enforcement's ability to keep our communities safe, and would      balloon our federal prison population by financing private      prison corporations. Rather than taking a punitive approach      to local law enforcement agencies that are working hard to      balance their duties to uphold the Constitution and to keep      their communities safe, Congress should end DHS's      unconstitutional detainer practices or fix the constitutional      deficiencies by requiring judicial warrants for all detainer      requests. Congress should also repeal mandatory detention so      that all immigrants receive the basic due process of a bond      hearing and reject any attempt to unfairly imprison      individuals who are not a threat to public safety.

The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence      (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations      advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence      victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the      country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence      receive the protections they deserve, write to express our      deep concerns about the impact that H.3003, the ``No      Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.3004, or ``Kate's      Law,'' will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual      assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on      communities at large.       This year is the twenty-third anniversary of the bipartisan      Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') which has, since it was      first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant      victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.3003 and H.     3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors      and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into      danger, undermining the very purpose of Specifically,      the nation's leading national organizations that address      domestic and sexual assault oppose H.3003 and H.3004      because:       Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing      community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal      immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine      the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA      and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant      victims into the shadows and undermining public safety.      Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that      supports local community policing and sustains community      trust in working with local law enforcement. H.3003 runs      contrary to community policing efforts and will deter      immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not      only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for      themselves and their children. While H.3003 does not      require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant      victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in      the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices.       Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse.      Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law      enforcement with U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement[[Page H5258]]     (ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating      trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community,      which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and      traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a      tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to      call the police because of fear of deportation, they become      more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the      individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear      of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting      violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result,      dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished.       As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes      often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they      will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting      the police and HR 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal      immigration and local law enforcement systems will only      exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be      able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and U.     Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim      advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by      immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help      from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and      attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs      indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened      fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78% of      advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are describing      fear of contacting the police; 75% of them reporting that      victims are afraid of going to court; and 43% reporting      working with immigrant victims who are choosing not to move      forward with criminal charges or obtaining protective orders.       In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie      Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among      Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to      concerns that police interaction could result in deportation.      According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have      dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles' Latino population since      the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop      among non-Latino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse      among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas      the decline among non-Latinos was four percent. The Houston      Police Department reported in April that the number of      Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year.      In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that      some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in      court. As of late February, the City Attorney's Office had      dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers      will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and      Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having      trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain      public safety and prosecute crime.       HR 3003 Will Unfairly Punish Entire       H.3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional      guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not      supported by due process mandates. H.3003 likely covers      more than 600 jurisdictions across the country, most of which      do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional      mandates as ``sanctuary'' policies. H.3003 penalizes      jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal      grants, including federal law enforcement grants, such as the      Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and      other federal grants related to law enforcement or      immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit      analysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would,      ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to      combat and prevent crime in their communities.       In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.3003 and H.     3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources      being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from      enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes,      including those protecting victims of domestic violence,      sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and      prosecution of many non-violent immigration law violaters.       H.3003 and H.3004 Will Unfairly Punish       By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding      criminal penalties for reentry, H.3003 and H.R.3004 will      have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of      human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are      often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition      of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when      police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may      be arrested or a survivor who acted in self-defense may be      wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English      better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural      barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the      survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor      faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty      (without being advised about the long-term consequences) in      order to be released from jail and reunited with her      children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often      arrested and convicted for prostitution-related offenses.      These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly      to be reunited with their children following their arrests or      pending trial. These factors--combined with poor legal      counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of      criminal pleas and convictions--have in the past and will      likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused      victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of      domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.3003      imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.3009 imposes      expanded bases for detention without consideration of      mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these      victims.       In addition, 3004 expands the criminal consequences for      re-entry in the U.without recognizing the compelling      humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been      previously removed return for their safety. Victims of      domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence      in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking      protection from harm. In recent years, women and children      fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and      Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge.      Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal      representation, they are unable to establish their      eligibility for legal protections in the United States,      resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of      domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking      in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims      subsequently attempt to reenter the U.to protect      themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and      sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their      abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from      obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with      some victims having to leave their children behind in the      custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.3004,      these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for re-entry for      attempting to protect themselves and their children.       On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence,      sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human      trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote      against HR 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and spirit      of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law      enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for      public safety in general, and particularly essential for      domestic and sexual violence victims and their children.           Sincerely,       The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence      (www.4vawa.org).                                  ____                                                    June 26, 2017.       Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on      Migration of the U.Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/     COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our      opposition to H.3003 and H.3004.       The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare      of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our      parishes include those with and without immigration status,      unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of      crime in the United States, including domestic violence,      armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of      fostering cooperation and information-sharing between      immigrant communities and local law enforcement.       We oppose H.3003 because it would impose obligations on      local governments that we fear--and that many of them have      warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law      enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local      law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure      public safety in all communities.       Furthermore, Section 2 of H.3003 would deny to      jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law      enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and      naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be non-     compliant with H.3003. The Catholic service network,      including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the      federal government on a number of Department of Justice and      Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including      disaster response and recovery, naturalization and      citizenship services, and services for the immigrant,      including victims of human trafficking, and domestic      violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the      protection and promotion of the human person and in some      instances life-saving. Cutting grants related to these      important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not      humane or just, nor is it in our national interest.       Also, we oppose H.3004 as it would lead to an expansion      of incarceration and does not include adequate protections      for people who re-enter the U.for humanitarian reasons or      seek protection at the border. While H.3004 makes notable      efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent      criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal      by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal      re-entry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in      these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that      important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to      prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent      crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry      or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does      not advance the common good nor will it ensure that      communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as      introduced, H.3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum      seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented      themselves repeatedly at the U.border in the flight from      violence), from being able to access protection, and instead      face fines, imprisonment or both.[[Page H5259]]       We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of      a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration      reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family      unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs      and rights of immigrants with our nation's best interests and      security.       The United States has a long and proud history of      leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their      circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready      to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to      this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of      our views in this regard.           Sincerely,     Most Joe Vasquez,       Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on     Donna Markham, OP, PhD,       President & CEO, Catholic Charities                                  ____                                                    June 27, 2017.       Dear Representative McGovern: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic      Social Justice stands in strong opposition to the ``No      Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.3003) and ``Kate's Law''      (H.3004) to be considered this week by the House of      We urge Congress to reject these bills. In a      country that prides itself on being the land of welcome and      opportunity, we must ensure that our immigration laws reflect      our shared values.       As Congress continues to delay comprehensive immigration      reform and a permanent solution for the nation's 11 million      undocumented immigrants, we are left with the status quo--an      enforcement-only approach that tears apart families and keeps      people in the shadows. Despite the gridlock in Congress,      localities across the country still have the responsibility      to uphold safety and peace in their communities. To fulfill      this goal, local police and residents have fostered mutual      trust to root out crime and promote public safety,      encouraging community members to cooperate with local      authorities. The ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.     3003) does nothing to promote public safety and instead will      make communities more dangerous while striking fear in the      hearts of our immigrant families.       Likewise, ``Kate's Law'' (H.3004) would criminalize      immigrants who simply want an opportunity to succeed in the      United States, and often are simply trying to be reunited      with their family. Punishing immigrants for wanting to      provide for their families with fines and imprisonment is      harsh and cruel--we, as a nation, are called to be better      than that. Again, we ask Congress to abandon the      ``enforcement first'' policies that have been the de facto      U.strategy for nearly thirty years, yielding too many      costs and too few results. Our antiquated system that does      not accommodate the migration realities we face in our nation      today does not serve our national interests and does not      respect the basic human rights of migrants who come to this      nation fleeing persecution or in search of employment for      themselves and better living conditions for their children.       Pope Francis cautions that ``migrants and refugees are not      pawns on the chessboard of humanity'' and he asks political      leaders to create a new system, one that ``calls for      international cooperation and a spirit of profound solidarity      and compassion.'' This is a holy call to embrace hope over      fear. Congress should recognize the God-given humanity of all      individuals and uphold our sacred call to love our neighbor      and welcome the stranger in our midst. Any action that      further militarizes our borders, criminalizes assistance to      immigrant communities, or weakens legal protection of      refugees is neither just nor compatible with the values that      we, as Americans, strive to uphold.           Sincerely,                                     Simone Campbell, SSS,                                               Executive Director,                        NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I, again, would simply say that if we really want to do something about immigration, we ought to come together, like the Senate did not long ago, and pass comprehensive immigration reform. But, apparently, that is not in the DNA of the current leadership of this  Instead, we have bills that demagogue the immigration issue, that demean immigrants, that cause hysteria, and I find that very unfortunate.  This bill is a bad idea. It falls in the same category as that other bad, stupid idea of building a wall across our country.  What we ought to be doing is serious legislating, enough demagoguing, and let's get back to doing the people's business, and that includes comprehensive immigration reform.  Mr.Speaker, as I said, we need to fix our immigration laws. When a mother in the Philippines has to wait 25 years or more for a visa to reunite with her son in the United States, is that system working?  To lose the entire childhood and young adulthood of your son? What mother wouldn't try to enter the United States some other way, in fact, any way that she could in order to be with her child?  When your daughter is threatened with rape and murder if she doesn't become a sexual slave to gang members; when your son and the entire family is threatened with death if the boy doesn't join the gangs, wouldn't you run away and try to find safety someplace else?  And when the family arrives at the U.border and they actively seek out the U.Border Patrol and voluntarily surrender to them and ask for safe refuge and asylum, is that really entering our borders illegally?  You know, when you have been an upstanding member of the community for 10, 15, 20 years or more in the United States, and you get pulled over because the tags have expired on your car, or your license, do you really deserve to be deported, to tear apart your family, to leave behind the businesses that you have spent a lifetime creating?  And does anyone in this Chamber honestly think that if this father or mother is deported, that they won't do everything they can to try to come back to be with their kids?  I mean, these are real stories. It is not fiction. They are not fantasies. It is real. And if you listened to people in your community, you would know these stories.  If you paid attention to your local police, you would know why it is so damaging to turn them in to ICE, because they rely on these community members to inform them of criminal activities in their community. The police don't want to do what you are asking them to do. Why would you force this on them? And why would you punish them by taking away essential Federal funding to help them protect the citizens of this country?  This is a bad idea. I guess, maybe it is a good press release. Maybe Steve Bannon thinks it is a good idea. Maybe it is a good sound bite for Who knows what the rationale behind this is. But it is not sensible. It is not thoughtful.  So if you want to get serious about these issues, you know, come together, like the Senate did, in a bipartisan way, and come up with comprehensive immigration reform. That is our duty. That is our job, as Members of Congress, not this garbage. This is a waste of time. This is an insult to the American people. We ought to be able to do better.  So, Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this. I urge them to defeat the previous question so we can have a debate and vote on whether or not to increase the minimum wage to $15 to give people a raise. Again, we have to do that because this House is being so tightly controlled that you can't get anything to the floor.  I would remind my colleagues that the underlying bill that we are talking about here today on immigration is under a closed rule. We will have another closed rule tomorrow. So much for democracy. So much for deliberative process. So much for openness. There is no such thing here. I mean, the Rules Committee has become a place where democracy goes to die, where everything gets shut down.  We need to do better. This process stinks, and this bill is lousy. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, vote ``no'' on the rule, and if it gets to the point we have to debate this, vote ``no'' on the underlying bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgH5244.txt,979,NO HERO LEFT UNTREATED ACT,2017.0,28.0,May
7102,topic-id,204,"Mr.Speaker, every day there are more stories about the Affordable Care Act's, or ObamaCare's, ongoing collapse.  Insurers have been dropping out of the ACA's markets for 3 years now. It is estimated that two out of every five, or 40 percent, of all counties in the country will have only one insurer on the exchanges, and many markets may soon have none at all.  The House passed compromise legislation to provide the American people, especially those in the individual market, with more flexibility and choice and fewer Washington mandates, all while putting Medicaid, a critical safety net program, on a sustainable path.  Critics of this legislation have responded with hyperbolic, irresponsible rhetoric, and no solutions, other than higher taxes, more spending, and more Washington control.  Some ACA defenders are actually calling for a single-payer system, which would result in unbearably high taxes, even tighter grips from Washington, and unsustainable spending. It would destroy innovation, create scarcity, degrade quality, and drive up costs. Even the liberal California legislator seems to have abandoned the single-payer fantasy this week.  Instead of careening toward single payer, let's keep the promises we made to repeal and replace ObamaCare and meet the expectations of those who sent us here.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5305-8.txt,2158,FUND THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES,2017.0,29.0,August

7047,topic-id,1004,"Mr.President, as a part of my office's ``Expression NOT Oppression'' initiative, I come to the floor today to highlight once again both a good news story with regard to human rights and a continuing challenge.  First let me begin by highlighting the good news. Aya Hijazi, whom I have spoken about before on the floor, is an American-Egyptian citizen whom Egyptian officials had imprisoned on trumped-up charges almost 3 years ago. She was released, and she was able to return home to the United States last week. I am pleased that she was set free, as are many of my colleagues in the Senate who had been calling for the Egyptian authorities to release her. I know this was a topic of conversation during Egyptian President Elsisi's visit to the United States 3 weeks ago.  I want to also take this moment to thank the Trump administration for working to ensure her freedom. They were instrumental--in fact, they were key in this being possible. They made it a priority in their private engagements with regard to President  Sadly, there are still many more political prisoners who remain jailed in We here in Congress as well as the administration should continue to raise these issues with the Egyptian Government until all of them are released, regardless of their citizenship status.  As the leader of the free world, the United States must work to safeguard the freedoms and liberties of all people. We must speak frankly with our allies, with our partners around the world, and we must work with governments to improve their human rights records.  It is ultimately in America's national security interests to have stable democracies that observe the impartial rule of law and that respect the rights of their people.                                Chechnya  Mr.President, I would like to highlight the horrific reports on the pro-Russian Chechen Government's brutal campaign against LGBT people and others over the last several weeks.  Human Rights Watch recently reported that ``law enforcement and security agency officials under control of the ruthless head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, have rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay, torturing and humiliating the victims.''  There are reports that at least 100 men have been arrested. At least three men have reportedly been killed since the campaign began. Chechen LGBT individuals, as well as those suspected of being gay, have been taken to unofficial secret detention facilities where they have endured heinous abuses.  They also face the danger of so-called honor killings committed by their own relatives.  Instructive in that vein is a statement from a spokesman for the Chechen leader. Here is what he told the Russian news agency, talking about gay men, in particular, in the LGBT community: ``If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.''  Unfortunately, this is not a new reality for those living under the brutal tyranny of the Chechen leader who, by the way, happens to be a loyal ally of Vladimir There have been reports in the past of similar abuses, although these reports seem to be the most brutal and should provoke anger in all of us.  We should never, ever tolerate human rights violations against any person for their political views, their religious beliefs, or their sexual orientation.  According to reports today, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said that Russian officials had not seen information to confirm the reports. Additionally, Putin's spokesman said: ``We have no reason not to trust the head of the republic''--talking about the Chechen Republic--``until there are actual complaints in this regard, not abstract, anonymous but actual complaints.''  Well, the actual complaints are all around us. They have been well documented in publications throughout the world, but instead, Vladimir Putin is choosing to prop up Kadyrov, the Chechen brutal dictator, and prop up his brutal regime instead of holding them accountable.  The United States and other responsible nations should do more to ensure that all people are protected and those who harm them are held responsible. We should use our voice on the global stage to call attention to these horrifying acts and to ensure that they are condemned in an appropriate way, ultimately in the hopes that they will be stopped.                         Tribute to Alex Burgos  Mr.President, before I yield the floor, as a matter of privilege, I am joined by a long-time staffer of mine who, in about 20 minutes, will end his employment with our office.  Alex Burgos has worked for me since 2009, when he left a stable job with a stable paycheck to go work for an underdog candidate with no chance to win in the U.Senate race in  For the last 8 years, he has been a critical member of our team. We are proud that he has moved on and is going to be working in another place outside of government, where he will be quite successful. We have watched him grow both in his professional career as well as his family.

7227,topic-id,401,"Mr.President, while not perfect, this bill includes important provisions that will benefit Florida, strengthen our national security, increase resources for our national defense and the fight against ISIS, and give our military men and women the largest pay raise in 6 years.  Given the threats our Nation faces from the likes of North Korea and radical Islamic terrorists, a government shutdown would send exactly the wrong message to the world at a time when it is counting on America to lead.  I am pleased to see this bill funds the Department of Defense to levels authorized by Congress and includes increases for ship building, operations and maintenance, and military readiness. It also incorporates the fiscal year 2017 Intelligence Authorization Act, IAA, that provides essential guidance and authorities for our intelligence community. This year's IAA requires the President to establish an interagency committee to counter Russia's active measures against the U.S., maintains resources for our intelligence community's counterterrorism capabilities, and requires the Director of National Intelligence to complete declassification reviews of terrorist activities of each individual who has been transferred or released from the U.detention facility in Guantanamo Bay,  This bill will ensure Florida can continue combatting the Zika virus and the opioid epidemic that is devastating so many families in our communities.

7077,topic-id,175,"Mr.Speaker, the Republican healthcare repeal bill is a giant step backwards. It will leave millions of Americans without any insurance and many more paying more money for less coverage. Worse, it will reduce protections requiring insurers to treat fairly those of us with preexisting conditions.

I urge my colleagues to support the Common SENSE Act and join me in finding commonsense ways to improve our healthcare, not to dismantle it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-19-pt1-PgH4379-5.txt,99999999999999,"FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017",2017.0,19.0,April
7053,topic-id,512,"Mr.President, just a word on the majority's use of the Congressional Review The window for using the CRA is closing this week. I heard the majority leader touting the 13 CRAs the majority passed this year. I want to make two points.  First, despite what the majority leader and the President claim, these CRAs are not a huge accomplishment. They simply overturned rules passed at the very end of the Obama administration. They hardly constitute a legislative agenda. In fact, the use of the CRA shows just how little this majority and this President have been able to accomplish in the first 100-plus days. The fact that they are bragging about these highlights how little else they have accomplished legislatively.  Second, the CRAs are designed to help special interests against the interests of working Americans, belying all the promises President Trump made when he campaigned. Let me give some examples. One of them is on foreign oil bribery. One of them is on a retirement rule. One of them is on stream protections. One is on mentally-ill access to guns. In each of these, it is a narrow special interest who pushed it, not a demand from the American people. Which Americans say ``Make it OK for our companies to bribe foreign oil companies or pollute our streams'' or ``Give the mentally ill access to guns''? These are narrow interests in each case.  Let's be very clear about this. The CRAs Republicans passed are not rolling back burdensome regulations. Oh, no. They are giveaways to Big Oil, Big Gas, Big Coal, Big Mining, and wealthy special interests.  The most indefensible one of many is the one on a retirement rule. If localities or States want to set up systems whereby working people want to put money away for their retirement, why not? It doesn't hurt anybody. It doesn't require anybody to do anything. And these days where fewer and fewer Americans have pensions from their companies, it is what is needed. But[[Page S2894]]some banks didn't want competition. They didn't want it shown that maybe the cities or the States could run these retirement systems more cheaply and take less money out of the average American's pocket. So we undid this rule. I don't think a single average constituent in any part of America wanted this rule undone, just the big banks--some of them, not all of them. That is the kind of thing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and President Trump are bragging about. It is nothing to brag about.  Let's be very clear about this. These are not the priorities the American people voted for in November, where a substantial majority of Americans said in exit polls that the economy was rigged against them. These CRAs rig the game even further for the wealthy special interests and are nothing to brag about or write home about.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

7266,topic-id,629,"Finally, Mr.President, a word on healthcare: The Republican attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, combined with the Trump administration's refusal to commit to making key cost-sharing payments that help keep healthcare costs low for working Americans, have created great uncertainty in our healthcare system. This uncertainty has already caused insurers to flee the marketplace or propose rate increases for next year.  A spokesman for America's Health Insurance plans--that is the insurance industry's main group; again, it is not a politician--said:       We need swift action and long-term certainty [on the cost-     sharing program]. It is the single most destabilizing factor      in the individual market, and millions of Americans could      soon feel the impact of fewer choices, higher costs and      reduced access to care.  My Republican colleagues, remember, if you continue to allow the President to do this, if we don't make cost sharing permanent, the system will deteriorate, and guess whose back it will be on? Yours, my Republican friends. You are in charge. And when people get a bad healthcare bill, you can blame anyone you want. You are in charge. Fix it.  Refusing to guarantee the cost-sharing payment is nothing short of sabotage, and the repeated attempts to pass TrumpCare will only make things worse.  The White House ought to step up and say once and for all that they will continue to make the cost-sharing payments permanently, and Republicans in Congress ought to drop their repeal efforts and, instead, work with us on stabilizing the market and improving our healthcare system.  Now, today the Congressional Budget Office will release its analysis of the House Republican healthcare bill--I remind my colleagues how unusual it is for a CBO score to come out nearly 3 weeks after a bill has passed. It is like test driving a brand new car 3 weeks after you have[[Page S3106]]already signed on the dotted line and paid the dealer in full.  Republicans in the House were so worried about how bad the CBO score might be, they rushed TrumpCare through--no hearings, no debate, no score. Never mind that this legislation remakes one-sixth of our Nation's economy. It has life-and-death consequences for millions of American families.  Republicans were haunted by the ghost of CBO scores past, so they went ahead without one.  When the CBO analyzed the first version of TrumpCare earlier this year, it concluded that 24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance if it became law. We also learned the bill would gut Medicaid, crush seniors with higher premiums, and would increase out-of-pocket expenses for Americans of all ages with higher deductibles and copays.  Given that there were few differences between the first and second versions of TrumpCare, we can expect that today's CBO analysis will likely show many of the same grave consequences as the first one. Only now, of course, TrumpCare includes a new amendment that allows States to opt out of the requirement to cover people with preexisting conditions. It is hard to imagine such an amendment would make CBO's score any better than the last, and it could certainly raise a lot of new questions.  Does the deal the Freedom Caucus got with the second version of TrumpCare violate the rules of reconciliation? Will the House have to change the bill and take yet another vote on TrumpCare? We know they don't want to do that.  We also don't know the answer to these questions, and we may not know the answers even after seeing today's CBO analysis. But all of these open questions demonstrate how reckless it was for Republicans to vote on this bill without properly vetting it first.  I yield the floor to my good friend, the senior Senator from Vermont, the former and hopefully future Senate President pro tempore.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3105-2.txt,1036,REMEMBERING PAUL LEVENTHAL,2017.0,24.0,June

I would like to thank the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Brady, and members of the Ways and Means Committee for bringing this bill to the floor, and I would like to thank my cointroducer of the bill, Representative Sewell from Alabama, as well, for the work that she has done in regards to foster care issues over the years.  Every child, Mr.Speaker, deserves a loving home; but when a child's home is no longer safe, often because of abuse, neglect, or behavioral issues, children are placed in foster homes. In fact, in 2015, more than 670,000 American children--16,000 in Pennsylvania, the State, including in my district, more than 16,000 there have spent time in foster care.  Countless families across the country are willing and eager to accept foster children into their homes, and research shows that placement with relatives is better for the child. Therefore, Federal policy should make it easier for foster children to be placed with family members.  Our bill is being considered today on the floor, and again, I ask for my colleagues' support.

First, taking the fact that Mexico is not paying for it, nor would anybody in their right mind think that Mexico was ever going to pay for it, now he is asking for $1.6 billion of Americans' hardworking taxpayers to pay for it.  We already have 650 miles of border fencing, but representing the Sunshine State, with over 1,000 miles of coastline, this isn't going to make us safer. It is not going to help us at all. And then you look to how there are racial undertones to this.  Notice how there is a focus on the Southern border, but not the Northern border?

But I want to make clear that I don't believe we have done our job to address the unbridled waste in this bill; billions of dollars, the sheer amount of waste in this bill, billions upon billions of dollars. And even worse, the bill, as currently written, sets us up to throw away billions more for years to come.  I know it can be political suicide to take on defense contractors, but we owe the taxpayers a level of accountability and discipline. It is the same thing every single year, like the greatest hits of defense waste: the littoral combat ship, a combat ship that can't even survive combat, a ship on perpetual port call because it is always in need of repair, a ship the Navy said it needs only one of.  But, apparently, the White House knows better, because they forced the Navy to ask for another one. And even that wasn't enough, because our committee decided to give them a third one. We are tripling the number of ships the Navy said they need.  Now, how outrageous is that?  That is $500 million a pop. That is $1 billion more than the Navy wanted.  The F-35, the President has trumpeted how he brought down the price of this bloated program. But just a few days ago it was revealed that the bill for this program is actually going to jump 7 percent. You probably won't be seeing this on the President's Twitter feed, but the Pentagon now says it needs another $63 billion for the program.  But instead of demanding accountability, this bill rewards Lockheed and the Pentagon by committing the government to block buy F-35s without the testing that is required.  Then there is the USS Ford, a brand-new class of carrier that is at least 25 percent over budget right now. You would think that before sending a crew of 4,300 out to sea in a $13 billion carrier with a host of new mission-critical systems, we would want to ensure that the ship can actually survive in combat conditions.

7091,topic-id,992,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for yielding. Thank you, Representative Langevin, for leading us in this hour, and also for your great leadership on behalf of the arts and humanities.  I am very pleased to join my colleagues in taking this time to speak about the critical importance of the National Endowment for the Arts, NEA, and the National Endowment for the Humanities,  Any great civil society will grow even stronger by embracing the arts and humanities, and certainly America, when she embraces the arts and the humanities, grows to the greatest potential; so the greatness of America is reflected by that interest and that investment.  At a time when some are arguing that we must cut our way to success, I would remind them that investments in the arts and in humanities are investments in our workforce and in our economy. I fully support funding for these programs.  The National Endowment for the Arts provides a foundation for America's artistic excellence, her creativity, and innovation that benefits individuals, communities, and our industries.  As NEA Chair Jane Chu once said: ``Although many may not realize it, the arts actively intersect with areas such as the economy, human development, and community vitality.''  The NEA, as a strong sponsor of the arts and artists, is an integral source of strength at these intersections, challenging students to turn imaginative ideas into brilliant solutions for generations to come.  Art in our communities, and especially in our schools, is indeed vital. It is one of the most important ways that we celebrate our unique regional heritage and expand our own horizons of creativity and innovation.  In the capital region of New York, the area that I am so proud to represent, we value the arts. So much of our artistic achievement would not be possible without the National Endowment for the  For many years, the Albany Symphony Orchestra has received NEA grants in support of the American Music  The Arts Center of the Capital Region has received NEA grants for exhibitions, workshops, and master classes.  Yaddo has been the recipient of many NEA grants to support residencies for collaborative teams.  Fence magazine uses NEA grants for publication of books of poetry and podcasts.  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was just awarded an NEA grant for residencies to create works investigating the intersection of art, media, technology, and, yes, science.  Without the NEA, these programs would not be there to enrich our communities and our lives.  National Endowment for the Humanities awards also support research and innovation, strengthen critical thinking and writing skills, as well as strengthen humanities education in all institutions of learning.  Supporting the growth of the humanities in our communities is just as essential. The National Endowment for the Humanities has contributed in many ways to the capital region, which has a very rich history and heritage worthy of preservation, promotion, and celebration.  Many of our institutes of higher education have benefited from these grants, including RPI, Skidmore, Union College, and SUNY Albany, to name a few.  Some of the projects that have been funded by NEH include the Underground Railroad History Project of the Capital Region, which explores the complex relationship between the Underground Railroad, the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction in our region, as well as the influence of these events on our contemporary society.  Investments in the humanities also drive us to be better citizens. NEH has supported the League of Women Voters of New York State Education Foundation, which is working toward the celebration of women's right to vote and the 100th anniversary of the League of Women Voters in New York State to celebrate the upcoming events commemorating the women's suffrage centennial.  Grant recipients include the Girl Scouts, the Troy Boys and Girls Club, libraries, museums, high schools, and elementary schools. Our history reminds us of the pride that comes with developing community and neighborhood, investments that those who came before us made in growing families, developing households, building neighborhoods in powerful and meaningful ways.  This conversation is also closely linked to two other important fields that are intertwined with the arts and humanities. First, I am a longtime supporter of America's heritage areas, special places that have played important roles in shaping our They tell the stories of people and communities, the pioneer spirit of which laid the foundations of our society.  Heritage areas provide enormous economic benefits, and I greatly appreciate the work that the Erie Canalway and Hudson Valley heritage areas have done for upstate New As the co-chair of the Congressional National Heritage Area Caucus, I continue to be impressed by how the entire National Heritage Areas program operates on a very small budget. These cost-effective programs create jobs and grow our local economies.  In fact, each Federal dollar invested in this program leverages more than $5 in non-Federal funds. That is exactly the kind of smart investing we need to see more of.  By the way, thank you to the 77 Members who joined me in supporting funding for heritage areas.  I am also supporting funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services because museums are a vital part of our communities and educational infrastructure. These museums collectively employ 400,000 Americans and have an impact of $20 billion in their communities.  During my time in Congress, I have been a steadfast advocate for our Nation's museums, and I have urged my colleagues to robustly fund the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the primary agency that supports our Nation's 33,000 museums. It is highly accountable, and its great competitive, peer-reviewed grants programs serve all  This year, we had 166 Members signing on to that letter. So it is very obvious, NEH, NEA, IMLS, and National Heritage Areas are fundamental investments in our communities. They make life richer, more meaningful; they inspire us; they challenge us. They need to be funded. Let's move forward with the critical funding they require and deserve.  ",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2770-5.txt,1942,"FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017",2017.0,6.0,April

Then he filled his Cabinet with former lobbyists, Wall Street and oil company executives, and other billionaires.

Joseph Stone was carrying out his duties in territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists. Two other members of the team--one from the Czech Republic and another from Germany--were injured.  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe controls these monitoring teams. They are comprised of unarmed civilians. The mission has been in the region since 2014, when, unfortunately, Russian-backed troops invaded Had Russia lived up to the Minsk agreements and ceased supporting, directing, funding, and fueling separatists in this region, there would have been no need for the mission to continue.  Sadly, that is not the case. This particular special monitoring mission currently fields roughly 700 monitors, with 600 of them in Donetsk and Luhansk.[[Page S2483]]Those who are part of this mission are unarmed civilians. They serve as the eyes and ears for the world in the conflict zone. They report on the near-constant violations of the cease-fire, as well as reporting on humanitarian needs of the population.  They play an essential role in the understanding of the situation on the ground, often under extremely difficult circumstances and, certainly, as we have seen with Joseph Stone, dangerous circumstances. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I often hear from our top military leaders about the importance of the OSCE and the work being done by the special monitoring missions.  In late March, for example, during a hearing of the Armed Services Committee, GEN Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.European Command and Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, called attention to the good work of OSCE in the region and the work of the monitoring missions. He confirmed in his testimony that ``Russia is directing combined Russian-separatist forces to target civilian infrastructure and threaten and intimidate OSCE monitors in order to turn up the pressure on Ukraine.'' He also said, ``Russian-led separatist forces continue to commit the majority of ceasefire violations despite attempts by the OSCE to broker a lasting ceasefire along the Line of Contact.''  The tragic death of American Joseph Stone underscores the need for the OSCE monitors to have unfettered access across the front lines and across the border regions controlled by the separatists. This unfortunate tragedy is a result of this access not being granted.  I commend the Austrian Foreign Minister, who serves as OSCE chair-in-office, for calling attention to this tragedy and calling for an immediate investigation into these events. Those who are responsible for the death of Joseph Stone and the injury of the two other monitors should be held accountable.

The Corporate Transparency Act of 2017 directs the Treasury Department to issue regulations requiring entities formed in the United States to declare their beneficial owners--the real, natural persons who control each company and benefit from it financially. The bill would do this by setting minimum disclosure standards for States to follow. If individual States choose to collect this information on behalf of businesses formed there, then that's all that a new business would need to do to comply. Participation by the States is completely voluntary. If companies are formed in States that do not collect this information consistent with the new minimum standards, they will need to disclose their beneficial owners directly to the U.Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement  Collecting beneficial ownership information at the time a company is formed will offer the transparency law enforcement needs to investigate these kinds of financial crimes. Under the bill, the new beneficial ownership information would not be available to the public, but available only to appropriate state and federal authorities. Finally, the bill provides civil and criminal penalties for improper disclosure.  The bill is constructed to exempt many legitimate businesses, and the information requested is already provided by most companies in the normal course of business. Collecting beneficial ownership information at the time of incorporation relieves later compliance burdens for legitimate businesses, while at the same time prevents illegitimate businesses from operating in secrecy.  The House companion to this bill, H.3089, was introduced with bipartisan support and efforts to identify the true owners of shell companies have the support of business groups like the Clearing House Association and the B-Team, law enforcement groups like the Fraternal Order of Police, and anti-corruption advocacy groups like the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition and Global  The Corporate Transparency Act of 2017 is a much needed step in stopping financial crimes and the abuse of anonymous shell companies. I thank Senator Rubio for joining me in introducing this bill, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill.   Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                1717       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Corporate Transparency Act      of 2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:[[Page S4771]]       (1) Nearly 2,000,000 corporations and limited liability      companies are being formed under the laws of the States each      year.       (2) Very few States obtain meaningful information about the      beneficial owners of the corporations and limited liability      companies formed under their laws.       (3) A person forming a corporation or limited liability      company within the United States typically provides less      information to the State of incorporation than is needed to      obtain a bank account or driver's license and typically does      not name a single beneficial owner.       (4) Criminals have exploited the weaknesses in State      formation procedures to conceal their identities when forming      corporations or limited liability companies in the United      States, and have then used the newly created entities to      commit crimes affecting interstate and international commerce      such as terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, tax      evasion, securities fraud, financial fraud, and acts of      foreign corruption.       (5) Law enforcement efforts to investigate corporations and      limited liability companies suspected of committing crimes      have been impeded by the lack of available beneficial      ownership information, as documented in reports and testimony      by officials from the Department of Justice, the Department      of Homeland Security, the Financial Crimes Enforcement      Network of the Department of the Treasury, the Internal      Revenue Service, and the Government Accountability Office,      and others.       (6) In July 2006, a leading international anti-money      laundering organization, the Financial Action Task Force on      Money Laundering (in this section referred to as the      ``FATF''), of which the United States is a member, issued a      report that criticizes the United States for failing to      comply with a FATF standard on the need to collect beneficial      ownership information and urged the United States to correct      this deficiency by July 2008. In December 2016, FATF issued      another evaluation of the U.S., which found that little      progress has been made over the last ten years to address      this problem. It identified the ``lack of timely access to      adequate, accurate and current beneficial ownership      information'' as a fundamental gap in U.efforts to combat      money laundering and terrorist finance.       (7) In response to the 2006 FATF report, the United States      has repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their      incorporation practices by obtaining beneficial ownership      information for the corporations and limited liability      companies formed under the laws of such       (8) Many States have established automated procedures that      allow a person to form a new corporation or limited liability      company within the State within 24 hours of filing an online      application, without any prior review of the application by a      State official. In exchange for a substantial fee, 2 States      will form a corporation within 1 hour of a request.       (9) Dozens of Internet Web sites highlight the anonymity of      beneficial owners allowed under the incorporation practices      of some States, point to those practices as a reason to      incorporate in those States, and list those States together      with offshore jurisdictions as preferred locations for the      formation of new corporations, essentially providing an open      invitation to criminals and other wrongdoers to form entities      within the United       (10) In contrast to practices in the United States, all 28      countries in the European Union are required to have      formation agents identify the beneficial owners of the      corporations formed under the laws of the country.       (11) To reduce the vulnerability of the United States to      wrongdoing by United States corporations and limited      liability companies with hidden owners, to protect interstate      and international commerce from criminals misusing United      States corporations and limited liability companies, to      strengthen law enforcement investigations of suspect      corporations and limited liability companies, to set minimum      standards for and level the playing field among State      incorporation practices, and to bring the United States into      compliance with its international anti-money laundering      standards, Federal legislation is needed to require the      collection of beneficial ownership information for the      corporations and limited liability companies formed under the      laws of such     3.

7285,topic-id,316,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, my neighbor from just down I-64, for organizing this Special Order honoring the life of Senator Bunning this evening.  This is the first time in my 11 years serving in Congress that I have spoken from this side of the aisle, and it is a fitting occasion that I do that. I am proud to join my Republican colleagues and friends this evening.  During his baseball career, Jim Bunning was once asked what his proudest accomplishment was, and he recalled the fact that he went nearly 11 years without ever missing a start. ``They wrote my name down, and I went to the post,'' he said.  I can't help but think that is a fitting way of also describing his political career and his love of the Commonwealth of Kentuckians wrote his name down time after time again, and he went to work for them, no questions asked.  Jim and I obviously didn't see eye to eye politically all the time, and as amazed as I was by the curve balls that he threw on the field, I sometimes found myself equally amazed by some of the curve balls he threw off the field, but that was When so much of what happens in Congress is political theater, you can't deny that he was always real and that every word he spoke, he genuinely believed.  I am sure Jim's family takes great pride in that fact. I join with my colleagues in offering them my thoughts and prayers as they continue to grieve their loss. I hope they find comfort in the lifetime of memories they share together.  It is reported that Daniel Boone once said: ``Heaven must be a Kentucky kind of place.''  I sure hope that is true.  As I said at the time of his passing, Jim Bunning can now throw no-hitters forever on his field of dreams.
