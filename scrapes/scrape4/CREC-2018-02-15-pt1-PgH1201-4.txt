                      CONGRATULATING GREGORY OLSEN

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Gregory 
Olsen from Chaska who was recently appointed to serve on the National 
Honey Board by the Secretary of Agriculture.
  Greg will serve a 3-year term alongside 19 other members as the 
importer-handler representative. The National Honey Board is one of the 
22 industry-funded boards authorized by Congress under USDA's 
Agricultural Marketing Service. Its purpose is to expand domestic 
markets for honey and honey products.
  The National Honey Board is responsible for research and development, 
advertising and promotion, consumer education, and industry information 
of the honey industry.
  Madam Speaker, Greg brings important industry experience to the table 
and will assist the National Honey Board in their mission of successful 
innovative research, education, and promotional work for honey products 
that many people rely on in Minnesota and across the world.
  Congratulations again to Greg Olsen.
