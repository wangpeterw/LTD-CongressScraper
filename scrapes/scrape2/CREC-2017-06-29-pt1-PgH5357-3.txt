      CONGRATULATIONS CASSY LESTER AND ALL ART COMPETITION WINNERS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today this House welcomes 
the winners of the Congressional Art Competition to the Nation's 
Capital. Students from all over the country have traveled to Washington 
to proudly display their works of art in the tunnel to the Capitol for 
the next year.
  The Congressional Institute hosts the nationwide competition each 
year to showcase and inspire the artistic talent of high school 
students from each congressional district. I am proud of the 37 
students from my district who submitted entries.
  I am thrilled to welcome our first-place winner, Cassy Lester of 
Reynoldsville, for her acrylic painting titled ``Chocolate Lab.'' Cassy 
attends Jeff Tech, and it is an honor to recognize a career and 
technical education student as our winner this year.
  She was honored with her fellow winners from the States across the 
Nation at this afternoon's luncheon, and earlier today, I was able to 
give Cassy and her family a tour of the Capitol.
  Congratulations to Cassy and all of this year's winners. We are 
grateful to have your art brighten the walls of the tunnel of this 
Capitol for the year ahead.
