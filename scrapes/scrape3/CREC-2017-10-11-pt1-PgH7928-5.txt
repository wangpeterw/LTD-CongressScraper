                RISING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 
many who have concluded that enough is enough. I rise today to speak on 
behalf of the many persons who believe that Article II, section 4 of 
the Constitution of the United States of America has meaning and that 
it is something that is appropriate for a time such as this, 
appropriate for a time when there is one among us who seems to incite 
hatred, bigotry, and invidious discrimination.
  I rise to speak on their behalf today, Mr. Speaker, and I do so 
understanding that I am not doing it on behalf of Republicans, 
generally speaking, or Democrats, generally speaking. The people whom I 
reference are Americans, generally speaking.
  So I rise to speak on their behalf.
