                         SANCTIONS LEGISLATION

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senators today will have an opportunity 
to advance important bipartisan Iran sanctions legislation. As we 
consider this bill, we anticipate that amendments addressing Russia 
sanctions are likely to be offered. I am encouraged that the chairmen 
of the Foreign Relations and Banking Committees, Senator Corker and 
Senator Crapo, have already been in discussions with their respective 
ranking members to work toward a bipartisan agreement. I support that 
effort, and I will have more to say about the underlying legislation 
tomorrow.
