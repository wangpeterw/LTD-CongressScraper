                    WORK TOGETHER TO FIX HEALTHCARE

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans continue to push a flawed 
and harmful healthcare bill, TrumpCare. It fails to address the basic 
healthcare needs of Americans.
  Republicans themselves are deeply divided on the subject. You have 
Republicans negotiating with Republicans and they can't come to 
consensus. Democrats, meanwhile, have been willing to work to come to 
consensus to work together to fix those real issues that we know we 
have to address in the Affordable Care Act. We have not been given the 
opportunity.
  There has been no transparency in any of this discussion, no 
hearings, and no public input. The entire process is behind closed 
doors. Of course, we know why. This is a bill that kicks millions of 
Americans off of healthcare. Twenty-two million people would lose 
health insurance. For those lucky enough to get healthcare, they will 
pay more for less. Their out-of-pocket expenses will go up. If you are 
50 to 64, there will be an age tax.
  This is a terrible piece of legislation. It ought to be rejected and 
we ought to work together to fix the problems we have.
