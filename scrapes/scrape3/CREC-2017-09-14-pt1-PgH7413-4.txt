                       UNITED UNDER THE DREAM ACT

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, too often we hear about our country being 
divided, and yet when it comes to the Dream Act, the message is clear: 
our country is united.
  A wide majority of Americans and nearly 70 percent of Republicans 
want us to pass this legislation. They want us to provide permanent 
legal status to DREAMers--800,000 people who are working hard, studying 
in our universities, contributing to our economy, and serving in our 
military.
  Mr. Speaker, I demand that we bring up the Dream Act for a vote. We 
cannot force these young people, who have received DACA, to wait any 
longer to know that America wants them to live here.
