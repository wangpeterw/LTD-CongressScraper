   LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, NOT END IT

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today, in the 
House Budget Committee, we heard testimony that, if the repeal mission 
that our Republican colleagues have been on now for the past 7 years is 
successful, 29.8 million Americans would lose their health insurance.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, keep in mind that, for all of the rhetoric, here 
are the facts:
  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we have more people with health 
insurance today in our country than at any time in our Nation's 
history. What was once a 16 percent uninsured rate has been cut in 
half. It is now 8 percent.
  Why in the world would we want to throw away that progress?
  Now, we hear from the other side repeal and replace, repeal and 
replace. Well, we have now had 65 votes to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act, and how many votes have we had on their replace plan? Zero. Not 
one.
  It would be criminal to throw away the progress that has been made 
through the Affordable Care Act. It is not perfect. No law is. No piece 
of legislation is. Let's work together to improve it, not end it.
