                     GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEGISLATION

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final issue, as we know, talks 
on government funding legislation have continued throughout the week on 
a bipartisan, bicameral basis. The House has introduced a short-term 
funding bill that we expect to pass before Friday night's deadline so 
that a final agreement can be drafted and shared with Members for their 
review prior to its consideration next week. This extension will also 
protect thousands of retired coal miners and their families from losing 
the healthcare benefits I have fought for throughout this entire 
process, as I continue to lead the fight to secure them on a permanent 
basis.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
