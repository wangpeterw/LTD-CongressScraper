SENATE RESOLUTION 289--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING OCTOBER 8, 2017, 
                  AS ``NATIONAL WILDFIRE REFUGE WEEK''

  Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. Kennedy) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 289

       Whereas, in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established 
     the first national wildlife refuge on Pelican Island in 
     Florida;
       Whereas, in 2017, the National Wildlife Refuge System, 
     administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, 
     is the premier system of land and water to conserve wildlife 
     in the world and has grown to approximately 836,000,000 
     acres, 566 national wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland 
     management districts located in every State and territory of 
     the United States;
       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important 
     recreational and tourism destinations in communities across 
     the United States and this protected land offers a variety of 
     recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent 
     uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages, 
     specifically hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, 
     photography, environmental education, and interpretation;
       Whereas, in 2017, 373 units of the National Wildlife Refuge 
     System have hunting programs and 310 units of the National 
     Wildlife Refuge System have fishing programs, averaging more 
     than 2,400,000 hunting visits and nearly 6,900,000 fishing 
     visits each year;
       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experienced 
     more than 31,400,000 wildlife observation visits during 
     fiscal year 2016;
       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local 
     businesses and gateway communities;
       Whereas visitation to the National Wildlife Refuge System 
     increased by nearly 30 percent from 2006 to 2016;
       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences 
     more than 50,000,000 visits each year, which generate more 
     than $2,400,000,000 in sales and 35,000 jobs in local 
     economies;
       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses 
     every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including 
     temperate, tropical and boreal forests, wetlands, deserts, 
     grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and spans 12 
     time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;
       Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 
     species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 species of 
     reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 species of fish;
       Whereas national wildlife refuges are the primary Federal 
     lands on which the production, migration, and wintering 
     habitat for waterfowl are fostered;
       Whereas, since 1934, the sale of the Federal Duck Stamp to 
     outdoor enthusiasts has generated more than $850,000,000 in 
     funds, which has enabled the purchase or lease of more than 
     5,700,000 acres of habitat for waterfowl and numerous other 
     species in the National Wildlife Refuge System;
       Whereas refuges provide protection to more than 380 
     threatened and endangered species;
       Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation 
     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the 
     Federal Government, State governments, private landowners, 
     and organizations in efforts to secure the wildlife heritage 
     of the United States;
       Whereas more than 40,000 volunteers and approximately 200 
     national wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute 
     more than 1,350,000 volunteer hours annually, the equivalent 
     of nearly 650 full-time employees, and provide an important 
     link to local communities;
       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important 
     opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater 
     appreciation for the natural world;
       Whereas there are national wildlife refuges located in 
     several urban and suburban areas and there is a refuge 
     located within a 1 hour drive of every metropolitan area in 
     the United States, which has enabled national wildlife 
     refuges to employ, educate, and engage young people from all 
     backgrounds in exploring, connecting with, and preserving the 
     natural heritage of the United States;
       Whereas, since 1995, refuges across the United States have 
     held festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other 
     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the 
     second full week of October;
       Whereas the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has 
     designated the week beginning on October 8, 2017, as 
     ``National Wildlife Refuge Week''; and
       Whereas the designation of National Wildlife Refuge Week by 
     the Senate would recognize more than a century of 
     conservation in the United States, raise awareness about the 
     importance of wildlife and the National Wildlife Refuge 
     System, and celebrate the myriad recreational opportunities 
     available to enjoy this network of protected lands: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week beginning on October 8, 2017, as
