his promise to the American people. He said he would discontinue the 
DACA immigration program, which allows hundreds of thousands of illegal 
immigrants to stay in the country and receive work permits.
  By ending the unconstitutional DACA program, he has overturned the 
last of President Obama's amnesty agenda and returned to the rule of 
law. President Obama, a former constitutional law professor, said many 
times that DACA was unconstitutional.

40-year low.
  President Trump is right to discontinue the DACA program and let 
Congress address immigration policies, including securing the border.
