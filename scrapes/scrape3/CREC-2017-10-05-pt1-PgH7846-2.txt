                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, 585, the number of people murdered and 
injured in Las Vegas on Sunday during the deadliest mass shooting in 
U.S. history.
  477, the number of days since the previous deadliest mass shooting in 
U.S. history in Orlando.
  521, the number of mass shootings since Orlando.
  91, the average number of Americans killed by gun violence every day.
  69, the number of homicides in Charlotte in 2017.
  Zero, the number of actions taken by Congress to address the gun 
violence epidemic in our country.
  When is enough enough? What is it going to take for Congress to end 
gun violence?
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stop wasting time and demand 
that a joint select committee be established to combat gun violence and 
the bipartisan King-Thompson bill be brought to the floor for a vote.
  It is time that we had the moral courage to act. Our Nation can't 
wait, and they shouldn't.
