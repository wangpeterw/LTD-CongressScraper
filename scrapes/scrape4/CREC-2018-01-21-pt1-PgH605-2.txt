                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Almighty God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. You have 
promised, O God, that You are with us wherever we are and whatever we 
are doing, to heal and to help, to give strength and make us whole.
  We pray that we all, and the Members of this assembly especially, 
will be receptive to Your promises and receive them with confidence and 
conviction, that, armed by Your spirit, we will be able to forge good 
solutions to the current impasse which promote justice, equity, and 
truth.
  Pardon us as we have missed the mark to this point, and yet we pray 
that we will be faithful messengers of Your Word and steadfast stewards 
of all Your gifts.
  May all that is done today be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
