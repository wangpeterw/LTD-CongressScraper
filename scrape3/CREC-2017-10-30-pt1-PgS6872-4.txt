                       TRIBUTE TO DAWNA DIANGELIS

 Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Ohioan Dawna 
DiAngelis for 30 years of service to the Canton Repository.
  Unlike many others in the news industry whom I have honored on the 
Senate floor before, you will not see Dawna's name in a byline or 
anywhere else in the paper, but make no mistake, the folks in Stark 
County can count on their news each day because of Dawna and her team 
in the production room.
  The ``Canton Repository'' has kept Stark County residents informed 
since 1815, but it wasn't until 172 years later, in 1987, that the 
paper hired its first woman for the Rep's composing room. Dawna became 
the first woman in the male-dominated pre-press department,

the department responsible for the layout and look of every single page 
of the paper.
  Dawna didn't stop there. She went on to earn the position of 
department head--again, the first woman to do so in the history of the 
paper. For the last 30 years, she has served behind the scenes to 
produce thousands of editions of the Repository. Dawna and her husband, 
J.D., have both served the Canton community--Dawna at the Rep and J.D. 
at WHBC radio.
  Dawna's work in the composing room has guaranteed that Canton 
residents get to read their news each day, and while doing her day job, 
she paved the way for other women in the news industry to follow.
  I join the entire Canton community and Dawna's colleagues at the Rep 
in congratulating her for her 30-year anniversary at the 
Repository.
