                  FREEDOM FROM BURDENSOME REGULATIONS

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, last week, I started ``Freedom Friday'' to 
highlight freedom-killing regulations currently in effect.
  Congress used the Congressional Review Act to overturn 14 regulations 
implemented in the waning days of the Obama administration. The repeal 
of these rules alone could save the economy millions of hours of 
paperwork--as much as $3.7 billion in regulatory costs to Federal 
agencies and up to $35 billion in compliance costs for industries. This 
is a nice start, but we are not done yet.
  My main priority here in Congress is to restore the constitutional 
parameters of the Federal Government and end overregulation. The first 
regulation that I will be highlighting for ``Freedom Friday'' is an 
overly burdensome restriction on our trucking industry. California and 
the Ninth Circuit have imposed more stringent standards for truckers 
than those established by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration.
  There are some issues over which Congress has clear constitutional 
authority. This is one of them. We simply cannot allow our vital 
interstate commerce to fall victim to an incoherent patchwork of 
burdensome regulations. Our economic and national security depend on 
resisting this ominous trend.
