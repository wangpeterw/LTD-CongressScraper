                 TRUMPCARE DROPS MILLIONS FROM COVERAGE

  (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thought the Republican plan for repealing 
the Affordable Care Act and dropping 24 million Americans from 
healthcare coverage could not get any worse, but I was wrong. The 
latest iteration of TrumpCare still drops millions from their coverage, 
but will now make coverage worse and more expensive for those who can 
get it.
  I believe all Americans deserve protections for the coverage of 
essential health services and preexisting conditions, not just Members 
of Congress. Swiss cheese insurance plans that don't cover ER visits or 
prescriptions and charge you more if you have ever been sick aren't 
worth the paper they are printed on.
  This bill undermines our healthcare system in so many damaging ways. 
And for what?
  Let's not forget that the bill includes nearly $600 billion in tax 
breaks for drug companies, insurers, and the wealthy. Millionaires 
would get an average annual tax cut of more than $50,000 while 
hardworking families and older Americans would struggle to afford 
meaningful coverage.
  I won't stand for a bill that endangers the well-being of my 
constituents to benefit the very wealthiest Americans. I urge my 
colleagues to do the same.
