                      CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, this year we are again experiencing 
terrible gun violence that destroys lives, tears apart families, 
devastates communities, and is leaving a stain on our Nation.
  Sadly, after thousands of senseless deaths, after Sandy Hook, after 
the Pulse nightclub, after Las Vegas, and after so many more, this body 
has taken no action, just the now tragically routine moments of silence 
and then back to business as usual.
  But this week Congress will, in fact, take action, action making it 
easier for dangerous people to carry concealed guns throughout the 
country. It is inconceivable to me that this bill is what comes to the 
floor from the debate about gun safety.
  Concealed carry reciprocity allows people from States with the 
loosest safety standards or no safety standards at all to carry a 
firearm across the country irrespective of local laws.
  I will give one example. In my State of Illinois, people who have two 
DUIs within 5 years cannot get a concealed carry permit. But this bill 
would override our State law, rendering our and every other State 
legislature virtually helpless to protect their own citizens.
  I rise today in strong opposition to the reckless and dangerous 
concealed carry reciprocity bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same.
