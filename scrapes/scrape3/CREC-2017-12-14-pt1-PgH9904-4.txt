                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. CURTIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, the House is in the midst of historic tax 
reform. Now that the House and Senate have almost reached agreement, I 
would like to take a moment to express a few ideals that I hope will be 
guiding principles as we complete this process.
  The final tax bill should cut taxes for all Americans while also 
retaining important incentives making homeownership, raising a family, 
and obtaining higher education possible.
  Additionally, the bill should continue to uphold American values by 
encouraging our people to be generous and charitable.
  The lowering of our corporate tax rates is critical. As a former 
business owner, I know firsthand the difficulty of the tax burden.
  Most importantly, the bill must help working American families keep 
more of their hard-earned money.
  I am confident that Congress will deliver on its promise to simplify 
the Tax Code and to cut taxes for all Americans. I know that this 
historic legislation will spur economic growth and prosperity.
