                     LET'S FIX HEALTHCARE TOGETHER

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the Republican healthcare plan, TrumpCare, 
has fallen apart in the Senate, naturally.
  After 7 months in office attempting to govern exclusively on their 
own, Republicans have shown once again that they can't govern. They 
control the House, the Senate, and the White House.
  Repealing the Affordable Care Act is their primary goal and signature 
achievement. They can't do it. Why? Because the American people get in 
the way. They said ``no,'' and enough Members of the Senate have 
responded to that.
  But now the Republican plan looks like it is to simply repeal the 
Affordable Care Act with no replacement. It will take us back to a time 
where you could have an annual or lifetime cap and could not get 
insurance if you had a preexisting condition. Thirty-two million people 
would lose their healthcare coverage overnight.
  That is the Republican plan?
  We need to work together. We need to come together and fix the 
problems that we see and not make this such a partisan issue.
