              PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PLAYING A DANGEROUS GAME

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, $15 billion for a wall. I thought Mexico was 
going to pay for it. Mr. Speaker, President Trump is playing a 
dangerous game with North Korea. He is playing a dangerous game with 
American lives.
  The President probably thinks he is being clever when he taunts Kim 
Jong-un and calls him ``little rocket man.'' The President probably 
thinks he is a tough guy when he threatens to rain down fire and fury 
on North Korea. But the President is not clever, and he is not tough.
  A clever President would know that peace is preferable to war. A 
tough President would understand that threatening war with a highly 
armed, petty dictator makes the United States look weak and risks 
American lives.
  President Trump's saber-rattling could draw the country into nuclear 
war that no one wants. If the United States is drawn into a war for the 
President's ego, people will die, Americans will die, and thousands, if 
not millions, of North Koreans will die.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mitchell). Members are reminded to 
refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President.
