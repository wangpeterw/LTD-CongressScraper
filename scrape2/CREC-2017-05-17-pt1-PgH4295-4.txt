                VETERANS DESERVE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Mental 
Health Awareness Month to talk about a growing group of individuals who 
need our help: our veterans.
  More than 16 percent of veterans have been diagnosed with a 
depressive disorder. Up to 43 percent struggle with symptoms of mental 
health issues, such as drinking excessively, smoking, or sleeplessness. 
These struggles have resulted in an unacceptably high suicide rate for 
our veterans. Every day, 20 veterans take their own lives, which is 
almost double the rate of nonveterans.
  Mr. Speaker, this is heartbreaking. It is unacceptable, and we must 
act. That is why I was proud today to join with

Congressman Tim Ryan in introducing the Veterans Wellness Act of 2017.
  This bill brings mental healthcare to our veterans by establishing a 
2-year grant program to provide wellness care and additional therapies 
at veteran service organizations like the American Legion, the VFW, and 
AMVETS. Many offer skilled assistance with VA enrollment that could 
help our veterans get the care that they so desperately need.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to ensure 
our veterans receive the best care possible.
