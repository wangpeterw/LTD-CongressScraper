minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three individuals 
who serve in local government in Arizona: Steve Chucri, Brigette 
Peterson, and Nora Ellen.
  This month, Steve Chucri's colleagues on the Maricopa County Board of 
Supervisors voted to elevate him to chairman of the board. Steve has 
served on that board since 2013.
  Last week, the Gilbert Town Council chose Brigette Peterson as their 
vice mayor. Brigette has served on the council since 2015.
  Last Thursday, the Chandler City Council voted to appoint Nora Ellen 
as their vice mayor. Nora has served on the council since 2013.
  Mr. Speaker, serving in local government isn't always glamorous, but 
these individuals and their colleagues demonstrate commitment to their 
constituents on a daily basis. Our communities are fortunate to have 
Steve, Brigette, and Nora at these posts. I wish them well in their new 
roles and look forward to working with them in 2018.
