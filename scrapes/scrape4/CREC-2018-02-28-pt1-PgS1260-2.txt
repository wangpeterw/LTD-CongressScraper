                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2464

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.
  The clerk will read the bill by title for the second time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 2464) to improve border security and to provide 
     conditional provision residence to certain long-term 
     residents who entered the United States as children.

  Mr. CORNYN. In order to place the bill on the calendar under the 
provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar.
