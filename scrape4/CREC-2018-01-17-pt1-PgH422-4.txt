                        RECOGNIZING MARIA ALONSO

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate and recognize 
the president and CEO of United Way of Miami-Dade County, Maria Alonso.
  The United Way of Miami-Dade is an organization committed to helping 
those most in need to lead successful lives. As its new president and 
CEO of the United Way chapter of Miami-Dade, Maria will continue to 
build on its mission of changing lives through education, financial 
stability, and health.
  For more than 3 decades, Maria has dedicated her life to improving 
the lives of others. Ms. Alonso has also chaired numerous south Florida 
institutions, such as the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, and served 
on the boards of The Miami Foundation, Camillus House, the Miami-Dade 
College Foundation, the March of Dimes, and Teach For America.
  Maria's vision of a stronger and united Miami is not only inspiring, 
but the very foundation of the work of the United Way of Miami-Dade 
that it brings to our community.
  Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to represent individuals like Maria, and I 
thank her for this invaluable work to empower individuals to live 
healthier and more fulfilling lives.
