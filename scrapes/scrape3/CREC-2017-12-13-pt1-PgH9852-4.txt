                        IMPORTANCE OF TAX REFORM

  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to emphasize the importance 
of the reductions and reforms reflected in H.R. 1, which the conference 
committee will work on today.
  People in my district and across America await meaningful tax reform. 
Most Americans paid too much in taxes. In fact, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reported last year that Americans paid more money in taxes 
than they spent on food and clothing. It is no wonder that nearly 60 
percent of Americans believe our current Tax Code is unfair--it is.
  America's Tax Code is currently chock full of special interest deals, 
while families living paycheck to paycheck and job creators need lower 
and simpler taxes now.
  Throughout this process, my approach has been to evaluate this tax 
legislation from one question: Will this improve the lives of the vast 
majority of the people in my district?
  That answer is, absolutely, yes.
  The Tax Foundation projects that the House plan will save the average 
family in Michigan about $2,200 a year. That is real money.
  Americans deserve to keep more of what they earn. I look forward to 
reviewing the conference report and finalizing the tax reduction 
package that will provide relief to all Americans.
