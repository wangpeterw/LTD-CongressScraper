           RECOGNIZING KAYLA BARRON, NASA ASTRONAUT CANDIDATE

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Kayla Barron of 
Richland, Washington, who was recently selected for NASA's 2017 
Astronaut Candidate Class. Kayla was chosen 1 of 12 from over 18,000 
applicants to join just 338 people who have held the prestigious title 
of American astronaut.
  Before applying to the NASA program, Ms. Barron attended the U.S. 
Naval Academy, where she received several medals and unit commendations 
while earning a bachelor's degree in systems engineering. She went on 
to earn a master's degree in nuclear engineering from the University of 
Cambridge. She was a member of the first class of women commissioned 
into the submarine community as a submarine warfare officer.
  Kayla is an exemplary role model for students interested in science 
and technology. I commend her for her hard work, and I wish her luck in 
her training and her future exploration endeavors.
