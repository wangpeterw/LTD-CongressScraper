CONGRATULATING FOOD BANK OF SOUTHERN TIER, 2017'S FOOD BANK OF THE YEAR

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Food Bank 
of the Southern Tier in Broome County and Tioga County for being 2017's 
Food Bank of the Year, nationally. Out of 200 locations across the 
country, the Food Bank of the Southern Tier was ranked number one.
  Last year, our food bank distributed more than 9 million meals 
throughout the southern tier. Over 40 percent of those meals were given 
to children and 14 percent to seniors.
  Through their work with mobile food pantries and the BackPack 
Program, the food bank has increased access to healthy food for all, 
distributing 2.2 million pounds of fresh produce to southern tier 
families.
  Today, I would like to thank President Natasha Thompson and the 
incredible volunteers who have worked tirelessly in their mission to 
build and sustain hunger-free communities. Your work has had a profound 
impact on ending hunger in our community. Thank you again for your 
dedicated service to the families of the southern tier.
