HONORING U.S. CHESS TEAM FOR ITS GOLD MEDAL VICTORY AT 42ND WORLD CHESS 
                                OLYMPIAD

  (Mr. LUETKEMEYER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the U.S. Chess 
Team for its historic victory in the 42nd Chess Olympiad held in Baku, 
Azerbaijan, this past September.
  The last time the United States won this competition was 40 years ago 
at the 1976 Chess Olympiad in Haifa, Israel. At that time, the gold 
medal was determined by the outcome of a single game that lasted 14 
hours and contained 111 moves, and eventually ended in our favor.
  The final round in Baku was even more strategic, with the gold medal 
determined by a brilliant final move. The game was close, but the 
United States Chess Team took home the gold once again.
  Today I would like to honor the six members of the winning chess team 
as well as their coach. This was a great accomplishment for the United 
States. I am honored to have the opportunity in Congress to recognize 
them.
  For the next 2 years, the Olympiad trophy will rest and be on display 
at the World Chess Hall of Fame in St. Louis, Missouri. I look forward 
to recognizing the team's accomplishments in my home State.
