                  TAX CUTS AND MORE JOBS FOR MONTANANS

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase 
paychecks for hardworking Montanans, create Montana jobs, and unleash 
economic growth.
  In fact, analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation finds the bill 
will create nearly 2,900 Montana jobs and will increase income for 
median Montana households by $2,200.
  Hardworking Montanans will see a big tax break by cutting their rates 
and by doubling the standard deduction. Montana families will benefit 
from an increased child tax credit.
  Today, only about one in four Montanans itemize their deductions--
filling out stacks of paperwork for hours after saving piles of 
receipts. With tax reform, those days are over. Under the new plan, 
nine out of ten Americans won't have to itemize to see their full tax 
benefit, and they will file their taxes on something like a postcard.
  I am proud to vote for tax reform that will create thousands of 
Montana jobs, ensure hardworking Montanans keep more of what they earn, 
and help small businesses.
