                      RECOGNIZING ALBERTO CARVALHO

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alberto 
Carvalho, the superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the 
Nation's fourth largest school system, with more than 500,000 students.

[[Page H1381]]

  For the past decade, Alberto has worked tirelessly on behalf of 
students and educators throughout my congressional district. His 
efforts have propelled Miami-Dade public schools into a position of 
national prominence, and it is now one of the Nation's highest 
performing urban school systems.
  Recently, Mr. Carvalho was offered the opportunity of a lifetime to 
run the largest school system in the country, and that is chancellor of 
New York City schools, but he showed his dedication and commitment to 
south Florida's students and teachers when he decided to stay in Miami-
Dade. As a former Florida certified teacher, I am so glad that he is 
staying to continue leading Miami-Dade County Public Schools.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of our grateful community and countless 
individuals who have been positively impacted by Alberto Carvalho's 
unwavering dedication, I want to say: Thank you, ``friend,'' ``amigo.'' 
Please stay.
