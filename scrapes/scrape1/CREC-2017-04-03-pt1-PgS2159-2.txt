                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Beautiful Savior, You have been our dwelling place in all 
generations, and we are sustained by Your steadfast love. Today, 
surround our Senators with the shield of Your favor as they labor to 
keep our Nation strong.
  Lord, this week our lawmakers must make critical decisions that may 
affect this legislative body for years to come. Teach them to be 
obedient to Your commands, doing Your will, and following Your leading. 
May they be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
  Lord, manifest Your power through their labors so that this Nation 
will remain a shining city on a hill.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
