                        IN MEMORY OF DAN COBORN

  (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of 
Minnesota's very own Dan Coborn.
  Dan Coborn, a native son of the St. Cloud community, recently passed, 
but his memory will live on.
  Dan will be remembered as an executive who helped his family's 
business grow and succeed. He will be remembered as a loving husband 
and father whose wife and five children meant the world to him.

  Perhaps most importantly, Dan Coborn will be remembered for his 
charity and generosity. Over the span of his life, Dan Coborn gave back 
to a number of charities that included the St. Cloud Area Family YMCA, 
Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Minnesota, and the Boys and Girls 
Clubs of Central Minnesota.
  In addition to financially giving back to these charities, he also 
gave his time by serving as a board member of the St. Cloud Hospital 
and the Sauk Rapids-Rice Schools, in addition to serving as a founding 
member of the United Way of Central Minnesota.
  Dan Coborn was a hero in our community, and his passing is a massive 
loss to us all. I wish his family peace during this difficult time, and 
I promise his life's work will not be forgotten.
