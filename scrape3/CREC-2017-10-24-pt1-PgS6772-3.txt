   EXCLUDING POWER SUPPLY CIRCUITS, DRIVERS, AND DEVICES FROM ENERGY 
           CONSERVATION STANDARDS FOR EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLIES

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 97, S. 226.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 226) to exclude power supply circuits, drivers, 
     and devices designed to be connected to, and power, light-
     emitting diodes or organic light-emitting diodes providing 
     illumination or ceiling fans using direct current motors from 
     energy conservation standards for external power supplies.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.
  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered 
read a third time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

     SECTION 1. APPLICATION OF ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS TO 
                   CERTAIN EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLIES.

       (a) Definition of External Power Supply.--Section 
     321(36)(A) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
     U.S.C. 6291(36)(A)) is amended--
       (1) by striking the subparagraph designation and all that 
     follows through ``The term'' and inserting the following:

       ``(i) In general.--The term''; and
       (2) by adding at the end the following:
       ``(ii) Exclusion.--The term `external power supply' does 
     not include a power supply circuit, driver, or device that is 
     designed exclusively to be connected to, and power--

       ``(I) light-emitting diodes providing illumination;
       ``(II) organic light-emitting diodes providing 
     illumination; or
       ``(III) ceiling fans using direct current motors.''.

       (b) Standards for Lighting Power Supply Circuits.--
       (1) Definition.--Section 340(2)(B) of the Energy Policy and 
     Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6311(2)(B)) is amended by 
     striking clause (v) and inserting the following:
       ``(v) electric lights and lighting power supply 
     circuits;''.
       (2) Energy conservation standard for certain equipment.--
     Section 342 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
     U.S.C. 6313) is amended by adding at the end the following:
       ``(g) Lighting Power Supply Circuits.--If the Secretary,

     drivers, or devices described in section 321(36)(A)(ii), the 
     Secretary may prescribe under this part, not earlier than 1 
     year after the date on which a test procedure has been 
     prescribed, an energy conservation standard for such 
     equipment.''.
       (c) Technical Corrections.--
       (1) Section 321(6)(B) of the Energy Policy and Conservation 
     Act (42 U.S.C. 6291(6)(B)) is amended by striking ``(19)''
