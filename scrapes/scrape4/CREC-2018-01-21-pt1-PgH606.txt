                     THE SCHUMER SHUTDOWN CONTINUES

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the editors of 
the National Review explained the Schumer shutdown clearly in their 
editorial, ``Hang Tough, Republicans.''
  In no uncertain terms, Senate Democrats have blocked a bill to keep 
the Federal Government running and fund the Children's Health Insurance 
Program for the next 6 years. Senate Democrats have made a choice not 
to keep the government open.
  A government shutdown does not benefit anyone. It causes irreparable 
harm to our military. Over 100,000 National Guard members will be sent 
home from weekend training, and over 2 million servicemembers will have 
their pay disrupted by the Senate Democrats' partisan politics.
  As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I know that military 
readiness is at risk; yet the government would be fully open for 
business if Democrats had not voted against the bill, a bill that has 
nothing of substance that they oppose, to get leverage for a policy 
they favor.
  This Schumer shutdown could have been avoided if Senate Democrats had 
prioritized funding at-risk children and troops over political 
grandstanding. Sadly, the Democrats' negotiating stance is: Give us 
amnesty or we will make the government shut down and blame you 
Republicans.
  This is an unreasonable position.
  Hang tough, Republicans.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
