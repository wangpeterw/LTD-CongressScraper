                SANCTION THE KGB, MR. PUTIN, AND RUSSIA

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we are not Republicans and we are not 
Democrats. We are Americans, and we draw together around the protecting 
of America's security.
  With that in mind, you can imagine my shock as a member of the 
Judiciary Committee to find out that a KGB agent was in a meeting with 
Jared Kushner, who now has a security clearance, and Donald Trump, Jr., 
among others.
  I was shocked to find out that the lawyer who was present in that 
meeting had a $200 million lawsuit to stop being sued on the money 
laundering, and that that lawsuit was settled by the Trump Justice 
Department for $6 million--$200 million down to $6 million. To the 
American people, that means that the $200 million that was owed to this 
government turned out to be $6 million.
  That is why I will have a resolution to ask the President to step 
down. And, as well, to introduce a resolution--a constitutional 
resolution--to begin a constitutional investigation into whether or not 
we are protected here in this Nation.
  Our security is our greatest priority.
  I would also suggest that the sanctions bill that was voted on in the 
Senate must be voted on in the House now. We cannot still continue to 
hide the ball. Sanction the KGB, sanction Mr. Putin, sanction Russia. 
They are, in fact, here to demolish the democracy of this Nation.
