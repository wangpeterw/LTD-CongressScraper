                      TRUMPCARE IS A TERRIBLE BILL

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this week Republicans plan to 
vote on TrumpCare to push 24 million Americans off healthcare coverage 
and saddle families across the country with massive health costs. 
TrumpCare is an assault on families and a broken promise to the 
American people.
  Twenty-four million people will lose their health insurance. It will 
terminate the assistance that people depend on to afford quality 
coverage. It will destroy the Medicaid program, the bedrock of our 
social safety net for more than 50 years.
  Medicaid covers 74 million children, pregnant women, people with 
disabilities, and seniors with long-term care needs. Under TrumpCare, 
deductibles and out-of-pocket costs will skyrocket and families will be 
exposed to crushing health costs. Premiums will rise dramatically--
particularly, for older Americans--because TrumpCare allows insurance 
companies to charge five times higher than what others pay for the 
average, five times higher for our near senior citizens. This means 
thousands and thousands of dollars more in premiums, which low-income 
seniors cannot afford.
  TrumpCare shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years and 
cuts $880 billion from Medicaid.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible bill, and it puts the entire 
healthcare system at risk.
