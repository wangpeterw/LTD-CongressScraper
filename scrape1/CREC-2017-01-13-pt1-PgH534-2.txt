 RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH AND YOUTH MENTORS ACROSS THE 
                                 NATION

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National 
Mentoring Month and in honor of the youth mentors across RhodeIsland 
and the Nation.
  Every day, mentors enrich the lives of young people. They are 
powerful role models who provide essential support for at-riskyouth.
  Just some of examples of the powerful impact that mentors have in the 
life of young people are that vulnerable young peoplewith mentors are 
more likely to enroll in college and volunteer more regularly than 
their peers. They are 46 percent less likelyto start using drugs and 52 
percent less likely to skip school.
  They are also more likely to develop self-confidence, form healthy 
relationships, and cultivate productive habits.
  Organizations like the Rhode Island Mentoring Partnership and Big 
Brothers Big Sisters lead the way in the Ocean State.Organizations like 
this and mentors across the country are improving our communities one 
child at a time, and I am proud tohonor them as we recognize National 
Mentoring Month this January 2017. I encourage more people to step 
forward and serve asmentors and make a difference in the lives of young 
people.
