             MOURNING THE LOSS OF SOUTHEAST TEXAS SOLDIERS

  (Mr. BABIN asked and was givenpermission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BABIN. Mr.Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
honor two young men who gave their lives in service to the State of 
Texasand the United States when their Apache helicopter crashed in 
Galveston Bay, Texas, during a training mission last week in 
mycongressional district.
  My deepest sympathies go out to the families of Army Chief Warrant 
Officer 2 Lucas Lowe of Daisetta,Texas, a resident of the 36th 
Congressional District, which I represent, and Army Chief Warrant 
Officer 3 Dustin Mortenson ofLeague City, Texas.
  The heartbreaking loss of these two fine Texas Army National Guard 
pilots, assigned to the FirstSquadron 149th Attack Reconnaissance 
Battalion of the 36th Infantry Division, has been felt throughout our 
southeast Texascommunity. Both men tragically leave behind a wife and 
family. Chief Warrant Officer Lucas Lowe's wife, Kami, was also 
pregnantwith twins due next month, in February.
  As a former Texas Guardsman myself, my prayers remain with all those 
who have beenimpacted by this terrible tragedy. As the U.S. Congressman 
for District 36, it is my commitment and duty to the families to 
seethat they get the support they need during this very difficult time.
  Please keep these families in your thoughts and yourprayers. May God 
bless these two soldiers, their families, and all who serve their 
country.
