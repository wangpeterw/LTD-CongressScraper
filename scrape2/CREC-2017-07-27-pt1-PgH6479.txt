               HONORING RAMON ANIBAL RAMOS, A TRUE LEADER

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ramon Anibal 
Ramos, a leading communicator and television producer born in Ingenio 
Angelina, San Pedro de Macoris, in the Dominican Republic.
  Ramon has had a long and successful career. Ramon obtained his 
passport through the `` `Fiesta' de Tele Antillas'' program. His show, 
the ``Ramon Anibal Show,'' is focused on the dissemination of positive 
news, positive stories about people, particularly immigrants that have 
excelled in America, and particularly in New York.
  Throughout all of this time, particularly during the negative anti-
immigrant rhetoric that is going on right now, including this week's 
push to build a divisive border wall, Ramon Anibal is the embodiment of 
being an immigrant, a pioneer, and successful contributor to our 
community.
  Thank you, Ramon, for being such a role model and leader in our 
community.
  Ramon Anibal Ramos, ``the best of cable,'' ``lo mejor del cable.''
