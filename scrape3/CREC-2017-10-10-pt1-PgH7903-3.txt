      MICHIGAN'S UPPER PENINSULA CELEBRATES 40 YEARS OF COMMUNITY 
                             REVITALIZATION

  (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 40 years of 
community revitalization in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
  When Kincheloe Air Force Base closed in 1977, a renewal of the Saulte 
Ste. Marie community began as it transitioned from military to civilian 
use. These 40 years stand as a testament to the hard work and 
resilience of the folks of Chippewa County, who have overcome the job 
loss and revenue loss associated with Kincheloe's closing.
  The transition from military to civilian is not always an easy one, 
but I am proud to represent a region that has remained focused on 
investing in the future of our communities. On this anniversary, we not 
only celebrate our current successes, but we also remember the 
contributions of our past.
  Kincheloe Air Force Base played a significant role in shaping our 
national defense and making our community into what it is today. We are 
forever grateful to the Chippewa County community for preserving that 
history throughout these 40 years.
