                            ABOUT GOVERNANCE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the question we raise this evening is 
about

governance. In the debacle of last Friday, when the administration 
failed to carry forward on its promise to pass the worst healthcare 
bill in the history of the United States, the administration offered a 
definition or an explanation: the ACA was exploding. It is not 
exploding. The CBO has indicated that the ACA needs improving, but it 
has insured some 20 million-plus people and protected children--unlike 
the administration's bill, Mr. Trump's bill which, in fact, would throw 
24 million people off of health care and cut $880 billion. It is about 
governance.
  That is why it is important to have a full investigation of the 
Russian collusion of all of those who are involved in Mr. Trump's 
campaign, and in his administration, including very close members of 
his senior staff.
  That is why we should have a full investigation, which would include 
the Judiciary Committee. I demand that the classified documents that we 
have requested in a bipartisan letter should be given to the Judiciary 
Committee, and we should begin investigations on whether there are any 
questions of criminality.
  It is about governance, Mr. Speaker; and the House of Representatives 
must know the truth so the American people can know the truth.
