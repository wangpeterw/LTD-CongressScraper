                     AMBASSADOR HALEY SPEAKS TRUTH

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, congratulations to 
Ambassador Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina, for 
leadership opposing a misguided U.N. resolution calling for the U.S. to 
lift the Cuban embargo. This was a resolution the Obama administration 
has shamefully abstained from voting on.
  Rather than bow down to the Cuban Communist dictatorship, Ambassador 
Haley stood up to them and stood up for the oppressed people of Cuba.
  Ambassador Haley correctly reviewed: ``The United States opposes this 
resolution today in continued solidarity with the Cuban people and in 
the hope that they will one day be free to choose their own destiny.''
  The economic catastrophe of Cuba is due to the Communist, 
totalitarian dictatorship, not the American embargo. As cited by the 
late Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher: socialism will work until you 
run out of spending other people's money.
  Ambassador Haley's service has ushered in a new era of moral clarity. 
The United States is again a leader for expanded freedom. President 
Donald Trump's commitment to peace through strength is going to make 
the world safer for American families, along with Vice President Mike 
Pence, who is here in the Capitol Building today.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
