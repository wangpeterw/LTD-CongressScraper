                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR LUKE KENLEY

  (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one 
of the most influential legislators in the history of the Indiana 
General Assembly, Luke Kenley, who has recently announced his decision 
to retire after 25 years of service representing District 20 in the 
Indiana State Senate.
  Senator Kenley was an invaluable resource and mentor during my 6 
years of service in the State Senate, and I am grateful that I had the 
opportunity to learn from him.
  Senator Kenley has established himself as a champion of physical 
responsibility and limited government. His accomplishments are too 
numerous to fully list here, but since 2009, he has led

the Senate Appropriations Committee, during which time Indiana passed 
five balanced budgets, cut taxes, invested in priorities, and built a 
substantial rainy day fund. And Senator Kenley has been the architect 
of our State's remarkable fiscal turnaround, and his impact on Hoosiers 
will be felt for generations to come.
  With a national debt approaching $20 trillion, I think it is fair to 
say we could use a lot more of Luke Kenley's style of leadership here 
in our Nation's Capital.
  I wish him well as he prepares to step down on September 30, and I 
thank him for his remarkable service.
