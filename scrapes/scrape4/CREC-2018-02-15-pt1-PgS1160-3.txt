                       TRIBUTE TO NANCY R. MAZZA

  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Nancy R. Mazza 
and congratulate her on her dedicated service to the people of North 
Carolina.
  Nancy previously worked for esteemed Congressman Howard Coble, a dear 
friend who served North Carolina for three decades and passed away in 
2015. After Congressman Coble's retirement in 2014, I was fortunate 
enough to hire Nancy in my High Point office.
  Nancy's addition to my team was instrumental in getting our 
constituent service operation off the ground and running. Nancy has 
been an absolutely indispensable mentor and leader on our team. She has 
trained many of our staff members, generously sharing her wealth of 
casework experience and expertise.
  Over the course of her distinguished career, Nancy has helped 
expedite thousands of passports, assisted countless veterans who were 
struggling to get answers and service from the VA, and inquired on 
behalf of many other North Carolinians when they needed assistance and 
had nowhere else to turn.
  Anyone who has ever interacted with Nancy can immediately tell that 
she has a heart of gold and a dedicated passion for public service that 
is driven by kindness and compassion.
  While Nancy Mazza will be sorely missed by our office, I am eternally 
grateful for the work that she did on behalf on North Carolinians. I 
wish her the very best in retirement.

                          ____________________
