                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Merciful God, thank You for giving us another day.
  Your care and wisdom are shown to us by the way You extend Your 
kingdom into our world down to the present day. Your Word reveals every 
aspect of Your saving plan. You accomplish Your designed purpose in and 
through the hearts of the faithful who respond to You.
  Today, convert our minds and hearts that we may become the great 
Nation You hope us to be.
  Help the Members of the people's House to seek Your presence in the 
midst of their busy lives. Animate them with Your spirit, and help them 
to perform their appointed tasks to come to solutions that will redound 
to the benefit of our Nation.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
