      RECOGNIZING SOUTHEASTERN KENTUCKY REHABILITATION INDUSTRIES

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the work of 
the Southeastern Kentucky Rehabilitation Industries, SEKRI, a nonprofit 
organization in Corbin, KY, which helps provide employment 
opportunities for individuals with disabilities.
  Before its founding in 1971, men and women with mental or physical 
disabilities in southeastern Kentucky often struggled to find real 
opportunities for employment. Since SEKRI was established, it has 
helped many men and women find work. Seventy-five percent of SEKRI's 
workforce is comprised of individuals with disabilities who produce 
garments such as caps and protective gear for the Armed Forces. Today 
SEKRI has five plants, four of which are in Kentucky, and employs over 
550 individuals throughout the region. SEKRI plans to open its sixth 
plant in Pineville, KY, this year.
  For more than 45 years, SEKRI has helped hundreds of workers with 
disabilities in eastern Kentucky participate in the workforce. I would 
like to commend SEKRI for its many contributions to the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky.
