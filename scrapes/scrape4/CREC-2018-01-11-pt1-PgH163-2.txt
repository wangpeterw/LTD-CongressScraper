                       SPOTLIGHT ON RURAL AMERICA

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank President Trump for 
shining a big, beautiful spotlight on rural America.
  My district has 17 rural counties, and for far too long, our 
hardworking farmers in these communities have felt forgotten by past 
Presidents. But thanks to the Trump administration's new policies and 
renewed support, that is no longer the case.
  This week, President Trump highlighted rural America when he 
addressed the American Farm Bureau Federation's national convention, 
making him the first President to do so since George H.W. Bush in 1992.
  In his address, President Trump pledged to work with Congress to pass 
the farm bill on time, critical legislation that supports our farmers. 
I am a proud member of the House Agriculture Committee, and we have 
already been hard at work crafting this year's legislation.
  The President also signed an executive order expanding access to 
rural broadband. In today's world, broadband is not a luxury; it is 
critical and a necessity. My constituents need accessible, affordable 
rural broadband in their homes, schools, and businesses. It is critical 
for economic development.
  President Trump is implementing concrete solutions to make a 
difference for my constituents in rural Georgia as well as Americans 
across this Nation. Together with the Trump administration and my 
colleagues in Congress, I will continue my hard work to ensure that 
rural America is never forgotten.
