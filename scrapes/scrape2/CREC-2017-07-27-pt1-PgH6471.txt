           RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AMERICAN FARMER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, with the fall season fast approaching, 
Bucks County's robust agricultural community is in full swing with the 
impending harvests, summer fairs, community projects, and recognition 
of the important work of the American farm family.
  In a few weeks, Bucks County will celebrate their 69th annual 
Middletown Grange Fair. From Wednesday, August 16, through Sunday, 
August 20, attendees from across our community

will have the amazing opportunity to come together to enjoy live 
entertainment, timeless carnival rides, tons of local food, animal 
demonstrations, and 4-H projects on display.
  Crowds will gather to see the antique equipment competition and 
exhibits in hundreds of categories ranging from a variety of 
vegetables, tomatoes, fresh flowers, and livestock to handcrafted 
quilts, jewelry, and woodwork.
  Mr. Speaker, as an annual attendee, I have seen firsthand how the 
Grange Fair brings our community together to enjoy the refreshing 
success of our local agricultural community. It is an event that helps 
people gain a better appreciation of the importance of agriculture and 
how the agricultural industry sustains our local economy--not to 
mention all of the jobs that it creates.
  We love our farmers in Bucks County. They have contributed so much to 
our community. They are an indispensable part of Bucks County's past, 
and they will remain an indispensable part of Bucks County's future.
