                      TRIBUTE TO FLORENCE NEMPHOS

 Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and 
extend my sincerest congratulations and happy birthday wishes to 
Florence Nemphos. On August 17, 2017, Florence celebrated her 100th 
birthday.
  Florence Nemphos was born in Saugus, MA, on August 17, 1917 to two 
loving parents, Annie LeBrun and Richard LeBlanc. Florence has been a 
resident of Seabrook, NH, for the past 34 years. Florence is known as 
an outstanding woman and a vital and active member of her tightknit 
community.
  For over 40 years, Florence has dedicated part of every week to 
playing bingo at the American Legion of Seabrook and the Seabrook Fire 
Association with members of the Seabrook community that she calls her 
bingo buddies.
  As Senator for New Hampshire, I would like to honor Florence on the 
occasion of her 100th birthday. I join with Florence's friends and 
family, as well as many, many people in her hometown of Seabrook and 
across the Granite State, in wishing her a very happy 100th 
birthday.
