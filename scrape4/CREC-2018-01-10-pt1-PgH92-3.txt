                     ABOLISH HUMAN TRAFFICKING DAY

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Keisha was 16 years old when she ran 
away from a foster family to avoid being sexually assaulted by that 
family. She thought she was finally safe from abuse when she met a man 
named Mastur D.
  Mastur D promised her that he would return her to her biological 
family. But he lied. He forced her to have sex with other men for 
money. Now she found herself to be a trafficked victim of the sex slave 
trade.
  Mr. Speaker, she was arrested for prostitution. After her second 
arrest, authorities finally rescued her from the trafficking scourge 
and provided her a way out of that situation.
  My legislation, the Abolish Human Trafficking Act, will increase 
prosecutions for perpetrators of human trafficking, like Mastur D, and 
hold those accountable for their crimes of sex slavery.
  We must support victims of human trafficking and put their predators 
where they belong: behind bars. Tomorrow is Abolish Human Trafficking 
Day, our society must prosecute the traffickers and rescue victims of 
this scourge on America.
  And that is just the way it is.
