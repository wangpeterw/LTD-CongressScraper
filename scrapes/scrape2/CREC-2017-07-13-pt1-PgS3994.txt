                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS

  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:

       POM-54. A resolution adopted by the House of 
     Representatives of the State of Louisiana memorializing the 
     United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary 
     to support the domestic beef industry; to the Committee on 
     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.

                        House Resolution No. 129

       Whereas, the value of the domestic beef industry is a vital 
     and integral part of the United States economy; and
       Whereas, the 2016 economic impact was approximately sixty-
     seven billion in farm cash receipts for cattle and calves; 
     and
       Whereas, there are over nine hundred thousand total cattle 
     and calf operations in the United States of which ninety-one 
     percent are family owned or individually operated, and eleven 
     percent are operated by women; and
       Whereas, domestic beef production in 2017 is estimated to 
     be approximately twenty-five billion eight hundred million 
     pounds; and
       Whereas, the amount of beef consumed in the United States 
     in 2016 was approximately twenty-five billion six hundred 
     million pounds; and
       Whereas, it is essential to the success of the domestic 
     beef industry to increase international trade to key export 
     markets; and
       Whereas, the promotion of policies which highlight the 
     quality, safety, sustainability, and nutritional value of 
     domestic beef will drive growth in domestic beef exports; and
       Whereas, it is in the nation's best interest to protect 
     against legislative policies or agency regulations that have 
     a negative impact on the economic health of the domestic beef 
     industry; and
       Whereas, minor changes in future domestic beef import or 
     export levels can significantly change the net beef supply 
     and beef prices; and
       Whereas, important steps to supporting the domestic beef 
     industry include developing a comprehensive national strategy 
     for including beef in future dietary guidelines and investing 
     in necessary research to improve productivity and efficiency; 
     and
       Whereas, it is critical to the success of the domestic beef 
     industry to identify barriers and develop strategies to 
     attract and enable the next generation of farmers into the 
     domestic beef industry; and
       Whereas, terrorist attacks have heightened the nation's 
     awareness of agriterrorism and placed a renewed focus on 
     ensuring the protection of the nation's critical 
     infrastructures, including the domestic beef food supply; and
       Whereas, an intentional contamination of the domestic beef 
     food supply could harm millions of people and cripple our 
     vast agriculture system; and
       Whereas, it is critical to preserve the United States 
     domestic beef supply and prevent reliance on foreign nations 
     for food; and
       Whereas, it will be necessary to develop a variety of 
     federal actions to support the domestic beef industry 
     including proposals which encourage domestic beef production, 
     improve consumer demand, protect our nation's critical 
     infrastructure, attract new farmers, improve the business 
     climate, and increase trade to export markets. Therefore be 
     it
       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 
     Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the 
     United States to take such actions as are necessary to 
     support the domestic beef industry. Be it further
       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be 
     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and 
     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and 
     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United 
     States Congress.
                                  ____

       POM-55. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada expressing the support of the Nevada 
     Legislature for the enactment and use of the Antiquities Act 
     and the designation of the Basin and Range National Monument 
     and the Gold Butte National Monument in this State; to the 
     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 13

       Whereas, The provisions of 54 U.S.C. 320301, commonly 
     referred to as the ``Antiquities Act,'' authorize the 
     President of the United States to designate as national 
     monuments any historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric 
     structures and other objects of historic or scientific 
     interest that are located on land owned or controlled by the 
     Federal Government; and
       Whereas, The Gold Butte National Monument was designated as 
     a national monument under the Antiquities Act to protect and 
     preserve approximately 300,000 acres of public lands in Clark 
     County, Nevada; and
       Whereas, Desert Bighorn Sheep, Gila Monsters, Desert 
     Tortoises and other species of concern live in the Gold Butte 
     National Monument; and
       Whereas, As a way to honor their ancestral lands, the Moapa 
     Band of Paiute Indians and the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe have 
     supported the designation of the Gold Butte National Monument 
     because it is rich with cultural artifacts and sublime 
     petroglyphs; and
       Whereas, The Basin and Range National Monument was 
     designated as a national monument under the Antiquities Act 
     to protect and preserve approximately 700,000 acres of public 
     land in Lincoln and Nye Counties, Nevada; and
       Whereas, The Basin and Range National Monument provides 
     vital habitat for Desert Bighorn Sheep, Gila Monsters, Rocky 
     Mountain Elk, mule deer, various kinds of sagebrush and many 
     other species of concern; and
       Whereas, The Basin and Range National Monument protects 
     many cultural artifacts which date from the early human 
     inhabitants of the area encompassed by the Basin and Range 
     National Monument to the creation of one of the world's 
     greatest works of art, entitled ``City,'' by world renowned 
     artist Michael Heizer; and
       Whereas, Hunting, hiking and hundreds of miles of motorized 
     access are allowed in both the Basin and Range National 
     Monument and the Gold Butte National Monument; and
       Whereas, The residents of this State have long benefitted 
     from the designation of the Lehman Caves National Monument by 
     former President of the United States Warren G. Harding and 
     the subsequent inclusion of the Lehman Caves National 
     Monument in the Great Basin National Park; and
       Whereas, Outdoor recreation activities generate 
     approximately $15 billion dollars in direct consumer spending 
     each year in the State of Nevada and approximately $1 billion 
     dollars in state and local tax revenue; and
       Whereas, The designation of the Basin and Range National 
     Monument and the Gold Butte Monument will increase tourism 
     and protect important wildlife habitat and cultural resources 
     in this State; and
       Whereas, Former President of the United States Theodore 
     Roosevelt first used the Antiquities Act in 1906 and 16 
     former presidents in the last 111 years, of whom 8 were 
     Republicans and 8 were Democrats, have used the Antiquities 
     Act to protect the natural, cultural, and historic heritage 
     of the United States; and
       Whereas, The designation of national monuments is a 
     uniquely American idea and the Antiquities Act was enacted to 
     preserve worthy public lands as national monuments for future 
     generations; and
       Whereas, Many unique sites, including, without limitation, 
     the Grand Canyon, the Statue of Liberty and sites that 
     celebrate and memorialize American history from slavery to 
     civil rights battles, have been protected under the 
     Antiquities Act; and
       Whereas, The designation of national monuments provides 
     additional protections for public lands which are held in 
     trust for all Americans, including public lands which are 
     available for traditional uses such as hunting, fishing, 
     grazing, tribal wood and herbal gathering and other 
     historical uses; and
       Whereas, The beneficial use of renewable land, water and 
     wildlife resources is essential to the long-term economy of 
     this State; and

[[Page S3995]]

       Whereas, The management of national monuments is guided by 
     plans developed with input from state, local and tribal 
     governments, members of the public and other stakeholders; 
     and
       Whereas, Landscapes which are protected and remain intact 
     are important to cultural and traditional activities for all 
     residents of this State; and
       Whereas, National monuments which recognize and protect the 
     contributions, histories, cultures and spiritual beliefs of 
     tribal communities and communities of color are some of the 
     most precious public lands of the United States and are 
     deserving of protection and are important in telling a more 
     complete and inclusive history of the United States; and
       Whereas, Recent polls indicate that approximately 81 
     percent of the residents of this State support keeping in 
     place existing national monuments such as the Basin and Range 
     National Monument and the Gold Butte National Monument; now, 
     therefore, be it,
       Resolved, by the Assembly and Senate of the State of 
     Nevada, jointly, That the members of the 79th Session of the 
     Nevada Legislature affirm and support the designation of the 
     Basin and Range National Monument and the Gold Butte National 
     Monument under the Antiquities Act; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature supports the 
     enactment and use of the Antiquities Act as a critical tool 
     for protecting the public good by authorizing the designation 
     of national monuments under the Antiquities Act; and be it 
     further
       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature urges Congress to 
     oppose efforts to weaken the Antiquities Act or to reverse 
     the designation of any national monument under the 
     Antiquities Act; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the 
     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the 
     presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of 
     the United States House of Representatives and each member of 
     the Nevada Congressional Delegation.
                                  ____

       POM-56. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada expressing opposition to the development 
     of a repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level 
     radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain in the State of Nevada; 
     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 10

       Whereas, Since 1954, when the Atomic Energy Act was passed 
     by Congress, the Federal Government has been responsible for 
     the disposal of radioactive waste, yet few environmental 
     challenges have proven more daunting than the problems posed 
     by the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level 
     radioactive waste; and
       Whereas, Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, 
     42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 10101 et seq., as amended, the Department 
     of Energy has been studying Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada 
     as a possible site for a repository for spent nuclear fuel 
     and high-level radioactive waste; and
       Whereas, In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy 
     Act of 1982, 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 10101 et seq., specifying 
     Yucca Mountain as the sole location for the placement of a 
     national repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level 
     radioactive waste; and
       Whereas, The State of Nevada has since opposed the 
     placement of a repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-
     level radioactive waste in the State due to the extremely 
     dangerous nature of such waste, the persistence of that 
     danger for an extended period of time, the potential harm to 
     the environment of the State and the serious and unacceptable 
     hazard to the health and welfare of the people of Nevada that 
     is posed by the placement of such a repository in the State; 
     and
       Whereas, The transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-
     level radioactive waste to a repository at Yucca Mountain 
     poses serious and unacceptable risks to the environment, 
     economy and residents of Las Vegas, Nevada, the largest city 
     in the State; and
       Whereas, In 2001, the Nevada Legislature enacted NRS 
     353.2655 creating the Nevada Protection Account which must be 
     used to protect the State of Nevada and its residents through 
     funding activities to prevent the location of a repository 
     for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at 
     Yucca Mountain; and
       Whereas, In 2002, the United States Senate and House of 
     Representatives approved the site at Yucca Mountain as a 
     repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive 
     waste, thereby overriding the notice of disapproval submitted 
     by the Governor of the State of Nevada; and
       Whereas, On June 3, 2008, the Department of Energy 
     submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission a license 
     application for construction authorization of a repository 
     for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at 
     Yucca Mountain; and
       Whereas, On March 3, 2010, the Department of Energy filed a 
     motion with the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the 
     Nuclear Regulatory Commission whereby the Department moved to 
     withdraw the pending license application that was filed in 
     2008 and asked the Board to dismiss its application with 
     prejudice; and
       Whereas, The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board denied the 
     Department of Energy's motion on June 29, 2010; and
       Whereas, In 2011, after stating that it found itself evenly 
     divided on whether to take the affirmative action of 
     overturning or upholding the June 29, 2010, decision by the 
     Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, the Nuclear Regulatory 
     Commission suspended the licensing adjudicatory proceeding 
     that began with such decision; and
       Whereas, For the Fiscal Year 2012, the United States 
     Congress ended funding of the repository at Yucca Mountain 
     and has not subsequently appropriated any new funds to the 
     Department of Energy the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for 
     this purpose; and
       Whereas, In 2012, the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's 
     Nuclear Future, in fulfilling its purpose to conduct a 
     comprehensive review of the policies for managing nuclear 
     waste, reported that any future repository for spent nuclear 
     fuel and high-level radioactive waste should be selected with 
     the consent of the potentially affected state, tribal and 
     local governments; and
       Whereas, In 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for 
     the District of Columbia Circuit in In re Aiken County, 725 
     F.3d 255, 259 (D.C. Cir. 2013), ruled that the Nuclear 
     Regulatory Commission had an obligation to resume the 
     licensing proceeding for the repository at Yucca Mountain 
     that was suspended in 2011 using the remaining funds from 
     previous appropriations, notwithstanding the objections by 
     the Commission that the funds were insufficient to complete 
     the licensing proceeding; and
       Whereas, The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has insufficient 
     funds to complete the licensing proceeding for the repository 
     for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at 
     Yucca Mountain, has expended the majority of its remaining 
     funds for the licensing proceeding for such a repository and 
     has not received any additional funds to continue the 
     licensing proceeding for such a repository; and
       Whereas, The United States Congress is considering various 
     legislation concerning nuclear waste, including S. 95, 
     introduced by Senator Dean Heller, and H.R. 456, introduced 
     by Representative Dina Titus, both of which are entitled the 
     Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act and which would extend the 
     right of consent to the State of Nevada before the repository 
     at Yucca Mountain could be authorized for development; now, 
     therefore be it
       Resolved, by the Assembly and Senate of the State of 
     Nevada, jointly, That the Nevada Legislature protests, in the 
     strongest possible terms, any attempt by the United States 
     Congress to resurrect the dangerous and ill-conceived 
     repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive 
     waste at Yucca Mountain; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature calls on President 
     Donald J. Trump to veto any legislation that would attempt to 
     locate any temporary, interim or permanent repository or 
     storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and high-level 
     radioactive waste in the State of Nevada; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature calls on Rick Perry, 
     the Secretary of Energy, to find the proposed repository for 
     spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at Yucca 
     Mountain unsuitable, to abandon consideration of Yucca 
     Mountain as a repository site, and to initiate a process 
     whereby the nation can again engage in innovative and 
     ultimately successful strategies for dealing with the 
     problems of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive 
     waste; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Nevada Legislature formally restates its 
     strong and unyielding opposition to the development of Yucca 
     Mountain as a repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-
     level radioactive waste and to the storage or disposal of 
     spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in the 
     State of Nevada; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the 
     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the 
     presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of 
     Representatives, the Secretary of Energy and each member of 
     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon 
     passage and constitutes the official position of the Nevada 
     Legislature.
                                  ____

       POM-57. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature 
     of the State of Michigan expressing support for the 
     construction of a new lock at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and 
     urge the President of the United States and United States 
     Congress to fully fund the project; to the Committee on 
     Environment and Public Works.

                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 2

       Whereas, The Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie. Michigan, are 
     of the utmost importance to Michigan and play a critical role 
     in our nation's economy and security. Each year, 
     approximately 10,000 Great Lakes vessels, carrying 80 million 
     tons of iron ore, coal, grain, and other cargo, safely and 
     efficiently traverse the locks. Nearly 80 percent of domestic 
     iron ore--the primary material used to manufacture steel 
     critical to the auto industry, construction, and other 
     industries--travels from mines in Minnesota and Michigan's 
     Upper Peninsula through the Soo Locks: and
       Whereas, Only one of the four Soo Locks is large enough to 
     accommodate the modem vessels that commonly traverse the 
     Great Lakes. Sixty percent of the American and Canadian 
     fleet--carrying 70 percent of the

[[Page S3996]]

     cargo traversing the locks--can only pass through the Poe 
     Lock. The remainder of cargo goes through the smaller 
     MacArthur Lock, with the smallest 100-year-old Davis and 
     Sabin locks rarely used; and
       Whereas, The reliance on one lock poses a serious risk to 
     national security and the economies of the state of Michigan 
     and the United States. A long-term outage of the Poe Lock due 
     to lock failure or terrorist attack would disrupt steel 
     production in the United States, crippling the economy and 
     plunging the country into recession. Because no viable 
     transportation alternatives exist, the United States 
     Department of Homeland Security estimated nearly 11 million 
     jobs would be lost. Other studies indicate that even a short-
     term failure of 30 days could result in economic losses of 
     $160 million; and
       Whereas, The United States Congress has authorized the 
     construction of a second large. Poe-sized lock at Sault Ste. 
     Marie. The project was originally authorized in 1986, and in 
     2007. Congress authorized the construction at full federal 
     expense. Though the project has been authorized and 
     preliminary work conducted, a lack of federal funding has 
     stalled further work; and
       Whereas, The economic benefits to Michigan, the Great Lakes 
     region, and the entire country far outweigh the cost of 
     constructing a new lock. A 2017 report to the United States 
     Department of Treasury estimated that the $626 million 
     investment in a new lock would provide a return of up to four 
     times that amount; and
       Whereas, The construction of a new lock would be a boon for 
     the northern Michigan economy and create good jobs in a 
     region that continues to suffer from higher than average 
     unemployment rates. At its peak, the project would employ up 
     to 250 workers and require 1.5 million man hours over the 10 
     years of construction; and
       Whereas, It is long past time to construct a new lock. The 
     investment of federal funds in this critical infrastructure 
     makes sound economic sense and is vital to ensure our 
     national security. Every year we delay, the Poe Lock gets 
     another year older, increasing the total project costs and 
     the chances of an unanticipated closure; now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved, by the House of Representatives (The Senate 
     Concurring). That we express support for the construction of 
     a new lock at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and urge the 
     President and Congress of the United States to fully fund the 
     project; and be it further
       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to 
     the President of the United States, President of the United 
     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of 
     Representatives, and the members of the Michigan 
     congressional delegation.

       POM-58. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada expressing the opposition of the Nevada 
     Legislature to certain proposed changes to the federal laws 
     relating to Medicare and the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance 
     provisions of the Social Security Act; to the Committee on 
     Finance.

                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 7

       Whereas, For generations, after a lifetime of work and 
     dedication to this county, many older Nevadans were forced to 
     live in poverty without adequate health care available to 
     them during retirement; and
       Whereas, When Congress passed the Old-Age and Survivors 
     Insurance provisions of the Social Security Act in 1935, 
     countless older Nevadans were lifted out of poverty and 
     provided with an adequate, dependable source of income for 
     their retirement; and
       Whereas, When Congress passed the Social Security 
     Amendments Act of 1965, crucial health insurance coverage 
     through Medicare was made available to all Nevadans over the 
     age of 65 years, regardless of their income or medical 
     history; and
       Whereas, Subsequent amendments by Congress to Medicare and 
     the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance provisions of the Social 
     Security Act established near-universal health care coverage 
     under these programs and provided many older Nevadans with 
     additional benefits, including, without limitation, yearly 
     cost-of-living adjustments to account for inflation, 
     prescription drug assistance and the extension of Medicare to 
     certain Nevadans under the age of 65 years who have long-term 
     disabilities; and
       Whereas, When Congress passed the Patient Protection and 
     Affordable Care Act in 2010, Medicare beneficiaries were able 
     to receive certain preventive health care services and 
     reduced costs; and
       Whereas, In Fiscal Year 2015, spending on Medicare and the 
     Old-Age and Survivors Insurance provisions of the Social 
     Security Act constituted over one-third of the $3.7 trillion 
     budget of the Federal Government; and
       Whereas, Wide-ranging changes to the Medicare program are 
     being considered by the 115th Congress, including, without 
     limitation, raising the age of eligibility to receive 
     benefits from 65 to 67 years and repealing certain 
     improvements that were made to this program by the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act; and
       Whereas, Wide-ranging changes to the Old-Age and Survivors 
     Insurance provisions of the Social Security Act are also 
     being considered by the 115th Congress, including, without 
     limitation, raising the age for full retirement from 67 to 69 
     years, moving towards a cost-of-living adjustment based on 
     the chained consumer price index and means testing benefits 
     for certain recipients; and
       Whereas, The 115th Congress is also considering the 
     potential privatization of many of the Old-Age and Survivors 
     Insurance benefits that older Nevadans have earned during 
     decades of work; and
       Whereas, The changes being considered by Congress could 
     have a damaging effect on the standard of living of Nevadans 
     who retire; and
       Whereas, A bipartisan solution is needed to ensure the 
     future sustainability of Medicare and the Old-Age and 
     Survivors Insurance provisions of the Social Security Act 
     which fully preserves the critical benefits that many older 
     Nevadans have come to rely upon, is fiscally responsible and 
     ensures that all Nevadans have a reliable source of income 
     and health care during their retirement; now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved, By the Assembly and Senate of the State of 
     Nevada, jointly, That the members of the 79th Session of the 
     Nevada Legislature hereby urge Congress to fully preserve the 
     critical benefits which many older Nevadans have come to rely 
     upon; and be it further
       Resolved, That Congress should work towards establishing a 
     bipartisan solution which avoids the privatization of 
     Medicare and the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance provisions 
     of the Social Security Act and strengthens these essential 
     programs for future generations of Nevadans; and be it 
     further
       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of 
     the United States, as the presiding officer of the United 
     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of 
     Representatives, the Chairman of the United States House 
     Committee on Ways and Means, the Chairman of the United 
     States Senate Committee on Finance, the Secretary of the 
     United States Department of Health and Human Services, the 
     Commissioner of Social Security and each member of the Nevada 
     Congressional Delegation; and be it further
       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon 
     passage.

       POM-59. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada urging Congress to propose an amendment 
     to the United States Constitution to allow the governments of 
     the United States and the individual states to regulate and 
     limit political contributions and expenditures to protect the 
     integrity of elections and the equal right of all Americans 
     to effective representation; to the Committee on the 
     Judiciary.

                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 4

       Whereas, The growing influence of large independent 
     political expenditures is a great and growing concern to the 
     people of the United States and the State of Nevada; and
       Whereas, In a democracy, the assurance of a fair and 
     uncorrupted election process is of the utmost importance, and 
     the Nevada Legislature believes that it is a legitimate and 
     vital role of government to regulate political expenditures 
     in an even-handed manner; and
       Whereas, In fulfillment of this important role, the 
     government of the United States and a majority of states have 
     regulated and limited independent and other political 
     contributions and expenditures; and
       Whereas, The Supreme Court of the United States in Citizens 
     United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), 
     held that the First Amendment to the United States 
     Constitution prohibits Congress and the states from limiting 
     or restricting independent political expenditures by 
     corporations and unions; and
       Whereas, Citizens United overturned a long-standing 
     precedent of allowing regulation of independent political 
     expenditures; and
       Whereas, Citizens United has served as a precedent for 
     further legal decisions which have harmed our democratic 
     system of government, including American Tradition 
     Partnership v. Bullock, 567 U.S. 516 (2012), which struck 
     down a long-standing Montana campaign finance law, denying a 
     state the right to regulate independent political 
     expenditures by corporations in state elections, and 
     McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, 134 S.Ct. 1434 
     (2014), which struck down aggregate individual contribution 
     limits; and
       Whereas, The people of Nevada and all other states should 
     have the power to limit by law the influence of money in 
     their political systems; and
       Whereas, In the wake of Citizens United, there has been an 
     exponential increase in large political contributions and 
     expenditures which threatens the integrity of the election 
     process, corrupts our candidates, dilutes the power of 
     individual voters and distorts the public discourse: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, by the Senate and Assembly of the State of 
     Nevada, jointly, That the members of the 79th Session of the 
     Nevada Legislature hereby urge the Congress of the United 
     States to propose an amendment to the United States 
     Constitution to allow the governments of the United States 
     and the individual states to regulate political contributions 
     and expenditures; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of 
     the United States as presiding officer of the United States 
     Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and each 
     member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it 
     further
       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon 
     passage.
