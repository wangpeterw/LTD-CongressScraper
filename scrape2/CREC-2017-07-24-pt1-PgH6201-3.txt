              SECRETARY PRUITT WELCOMED TO SOUTH CAROLINA

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this morning at Cameron, 
South Carolina, I was grateful to join EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, 
Senator Lindsey Graham, Attorney General Alan Wilson, and Commissioner 
of Agriculture Hugh Weathers to discuss the waters of the United States 
rule published by the prior administration.
  This harmful rule geometrically expanded intrusion of the Federal 
Government, imposing greater Federal overreach, dictating the 
definition of waterways, and destroying jobs of original 
conservationists who promote a clean environment.
  I appreciate Administrator Scott Pruitt who facilitated the 
roundtable to learn directly from local agricultural community leaders 
about the harmful consequences of the rule. The men and women of the 
roundtable, hosted by Jim and Karen Roquemore, clearly explained the 
real impact overreaching regulations have on environmentally positive 
development for jobs.
  I am grateful that President Donald Trump and Administrator Pruitt 
have committed to review the rule and, most importantly, considered the 
input from grassroots organizations about the negative impact.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  I appreciate Rusty Shannon of Sandy Run, South Carolina, for alerting 
me to the destructive consequences of the rule.
