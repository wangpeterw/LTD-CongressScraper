                        REFORM FISA 702 PROGRAM

  (Mr. MASSIE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, on December 31 of this year, the FISA 702 
surveillance program expires.
  Ostensibly, this program allows our intelligence agencies to spy on 
and stop terrorism. However, it is a well-known fact that the FBI has 
used this program as a back door to our Constitution to spy on 
Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to reauthorize this program 
before December 31 without significant reforms. We all took an oath to 
uphold and defend the Constitution. We need to stay true to that oath 
and require the FBI to get a warrant if they want to go into the 702 
database to surveil Americans.
