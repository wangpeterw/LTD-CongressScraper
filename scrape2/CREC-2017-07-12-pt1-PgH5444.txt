                NAS REPORT ON THE VALUE OF SBE SCIENCES

  (Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the findings of 
a recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine entitled: ``The Value of Social, Behavioral, and Economic 
Sciences to National Priorities.'' This report was requested by the 
National Science Foundation to examine whether the Federal Government 
should continue funding research in these disciplines. The resounding 
answer is: yes.
  The report found that SBE funding furthers the mission of NSF and 
helps other agencies achieve their missions, and this funding provides 
tools and methods that have helped business and industry grow the U.S. 
economy and create jobs.
  The report also highlights that virtually every major challenge the 
country faces today requires understanding the causes and consequences 
of people's behavior. The way we do this is by funding research in the 
social, behavioral, and economic sciences.
  Mr. Speaker, investments in SBE are critical for our Nation's future, 
and we must continue this robust investment.
