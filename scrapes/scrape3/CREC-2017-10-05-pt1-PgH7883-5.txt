   CONGRESS MUST REAUTHORIZE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the swift 
reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program.
  CHIP helps families provide care for their children. Throughout our 
Nation, it covers 9 million children and pregnant women. In California, 
it covers 2 million children. And in my district, half of the kids get 
their healthcare from Medicaid or CHIP.
  Now, CHIP was implemented over 20 years ago, championed by two 
Senators on opposite sides of the political spectrum, Orrin Hatch and 
Ted Kennedy, and it has continued to receive strong bipartisan support. 
But because of inaction by the House of Representatives, because of the 
distractions by this administration, millions of our children may be 
denied coverage.
  They may not get to see their doctors for routine checkups. With the 
upcoming flu season, kids may not be able to get the necessary care 
when they are sick, and children with allergies may not have access to 
lifesaving medications and health services.
  If this Congress does not step up to fix this mistake before it is 
too late, children will pay the price of our inaction.
  Congress must take action to come together to pass CHIP for the 
millions of kids who continue to depend on us for this healthcare.
