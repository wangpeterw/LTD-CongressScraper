        THANKING ALL WHO RESPONDED TO HELP AFTER HURRICANE IRMA

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, this week, Hurricane Irma brought devastation 
to south Florida and many parts of the Southeastern United States, 
including the 12th District of Georgia.
  In times of disaster, Americans come together and show their love and 
support for one another, and I thank all of our first responders, law 
enforcement, our military, and Good Samaritans for their extraordinary 
service in this time of need. Your selflessness saved countless lives 
in this unprecedented storm.
  I thank Governor Deal, President Trump, and FEMA, and all 19 counties 
in the 12th District of Georgia that were included in the Federal 
emergency declaration authorizing FEMA to provide direct Federal 
resources to our district.
  Visit disasterassistance.gov to learn about the options available to 
you. It is the greatest honor of my life to represent the people of 
Georgia's 12th Congressional District, and my office is here to help in 
any way we can. If you need any help in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Irma, please do not hesitate to reach out. America is resilient.
  The American people are resilient when we come together as one, and 
now we must assess the damage and help each other rebuild our 
communities.
