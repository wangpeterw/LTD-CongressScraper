            By Mr. SENSENBRENNER:
        H.R. 1795.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 (The Congress shall have 
     Power ``To regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among 
     the several States and within the Indian Tribes'') and 
     Article 1, Section 8, Clause 18 (The Congress shall have 
     Power ``to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper 
     for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all 
     other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of 
     the United States, or in any Department or Officer 
     thereof'').
       Additional authority derives from Article III, Section 1, 
     (``The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested 
     in one Supreme Court, and in each inferior courts as the 
     Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The 
     Judges, both of the Supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold 
     their Officers during good Behavior, and shall at stated 
     times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which 
     shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.)
       Additional authority also derives from Article III, Section 
     2, Clause 3 of the Constitution.
