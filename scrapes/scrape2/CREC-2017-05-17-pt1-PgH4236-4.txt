                INVESTING IN OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Infrastructure 
Week.
  In my first few months in Congress, I made it a priority to meet with 
elected officials from every municipality and jurisdiction in my 
Washington State congressional district. I met with them to understand 
their critical transportation and infrastructure needs. Today I am 
releasing a report on those needs.
  I am proud that my district continues to draw in more and more people 
and that we have assets like a natural deep water port that facilitates 
commerce from across our State.
  Unfortunately, between 1990 and 2015, as our State's population 
increased by 45 percent, Seattle has now got the second worst evening 
rush hour traffic in the country. We have failed to invest in our 
infrastructure.
  This administration made promises but has done nothing to actually 
fulfill those promises to invest in infrastructure and to ensure that 
our country actually moves forward. Instead, it has just been lurching 
from crisis to crisis.
  Investing in infrastructure is not only essential, it creates jobs. I 
intend to do everything I can to make sure that I fight for my 
district's priorities and to ensure that Congress invests in our 
infrastructure.
