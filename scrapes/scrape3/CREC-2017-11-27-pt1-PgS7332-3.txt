       50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MONTANA WHEAT AND BARLEY COMMITTEE

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and 
congratulate the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee on their 50th 
anniversary. Agriculture is Montana's No. 1 economic driver, and wheat 
and barley are the principal grain crops produced in Montana. 
Established in 1967, the committee works to promote Montana wheat and 
barley producers, help identify and open markets both at home and 
abroad, and advance research that helps with crop quality and 
production. The severe drought and low commodity prices that Montana 
farmers have faced over the course of the past year have highlighted 
the importance of these efforts, and I thank all the directors, 
members, and staff for their years of dedication.
