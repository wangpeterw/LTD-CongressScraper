                   SUPPORT YOUNG FARMERS AND VETERANS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
the Farmers of Tomorrow Act, a bill that Congresswoman Cheri Bustos and 
I recently introduced. Our bill was designed to make it easier for 
young farmers and veterans to purchase new land to begin a farming 
career.
  New and beginning farmers can obtain ownership loans through USDA to 
buy land, but too many experience difficulty due to outdated experience 
requirements that do not take into account the variety of paths future 
farmers can take to prepare to run their operations.
  The Farmers of Tomorrow Act allows new, beginning, or veteran farmers 
to count various experience toward the current 3-year experience 
requirement to make it easier to access USDA financing. This includes 
an honorable discharge from the United States military, successful 
completion of a farm management curriculum, at least 1 year as hired 
farm labor with management responsibilities, and more.
  Access to land is essential for supporting the next generation of 
farmers. This legislation will help get more Americans involved in 
agriculture, while strengthening rural communities. I encourage all my 
colleagues to support it.
