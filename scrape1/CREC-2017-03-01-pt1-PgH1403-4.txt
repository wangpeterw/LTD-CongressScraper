                    READY FOR GROWTH AND INNOVATION

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Searching 
for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, or 
the SCRUB Act.
  This legislation establishes a commission to review existing Federal 
regulations and report to Congress those that should be repealed to 
reduce unnecessary costs to the economy--kind of like a regulation 
report card.
  Federal rules and regulations have sucked the life out of our small 
businesses for the last 8 years. Unlike some lawmakers, I have the 
unique experience of having operated a business under Obama-era rules 
and regulations. Let me tell you that it was very difficult. Our 
struggles were not an isolated event. Georgians and Americans across 
the country bore those same burdens.
  We are ready for growth and innovation and an environment that 
encourages an economy like we have never seen before. The SCRUB Act is 
a solid step forward in restoring life to the American small-business 
community.
  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
