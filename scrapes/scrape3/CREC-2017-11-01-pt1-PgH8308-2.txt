                 HONORING THE LIFE OF HEATHER ALVARADO

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 1-month anniversary of the 
terrible shooting that happened in my hometown, Las Vegas, on October 
1.
  I rise to remember the life of Heather Alvarado, a woman who was 
known for her hugs, her love of hot pink, and her beautiful green eyes.
  Heather lived for her kids, Syrus, Albie, and Charlie, and had 
traveled to Las Vegas to attend the Route 91 concert with her daughter.
  Heather loved going on vacation with her family and spending time 
outdoors. She loved planning parties for her children and friends, 
including hosting elaborate Halloween parties every year. She was known 
for her caring nature and kindness. Heather's husband, Albert, said 
that she saw the good in everyone and would do almost anything to help 
others.
  I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Heather's friends 
and family. Please know that the city of Las Vegas and the State of 
Nevada and the whole country grieve with you.
