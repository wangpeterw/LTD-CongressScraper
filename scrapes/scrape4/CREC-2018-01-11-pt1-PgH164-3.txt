                 RECOGNIZING HEATHER RICHARDSON-BERGSMA

  (Mr. BUDD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize High Point native 
Heather Richardson-Bergsma for qualifying for the 2018 Winter Olympics 
in speed skating. Holding multiple world records, she will be competing 
for her first Olympic medal this year.
  Heather's hunger for speed skating began at an early age. Growing up 
just a few minutes from our local High Point roller rink, Heather's 
talents were recognized by a local coach who suggested she start taking 
inline speed skating classes.
  Although she was told she must wait a full year before she could 
compete, her passion and dedication for the sport did not waiver, and a 
year later she competed in her first race.
  The Olympics mark crowning achievements in every Olympian's career. 
The many years, hours, minutes, and seconds they have devoted to 
training all come down to fulfilled dreams and broken records.
  Heather's dedication, passion, and perseverance demonstrate the 
characteristics found in every great athlete. I am proud to recognize 
Heather today and I wish her the best of luck next month.
