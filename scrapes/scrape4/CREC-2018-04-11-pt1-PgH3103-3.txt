                                 PRAYER

  Chaplain Scott Foust, U.S. Air Force, Arlington Cemetery, Arlington, 
Virginia, offered the following prayer:
  Gracious Lord, when King David of old faced a seemingly 
insurmountable mountain of problems to solve, questions to answer, and 
obstacles to overcome, he uttered a brief yet powerful prayer: ``Hear 
my cry for help, my King and my God, for to You I pray.''
  Similarly, after our very first President and Commander in Chief took 
his very first oath of office, he must have felt the weight of the 
daunting task before him, so he went off script and uttered a brief yet 
powerful prayer: ``So help me God.''
  I can only begin to imagine the weight of care and the gravity of 
concern that this body carries, day after day, publicly and privately. 
With that in mind, before this session begins, we pause to acknowledge 
our utter dependence upon You, O God, and we humbly echo that powerful 
sentiment with this brief prayer: Help us, Lord.
  Amen.
