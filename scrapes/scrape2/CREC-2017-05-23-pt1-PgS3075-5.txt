                           MANCHESTER ATTACK

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before I say anything else this 
morning, I want to say this: What we saw in Manchester last night 
almost defies description. It was, in the words of Prime Minister May, 
a ``callous terror attack'' that stood out ``for its appalling, 
sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless 
children and young people, who should have been enjoying one of the 
most memorable nights of their lives.''
  Although we will continue to learn more about what happened, this 
much is very clear: Many have died, many more have been injured, and, 
as the Prime Minister told us, many of them were children. It is hard 
to imagine the pain the families of these victims must be feeling 
today. On behalf of the Senate and our country, let me express our 
heartfelt condolences to the victims, their families, and to the 
British people, who have been our friends and allies through many 
challenges.
  The Senate also recognizes the many first responders, medical 
professionals, and citizens who stepped in to provide help.
  As I speak, I know that the intelligence professionals from both of 
our countries are already working to discover whether this was the 
result of an individual attacker or directed by ISIL. In either case, 
the people of America will stand with our allies and provide any 
assistance we possibly can.
