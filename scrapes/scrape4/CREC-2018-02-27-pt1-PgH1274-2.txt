                     KEEP YOUR WORD, MR. PRESIDENT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Al Green) for 1 minute.
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a liberated 
Democrat with one request: I ask that the most powerful man in the 
world, the President of the United States of America, keep his word.
  Keep your word, Mr. President. You have indicated that no one under 
the age of 21 should be able to buy an assault-type weapon.
  Keep your word, Mr. President. Don't allow the NRA to veto your word. 
You are the most powerful man in the world.
  Keep your word, Mr. President. Stay with those young people who have 
issued a clarion call to this country to do something about the killing 
that is taking place on our school campuses. These are children who are 
dying.
  Keep your word, Mr. President.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their 
remarks to the Chair.
