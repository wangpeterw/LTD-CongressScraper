                              ALDO'S STORY

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Aldo 
Solano of Woodburn, Oregon.
  Aldo was only 6 years old when his family first immigrated to the 
United States from Colima, Mexico. Economic distress, corruption, and a 
lack of opportunities pushed his parents to leave everything behind and 
head to the Willamette Valley. They wanted a different life for Aldo 
and his siblings, one where they could go to school and pursue their 
dreams.
  Aldo has done just that. At Woodburn High School, he served as vice 
president of his class. While earning good grades, he participated in 
sports and volunteer opportunities like 4-H Latino Summer Camp, 
encouraging young people to enter the STEM field.
  After graduating, Aldo became a DACA recipient. Through DACA, he has 
been able to work for the Latino Health Coalition, where he worked to 
pass Cover All Kids, a State law to ensure access to healthcare for 
every child in Oregon. This winter, he will begin working towards a 
public health degree at Portland State University.
  Without DACA, none of this would have been possible for Aldo. Young 
people across the country are relying on us. We need to pass a clean 
Dream Act that will recognize Aldo and over 800,000 DREAMers as equal 
members of our community.
