  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania (during the Special Order of Ms. Sinema). 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the proceedings during the 
former Members program be printed in the Congressional Record and that 
all Members and former Members who spoke during the proceedings have 
the privilege of revising and extending their remarks.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Donovan). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania?
  There was no objection.
