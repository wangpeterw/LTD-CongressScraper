               HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF TOM PETTY

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
Gainesville's native son, Mr. Tom Petty.
  Thomas Earl Petty was born on October 20, 1950, and, over a career 
that spanned five decades, collected 28 top 10 hits, the most of all 
time.
  But his contribution cannot be measured in hits or awards. He wrote 
America's soundtrack. Tom Petty's story sounds familiar. He grew up in 
a small town, struggled, persisted, and then succeeded--a true American 
Dream story.
  But it is not what he did; it is how he did it that strikes us. It is 
the honesty, wit, and sentimentality that made his music special. Every 
hit Tom Petty crafted became an anthem, each song a score to the 
memorable moments of our lives. American life would be much diminished 
without his work.
  Jefferson and Madison wrote our system. Twain wrote our story that 
described Early American folklore. Petty wrote our songs. The songbook 
of America is bigger and brighter because of him.
  Rest in peace as you continue ``Runnin' Down a Dream.''
