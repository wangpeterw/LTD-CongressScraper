CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATION OF ROSE HISTORICAL CEMETERY IN TARPON SPRINGS, 
                                FLORIDA

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, last weekend, I had the honor of 
attending the centennial commemoration of Rose Historical Cemetery in 
Tarpon Springs, Florida.
  Rose is the oldest African-American cemetery in Pinellas County and 
is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It was an 
especially meaningful ceremony because it was held on Juneteenth, the 
anniversary marking the end of slavery in the U.S.
  Those who have been laid to rest at Rose represent a major part of 
Tarpon Springs history and culture. Civil rights pioneers, veterans, 
and many others, including friends I grew up with in Tarpon, are buried 
there.
  I would like to especially thank Tarpon Springs Mayor Chris 
Alahouzos, Annie Dabbs, a member of the cemetery's board, and the 
dozens of volunteers who work tirelessly year-round to preserve the 
legacy of Rose Cemetery. Because of their dedication, Rose continues to 
be a beautiful, historical site for our community.
