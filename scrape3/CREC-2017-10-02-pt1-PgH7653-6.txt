     WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP MASS SHOOTINGS IN AMERICA

  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, when will it end? When will the carnage end? 
How

[[Page H7654]]

many more times are we going to have to turn on our televisions or our 
phones or get a text message to talk about some other mass shooting in 
America?
  We have got to do something to stop this now.
  There is no reason that someone like the killer should have automatic 
weapons or semiautomatic weapons.
  I believe people have legitimate reasons to have guns, but not 
legitimate reasons to have automatic weapons to mow down so many 
innocent people. And it will happen again and again and again, because 
we refuse to do anything to have sensible gun control in this country.
  My heart goes out to the families, but thoughts and prayers are not 
enough. A moment of silence in the House is not enough. We need to do 
something now to have sensible gun control laws; otherwise, these words 
ring hollow.
  This country is hurting, and guns are doing it, guns in the hands of 
wrong people.
  Again, guns for hunters, guns to keep people safe, I am not opposed 
to that, but I certainly am opposed to automatic weapons. Nobody needs 
automatic weapons. They are weapons of war, and they should not be in 
the hands of anybody who is unstable.
