6757,topic-id,1530,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today as the pain of ObamaCare around the country continues to worsen. Healthcare prices continue to rise. ObamaCare is collapsing, basically, more and more every day. People in every State of this Union have seen their healthcare costs skyrocket. It has happened everywhere around the country.  We must do something to help the American people who are suffering under the heavy weight that ObamaCare has placed on their lives.  I was at a hospital this past weekend in Casper, WY, my hometown, and I talked to doctors, nurses, and patients. What I hear at home in Wyoming is that there is an urgent need to do something about the high costs and the limited choices under the Obama healthcare law. We are having discussions right now about the very best way to do that. Whatever we come up with, it is going to be a fundamental change in a direction away from That is what America wants. That is what America needs. It is what the American people are asking us to do.  One of the biggest steps we need to take is to get rid of the ObamaCare mandates and penalties. I hear about it day in and day out. I heard about it in my office yesterday from a woman who was in town visiting on another matter, but she talked about her experience with the ObamaCare situation where her premiums have gone way up, and the deductibles are up so high that even though they are counted under ObamaCare as having insurance, her husband would tell you that he will not go to a doctor because, with a $6,500 deductible, he feels he cannot afford to. But he is counted under He wants more choices. He wants more control of his own life. And he wants to eliminate the taxes and the mandates.  I am sure the Presiding Officer hears this at home: People hate the fact that there is a mandate that says they have to buy insurance that Washington says they have to buy--that the Democrats have said they have to buy--rather than what might work for them and their family and be cheaper and work better for them and be more tailored to their family's needs.  There are more than 19 million people across the country who have decided that they are going to pay a penalty to the IRS or they received a waiver so they didn't have to get ObamaCare insurance--either pay the penalty or get a waiver. These are people who made the fundamental decision that ObamaCare insurance was not a good deal for them.  The second thing we need to do, I believe, is to repeal the burdensome and[[Page S3813]]expensive ObamaCare taxes. Healthcare costs have been soaring under One of the reasons is because the healthcare law added almost $1 trillion of additional taxes on to the backs of hard-working These are the taxes that specifically raised the cost for people needing health insurance and healthcare. They put taxes on things needed by people who are in need of medical care. Somebody who needs a pacemaker, someone who needs a walker, a wheelchair, an artificial joint--additional taxes on all of these users of medical devices, medical supplies, of over-the-counter pain medicines, over-the-counter medicine for fever, sore throat, as well as prescription medications. The taxes are on just about everything, and then, of course, the tax on health insurance itself. So if you buy health insurance, you have to pay a tax on that. What is that going to do to the cost of health insurance? It is going to raise the cost for people who have health insurance.  When the Democrats were debating and voting in support of the ObamaCare law on this floor of the Senate, they conveniently failed to mention all of these new taxes to the American people.  The third important thing that Republicans are committed to doing is to give much more flexibility to the States when it comes to making and developing healthcare solutions for the future.  I served 5 years in the Wyoming State We always felt that we could do a lot better job if we just had a little more local control, a little less in terms of government mandates, and make that same amount of money work that much better and go that much further and take care of that many more people.  Medicaid is the prime example. I had a State legislator in from Wyoming today, and in the office we were talking about Medicaid and what role the States play and what role the Federal Government plays, how to make dollars go further at home. ObamaCare increased the amount of money that Washington sends to States that chose to expand their Medicaid Of course, that is taxpayer money. Then ObamaCare paid a bonus--a bonus--to States that decided to not focus on the area where Medicaid was intended originally to be focused, which was on poor women, children, and the disabled. They didn't get a bonus--not at all. No bonus money to help those people. The bonus money went to help able-bodied, working-age adults. That is not whom Medicaid was set up to help in the first place.  Why should Washington collect money from people at home and then send it back out to the States with all of these new Washington mandates and restrictions on how the money is spent? I have much more confidence in the people of my home State of Wyoming and in the people of the Presiding Officer's State of Arkansas than I do in any bureaucrat in Washington, When it comes to developing good ideas about improving America's healthcare, I always believe in more flexibility and local control and patient control. The more we are working with doctors and communities, working with State legislators, the better. We need more flexibility in every State; we don't need Washington telling all of us what to do. If we give people and States more options, there will be more affordable options for insurance as well as for care.  Democrats tried their goal of a one-size-fits-all, Washington-mandated approach. That is what ObamaCare was all about, and it did not work.  I want to talk about one other thing Republicans are committed to doing with our healthcare reform plan, and that is stabilizing insurance markets while other reforms can take effect.  The ObamaCare exchanges are completely falling apart. Week after week, there is another story, another headline about the disaster that is We look at a headline in a Chicago paper: ``Another Obamacare rate shock.'' ``Another'' and ``shock'' with rates--that is what people are seeing around the country.  Last week, we learned that another 77,000 people in Indiana will lose their ObamaCare plans. Two more insurance companies are leaving the market there. Across the country, there are more than 40 counties where no one will be selling ObamaCare insurance next year--no one.  Premiums have already doubled because of ObamaCare in the last 4 years. Next year, people's rates may go up another 40 percent, 50 percent--well above that in other places. We cannot allow this to continue. The American people cannot afford it, it is not good for our country, and it is not good for the people living in this country.  We need to make sure we help support people who do need help paying their premiums. We need to give insurance companies more flexibility to offer the kinds of plans that people actually want to buy. We need to give States the ability to support their markets in ways that make sense for people in that  The discussion draft of our plan includes ideas to help keep the individual market going in a much stronger way than it is under ObamaCare today. It stabilizes the markets.  The insurance company Anthem put out a statement on The company said that these kinds of ideas ``will markedly improve the stability of the individual market and moderate premium increases.''  Anthem has been dropping out of exchanges across the country because the markets are unsustainable under That has to be one of our goals as we continue to discuss legislation--stabilizing the markets and reducing premiums. There are a lot of good ideas on ways to do it. We are committed to exploring those ideas and putting together a plan that will help give people the care they need, from a doctor they choose, at lower costs. That is what the American people want us to do. That is what we are working on.  There are limits under the Senate rules that keep us from doing some things we would all like to do. If Democrats are ready to work with us and to be part of the conversation, I think we can do some things to make this bill even better. But the situation we have today in this country for healthcare is not working. ObamaCare has collapsed. Healthcare is in a state of crisis. Those who supported ObamaCare and voted for it have caused it. We are just trying to clean up the mess.  I yield the floor.

Instead of giving the American people time to read the bill, the Senate is being asked to pass the legislation now. At a minimum, shouldn't the American people have at least a day to read the proposal?  Putting that aside, this bill seeks to address another major failure of That is what they are trying to do here. As a doctor, I want insurance to be affordable for patients all across the country. This bill confirms what we all know--that ObamaCare is not affordable.  The Senator is well aware of the large premium increases in her own It is not just the premiums that are skyrocketing. This week, I spoke to a woman in She told me that the deductible under her ObamaCare plan is so high that her husband refuses to go visit the doctor. She said that it is $6,500 for her and $6,500 for him and that he will not go to a doctor with that kind of a deductible. According to supporters of ObamaCare, this person is actually covered under ObamaCare, but as a doctor, I see things differently in that healthcare must be more affordable for everyone.  The Senator's proposal seeks to throw more money at a systemic problem with Instead, we should be passing bills that actually bring down the cost of care.  When the Senator mentions the CSRs, I will point out that absolutely every payment has been made--every one--all the way up until today.  People also talk about the sabotaging of the market. To me, the sabotaging of the insurance companies and the insurance market in this country has been because of ObamaCare's mandating that people buy insurance--buy more than they want, more than they need, and more than they can afford in so many cases, and it is insurance that provides very hollow opportunities to actually use the insurance.

6776,topic-id,450,"Mr.President, reserving my right to object, before coming to the Senate, I practiced medicine in Wyoming for over 20 years. That is why I am passionate about improving the quality of care and lowering the cost of healthcare. Unfortunately, we know healthcare is in a crisis. Premiums and deductibles are skyrocketing, and insurance is unaffordable.  It is interesting to hear the comments when we are talking about the sabotaging of the marketplace. It is ObamaCare that has sabotaged the marketplace. The Presiding Officer knows fully well, as do I, that when you look at the co-ops that were set up all around the country under ObamaCare, one after another went bankrupt--belly-up, shut down--and left people uncovered. That was before we even knew who the Republican nominee for President was going to be in 2016. That is That was at a time when all there was out there was the Obama healthcare law. One co-op after another failed, and it cost the taxpayers billions of dollars--guaranteed loans that will never be paid back.  Just like the bill we just discussed, this proposal is an important acknowledgment by the Senator from It is the acknowledgment that ObamaCare's collapsing insurance markets are affecting people all around the country. In Missouri, 18,000 people in 25 counties will have zero options on the ObamaCare exchanges--zero. They have been promised that their preexisting conditions will be covered, and no one is selling insurance in those counties in that They have basically been misled by ObamaCare that they will be covered for preexisting conditions. In the Republican plan, what we are doing is covering people who have preexisting conditions.  Let me say again that next year thousands of people in Missouri will have no insurance company that will be willing to sell insurance in the ObamaCare exchange. It is clear that insurance markets in Missouri are collapsing, as they are all around the country.  This bill is not the solution. Instead of giving people more choices in Missouri, what does the bill do? It sends people to Washington, DC, to buy their health insurance--a typical solution from the other side of the aisle. Instead of empowering States with more flexibility and the authority at the State level, they think once again that Washington knows best. They think that the people they represent would rather call a bureaucrat who is hundreds of miles away than talk with local people who live and work in their communities.  The simple fact is that ObamaCare is not providing patients with the increased choices they were promised.

6810,topic-id,2060,"Madam President, for a number of years, we have been debating healthcare in this country. Clearly, our healthcare system had problems 8 years ago when they started to do healthcare reform. I saw that as a doctor practicing in Casper,  Well, then Washington Democrats tried their solution. It is a solution that passed, and it is known as Republicans said that it wouldn't work and have been proven right. ObamaCare is too costly. It is collapsing. It is interesting because yesterday, as we were having our policy lunch meetings--Republicans and Democrats--word came out that another one of the ObamaCare exchange companies, Anthem, this time in Ohio, was pulling out, leaving about 18 counties, if not more in Ohio, without anybody to sell insurance on the ObamaCare exchange.  ObamaCare actually hasn't solved the problems of America's healthcare system. In many ways, it has made matters worse. That is why the law has never really had the support of the American people and continues to be unpopular today. It is why more than 19 million people actually chose not to sign up for ObamaCare coverage at all, even in spite of financial incentives to do so and a fine or a tax if you didn't sign up. So they either paid the fine or they got an exemption.  The Democrats, when they come to the floor to talk about healthcare, refuse to talk about those 19 million people who have just said: We want nothing to do with We are not going to sign up. Give us an exemption. Let us out.  They want to talk about people whom they actually have covered by pushing them into a broken Medicaid system, and that is about what has happened here. This expansion through the healthcare law and expanding Medicaid put many people into a broken healthcare system called It wasn't working well before ObamaCare, and it has gotten worse. The numbers out there, in terms of physicians taking care of patients, are about one-third--one out of three doctors will not take new Medicaid patients, so it is not a system that is working. It is not a solution, but Democrats put more people into that.  For people who didn't end up in Medicaid and who paid their premiums, those premiums have gone up significantly. They have doubled in most States, I think, across the board--up about 107 percent over the last 4 years. Thus, the statistics that have come out from the Department of Health and Human Services recently are the statistics the Obama administration, as it left office, didn't want the American people to see--that rates have doubled across the country and, in some States, much, much higher than that.  In my home State of Wyoming, they were up actually higher than the national average has been. People are paying more and more. There were two companies, at one point, that were selling insurance on the ObamaCare exchange, both losing money. One lost so much that they are no longer in business. The other is still losing money and still selling on the exchange, but you wonder how long they will stay. Or will they do the sort of thing that Anthem had to do in Ohio and the sorts of things we have seen in the Presiding Officer's home State of Iowa and we have seen in Nebraska and we have seen across the board? Some Democrats say: This is a one-term correction; give it time. But it doesn't seem that it is going to be working that way.  There was an article in the paper here, in Washington's Roll Call, and the headline was--this was last week--``Insurers Seek Increases for Obamacare Premiums in Early Filings.'' This is for next year. The article talks about how the insurance companies are starting to say how much they are going to need to charge people next year, which is much higher than it is this year. They are talking about an average increase of about 30 percent.  The average premium in the ObamaCare market in Wyoming right now is already more than $7,000 a year for a family. So how much more can people take? That is why I continue to come to the floor and talk about what is the problem with the healthcare law--healthcare and the system. People under ObamaCare have seen their deductibles go up, their copays go up, and the choices that they have go down. This is the real problem when we talk about  Then, of course, the other thing is taxes. There are at least 15 new or higher taxes under So people aren't just paying higher premiums; they are paying higher taxes, which were supposed to help with the premiums, but it doesn't seem to be doing so for people all across the country.  The Congressional Budget Office has looked at this, and it said that Americans are going to pay more than $28 billion over the next 10 years on just one tax on prescription drugs. Well, if we are trying to lower the cost of drugs and trying to lower the cost of care, putting a tax like this, as ObamaCare did on prescription drugs, just adds to the problem.  It has raised taxes all across the board. I don't want to go through each and every one of the taxes, but suffice it to say that when President Obama said he would put this program into place and it wouldn't cost a single[[Page S3307]]dime, he forgot the trillion dollars in new taxes that he added onto the backs of hard-working So we have had higher taxes, we have had higher premiums, we have had higher out-of-pocket costs from people--this huge tax burden.  What has happened is that we need to do a reform. The House has passed reform, and now in the Senate we are working on passing our own healthcare reform bill. We have been meeting three times a week up to over 5 hours a week for the last month and a half, going through piece by piece of all the different components of the healthcare law, trying to address the issues that are facing the American people, trying to lower the taxes that top the list of what we hear about at home in terms of trying to help people because they are paying more taxes, trying to work to deal with premiums.  I am really encouraged by the debate we have been having. I think we have been taking good steps in trying to address the issues the American public is seeing in terms of higher premiums and fewer choices.  I would like to work with the Democrats to solve these problems in a bipartisan way, to talk about how people can actually get healthcare in this country. But what have the Democrats done in response? Well, it is interesting because they want to go to a single-payer healthcare system. Some may deny it, but a majority of the Democrats in the House have cosponsored legislation to go to a single-payer healthcare plan. It is modeled, in some ways, after what you are seeing in  The California State Senate last week passed a bill, which seems to be the drift and the direction and maybe even the tip of the sphere of the Democratic Party efforts. It said: We want single-payer healthcare in  I served in the Wyoming State Senate, and I know the Presiding Officer served in the State legislative body in her home State of We do a fiscal note. We say: What is this going to cost? Is it a good idea? Can we afford it? What are the costs going to be? And the cost for what they proposed in California is $400 billion. Can they afford it? What is the total budget of the State of California? What is their general fund for the year? It is only $190 billion. So what they are proposing for healthcare alone is over twice what the entire general fund for the entire State of California is. Yet, it passed. It was a party-line vote in the State of California in the State senate, but that is now the position that they are working to do.  So it is hard to get cooperation from somebody to work on dealing with a healthcare plan when their plan is to go with more government, more spending, pledging money they don't have. When I looked at it in California, I said: If they want to do this, they will have to, 1, cut spending on other things. When you think about where general funding goes, it is for teachers, law enforcement, public safety, and firefighters. But they would also have to raise taxes significantly to get the money for what they want to promise everybody in this single-payer healthcare plan.  I am interested in working in a bipartisan way with people, but it is hard to get cooperation from people when their solution is more government, higher taxes, and less freedom. We need a solution, and that is what we are working on. I am very happy to say that it has been discussed at length in our conference. We had another good meeting about it yesterday, along with the Vice President, focusing on eliminating taxes, getting rid of the mandate that says that people must buy a government-approved product, giving people additional choices, and giving the States flexibility to make a number of these decisions.  I am from a State where agriculture plays a significant role, as is the Presiding I will be at our Wyoming stock growers' meeting on Friday when I am back home in the I was there a couple of years ago after ObamaCare passed, talking to people who had insurance that worked for them and worked for their families, but they lost it, not because they couldn't afford to pay for what they had but because what President Obama and the Democrats forced through in Congress said it wasn't good enough for them.  Under the mandate, as to what my friends and neighbors and folks around Wyoming have been saying was good enough for them and they could afford, President Obama said it wasn't good enough for them. Who is the better judge of what is good for a family in Iowa or Wyoming--President Obama and the Democrats or the family there in Iowa or Wyoming who is making the decision about what works best for them and their families? I am sure I am going to hear more about it at the stock growers' meeting on Friday, when I hear from families who say: What we had worked, but lost it because it wasn't allowed to be sold anymore. The President said it wasn't good enough for me. One woman said to me: Tell the President that I can make the decisions for myself. I don't need his help--referring to President  So we will continue to work toward the goal of making sure that we have people who can get the insurance and care they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs. That is what we needed with healthcare reform. That is what we didn't get with We got higher costs and fewer choices. Across the board right now, it looks like in 7 out of 10 counties in this country, people are down to one or two choices--hardly a market. In many places it is a monopoly now. After the news that came out yesterday from Anthem in Ohio and some of the news that we see from Iowa and neighboring Nebraska, we are going to find that many places will find themselves with no options available. Even with the subsidies that the Democrats had promised to help deal with the high premiums they have caused, there may be nobody to sell the insurance even when the subsidies are available.  So I come to the floor, as I do just about every week, to talk about the situation with the Obama healthcare law, the challenges the American people face, and our commitment to help provide relief and rescue the American people from what has happened to them under President Obama's healthcare law.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

All we hear is about how we don't get along, Mr.Nobody is watching when we do get along. And all of the bills that are being debated and voted on on the House floor today are examples of bipartisanship at the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Mr.Upton, Mr.Rush, Mr.Pallone, Mr.Walden, and the other ranking members and subcommittee chairmen are to be commended for that.  One of the bipartisan amendments, which was adopted in full committee on this bill, is a bipartisan amendment from Mr.McNerney, a Democrat from California, and myself, that deals with the cybersecurity and would suggest that, as these States provide these energy security plans to the Department of Energy, they include an assessment of cybersecurity.  So I can't tell you that this is the most important amendment that has ever been added to a bill in our committee, but it is a very good amendment, a very positive amendment. As plans are developed, including an assessment of cybersecurity threats and solutions to those threats, it should make the grid better, more reliable, and help make our country safer.

6833,topic-id,1580,"Mr.President, it is nice to see the Presiding Officer in the Because he is a student of history, I know it will come as no surprise to my colleague from Colorado that this week marks the 70th anniversary of the Marshall  In 1947, Europe was in ruins. After years of war, factories from Manchester to Munich had been bombed out. Railroads laid disfigured from artillery. Farms stood defaced by the tracks of a thousand tanks. Across the continent, Europe's once humming economies stood silent. Over 60 million people had died, including 6 million Jews who were killed in the  Here in the United States, we mourned the loss of over 400,000 of our soldiers. We had spent, in today's dollars, nearly $4 trillion to secure that victory in World War But to secure the peace, our leaders understood that even more was required of us. Truman's Secretary of State, George Marshall, told the Nation that without a return to ``normal economic health in the world,'' there could be ``no assured peace.'' In other words, if famine and poverty remained unchecked across Europe, unanswered, fascism and communism would soon follow, threatening U.interests and global stability at the same time.  So after years of sacrifice--sacrifice that this generation of Americans, thank goodness, has never had to endure--the easy course would have been to withdraw behind the Atlantic and the Pacific, turn our back on the world, and embrace isolation.  Instead, we proposed the Marshall Plan, a bold investment to revive Europe's economies, modernize industry, and expand trade, not only for allies like France and Britain but also for our enemies, Germany and It was extraordinary that political leaders here once made those decisions. I struggle to think of a time in human history when the victor helped to revive the vanquished with no strings attached, no colonial objective.  As the Marshall Plan made its way through Congress, leaders in Washington made the case to the American people, even standing firm against some who wanted to require European countries to buy only American products with the aid that we gave them. Still in the years to come, American farmers and manufacturers would fill millions of crates of wheat and wood, of sugar and steel to rebuild Europe from the ravages of war.  President Truman understood that, in time, strong European economies would become strong trading partners, strong military allies, and a bulwark of freedom against Soviet expansion. History proved him right, to say the least.  After the Marshall Plan, Western Europe surged back to life as Eastern Europe stagnated behind the Iron In the West, production rose and hunger fell. Foes became friends. Bonds across the Atlantic solidified. Investments through the Marshall Plan helped lay the foundation for NATO, the common market, and the European  Few actions in our foreign policy have been as consequential for America's long-term interests, for our national interests, and all at a cost of $150 billion in today's dollars--25 times less than the total cost of World War II[[Page S3319]]and about 25 times less than what we paid in the wars in Iraq and  As President Truman invested in Europe's recovery, he also helped fashion a new world order from the rubble of war. American leadership forged global institutions to enshrine our interests and values around the world for generations, giving rise to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the entire international system that we have today.  Seventy years ago, President Truman had the vision to think longer term. He had the wisdom to see that what was good for others was often good for us as well. And he had the courage to ask our citizens to lead, to sacrifice, and to believe that even after the second war in a generation, it was still within their power to shape a lasting peace.  Those actions, those qualities are why Truman's Presidency marks one of the finest periods in American foreign policy in the history of our foreign policy. The comparison with what we are seeing today just couldn't be starker.  Under the banner of putting America first, President Trump has undermined our interests at nearly every turn. At a time when China proposes to spend over a trillion dollars to expand its global influence with new railroads from Hungary to Kenya, new bridges and tunnels linking Southeast Asia together, and new electrical plants to power Pakistan, President Trump proposes to slash our foreign assistance advancing U.interests around the world. At a time when NATO faces challenges to its east and south, President Trump publicly rebukes the alliance and refuses to reinforce its bedrock principle of collective security.  As the recent terrorist attack unfolded in London, President Trump took to Twitter to promote his political agenda and sow fear in the wake of that attack. In the face of challenges like extremism and instability that demand 40-year strategies like the ones President Truman had in mind, President Trump is conducting his foreign policy 140 characters at a time.  Now, as the world unites to confront the perils of climate change, our President has withdrawn from the landmark Paris Agreement, which we helped forge, in a shameful abdication of America's global leadership. In doing so, the President ignored the voices of millions of Americans and thousands of businesses, urging him--against the arguments that he made--to stay in the agreement for climate reasons, for economic reasons, and for national security reasons as well. By withdrawing from it, the President has turned his back on millions of people across the globe, as well, mostly the poor, who are already on the edge of crisis, who may face drought, displacement, and famine from a warming planet.  America has a strong interest in avoiding that future. Anybody who has seen what has happened since the Arab Spring understands what resulted from a doubling of the price of wheat in A wise leader could see that. A President Truman would see that.  Like the Marshall Plan, the Paris Agreement recognized that in the modern world there is no ``over there'' anymore. Today, over there is here, and here is over there, and our President fundamentally doesn't understand it.  He claimed that withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would ``put America first.'' In fact, this move threatens to put America last--last in innovation, last in clean energy, last in science, last in our moral responsibility to hand the next generation a safe and stable planet. That is why States and cities all across the country are making their own commitments to honor the Paris  Now it is just us, Nicaragua, and Syria on the other side. That is why towns, cities, and States all across the country are scrambling to fill the void of leadership left by the administration to show the rest of the world that we are serious too.  In my home State of Colorado, we know that we can protect our economy and our climate, that we can grow our economy and protect our climate. We see those as linked together. You can't do one without the other. We developed the first State limits on methane pollution. We passed the first voter-led renewable standard in the entire We established our own limits on carbon pollution. And in the process, we have created 13,000 renewable energy jobs, with wind jobs alone expected to triple by 2020. On average, those jobs pay a salary of $50,000. We are manufacturing again in our State with the supply chains that come along with it.  What comes with those commonsense regulations? One of the strongest economies in America, the lowest unemployment rate in America, and we see this all across the country. New energy jobs are growing 12 times faster than the overall economy. The President doesn't see any of that.  In a matter of months, from foreign assistance, to global alliances, to terrorism and climate change, the administration has imperiled America's stature with a shortsighted and willfully ignorant agenda that is profoundly out of step with the realities of the world and the interests of the people of the United  In a recent op-ed, senior officials from the administration painted the world as no more than an ``arena'' where nations ``compete for advantage.'' They were trying to explain the President's behavior while he was in That attitude marks a huge departure from generations of American foreign policy. This is not about the Obama administration; this is about a set of traditional American values and approaches to the world that we have had almost since the Nation's founding, and the space the President is creating out there in the world by abandoning those treasured American values gives space to those who seek every single day to undermine the liberal world order that has allowed our country and allies across the globe to succeed.  The President should understand that generations of leaders in the United States have put America first. They have always put America first--not in slogans or stump speeches but in the alliances and institutions we built, the values we champion, the alliances we forged that have given our world 70 years of peace and prosperity. That is a legacy upon which we must build--one that has put America first and has kept America first today and, if we act wisely, I think for decades to come.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

6990,topic-id,458,"Mr.Chairman, I believe the bill before us today is a well-intentioned attempt to create a process which would minimize the risk of fire along electrical utilities' rights-of-way. Yes, there are some problems with the bill, but my most significant objection is that this bill, our Natural Resources Committee, and this Congress refuse to act on the urgent need to address how our U.Forest Service deals with wildfires.  The Forest Service burned through more than half of its budget last year fighting wildfires. Yet our leadership won't bring to the floor for a vote a bipartisan legislation that deals with the problem of ``fire borrowing.''  In the 114th Congress, just such a bill, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act had 151 cosponsors--67 Republicans, 84 Democrats--but it never even got a committee hearing. So that is disappointing, and even irresponsible.  So, once again, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are going to go into this fire season knowing that they don't have the resources to do the work necessary to mitigate wildfire damage on U.public lands.  In a recent report on fire suppression costs, the Forest Service reported that funding available for recreation, heritage, and wilderness had fallen 15 percent; funding for roads is down 46 percent; facility spending, off 68 percent; deferred maintenance outlays have been slashed by a disastrous 95 percent.  Mr.Chairman, in my two terms on the Natural Resources Committee, we often debate and fret about how little money is available for maintenance of our public lands, the deferred maintenance. The diversion of these funds for wildfire suppression is among the many causes.  Non-fire-related staff has been cut by 39 percent since 1998, and over the last two decades, the cost of fire preparedness and suppression activities has grown from 62 percent of the Forest Service's total budget, to more than half--52 percent.  That shift has come at the expense of programs and staff that every American wants: staff on recreation, permits, timber sales, hunting, and fishing. Everything else is suffering because of our inability to deal in a constructive way with wildfire mitigation.  So now is the time that we address wildfires to be treated as the major disasters they are and for the efforts to put them out, to be eligible for disaster assistance, and not subtract it from funds that land managers need to do their daily jobs.  So my very simple one-sentence amendment simply says that no money in this bill--this bill will not divert legitimate wildfire mitigation money more to wildfires than is already there.  I urge you to vote ``yes'' on my amendment so, at the very least, we can prevent this bill from detracting from further Federal wildfire suppression efforts.

6696,topic-id,1344,"Mr.President, I am proud to join my colleagues tonight because this Nation stands at a precipice--on the verge of a tragic mistake, about to embark on a travesty that mocks the democratic process. Truly, the combination of secrecy and speed are a toxic recipe in our democracy. Secrecy and speed will bring us recklessly over the edge of that precipice to tragic mistakes that belie and betray the people of America and the values that we all share in this Chamber, because they are basic to the American way of life.  Healthcare is a right, and it should be recognized as a right. The goal of extensive and comprehensive insurance coverage has to be, ultimately, a goal that we share in common, but, right now, we are speeding secretly toward a betrayal of American values and even of our constitutional duties. I am deeply disappointed that the secrecy employed by my colleagues has brought us, recklessly and reprehensibly, to the verge of gutting the Affordable Care  The absence of hearings before the committee, the absence of public debate, the absence of any text of a bill that can be debated and offered for public comment leaves us without the democratic bedrock principle of listening to the people of America and listening to the people who are most affected, who know the most--the experts and the patients. In fact, it is the patients who deserve to be heard here perhaps most of all. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seemingly will go to any length to suppress the cruelty that lies in their alleged healthcare bill. President Trump has called it mean, and that is an understatement. It is cruel beyond words and costly in lives and in dollars and cents because it will deepen and worsen healthcare issues that can be prevented and made curable or more palatable.  Let's be clear. This secrecy--a small group of men making decisions about our entire healthcare system, with no input from women, from Medicaid beneficiaries, from people with substance use disorders, from patients struggling with mental health illness, or struggling with any disease at all--is irresponsible and deadly and truly cruel and costly to our democracy.  The way these discussions have been done are a stain on this body and a slap in the face to every American who relies on us to make decisions that are in the best interests of their family as well as themselves. My colleagues seemingly would prefer to ram and rush a deeply flawed and unpopular bill through this body, ignoring the needs and will of the people they represent. That is a sad day in this  We need public hearings, not for their own sake, not for our sake but for the individual recovering from substance use disorder thanks to Medicaid; for the mother of a little girl with a preexisting condition, terrified of how she will pay for her care and able to do so now because of the Affordable Care Act; for the woman who is at a Planned Parenthood clinic today receiving a mammogram and other cancer screenings and other preventive healthcare testing, as well as men, because of the coverage provided to them by Medicaid and the Affordable Care Defunding Planned Parenthood, risking, again, preexisting conditions, eliminating the guarantee of essential health benefits, such as maternity care, is a war on women's healthcare and a disservice to our democracy done in secrecy.  My colleagues across the aisle may succeed in gutting our Nation's healthcare system, but the people who pay the highest price will be ordinary Americans, working men and women and their families who now have healthcare coverage to prevent more serious illness and who will now go without it.  Secrecy is the reason I convened an emergency field hearing on healthcare today in Connecticut, on very short notice--literally 24, 48 hours--and people came from across Connecticut at 9 a.m. on a Monday morning. My staff did yeoman's work putting together the logistics. The outpouring of anxiety and anger was remarkable, as was the eloquence and power of the insights offered by people about their own situations as well as about others whose interests they advocate. Many decided to stay and stand, even though the room afforded inadequate numbers of seats for everyone. It was standing room only, and they literally streamed out the door. The stories they told are worth hearing, and we have an obligation to listen to these  I told them I would personally bring their voices and their faces to this Chamber, to the floor of the U.In the coming days, that is exactly what I will do because people need to hear the story of a beautiful young woman who now is incapacitated because she suffered from an overdose after seeking treatment, and the effect on others similarly seeking treatment will be so dire and damaging if coverage for addiction treatment and abuse treatment is eliminated.  They need to hear the story of Sean, who similarly sought to overcome a substance abuse problem. They need to hear about individuals who would suffer from preexisting conditions. Those stories are what I will be recounting in the coming days, as I share word for word their fears, their anxiety and apprehension, and their worry for America about what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is repealed and gutted.  We must build on that act. We must improve its defects and make sure it is worthy of the great goals we share but not destroy it or decimate it, and building on it, acting constructively, coming together is what we owe the American people.  The folks who came today to the State capitol in Hartford at my emergency healthcare hearing recognized that if they fail to stand up for Planned Parenthood or mental health or those people with preexisting conditions or Medicaid or their loved one who is battling a dreadful disease, no one will.  I am so proud of them and the people of Connecticut who have spoken up and stood up for the Affordable Care Act, and I am proud to bring their voices to the U.Senate--literally bring their voices here, as I will do over the coming days, as I read into the Record and put in the Record their testimony. I will hold a second hearing, probably later this week, because we couldn't hear from everyone who came to speak out and stand up.  I hope my Republican colleagues will stop their denial, cease ignoring and disregarding those voices, and come to listen to them instead and recognize they cannot conceal the fact that the Affordable Care Act has helped our Nation's health.  Gutting it without any hearings or public debate is unconscionable and reprehensible. It is a move they will regret. I stand ready to build on the great strides made by the Affordable Care Act, and I hope my colleagues are ready to do the same.  If this Chamber proceeds down this reckless and reprehensible path of secrecy and speed toward repeal and gutting the Affordable Care Act, I promise to do everything in my power and use every tool at our disposal to stop this process. We cannot go about normal business in the U.Senate while so many back in our States demand that we fight, and we must fight.  I will stand with hundreds of thousands in Connecticut who will lose their insurance--more than 220,000. I[[Page S3589]]will stand with the people of Connecticut who will lose billions of dollars in investment in healthcare. I will stand with more than 20,000 people in Connecticut and 1 million around the country who will lose jobs. According to a study recently done by the Commonwealth Fund, job losses are inevitably the result, at some point in the future, of gutting this program. I will stand with the people of America and my colleagues who will resist--indeed, resist--this secrecy and speed that so disserves the values and betrays the ethos and traditions of this body.

6766,topic-id,1543,"Mr.President, over the last 10 days, I have conducted[[Page S3819]]emergency field hearings, giving my constituents in Connecticut an opportunity to be heard, a chance for their voices and faces to be part of considering the Republican healthcare or really, more accurately, wealth care bill. Indeed, that label or characterization of the bill came from one my constituents who said: This plan is not healthcare, it is wealth care because it produces a massive transfer of wealth from the poor and middle-class Americans, whose healthcare would be deeply harmed, to the richest Americans, who would enjoy the benefits of hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts.  That kind of voice and criticism deserves to be heard here. Yet my Republican colleagues and their leadership have gone from total secrecy to total chaos. They are in chaos because they have refused to heed the voices and faces of ordinary, average working people--middle-class people, the most vulnerable people--who would be deeply harmed by this proposal.  One woman at one of my hearings in Connecticut, knowing what would happen under this bill, said to me:       Do the right thing. Save the Affordable Care Act and save      our lives.  She was not exaggerating when she said lives are at stake. She is right. This very eloquent woman, Amy Etkind, knows all too well what this bill means for Americans like her, and the man she described, literally, as the ``love of her life.'' She told me about him during a hearing in New Haven Friday afternoon--about how he has struggled with addiction, mental health issues, and now diabetes. He is alive today because of Medicaid, and he has access to the services he needs. As she said, ``If Medicaid were to go away, he would be literally dead in a very short period of time.''  When we say the Republican plan would cost lives--it would kill people--it is no hyperbole, no exaggeration. It is plain, simple fact. As Ronald Reagan said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' The fact is, this bill would cost the State of Connecticut nearly $3 billion in Federal funding over the next 10 years. These cuts, mainly to Medicaid, cannot and will not be replaced, as the CBO has predicted. It would leave States like Connecticut in an impossible position: either raise taxes to pay the difference or cut Medicaid enrollment to insurers, putting people like Amy's husband at risk, literally, of death; putting out on the streets the senior citizens living in the Monsignor Bojnowski Manor in New Britain, where they are enjoying great care--a high-quality environment because of Many of them are middle-class folks who worked hard, played by the rules, and exhausted their savings. They are vulnerable now because of the cost of healthcare and their care, in particular. The focus ought to be on them, on the people who are affected, not so much the numbers, but we know from the numbers that the Republican plan would disastrously raise premiums by 20 percent and would cut enrollment impact on the individual market--premiums and enrollment, apart from Medicaid, on the individual market. These numbers are from the Center on Budget and Policy They are fact. Facts are stubborn things.  We know also what the effects would be--what the numbers are for people who are middle income. The elimination of the tax credits for middle-income people paying their premiums would be nothing short of disastrous.  We focused on I talked to you about Amy and the love of her life and what the effects would be of the decimation of Medicaid, but here we are talking about the elimination of tax breaks that help middle-income people. I don't need to explain this graph. For someone with $26,500 in income, their premiums under the Senate plan would jump to $6,500 from the present $1,700. For somebody earning in the midfifties, the jump is even greater, and it is true even for people who are earning $68,200. They will have to pay more, a larger share of their income, and receive less. It is not only that the Senate plan is disastrous because it is more costly, it is also going to impact the quality of care by reducing the standards; eliminating the strict requirements on preexisting conditions, the protections on annual and lifetime caps for coverage, defunding Planned Parenthood, continuing the war on women's healthcare. The long and short of it is that this measure is bad for  Tia spoke to me at these hearings about the opioid epidemic. If there is one example that breaks our hearts and wrenches our guts, it is the effect on people who are trying to recover from opioid addiction and abuse. Their recovery would be shredded--maybe stopped--by gutting Medicaid coverage.  Another woman who spoke at my hearing, Donna Sager, called herself ``the perfect example as to why our healthcare plans must include preexisting conditions and not punish people like me with high premiums.'' Donna, as she told me, is 63 years old and not yet eligible for When she was 36, she was diagnosed with a rare form of hereditary colon cancer. For 27 years she has been undergoing major surgeries, constant screening, doctor visits to make sure she can remain as healthy as possible. Then she told me about her husband, a man in his seventies, and she said this:       He would like to retire, but how can he with all my medical      expenses? I am frightened what I will do if the Republican      healthcare bill gets passed. Changes to preexisting coverage      will be extremely damaging to me, how will I pay these costs      and high premiums? The republican healthcare plan wants to      punish me for having cancer.  She closed by saying:       It is as though Washington wants to punish me again for      having cancer and being older. . . . I never would have      expected that the greatest country in the world would treat      me like this.  There is a path forward, and it requires our Republican colleagues very simply to start over, to work with Democrats, to abandon this misguided, myopic effort to repeal, repeal, repeal. That mantra simply is not a policy for American healthcare.  What is needed is to build on the Affordable Care Act, to improve it, to correct its defects. We can do it if we work together and if we focus on the rising costs of medical care and try to bring them down, if we focus on the regulatory barriers to entering insurance markets and seek to eliminate them, if we focus on the FDA drug approval process and seek to responsibly and safely expedite new drugs coming to market, if we enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices as the VA does. Those examples of improving the present system are doable. They require leadership, which has been lacking and most particularly lacking at the White  Yesterday, we saw a picture that is worth a thousand words: the President of the United States sitting with Members of this body, but only Members of this body from the other side of the aisle--only Republican It was almost the entire membership on the Republican side. Not a single Democrat was invited, not a single Democrat consulted, not a single Democrat involved in the continuing process now of producing yet another plan behind closed doors in secrecy.  The majority leader announced it just today. The effort is to have another version to be submitted to the CBO by Friday, but that process simply continues the present fatal flaw in my Republican colleagues' thinking, which is that they can do it with only one party. I want to give credit to our Republican colleagues who had the courage and strength to say no because they saw it was bad for  In closing, I want to say that my Republican colleagues will be going home this weekend. They have been looking at themselves in the mirror, at their consciences, and they have been seeing something they don't like--a moral failing in this bill, not just a political failing or a policy defect but a real moral failing.  Healthcare is a right, and even if my Republican colleagues disagree on that point, they have to recognize that taking away healthcare, decimating Medicaid, waging war on women's health, depriving children of the preventive care they need so they can go to school and learn properly, evicting seniors from nursing homes, putting the burden of billions of dollars on my State of Connecticut and every State represented in this body, and other grotesque, cruel, costly impacts of this bill are the wrong ways to go. They know that when they look in the mirror, but they will know it even more powerfully when they look in the eyes of their constituents this week--if they have the guts and courage and heart to do so.[[Page S3820]]  This wealth care plan is doomed to failure. Even if it passes, it is doomed to fail It is a moral failing, not just a policy failing. The health of our consciences, as well as our physical well-being, hangs in the balance.  Thank you.

6827,topic-id,1228,"Mr.President, this body has a dual obligation--to ensure that there are sanctions against Iran for its destabilizing activity around the region and, indeed, the world but also sanctions against Russia for its interference with our election--one of the core democratic institutions of our Nation--as well as other acts that are hostile to the world order and to world peace.  I support 722, the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, but I strongly believe it should have Russian sanctions included as well.  As the Senate proceeds to this urgently needed measure, Iran's own Parliament has suffered an ISIS-claimed terrorist attack in I condemn that act of terror--one of many the world has suffered because of We are at war with ISIS as we are with terrorists--extremism--around the world. It intentionally targets civilians. It uses violence to spread terror and destabilize the Middle ISIS has been a world terror organization.[[Page S3316]]  The fact that Iran's leaders themselves direct and glorify terrorism against Israel and the United States does not diminish the horror of what has occurred. People of all faiths from an increasingly diverse number of nations have become victims of this terror spread by ISIS and What occurred today is, sadly, more evidence that Iran's unconditional support for Bashar al-Assad is directly counter to the interests of the Iranian people and our ongoing efforts to defeat  We must hold Iran accountable. We must hold it accountable for its many malign activities through increasing and enforcing strong, targeted sanctions. I thank my colleagues, including Senator McCain, who just spoke so forcefully on the floor, Senator Menendez, Senator Corker, Senator Cardin, as well as other colleagues who have worked on this cause. We must hold Iran accountable for the threat its acts of terrorism pose to our national security. We must hold it accountable to the threat its missile program holds to our allies, including Israel--our major strategic partner in that region. We must hold Iran accountable for the gross violations of human rights and war crimes that it and Russia together are perpetrating in  In the last few months, Iran has tested and fired ballistic missiles, tested a new Russian-made air defense system against missiles, and harassed U.ships. It continues to arm and enable the Hamas terrorist organization, the despotic Assad regime, and the supply of weapons to It has enabled Hezbollah to amass 150,000 rockets and missiles--all aimed at civilians in  Last month, the State Department released a report on Iran's human rights violations. It continues to show a troubling trend of abuse and notes that Iran has more than 800 political prisoners and that it executed at least 469 people just last year.  We know that sanctions must be targeted and continually strengthened to deter This legislation will impose sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, human rights violations, and ballistic missile development. That includes sanctioning any person who knowingly violates arms embargoes or materially contributes to Iran's ballistic missile program. It also includes terrorism-related sanctions on members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its affiliates--going beyond members of the Quds Force, who are already sanctioned.  In no way does this sanctions program contradict or undermine the nuclear agreement with That agreement provided us and our allies the time and space to now push Iran to end its malign activities without the imminent threat of a nuclear weapon.  Congress must do everything it can to authorize new measures against Iran and ensure that this new administration effectively enforces them. We must also seize this opportunity to hold Russia accountable as well for its egregious, aggressive behavior and ongoing violations of international law.  Russia's cooperation with Iran, including providing Iran with an S-300 air missile defense system that it recently tested, strengthens Iran as it fuels and finances a network of terrorism. Under Putin's direction, Russia both enabled and tried to cover up crimes in It invaded It illegally annexed It attacked and interfered with our democracy.  Enough is enough. That is why I urge this body to adopt Russian sanctions as part of 722. Sadly and dangerously, our President has proven time and again to be unwilling to hold Vladimir Putin accountable. Congress must ensure that he does so. It must ensure that Russia receives a clear, unequivocal signal through this measure, Senator Cardin's Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act, and Senator Graham's Russia Sanctions Review Act, as an amendment to be adopted by this body to the Iran legislation, which I helped author. These measures are critical to sending a message that we will hold Russia accountable for its lawbreaking, its support of terrorism, its interference in our elections, its annexation of Crimea, its invasion of Ukraine, and its violation of the INF I can accept nothing short of including these Russia bills to move forward to a final vote. I will support 722, but I believe there is a track and a path for this body to do both, and we must do it.  The imposition of mandatory sanctions codifying former President Obama's Executive orders regarding Ukraine and malicious cyber activity, as well as targeting individuals and entities contributing to Russia's oil and gas industries, should be part of this final passage. We cannot afford to wait any longer to take action.  I am disappointed that the President has seemed disinterested or at least unwilling to join in these sanctions against Unfortunately, the testimony that former Director Jim Comey will deliver tomorrow provides evidence as to possible motive and intent in his discussions with Comey that reflect on his apparent willingness to tolerate this aggressive conduct by Russia without holding it accountable.  This testimony from Director Comey is an explosive corroboration of the facts that have been reported--that the President asked for loyalty, threatening Jim Comey's job, and tried to influence the FBI's ongoing criminal investigation on multiple occasions. This conduct shows unequivocally the disdain the President has for the rule of law and clearly demonstrates that he believes he and his friends and family are above the law. I am saddened and I am chilled that this harrowing account will be given to the Senate Intelligence Committee rather than, in fact, in a fictional spy novel.  Director Comey deserves credit for his willingness to come before the committee, for his apparent candor and truthfulness, and for his resistance to those demands for a pledge of loyalty and an end to the Flynn investigation, even when it meant his firing.  His testimony should serve as evidence in the investigation led by Robert Mueller but also as evidence that Mr.Mueller must have unimpeded space, resources, and independence to conduct his investigation. I will take action as a member of the Judiciary Committee to seek oversight simply to ensure that those resources are independent and are safeguarded. With this documented proof, clearly the White House has sought to derail our law enforcement officials in their enforcing of the law. We must ensure an end to such conduct, and we must send Russia a signal that, in fact, it will be held accountable; that the investigation into its meddling in our election will be pursued vigorously and aggressively; that anyone in this country who colluded with or aided and abetted that meddling will be held accountable; and that there will be no obstruction of justice. This goal should unite us across the aisle on a bipartisan basis.  Thank you, Mr. ",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3303-4.txt,2076,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,7.0,June

I am grateful for my colleague from Hawaii and for my colleagues from across the country who are going to be coming to the floor tonight.  This is going to be a long evening because there are a lot of folks who are frustrated. There is frustration not just about the actual bill itself, a lot of this frustration right now is building because of the brokenness of this process. It is a process that is right now about secrecy. It is a process that has been conducted behind closed doors in back rooms. It is a process that is not reflective of our history, of our traditions, or of the many calls from both sides of the aisle, in my short time in the Senate, hearing echoes of a chorus from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who talk about regular order, regular order, regular order.  Several of my colleagues and I earlier were asking for unanimous consent--trying to use the process of the Senate to bring about a better process--a process that would bring this legislation out into the light of day and create an opportunity reflective of the Affordable Care Act, where we would have people able to put input into this process. A debate would happen. Discussion would happen. Actually, we would come forward with a bill the American public would see go through the debates.  In fact, through the process, the very Constitutional Convention of this country--perhaps some of the biggest issues of humanity--were debated in an open forum. We have records of those discussions, records of those deliberations. Everything from the representation that each State should have to issues as profound as slavery were right there, out in the open. Tonight, it is remarkable to me, it is almost tragic to me, to see a process that is so broken, a process that is so secretive, a process happening in back rooms--everything Americans dislike about politics of old--people working in secret on a bill they are going to try to force through Congress with no public input, no hearings, no meetings, no markups, no debate, no public accountability.  So there will be a lot of voices tonight speaking about the realities of this legislation. I am one of those folks. I came from a children's hospital this afternoon with parents and with children who suffered accidents--car accidents and more--telling me how they were relying on I think it is one of the most terrifying things that is about to happen because people look at the House bill--a bill our President even called mean--and they are fearing for their own communities, fearing for families like theirs.  I understand the substance of this bill should have many people afraid about what kind of country we are going to be when we look at the House version of the bill and see that it violates our common values and ideals as a nation--to give massive tax breaks worth hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to the wealthiest and, at the same time, cut the social safety net to a degree we haven't seen in my lifetime. The substance of this is frightening, but the process, to me, violates the values I know so many of my colleagues hold and that any of us, watching this happen in an objective way, would criticize.  We know the starting place in the We know the details of that bill--23 million Americans losing health insurance, the gutting of Medicaid by $800 billion, throwing one-sixth of our economy into crisis, but it is the process that is fundamentally at odds with the principles and the values of especially this body, the When I was running for this office, I had so many people come to me and say: This is the greatest deliberative body on the planet Earth--the Senate--which slows things down, the saucer that cools the tea as our ancestors said. This body has a history of grappling with issues. This process is so at odds with everything I believe about this body and how it is supposed to operate. The Senate is meant to be a place of powerful consideration of debate, of discussion.  Now, the history of this body and its debates and discussions is really interesting. The longest consecutive session in Senate history was a debate during the First World War about whether to arm merchant ships. That is the record. By the way, issues of war and peace I would hope would bring about substantive, deliberative debate, discussion, open air. This body is probably--in fact, the elder statesmen and[[Page S3579]]women in this body I have spoken to on both sides of the aisle, sometimes the most difficult decisions they have made are involving war and peace. What is interesting, if you look at the history of the body, the longest consecutive session debate was about war and whether to arm merchant ships in the First World  What was the second longest debate? The second longest consecutive session in Senate history was actually healthcare, or, more specifically, it was the healthcare debate in 2010 about the Affordable Care Act or so-called In fact, here we are looking at a process that seems to be screaming something to the floor: No hearings, no markups, no committee sessions--screaming to the floor in the shadow of the second longest consecutive session of debate. That, to me, is a contrast that speaks volumes about the wrongness of this moment in history. Anyone objectively standing back would agree and concur that for something that is so deeply at the core of what our country is about--we literally founded this Nation because of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--life. What more fundamental aspect of life is there?  A critical constituent part of that has to be how we preserve life, how we embolden life. What is the state of our healthcare? For this great, historic, deliberative body to be doing that without so much as a pause, with the brilliant minds on both sides of this aisle, with the thoughtful people on both sides of this aisle, people who have come through portals and processes where they expose themselves and their lives to public discussion, public debate--that is what a democracy is, and that is what this Republic was founded upon, not secrecy, not back rooms.  This body reflects the best of what democratic principles are. Now we are rushing something through that fundamentally affects life, and we are pushing it to the floor with an insult to our history, an insult to our values.  It has been said before, but I remind my colleagues that the Affordable Care Act had a lengthy process before that near recordbreaking consecutive days of session. The Senate's HELP Committee held 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13 bipartisan hearings, 20 bipartisan walkthroughs, and considered nearly 300 amendments. The Affordable Care Act actually accepted over 160 amendments--160 Republican amendments to shape the bill.  The Finance Committee held 17 roundtables, summits, and hearings; 13 bipartisan Member meetings and walkthroughs, 38 meetings and negotiations, and then a 7-day markup on the bill--the longest markup in over 20 years. That is our history. In the end, the Affordable Care Act went through a lengthy process, through which the policy experts, market experts, medical professionals, health nonprofits, insurers, hospitals, and families all came to this Senate and put forward their input and their ideas.  This wasn't a Republican bill or a Democratic bill by the politicians themselves. America was invited to the table. Hours and hours of hearing records show that people--whether the bill ended up reflecting their ideas or not--had their say. That is what is beautiful about this democracy, is that the dignity and the voice and the opinions of others is brought into the process.  I was mayor of Newark during the time that this process was going on. People in my community were riveted by it. They knew that issues that would affect their lives were going on here in the U.Senate, at a time when the 1 reason for personal bankruptcy in my State was because people were declaring bankruptcy because of their healthcare bills--something that is not happening now at those levels.  People were caring and concerned about what was going on, and representatives from my community came down. I saw how that process shaped the bill. I saw how Republican ideas shaped the bill. I saw how hospitals and insurers and advocates and doctors and nonprofits, the AARP, and others let their voices be heard, shaped the process, had input, had voice, and their dignity and perspectives were respected.

6711,topic-id,173,"Thank you very much.  The Senator's charts plainly showed who benefits from the Republican bill that we saw in the The CBO, as he pointed out, plainly demonstrates that 23 million Americans will lose healthcare. I have heard him talk about this on other issues--how we as Americans are far more connected than we realize and that while one family might suffer from lack of health insurance--like the folks he talked about in the beginning of his remarks--the reality is that when that child doesn't get the healthcare they deserve, when they don't achieve in life the great potential they might have, others suffer as well. You see this as you travel to European countries. They have vastly more people insured, vastly more investments in childhood education and childhood healthcare.  I am wondering if the Senator can extrapolate for me for a moment that this isn't just about individual families who are vulnerable. It is really all Americans, who suffer when other Americans are not getting the benefit of healthcare in this country.  ",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3573-2.txt,2194,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,19.0,June

I was mayor of a city, and I imagine my experience is similar to that of the Senator from Our hospitals before the Affordable Care Act were having a really difficult time because so many of those costs at the most expensive point--when a disease had become so much more acute--were being pushed into hospital emergency rooms. My State was having a very difficult time with the costs of that charity care. They literally had tough choices. They weren't going to close their doors when somebody went into diabetic shock or someone had an asthma attack or some of those diseases were not treated at an earlier stage.  I am wondering if the Senator can help explain, in terms of Connecticut's perspective, why this has an impact on all of us in terms of the systemic healthcare systems that sustain our communities.

They talked about the Connecticut As you well know, this was a compromise that allowed our Republic to form, understanding they would have two bodies, the House and Every State would have two Members representing it. In many ways, the Founders of our country, coming out of this, viewed this body very differently than the other body.  Now, the other body, you served in. I am hoping maybe you can shine some light. I have been here 3\1/2\ years. You had experience as a House Member and as a You said something some people at home might dismiss as hyperbolic partisanship, but I have been here 3\1/2\ years, and I have seen this body change. What frustrates me is that when I was here for a brief period of time and Democrats were in the majority, I heard Republicans talk about regular order, how urgent regular order is. When we are in charge, we will have regular order. The leader spoke publicly about this thing called ``regular order.'' The House operates on majority rule. Our Founders saw that as a very different body than this, which is in many ways talked about as a different rhythm--a different way of doing things. In fact, one Senator over here can have a lot of power within this system, sometimes to the frustration of folks, to slow things down.  You made the claim about this being broken. This is a perfect example of it--this idea that this would be the body, on such a big issue, that would have a chance to be deliberative and to focus on this. I think you are right. We have seen this body, in the very short period of time I have been here, begin to undermine not just things that happened under the Obama administration but to undermine traditions that go back decades, if not more than a century.  I wonder if, being that State, as I was told, so critical to our Constitution, you could give some light on why you really are substantively, factually saying that this is probably one of the low moments of the Senate in the way that this process is being done.

6720,topic-id,3983,"Thank you very much, Mr. I want to pick up on that conversation that we were having, in which Senator Murphy laid plain on his charts about larger issues with this bill. I want to get back to the point he was just talking about and that I observed here in the Senate for about 3\1/2\ years, and that is the functioning of this body. I love history. I am one of these guys who doesn't read any fiction any more. I love reading about this country, about its past leaders, about great moments in history.  What is interesting about this body is that, being someone who has the privilege to stand on this floor--quite literally, given to me by the State that I love, New Jersey--I walk on this floor and I feel a sense of history every time I am here. It has been 3\1/2\ years, and it hasn't lost its ``wow'' factor for me that I get to stand on this floor. I have to say that I love my State, and in my campaigning, I don't think the issue that I am New Jersey's first Black Senator came up that much. New Jerseyans wanted to know: Would I come down here and fight for them? I was aware of the history of being the fourth African American popularly elected in the history of this body. I came down here as a student of many of the great moments in time on this floor and many of the records that were set.  I think some of those records are really germane to this moment right now. The longest filibuster on this floor is where one Senator could actually grind the workings of the Senate down to a crawl because of Senate rules and Senate traditions. In this case, it is something I wasn't even alive for, but something that, to me, is frustrating. But it is a moment of history that shows what regular order is. It slows down this body.  A filibuster takes 60 votes to overcome. So here was this moment. It was[[Page S3603]]actually almost exactly 60 years ago. That was the 1957 Civil Rights It was Strom Thurmond who gave this long filibuster, trying to block something that--yes, indeed--was going to have societal impacts on this country--the 1957 Civil Rights This is one illustration of how, when monumental pieces of legislation come to this floor, the history of this body and the traditions of this body are to slow things down, to have a process, to have rules--especially for things that are so monumental. In this case, it was the 1957 Civil Rights Act--something on which we look back in the past and say: Wow, it took them a long time to get there, but it demonstrates what this body's rules have been about for a long time.  Let me go with another record that I mentioned earlier tonight, but it shows, again, that when monumental pieces of legislation are coming, this is a body that looks closely, takes its time, is deliberative, and has a time-honored process. That is the other record set by the longest consecutive session in Senate history. It was a debate about truly one of the more important things in our society, which is issues of war and peace. The longest consecutive session in the Senate history of debate and of deliberation--open and public, not just for the Nation to see but for the world to see--was a debate during the First World War about whether to arm merchant ships. It brought about tremendous consternation, tremendous debate, as we did the lead up to the First World What is interesting is, if you think about the forming of our country in that debate--again, the Constitutional Convention was public, open, transparent--issues were debated. One of the fundamental reasons for organizing our government was seen as the protection of the American people, the ideals of a common defense, and the public welfare. These were the things, literally, put into the preamble of our Constitution, about what this government is about--that these are the most important ideals. In fact, we herald some of these ideals. They have become part of our civic gospel. Everyone knows when they hear the words ``liberty and justice for all'' that they are part of our civic gospel.  Part of that gospel, as well--in the core center of our country--is that this is a nation about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As to that word ``life,'' this government, this Republic is affirming the ideals of life. It is only understandable when we are debating epic pieces of legislation that will go to affect the lives of tens of millions of  I was in the children's hospital today. Families in peril, families in crisis were talking about the lives of their children. I have seen it happen, unfortunately, to neighbors and people of my community. When the lives of their children are at stake or threatened or afflicted with disease, it puts so many things in perspective.  So here we have legislation speeding its way to the Senate floor that goes to the fundamental ideals of this Will we be a country that has a system of healthcare that affirms life?  When we are talking about records in the Senate, it is no coincidence to me that one of the longest times that there was a consecutive session in Senate history for debate--no coincidence to me--was about war and peace. It was the rush, as some people saw it then, toward war in World War What is fascinating is that folks should know that the second longest consecutive session in Senate history was about healthcare. It was in 2010. It was over the Affordable Care Act, a bill that the full Senate spent 25 consecutive days considering, 160 hours. Those 160 hours in session does not include hundreds more hours in committee hearings, in meetings. All that took place in the development of a bill that came to this floor and set a record about being the second longest debate.  It is perfectly justifiable that the bill should have taken so much time, so much focus--that the world's greatest deliberative body would deliberate, would do its job. As for that piece of legislation, don't believe the lie; it wasn't rushed through here. It didn't get the express train through the It set records for discussion, deliberation, debate, and a process that included comments, input, thoughts, and testimony from Americans across the country--not just red States, not just blue States, but of all It was justifiable. It was absolutely justifiable.  I wasn't here. I was at home in I was mayor of the city.  This debate went on and on and on, and it captured the attention of the It was something I had never seen before and I haven't seen since. The President of the United States then, Barack Obama--this to me was stunning; it caught my attention--was on national TV cameras. Sure, it was C-SPAN--not what I turn to first when I am home relaxing on my couch. But the President of the United States invited Congress in--Republicans, some of the smartest minds. I have served here 3\1/2\ years now. Some of the smartest minds I have met in this country are here in the Senate on the Republican side. He invited the Congress in to discuss and debate with him on live TV healthcare. I don't know if Reagan did that. I don't know if Bill Clinton did that. I can't remember that they did. So here was something that was done fully in the light, vetted, debated, deliberated, discussed in open air.  The hearing numbers are incredible. I have been here 3\1/2\ years, and I have never seen anything like it. In the Senate's so-called HELP Committee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--they held 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13 bipartisan hearings, 20 bipartisan walkthroughs, and they considered 300 amendments. This is the thing I didn't know until I got to the Senate because of all the rhetoric on 24-hour cable news. This wasn't a purely Democratic bill. They actually accepted over 160 amendments from The stories I have heard from people on both sides of the aisle is that they were bending over backward trying to pick up one Republican vote, so they incurred and took on amendments that actually shaped the bill, Republican ideas onto this healthcare bill, 160 amendments. But stop, that is only in the HELP  In the Senate Finance Committee, they held 17 bipartisan roundtables, they held summits and hearings, 13 member meetings and walkthroughs, 38 meetings and negotiations, bipartisan. They held a markup. I have been to lots of markups. I have never seen them last or scarcely can think of times they have lasted for more than a day, but they held, in the Finance Committee, a 7-day markup on the bill. That 7-day markup--talk about records--that 7-day markup was the longest markup on a bill in 20 years. That was the process.  A bill affecting that fundamental American ideal that this Nation--founded like no other, not a theocracy, not a monarchy. It is the oldest constitutional democracy on the planet Earth that affirmed ideals that put into the ether of Earth, for the first time, this Constitution, talking about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This healthcare bill involved such debate and discussion and the Nation participated. Policy experts, market experts, medical professionals, health nonprofits, insurers, hospitals, Americans all got to put forward their input, their ideas. Sure, all of them were not accepted, but everything went into the mix.  This should be shocking to the consciousness of all people of good conscience who aren't reflexively partisan, but look at the history of this country, a history that is proud, a history that should be shameful about how things got done in matters of war and peace, in matters of foreign policy and domestic, in matters like integration and civil rights that made it possible for me to stand on the Senate floor. There was a process, and somehow in the last 3\1/2\ years--in the name of what? A vicious brand of partisanship that somehow undercuts not just the voice of Democrats, not just the voice of policy experts, not just the voice of hospital experts, not just the voice of medical professionals--it doesn't just undercut their involvement in the process, but it is an insult to the history and the traditions of this body.  This was not the constitutional intent that something as important as healthcare should be done in a back room where a small handful of Senators are trying to hammer out amongst themselves a piece of legislation that is going to affect tens of millions of Americans and change our economy and change our communities. There is honor in this place that isn't[[Page S3604]]on There are good folks on both sides of the aisle. I have gotten to know them. I consider folks my friends. I know their hearts. This does not sit well the way this is being handled. I know it.  This is one of those moments of history that somebody just needs to raise their hand and say: You know what. I might even like that bill that comes out of that back room. I may like that bill that was hammered out by 12 Republicans, but this process is wrong. It is an insult to our history. I wouldn't want this done to me.  This is the moment. It is a test. History will look back and see what this body did at this moment in history. I fear we are going to fail the test.  What is even more painful than that, for me, is not just the sadness or the anguish I feel about a body contorting its traditions, breaking its way, what even hurts me more than that is what they are going to be pushing through. We saw it in the  Instead of this body coming together--and literally there is agreement on this. All of us believe the Affordable Care Act needs to be improved. I have had it in conversations, formal and informal, that we could build upon the Affordable Care We could correct for its deficiencies, and we could build upon its extraordinary successes.  I see those extraordinary successes in my I have Republicans and Democrats who are now fearful about the consequences should a bill like the House Republican healthcare bill be made law. There are folks who fear for their families, fear for their children, who don't want to go back to the Nation we had before, where the 1 reason for bankruptcy was not being able to afford your medical bills, where people with preexisting conditions were denied insurance, when mental healthcare wasn't in parity with physical healthcare. I can go through all the things I have seen make a huge difference in New Jersey in communities, rural and urban, for  I want to highlight some of those right now, some of those questions that people are asking at home about what happens if a bill like the House bill becomes law, if they take that bill here in the Senate and push it through, send it back to the House this bill that subverted process, inclusion and debate and deliberation, and go to that process called reconciliation. There are questions that are being asked.  Here is one: What happens to a mother who is pregnant with, say, her second child who suddenly loses Medicaid coverage? Now, understand, a very large percentage of the children born in the United States of America are born covered by Medicaid, which we already see in this House bill is being gutted, which is the biggest rollback in the safety net in our country in my lifetime and more.  What happens to that mother who is pregnant with her second child and loses her Medicaid coverage and her prenatal care? If she loses her prenatal care along with it, what happens to that American citizen? What happens to that baby?  Well, we know that according to the U.Department of Health and Human Services, babies born to mothers who receive no prenatal care are five times more likely to die than those whose mothers did receive prenatal care. Tragically, women without prenatal care are three to four times more likely to suffer maternal mortality--that means dying in childbirth--than women with prenatal care, and these rates significantly increase for women of color.  What happens to the tens of thousands of mothers who may lose access to maternity services, and what happens to the already dismal infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rates in our country if this plan goes through? That is a legitimate question. The data is clear. You restrict access to prenatal care, you endanger children, Americans, and you endanger mothers.  Let's keep asking those questions. What happens to the healthcare worker who works 60 hours a week taking care of others but loses their own healthcare coverage and then is unable to afford getting screened themselves, preventive screenings for cancer--let's say ovarian cancer. What happens to them? We don't have to imagine what happens when millions of Americans forgo preventive screenings. We have factual data on what happens should access to those preventive screenings--like what happened with the House healthcare bill--what would happen.  The American Cancer Society tells us clearly that inadequate health coverage is a barrier to preventive care, early detection, and optimal treatment. They find, for example, that patients with stage II colorectal cancer who have it detected have higher survival rates. In fact, they point out that people with stage II colorectal cancer with adequate health insurance have better survival rates than people with stage I colorectal cancer who have no health coverage. In other words, the American Cancer Society shows that access leads to survival and denial leads to higher rates of death.  A recent cancer study found that ``the number of Americans whose cancers were diagnosed at the earliest stage when it was most likely to be cured increased after ObamaCare went into effect, and more citizens had access to health coverage.'' You take away the expanded coverage that was founded through ObamaCare, you decrease preventive screenings, you decrease early detention and, as indicated by the American Cancer Society, death rates go up.  Another question, in general: What happens to cancer rates in America when these gains are reversed? What happens when these gains are reversed? What happens to the father of two who is diagnosed with a rare cancer who can't afford the additional estimated $82,000? His cancer treatment goes up if this bill, like the Republican House bill, passes. That is what is estimated--$82,000 is what his cancer treatments would go up. What happens when he can't afford that care, when he is forced to choose between his family's home, for example, and treating his cancer?  Well, this is what we know. These are the facts that from 2010 to 2016, personal bankruptcy filings have dropped close to 50 percent in the United States of One of the collateral benefits of ObamaCare is there was a 50-percent drop in personal bankruptcy filings, with experts agreeing that the Affordable Care Act played an important role in this significant decrease.  A group of economists has estimated that the House Republican bill would cost the average enrollee more than $1,500 more per year than the current system. This is despite the fact the surveys have found that the majority of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings, with one study finding that 63 percent of Americans don't have the savings to cover a $500 emergency.  Remember what Senator Murphy showed? That is a bill that gives massive tax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans, shifting the cost burden so the average enrollee now under this bill is going to see a $1,500-more-per-year payment when the average American doesn't have the savings to cover about a $500 emergency.  Another question that folks are asking is, What happens to the family whose child with a disability loses their access to home and support services--the physical and speech therapy they receive through Medicaid--if the Republican plan goes forward?  I was in a hospital today with such parents telling me about children who--the only way they got the coverage was because of the expanded Now what happens under the Republican plan? We know that Medicaid is a critical lifeline for people and families with disabilities, providing access to services such as rehabilitative therapy to help children meet developmental goals.  One of the incredible young women, girls, I met today--because of developmental therapy, she went from not being able to walk to now continuing to do the things that her normal teenage peers and her twin sister are able to do.  We know that today, 15 percent of kids are growing up with developmental disabilities. In New Jersey, 1 in 41 children lives with autism. But this plan that was passed in the House threatens to make it more difficult for children with disabilities to receive the care they need, to go to school, and to live healthy lives. Losing coverage could mean the difference between a child with a disability achieving a developmental milestone or falling further behind. Unfortunately, in the Republican bill that passed the House,[[Page S3605]]that is exactly what will happen if it should become law.  If that bill passes, what will happen to older Americans who qualify for Medicare but still need access to critical health services? We know that insurance companies would likely be allowed to charge older Americans much higher premiums under the Republican plan. Remember, it used to be capped. The cost for older Americans used to be capped. It is now being estimated that Americans between the ages 55 and 64 would pay some of the highest increases. That increase would be $5,200 more per year. Standard & Poor's actually estimated that premiums for a 64-year-old could increase by 30 percent under the Republican bill that passed the  The Congressional Budget Office noted in their report on the House Republican health care plan that ``although the agencies expect that the legislation would increase the number of uninsured broadly, the increase would be disproportionately large among older people with lower incomes, particularly people between 50 and 64 years of age with incomes of less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level.'' Think about that for a second. Executives of insurance companies, pharma companies--the richest will get tax breaks into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the poorest folks, the elderly in our community, according to the CBO, would see their costs go up considerably.  The New Jersey Hospital Association noted that ``under current law, a 64-year-old making $26,500 a year will pay an average of $1,700 in annual premiums.'' Under the AHCA--the Republican plan in the House--that same individual making just above minimum wage will pay, under their plan, between $13,600 and $16,100 in premiums. That is the increase for older Americans, working That is the increase.  We know that as more older Americans lose their health coverage and in turn enter Medicare in worse health, our entire Medicare system is made weaker and less solvent.  If this bill passes, what happens to older Americans who have already spent their life savings in nursing homes? We know that right now for elder Americans in nursing homes, Medicaid actually covers the cost of two out of three of those individuals.  I will quote from a piece that ran just this past weekend in the New York Times: ``Roughly one in three people now turning 65 will require nursing home care at some point during his or her life.''  Over three-quarters of long stay nursing home residents will eventually be covered by  Many American voters think Medicaid is only for low-income adults and their children, for people who aren't ``like them.'' But Medicaid is not somebody else's insurance; it is an insurance for all of our mothers and fathers and eventually for ourselves.  I continue the quote:       Mr.Trump and the Republicans would lower spending on the      frailest and most vulnerable people in our healthcare system.      They would like most Americans to believe that these cuts      will not affect them, only their ``undeserving neighbors,''      but that hides the truth that draconian cuts to Medicaid      affect all of our families. They are a direct attack on our      elderly or disabled and are dangerous.  I want to wrap up with this concluding thought: We know right now that we are at a turning point in our country, that the process that has made this deliberative body known throughout the land, throughout humanity--that this deliberative body is about to alter its tradition and have a bill that affects tens of millions of Americans done and crafted in a back room without public input and rushed to this floor. That is what the process is right now.  As Martin Luther King said in a speech to the medical community for human rights in 1966, ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.''  This bill will perpetuate injustice in our It will further the gulf between the haves and have-nots. But it does not just target the vulnerable, the elderly, the poor; it targets all of us. It targets our character as a country, our highest ideals, the very core of many, if not all, of our The least of these. The least of these.  We cannot allow this legislation that will so hurt our country to be crafted in darkness behind closed doors. It subverts a mighty tradition of the world's most deliberative body to be rushed through and cause so much damage to so many Americans and indeed the very soul of our country.

6661,topic-id,722,"Madam President, I rise in strong support of William ``Brock'' Long as the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and I might add that supposedly, in 12 minutes, we were going to vote on his confirmation, and unfortunately because of this unbelievable weather throughout the country, we have Members who can't make it back in so this will roll until 11 a.m. tomorrow.  Brock is a fellow North Carolinian, alumnus of Appalachian State University, and currently lives with his family in Hickory, I believe he is an exceptional nominee to lead FEMA, and he is well prepared to lead the Agency as it responds to disasters, regardless of where they are in this country.  When we met in my office a few weeks ago, we discussed the ongoing efforts in North Carolina to recover from Hurricane Many might remember that. That was last year. It affected millions of people from Florida to The storm caused historic flooding in cities and towns across the eastern half of my FEMA was in North Carolina before the storm, and Agency personnel have been in the State ever since that storm happened. As many in this Chamber know, once the camera crews leave, there is a perception by the American people the disaster is over. The truth is, Brock and I both know that isn't the case. Even 8 months after Matthew, there are still over 50 families being housed in local hotels utilizing FEMA assistance. It will take years for my State to fully recover.  Even as the recovery from Matthew continues, another hurricane season has already begun. If not a hurricane on the east coast, there will be fires, tornadoes, and other natural and manmade disasters that FEMA will be called to respond to. A key facet in responding to these disasters is the cooperation among local and State emergency management officials, as well as the Federal stakeholders led by  Brock understands why this cooperation is imperative. He is bringing his own deep knowledge and experience of emergency management to He began his career with the Georgia Emergency Management Agency before moving on to FEMA region IV in While at FEMA, Brock was a regional hurricane program manager and hurricane and evacuation liaison team leader.  After leaving FEMA, Brock was selected by my good friend Bob Riley of Alabama to serve as the director of Alabama's Emergency Management Brock served in that position from 2007 to 2011, where he led the State's efforts to respond to 14 disasters, including eight presidentially declared events. Specifically, Brock was charged with leading the State's response to the Deepwater Horizon oilspill in 2009.  He is a man of immense qualifications and experience. More recently, Brock has worked in the private sector, where he provided emergency management advice and expertise to his firm's clients. Brock has also served as the private sector chairman for the National Emergency Management I believe we must take advantage of assets in and out of government when preparing for disasters. Leveraging the private sector can supplement State emergency management agencies with knowledge and expertise that is difficult to build independently when State budgets are tight. Brock agrees with this approach and will build on these important partnerships at  The combination of his work for FEMA, State emergency management, and the private sector makes Brock Long well suited for this nomination by the Because of his experience, Brock understands it is the work done before a storm that saves lives. Helping States and cities establish emergency management plans allows funding and assistance to flow almost immediately after the storm has passed. If public officials are developing plans after the storm, it is already too late.  In closing, let me say to my colleagues again, reiterate my strong support for Brock Long, and urge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation--especially now that we have entered the 2017 hurricane season. It is my hope the Senate will confirm him tomorrow at 11 a.m. with broad bipartisan support, allowing him to quickly begin the work of strengthening FEMA and helping the Agency to respond to the disasters yet to happen.

6979,topic-id,2138,"Mr.Chair, I am pleased to be here today in strong support of H.1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection  As we enter wildfire season, it is of the upmost importance that the federal government act to prevent these devastating disasters.  The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act strengthens electric grid reliability while reducing the risk of fires and fire hazards caused by poor vegetation management in power line rights-of-way on federally managed public lands.  Currently, bureaucratic permitting delays impede electric utility companies from effectively managing overgrowth near electric infrastructure, which puts these areas at greater risk for a fire event. This common-sense, widely-supported, legislation would require an expedited federal review process for trees that are dangerously close to power lines.  The effective management of this unruly vegetation is especially important in my home state of California, where in 2016, an overwhelming 6,986 fires destroyed over 565,000 acres of land throughout the state.  I thank my Colleague from California, Mr.LaMalfa, for his leadership on this legislation and I look forward to supporting the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act later today.  The All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.

6697,topic-id,1791,"Mr.President, I come to the floor tonight to join my colleagues to raise concern about a proposed Senate healthcare bill that might move through the U.Senate, as my colleagues are pointing out, without a hearing, without attention to details, actually almost in secret. I guess it would be secret--if we didn't know exactly what was in the House bill, it would be even more secret. People have said it is probably going to be 80 percent of what is in the House bill.  I can tell you, I agree with President That was a mean bill. So if it is just 80 percent mean, I guarantee it is still going to be mean.  I say that because I have been at home listening to my constituents, and they do not appreciate it one bit. If you are Harborview Medical Center and you are a public hospital and you are going to cut $627 million out of their budget because of your cap on Medicaid and you are going to leave a regional hospital without resources, they are mad.  If you are talking about children's hospitals and they see children who are on Medicaid and they are not going to be able to see those children or get coverage, they are mad.  Just Saturday I was with veterans in Vancouver, People don't understand, but veterans of the United States of America do not get all of their healthcare coverage through the They get it with Medicaid at individual clinics for services. I have met several of these people in my State, and they have told me point-blank, without access to Medicaid, they would not get the benefits they need as veterans of our country.  I think it is mean to break our promise to veterans and not give them access to I think this whole discussion is basically the fact that we are trying to box with these guys on a proposal. If their proposal is so great, they should come to the Senate floor and just--don't even talk about the bill, talk about the principles.  I want to know, in the Republican proposal, what ideas do you have to lower costs, increase the quality of care, or improve access. Those are the milestones by which you should be debating healthcare.  Now, if your goal is to just cut Medicaid and cut people off Medicaid and cut their benefits so you can give tax breaks to the rich, OK, you might convince me that, yes, you have a proposal--because I think that is exactly what their proposal is--but if your proposal is about reducing costs, then come out here and debate it. Don't even tell me what is in the bill; just show up on the Senate floor and debate us and say: Here is our idea for reducing costs.  I will tell you what my idea of reducing costs is because I wrote it into the Affordable Care Act and some States are doing it and it was a good idea. It was called give the individual who doesn't work for a big employer the ability to negotiate with clout and be bundled up with other people. That is what they did for the working poor in New So 650,000 people in New York are now on something called the Basic Health Why? Because they didn't work for an employer that could negotiate a big discount for them.  We asked, on our side of the aisle: Why would we let poor people just get thrown around in the market and not be able to drive a decent price? I call it the Costco model. So we said to them: We are going to let you be bundled up like the big employer is and you are going to be able to drive a decent price in the marketplace. That plan is giving a family, with $40,000 a year of income and four individuals in the family, a yearly annual premium of about $500 instead of $1,500 on the exchange.  So that is an idea. So come out here and discuss that or, if you want to tell me you have figured out a way to give better quality of care, I would love to hear that idea. I would love for you to come out and tell me how you are going to deliver better quality of care because I can tell you there are things in this bill that are about quality of care. They are about improving the way that organizations deliver care so they are rewarded for achieving better outcomes for patients.  The whole idea of accountable care organizations are that you put the patient at the center of the delivery system, and you reward them for doing a good job of delivering better outcomes. We have innovated. We have innovated in the Affordable Care If you are talking about access, come out and tell us what proposal you have that is about increasing the access to healthcare. I would love to hear it because in the Affordable Care Act, we already did that too. We said: You know what. It is kind of crazy and expensive to think that everybody who ages, particularly in Medicaid, should spend time in a nursing home. Why? It is more expensive, and I don't think I have met one Washingtonian who told me they really wanted to go to a nursing home. They want to stay at home.  So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act incentives for States to change the delivery system, as we have done in the State of Washington, and deliver affordable care to people at home in their communities. By gosh, actually some States--Texas, Arizona, Indiana, other States--took us up on it. They said: What a great idea. We want to reduce costs.  So if that is such a great working aspect of the Affordable Care Act and you think it works and it increases access to care by giving people community-based care and reduces Medicaid costs, come out here and talk about it. Talk about what you want to do to put that program on steroids so more people in America can benefit from better access to care and not think they are going to spend their last days in a nursing home. That is what we should be debating. But we can't even see or hear or have a hearing about what this proposal is. Yet my colleagues can't even come out here and throw a concept on the table.  But the fact that you want to affect over 1 million veterans who have fought for our country and you are going to cut many of them off of the Medicaid care they deserve to have access to--that is a broken promise. It is just as broken a promise as what President Trump said. President Trump tweeted: I was the first and only GOP candidate to state that there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and So I am not surprised that he calls it a mean bill. But he should also own up that it cuts  We all have an office budget. I see my colleague from Virginia here. If we took our office budget and said: We are going to cut it and cap it, and next year it is going to be lower, and next year it is going to be lower, and next year--in perpetuity--that is what their idea is, it is to put a cap on Medicaid and cut it in perpetuity and basically cut it out of existence.  I don't know why they are beating up on Medicaid, because Medicaid has provided great stability to so many people in our country. It has lifted people out of poverty, provided healthcare, stabilized communities, and raised the economic standard of living in many communities in our country.  I received a letter from a superintendent from the Vancouver School He wrote to me about the devastating impacts that capping Medicaid would have on his students. He wrote:       Our school-based Medicaid programs serve as a lifeline to      children who can't access critical healthcare and services      outside of their school.  He goes on to say:       Restructuring Medicaid to a per capita cap system would      undermine Vancouver Public Schools' ability to provide      America's neediest children access to vital healthcare      [insurance].  So why would we do this?  I met a veteran, Kristina, who is 46 years old and a full-time student. She suffers from chronic and disabling injuries and needs a high level of care. The care she gets from Medicaid helps her access the medication that manages her chronic care and keeps her going,[[Page S3590]]and she is working toward that degree. Why would we cut somebody like that--a veteran--off of Medicaid just because someone's idea over here is to cap and reduce Medicaid?  These stories are from all over the country, and people are wondering: Why would you take this level of investment in Medicaid out of our entire economic system? Why would you impact our school districts, our regional hospitals, our veterans, our Medicaid population? Why would you affect a community that has a large Medicaid base?  And that is the way they serve them. Our hospitals have told us: We have stabilized private insurance premiums because more of the population is covered and has access to  You rip that back, and we will be back to skyrocketing costs, with people in the emergency room, no access to care other than that facility, with impacts on everybody on private insurance and on It is just not a good idea.  So I ask my colleagues, come out here. Don't say you want a patient-centered healthcare delivery system, because we are all for that, and we actually put things in the Affordable Care Act that did that and are working. If you want to make that claim, come out here and say what it is that you don't like about the patient-centered delivery system that we are working on promoting, and how you want to change it. If you say your proposal increases access to Americans, let's hear it, if it is about better quality. But I don't hear any of that. I just hear a drumbeat by some people who want to be heartless and cut people who have access to healthcare, people who are less fortunate in our society, because they want to cut  The President promised he wasn't going to do that. I ask my colleagues to live up to that, and let's start talking about the substance that truly will increase access, lower costs, and give better care to our constituents and the people of the United States of  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Coming from local government, as the former county supervisor for Santa Barbara, I have experienced firsthand the obstacles and challenges of balancing red tape and coordination among stakeholders.  Now, as the Representative for the Central Coast in California, I can tell you, we are no strangers to wildfires. Just last year, my district witnessed the devastating impacts of the Rey and Sherpa fires.  Unfortunately, the impacts of these wildfires are widespread. The Sherpa fire burned 7,474 acres in Santa Barbara County and the Los Padres National Forest for nearly a month last Then in January of this year, the heavy rains in the area triggered mudslides and flooding.  If we can take action to prevent wildfires, we should. We know it pays to be prepared. Congress needs to act to improve better coordination and clarity between Federal and land managers and utility companies that hold rights-of-way on public lands. In improving coordination, we can help utilities prevent fires due to overgrown vegetation or trees contacting power lines.  In turn, it would help the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management respond more quickly and consistently for requests to access and maintain rights-of-way on public lands. At the same time, the agencies can function as good stewards of our natural resources while enhancing their effectiveness in addressing fire hazard vegetation.  While well-intentioned, H.1873 does not solve the problem of poor coordination.  Mr.Chairman, the underlying bill does not address the threats of wildfires because the rights-of-way maintenance plans described in the legislation are voluntary. Currently, owners of transmission lines can work with the Federal land managers to develop these plans. This is no different than the status quo.  That is why I introduced my amendment to ensure that we make up-front planning a requirement for utilities.                              {time}  1545  I urge passage of my amendment to make sure that we are prepared and minimize the threats of wildfires.

6690,topic-id,1489,"Mr.President, I thank my friend for yielding. I take the train back and forth from time to time to my home I am going to try to get on a train later tonight to go home. Thank you for letting me have a few minutes.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, I was elected to the Senate in 2000. I came here in 2001. Two days after I was elected, I called Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate, and I said: I understand I need to explain my choice and preferences for committees to you.  He said: You should give me a letter today that tells me which committees you would like to be on.  I am not sure how they work it on the Republican side, but that is the way we did it here and, I presume, still do.  I said: My first three choices to be on committees would be--my first choice would be the Finance Committee, my second choice would be the Finance Committee, and my third choice would be the Finance  He said: You want to be on the Finance Committee, don't you?  I said: Yes, I do.  He said: So does everybody else. You have to get in line.  So I did. It took me 8 years. I got on some great committees in the interim, including the Banking Committee, Commerce, Environment and Public Works, Homeland Security, Governmental Affairs, and others as well, even Aging for a while. Eventually I got on the Finance Committee--in 2009. That was the year we had a new President, Barack Obama, and a new Vice President, Joe The hope from our new leaders was that we would do something Presidents since Harry Truman have wanted to do, and that was to provide healthcare coverage for just about everybody in our country. We weren't sure exactly how to go about it.  We did our homework and found that in 1993, when First Lady Hillary Clinton came up and worked on something called HillaryCare, the Republicans felt like they had to come up with an alternative, which was provided by the people at Heritage, a Republican think tank. What they came up with had five components to it and was introduced as stand-alone legislation by John Chafee and cosponsored by Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, and I think about 20 other Republican  In the end, HillaryCare didn't go anywhere. The Chafee bill didn't go anywhere, but it lived on beyond 1993 and that When Mitt Romney was Governor of Massachusetts and was going to run for President, he took that 1993 legislation, which called for creating exchanges in every State and marketplaces and large purchasing pools where people who didn't have healthcare coverage could buy healthcare coverage in their The 1993 legislation had sliding-scale tax credits so people buying coverage on the exchanges could get a tax credit to help buy down the cost of their coverage. The idea was that folks whose incomes were low would get a bigger tax credit, and those whose incomes got larger and larger would eventually not qualify for anything at all. But there was a sliding-scale tax credit.  Another provision in the 1993 legislation Mitt Romney borrowed was the idea of having individual mandates so that people had to get coverage in Massachusetts, and if they didn't, they had to pay a fine. The idea was that we need for folks to get coverage. We need to make sure these exchanges--if they were going to have them in the State, that they wouldn't have people just sign up for coverage in the exchanges when they get sick and run up the tab a lot for the insurance companies. The insurance companies said they couldn't make money doing that. So in Massachusetts, they had the individual mandate.  They also had an employer mandate that employers with a certain number of employees had to provide coverage for their people. They didn't have to pay for it all, but they had to offer them coverage.  The last thing Governor Romney took from the 1993 legislation by Senator Chafee and others was the idea that insurance companies could not deny coverage to folks with preexisting conditions.  Mitt Romney thought those were pretty good ideas and made them sort of the centerpiece of what they called RomneyCare in Massachusetts, which became the law and ultimately extended coverage to a lot of people who didn't have it.  Initially, they didn't do a very good job on affordability. I am told by folks in Massachusetts that one of the reasons was that the fine associated with the individual mandate wasn't very big. Eventually it was scaled up, but it took a while to get to a point where young people said: I am paying this fine; I may as well get coverage and stop paying the fine and get something for my money.  RomneyCare ended up being pretty successful. He ran for President, and one of the linchpins he used is, look, we have already done what Barack Obama wants to do. We are already providing healthcare coverage for people in my state.  In any event, in 2009 I ended up on the Finance We spent a huge amount of time in 2009 trying to figure out what this healthcare plan should look like that our new President and new Vice President wanted us to do. It looked a lot like what was offered in 1993, and it looked a lot like what was actually adopted and I think worked with relative success in  We held a lot of hearings. I remember being on the Finance It seemed like for week after week after week, we had hearings, we had roundtables, we had discussions, we had meetings off the floor and on the floor to talk about whether it made sense. We went for an extended period of time where we had three Democrats and three Republicans on the committee who met endlessly to try to figure out what the reasonable compromises were that would enable us to extend coverage to everybody in an affordable kind of way.  We ended up having an extensive markup, voting, and debating the legislation in both the Finance Committee and the HELP People had the opportunity to offer amendments, a number of which were offered and adopted by Democrats and Republicans alike. I don't remember exactly, but I seem to recall that in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, something like 300 amendments may have been offered, 160 by Republicans that were adopted.  Long story short, we finally had a chance to finish the debate, and it became law.  I know our Republican friends don't feel like they had much of a chance to be involved, but my recollection is that there was a lot of involvement by both sides. I thought at times that the debate on this legislation would never end. It finally did, and we finally passed it on a close margin.  The reason I bring this up is that was my first year on the Finance I loved it. I was on there with Senator Stabenow and a number of others, and we were actually legislating. It was fun. It was challenging. We were trying to develop consensus. I want us to do that again.  As good as we think the Affordable Care Act is, I know it is not perfect. I think everybody in this Chamber knows it is not perfect. But the idea of preserving what needs to be preserved and fixing what needs to be fixed is what we ought to be about.  As smart as our Republican friends are, they can't do this by themselves, and as smart as we like to think we are, neither can we. In this case, we would be a lot better off doing this together. I know Senator Schumer has asked the Republican leader for us to meet later this week--maybe Thursday--in the Old Senate Chamber and just talk it over.[[Page S3581]]  John Kennedy used to say that we shouldn't be afraid to negotiate. He had a great quote about being afraid. He basically said we should never be afraid to negotiate or talk. I think that probably pertains to us today.  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for yielding his time to me to give me a chance to say something again to my Republican colleagues.  I was in Tanzania, Africa, a couple of years ago for an Aspen Institute seminar with Democrats and Republicans, House and I learned a lot about One of the things I learned was a great African proverb. A lot of people have heard it; I had never heard it before. It goes something like this: If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

To the extent that we wear different uniforms, we really are on the same team, and I think the American people are anxious for us to start acting that way.

I hope we will, as some of our colleagues have suggested, explore some ideas where we can work together.  Some have talked about how to make the marketplaces work. It is not a Democratic idea. It is a Republican idea. There are the tax credits for the exchange, which is a Republican idea.

Unfortunately, what Republicans have offered and what they pulled off the floor doesn't do that. It provides less coverage for more money.

6802,topic-id,1529,"Mr.President, I understand that we had originally scheduled for, in about 1 minute, a vote on cloture on the new Iran sanctions bill. I understand that the cloture vote has been delayed until early this afternoon.  This comes on the heels of an announcement of very sad news from I would certainly be among the first to note that some of the people in Iran, the Revolutionary Guard and some of their leadership, support terrorism. They wish ill for us and for our country.  That same country had elections about 2 weeks ago, and the results of those elections were surprising, even for me, but encouraging. The results of the election found that President Rouhani, one of the leaders of reform and one of the modern elements within that country, was reelected by a resounding majority--close to 60 percent of the vote. Although the Supreme Leader thought it would be a one-on-one race for the Presidency, in spite of that, Rouhani was reelected, and we congratulate him. There were a number of municipal elections across the country, most prominently in Tehran where the hard-line mayor of Tehran has been ousted, and moderate forces seem to have made real, encouraging progress from my perspective and I think the perspective of most  One of the things the Iranians do, which is troubling to me and I think to others in this country, is continue to test ballistic missiles in what we believe is in violation of the United Nations' decision. Iranians are not violating the agreement that was entered into among five nations, including the United States and Iran, roughly 2 years ago in Iran's nuclear joint agreement. They are not violating that, but they are violating other U.sanctions.  So this revised sanctions bill, which was scheduled to be debated today and maybe voted on later this week--at least the start of the debate on whether they are going to proceed to the bill--has been delayed until this afternoon. I urge us to consider delaying further action on this Iran sanctions measure today or this week.  The term ``adding insult to injury'' comes to mind. I try to use the Golden Rule to figure out what I should do and how I should behave as a human being, and I think maybe we ought to consider the Golden Rule in this case as well. Iran is not necessarily our close friend. They are not our close ally. I think the potential is there for having a much better relationship as a young generation of Iranians grows up and eventually assumes the leadership of their country.  It is a country of 80 million people, over half of them under the age of 25. They had a revolution in 1979 and captured our They held our people for a year or more until after the 1980 Presidential election. Our relations with Iran have been difficult since that time but more encouraging of late--again, a young country of 80 million people, more than half under the age of 25.  The younger generation there wants to have a good relationship with the rest of the world, a better relationship with the rest of the world, and certainly a better relationship with us. I have talked with a number of American leaders, including senior American leaders, who have been to Iran in recent years and were surprised by the warm welcome they received.  It reminds me very much of the warm welcome I received leading a congressional delegation to Vietnam in August of 1991 to find out what happened to thousands of We were expecting to be met by suspicion and hostility, and we were warmly embraced at that time. Six of us--Democratic and Republican Congressmen--were there to present to the leadership of Vietnam on behalf of the George Herbert Walker Bush administration a roadmap to normalize relations if they would do a number of things to enable us to find out what happened to thousands of our We presented that proposal. John Kerry and John McCain worked very hard on the Senate side and at the same time in Southeast Asia as well. We ended up with normalized relations within a few years of our visit. One of the members of my delegation, Pete Peterson, became our first U.Ambassador to  I mention that today because of the hostility we felt toward Vietnam for[[Page S3304]]many years during the war and after the war and the suspicion that they were holding thousands of our MIAs as POWs, which turned out not to be true. But our efforts, along with those of Senator McCain, Senator Kerry, and others, ended up providing information about the missing and the closure we hoped for hundreds of families of Americans who had lost their loved ones in Vietnam and never recovered their remains--although some of their remains were recovered and returned to the families.  I mention it today because a year ago in Vietnam, with President Obama and Secretary Kerry, and at a time when the Vietnamese were announcing they were going to buy billions of dollars' worth of our Boeing aircraft--we are their top trading partner, and they were going to be an integral part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we negotiated, along with other nations. Sadly, that has gone away. I think one of the biggest mistakes of this Congress and the last was to let the transpacific trade partnership die. But Vietnam was a key member of that.  It is kind of ironic to me that a nation with whom we fought in a war, where the names of 55,000 who died are at the Vietnam Memorial--not even 2 miles from where I am standing right now--yet, since the 1970s we have let bygones be bygones and have a much better relationship with They are still Communist, and they are still a one-party system, but they have high regard toward  Rather remarkably, we learned last April when we were there that they had two surveys done of the Vietnamese people this last year. One survey found that 85 percent of the people surveyed had favorable opinions of the United States, more than any other nation in the world. In the second survey, we learned that about 95 percent of the Vietnamese people had favorable opinions of the United States, more than any other nation on  Again, we are their top trading partner these days, and they are buying a lot of the products we manufacture and sell. If that relationship can change, I think there is reason to hope our relationship with Iran can change.  We have our pages here. If it were left to the generation the age of our pages or maybe their parents, it would be a brandnew day in But change is happening there.  The question is, on the heels of this attack by ISIS, with whom we have bitter differences and a hotly contested armed conflict--for us to somehow, on the heels of two attacks by ISIS in Iran, one on the Parliament and the other apparently on the mausoleum for the former Ayatollah, where a dozen or more people have been killed, 40-something wounded--does it make sense for us to take up the Iran sanctions bill today? I don't think so.  My reading of the Golden Rule, treating other people the way we want to be treated, would suggest this might not be the right day to do this--next week, maybe; today, no. I call on our leadership to hit the pause button. There is not a need to rush on this.  The Iran sanctions bill, which is coming to us today, is a much more thoughtful approach than was originally contemplated by the Foreign Relations They have done a very nice job of improving what I thought was a badly flawed earlier effort. But this might be a good day to hit the pause button. Instead of rubbing salt into a wound, let's wait a few days and consider what to do. If we were in their shoes, I think we would appreciate that gesture. If we were in their shoes, I think the idea of their taking this kind of action or step against us on a day that we have been attacked by ISIS would not be well received. It would be badly received. So I think we ought to treat them the same way.  I think that is pretty much it. I appreciate the chance to come to the floor and say a few words. I call on leadership to delay this vote on cloture and to delay the vote on the underlying bill until next week. When we do the underlying bill on Iran sanctions, let's couple it with something that includes some of the very thoughtful work going on with respect to Russia, which really is creating mischief in this country--not just with elections but otherwise as well--and maybe do a package that includes both together. That might make a lot more sense, and the timing would be a lot better.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

6873,topic-id,1667,"Mr.President, good to see you and our friend from I feel compelled to go back in time, if I could. This is a question a lot of people ask me back home and around the country: Where did ObamaCare come from? The part where most people think of ObamaCare is when they think of the exchanges that have been established in all 50 States, where people who don't have healthcare can get coverage as part of a large-group plan. That was an idea that came from  In 2006 in Massachusetts, when Mitt Romney was the Governor and was running for President, they came up with a really smart idea: Governor Romney, you have a much better chance of being elected President if you have done what no other Governor has done; that is, to cover everybody in your State for healthcare.  Well, that is an interesting idea. They looked around for ideas, and what did they come up with? They came up with an idea that was actually suggested by the Heritage The Heritage Foundation found its way to this body in 1993 in legislation introduced by Republican Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island that called for doing five things:  1 was creating exchanges or marketplaces in every State, where people who didn't have coverage could be part of a large group and get coverage.  2, folks who bought coverage on the exchange might be eligible for a sliding-scale tax credit. Lower-income people would get a better tax credit, reducing their premiums, than people whose income was higher.  3 was the idea of an individual mandate. People had to get coverage. If they didn't, they would have to pay a fine. You can't force people to get coverage, but in Massachusetts they said: Well, at least we will fine them, and, eventually, maybe over time, the fine will go up and most people--including young, healthy people--will elect to get coverage and be part of a group that is actually insurable, as opposed to people who are just sick or who are anxious to get an operation or are needing to get an operation.  The fourth principle, which was the idea underlying the Chafee legislation, which would later become RomneyCare, was the idea that employers of a certain magnitude, or with a certain number of employees, had to cover their employees.  The fifth principle in that original idea was brought to us from the Heritage Foundation, by 23 Republican Senators in 1993--as an alternative, by the way, to HillaryCare--and later became The fifth principle was the idea that if you are an insurance company and you want to deny coverage to people because they have a preexisting condition, you cannot do that.  That was it. When a number of us in this body worked on the Affordable Care Act, we took the Heritage Foundation idea, the idea from those 23 Republican Senators who introduced it, cosponsored it--including Senator Hatch, including Senator Some of the folks who are complaining the most about ObamaCare or the exchanges are the people who supported the original legislation introducing the idea. I don't know if that seems ironic to other people. It certainly does to me.  I spent part of Saturday--invited up to Providence, RI, to do something I used to do for 8 years--meeting with the National Governors For 8 years, as Governor of Delaware, I was privileged to be a part of the National Governors Association, at one time vice chair and later on as the chairman of the group. They invited me to come back and talk about healthcare, healthcare reform, and what was going on here in the I was happy to do that, and we made it work on my schedule.  There, to speak on behalf of the administration, was the Vice President of the country, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the OMB Director, and the Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, explaining to the Governors why they should support the administration's position and why they should support the Republican position here in the  Today the Republicans sent out a strong letter--not just Republican Governors and Democratic Governors sent out a joint letter, a bipartisan letter, saying to us, basically: Do these things.  Their advice to us was this: Hit the pause button; stop what we are doing. 2, pivot and stabilize. Stop destabilizing the exchanges.  This administration is trying to destabilize the exchanges, which were a Republican idea, and I think, actually, a good idea. But the administration has sought to destabilize the exchanges, through a variety of tricks that they are pulling.  The third thing we should do is to stabilize the exchanges. It is not all that hard. Make it clear that the individual mandate, or something very much like the individual mandate, is going to continue to be the law of the land so that we end up with young, healthy people in the exchanges and not just a lot of sick people and older people.  2 is reinsurance. One of the keys to the success of Medicaid Part D, the drug insurance program for folks on Medicare, is reinsurance. A number of us, led by Senator Tim Kaine and myself and others, said: Why don't we take that tried-and-true idea and use it to help stabilize the exchanges? I spoke here earlier today on how that would actually work. It is not a Democratic or a Republican idea. It is just a good idea.  The third thing we need to do to stabilize the exchanges--an idea actually suggested by a number of Senators, including Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire--is to say that we are going to continue to fund and authorize something called CSRs, or cost-sharing reductions, which actually reduce the copays and the deductibles for lower income people who buy their coverage in the exchanges.[[Page S4040]]  Those three things, we are told by health insurance companies, would reduce the cost of premiums in all the States by anywhere from 25 percent to 35 percent. It would stabilize the exchanges, and it would get other insurance companies to say: I don't know if I want to insure in Ohio, Delaware, or Insurance companies would say: Well, I think I can offer insurance products there and not lose my shirt. Then, they would get back into the exchange. They would offer coverage. Then, when more than one or two offer coverage, guess what happens. You have competition. And do you know what flows from competition? Better diversity of products to choose from and lower costs.  Those are three things we can do to stabilize the exchanges and, frankly, they are not all that hard.  The fourth thing the Governors suggested we do is, basically, regular order. Around here, regular order means that if people have a good idea, they introduce it. We turn it in up here at the front desk, and the legislative idea goes to the committee of jurisdiction. There is a discussion of whether there should be hearings about that particular bill. If it is a good bill, there may well be hearings. You have sponsors. It could be bipartisan. But, eventually, the idea will have a hearing in committee, and those who like that idea or those who don't like that idea show up in daylight, in the light of day, and say: Here is why I like it; here is why I don't like it. They let their voices be heard.  On issues as important as healthcare, why we are not fully involving the Governors is beyond me. I just don't get it. Who runs the Medicaid Programs? The Governors in their That is a big part of what we are debating in this battle.  I will close with this. I said it before earlier today, and I want to say it again. As I travel around Delaware, talking to people in my little State--we have a lot of Democrats, we have a lot of Republicans, and we have a lot of Independents--they speak to me with one voice, and here is what they say: Work together. Solve some problems together. Democrats and Republicans, take off your hats and work together. That is what they want us to do.  It is not just A Kaiser Permanente national survey released last week said 71 percent of the people in this country surveyed said we ought to work together and get this done.  If we are smart, before we leave for the August recess, we will stabilize the exchanges with the three things I talked about. The administration just needs to stand down and just be quiet on this point. If they don't like this Republican idea of the exchanges, just be quiet. But we come back here in September, and we go to work, with regular order, hearings--bipartisan hearings--bipartisan roundtables, and the chance for us to debate legislation in committees in the House and in the Senate, and on this floor, and to debate amendments. That is the way we ought to do this.  Anytime in this country when we have done really big things--Social Security comes to mind, the GI bill comes to mind, and the 1986 tax reform comes to mind--we didn't do it with just Democratic votes or Republican votes. We did it together. If we do that, we will be stronger together.  I will close with an old African proverb. It goes something like this: If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.  We need to go far. If we do, we and the American people will get a lot further along toward the three things we have sought ever since Harry Truman was President: 1, cover everybody; 2, quality healthcare; and 3, affordable price. That is the ``holy grail,'' and we should strive to get there together.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Rowan Simpson, their son, is on the autism spectrum. I have talked a lot about Rowan's disability in the context of the healthcare debate.  We have now the beginnings of a debate about what will be in the Senate bill, if one emerges. If we are going to be up front about what happens to families and individuals like Rowan, I think it would be important to know what happens to a family who has a loved one with a disability in the context of both the Senate bill and the House bill merging.  Madam President, on behalf of Rowan and families who have loved ones with disabilities, I ask unanimous consent that no motion to proceed to calendar 120, H.1628, the American Health Care Act, be in order until the bill is jointly referred to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  The PRESIDING Is there objection?

I want to alert the Chair, I am going to pose this question initially before I make my remarks about the debate we are having on healthcare.  Is the Chair able to confirm that the Committee on Finance considered 1796, the America's Healthy Future Act, which was ultimately incorporated into H.3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in executive session on eight separate calendar days prior to reporting the bill favorably?

6701,topic-id,1929,"Thank you.  Mr.President, I rise tonight to provide some context about what is at stake for children in the United States with regard to the debate we are having on healthcare and, in particular, what would happen--some of the adverse impacts on children with disabilities.  I will start with the broad view, but I think it is important to frame our discussions. Sometimes our debate on healthcare comes down to a discussion of big numbers. How many people will be impacted? For example, the Congressional Budget Office told us that 23 million people would lose their healthcare coverage over the course of a decade if the House bill were to become law. So healthcare coverage would be ripped away from 23 million people or we hear about the impact on the deficit one way or the other or we hear about broad numbers. Probably the best way to think about the impact of these policies is, if the House bill were to become law or some version of it because of what a few Senate Republicans are working on right now--maybe the better way to think about it is in terms of a couple of individuals, children.  I will give you two examples for now. Angelica and Rowan--two different children, two different stories. We received a letter in the last couple--I am sorry. Angelica is the parent. I should have said Amaya is the child whom her mom wrote to us about. Her mom is  She wrote to us and said:       I am writing to you because I am appalled by all that is      happening to this country. I have an amazing story about my      daughter She was basically born with no bones and she      received a miracle drug that regrew her bones. She will have      to take this medicine for the rest of her life but the fact      that she is doing so amazing has to do with all the help that      she received from She is the youngest patient in      the U.to take the drug. I don't only want to talk about      her but I am concerned about the future of our party. Looking      forward to hearing from you.  So said Then, later on, she talks about what happened in her case to her child. She says she decided with a counselor to check with the Allegheny County officials about whether or not Medicaid expansion would cover Amaya's treatment. She said they made an inquiry. She said by the next day, ``Someone from the State had called me, and later that week her treatment was approved. Thanks to the Medicaid expansion, my daughter receives her lifesaving treatment.''  So I make that reference to one letter about one child, Then, of course, there are so many other letters. I will just highlight one I received months ago now from Pam She is from Coatesville, PA--Southeastern Pennsylvania just outside the city of Now you are talking about Rowan in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Amaya in Southwestern Pennsylvania, two corners of the State--two children facing challenges that most of us can't even imagine.  In this case, Pam Simpson wrote to me about her son Rowan and talked about his life before a diagnosis of autism and before he was getting the help he is getting now. Pam talked about all of the challenges she and families like her face. She talked about the fact that he was having all kinds of difficulties, but then they finally got the word that Rowan would be covered by Medical That is the Pennsylvania version of Medicaid at the State level. She said she applied in January of 2016. After Pam got the word that Rowan would be enrolled, she said:       We were able to obtain wraparound services, which included      a behavioral specialist consultant--so-called BSC--and a      therapeutic staff support worker. The wraparound services      have been a godsend--  Referring to the services provided to her son Then she goes on later in the letter and says:       Without Medicaid, I am confident I could not work full time      to support our family. We would be bankrupt or my son would      go without the therapies he sincerely needs.  Here is how Pam concludes her letter:       Please think of my dear Rowan and his happy face, his big      blue eyes, and his lovely strawberry blonde hair. Please      think of me and my husband, working every day to support our      family, and please think of my 9-month-old daughter  I will stop there just to explain. She is talking about Rowan, who is a couple of years older. The reference here is to his younger sister       Please think of my 9-month-old daughter Luna who smiles and      laughs at her brother daily. She will have to care for Rowan      later in her life when we are gone. Overall, we are      desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and would      be devastated if we lost these benefits.  That is what Pam Simpson wrote to me months ago. After referring to her story and Rowan's story over the last couple of months, I finally had the chance to meet her and to meet Rowan and his dad and his sister So I met this family--four people in a family. I met them on It is one thing to read about it and to get a sense of what a family is up against every day, and it is another thing to meet them. Right now, the Simpson family has what they need for That doesn't mean they don't have challenges. It doesn't mean it will not be difficult in the years ahead, but they have the benefit of Medicaid right now--Medical Assistance, as we call it in  Rowan now, because he has autism, has the benefit of those behavioral specialists and Medical There was a person with them the day I met them, to work with Rowan every day so the parents can work and have the peace of mind to know they can go to work, and they can raise their family with the benefit of the kind of healthcare every child should have. Some might say: You know what. If the Republicans get their way on this bill, maybe the Medicaid provisions will not apply to Maybe he will be protected or maybe in Allegheny County, maybe Amaya will be protected. Maybe it will not reach that far. Maybe when the Congressional Budget Office--I will read directly from page 17 of the report by the Congressional Budget Office analyzing the House bill when it says: Medicaid enrollment would be lower throughout the coming decade, culminating in 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026, a reduction of 17 percent relative to the number under current law. That is what the Congressional Budget Office says about the impact of the House bill on Medicaid--14 million people lose their  Some might say: Let's assume for purposes of this argument that those two children we just spoke about might be protected from those cuts. We don't know that, of course, and they can't guarantee that because what they are doing when they go at these Medicaid provisions is taking away the guarantee that has been there for 50 years and, over time, eliminating the Medicaid expansion. That is what we expect to happen. That is certainly what the House bill did.  Let's assume for the sake of argument that they could come in here and make an ironclad guarantee that those two children, Rowan and Amaya, won't be affected. You know what. That is not good enough. That is not good enough because there are a lot of other children who will be affected, children who might have a disability.  Sixty percent of children with disabilities are enrolled in We know that. We know that millions of other children who come from low-income families get the benefit of We know that a lot of seniors depend upon Medicaid to get into a nursing home. But no family who has a child with disabilities who benefits from Medicaid should have to worry for 15 minutes about what would happen in this Chamber--because a small group of Republican Senators are meeting in secret, and they are supposed to produce a bill that we are all supposed to consider in a short timeframe--no product of that secret process should in any way give any parent who has a[[Page S3594]]child with a disability any concern at all that that benefit will be taken away. That is not who we are as a country. We are We take care of people who need those kinds of services, that kind of benefit.  So if a child like Rowan, who is receiving the benefits of Medicaid today because of his disability--if a child like that is receiving those services today, we should guarantee that he will receive those benefits for as long as he needs those benefits. Even if it goes the length and breadth of his life, we should guarantee that, take it off the table so that family doesn't have to worry.  That, I hope, would be the result of this process undertaken by a small group of Republican I have been waiting to hear that, waiting to hear whether they will guarantee that to that child, to give that family some peace of mind with all the challenges they have, even with Medicaid, even with the great support they get. It is not easy. It is a very difficult life many families lead when they have a child with a disability. But we should do everything we can to make sure that if a child with a disability--just one category of people who benefit--any child with a disability who gets the benefit of Medicaid should have that protection for as long as they need it. And I will be waiting to hear that from our colleagues when they finally emerge from this secretive process with the bill. So I hope that is what they are working on in their meetings because we know that it affects a lot of children.  As I said before, Medicaid covers 60 percent of all children with disabilities, ranging from autism, like Rowan, to traumatic brain injuries. We know that children on Medicaid receive what many consider the gold standard for children's healthcare--early and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment options, so-called EPSTD--so they can get the screenings they need, so they can get preventive healthcare when they need it.  All of these protections should be not just a goal, they should be guaranteed for those children. I am hoping our friends who are working on this right now will consider Rowan and Amaya and children like them.  We will come back to it later. We will have other stories to tell about children and what they are up against. But on a night like tonight, I am thinking of those children and worried about some of the headlines we are seeing on some analysis.  I will wrap up with this: The Center for American Progress report dated May of 2017 is titled ``Cuts to Medicaid Would Harm Young Children With Disabilities.'' That is one report. Another report is from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, May 18, 2017: ``Medicaid Cuts in House ACA Repeal Bill Will Limit Availability of Home- and Community-Based Services.'' That is another headline. We won't get into the details of those reports now.  We have a lot to work on here to make sure that nothing that happens in this process will rip away healthcare from children with disabilities.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue).

6837,topic-id,2863,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the destructive path that the majority is headed down with their attempts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  The Republican bill, and, frankly, the House Republican bill that the Senate is now considering in addition to other ideas is, in my judgment, not really a healthcare bill but a tax cut bill. It is a tax cut bill for the super-rich--not only the rich but, literally, the wealthiest few Americans--while increasing costs for middle-class families. It gives States the option to allow insurance companies to discriminate again like they did before the ACA was passed. It would also allow those same policies to devastate our hospitals, particularly those in rural communities. I live in a State where 48 out of 67 counties are, in fact, rural counties.  The Republican bill would rip away healthcare, according to the Congressional Budget Office, from 23 million Here is what that means in Pennsylvania, based upon the Congressional Budget Office numbers: Up to 770,000 Pennsylvanians could lose health insurance by 2026 if the bill were to pass, 48,000 Pennsylvania seniors on Medicare could lose access to services covered by Medicaid, and 52,600 Pennsylvanians with disabilities could lose Medicaid coverage. I live in a State[[Page S3320]]where, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, over 722,000 Pennsylvanians with disabilities rely on Medical Assistance for their medical care. Medical Assistance is the State version of We know that if you are a child, if you are a senior, or if you have a disability, many Americans in those categories, of course, rely upon  We also know, based upon the CBO numbers, that 180,000 Pennsylvanians could lose access to mental health and substance abuse care now provided by We have heard a lot of talk, and there has been a lot of work, actually, in this body, as well as in the other body, in the last year on the opioid problem. We have Democrats and Republicans focusing on a major national problem, an urgent public health problem. We have made some progress--not enough but some good progress--on opioid legislation. All of that would be badly undermined if we made the changes to Medicaid that some want to make here because of the significant impact that cuts to Medicaid would have on the challenge of reducing the opioid crisis.  So even the possibility that this bill might become law is, in a sense, destabilizing to the healthcare marketplace, which has been better each year we move forward from the passage of the ACA in 2010.  Just last week, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department announced average proposed rate increases for health insurance premiums for 2018. Here is what the Pennsylvania Insurance Department told us. If we maintain current law, premiums will go up 8.8 percent in If the Republicans get rid of the cost-sharing subsidies, which many seem either to want to get rid of or to want to ignore, thereby creating uncertainty--if those cost-sharing subsidies are thrown out the window--premiums will go up 2.5 times as much, by over 20 percent. So far, it is 8.8 percent under current law or 20 percent just based upon the cost-sharing subsidies being taken away.  Also, if the individual mandate is repealed, premiums will go up almost three times as much, by 23 percent. If we get rid of both the cost-sharing subsidies and the individual mandate, premiums in our State will go up by over 36 percent.  So we have a basic choice to make, at least as it relates to Under current law, it is 8.8 percent, and we should try to bring that down. I think there are ways we could work together in a bipartisan fashion to bring that down. But if we go in the direction that many want to go--especially on the Republican side--to undermine or to do nothing about cost-sharing and get to rid of the individual mandate, premiums go up 36 percent. So folks can make their choice to go up about 9 percent or to go up 36 percent. It is a real simple choice with basically two options.  The bill that was passed in the House would destroy the lives of many vulnerable What should we do about it? Well, the first thing we should do with the bill is to throw it in the trash heap. That is where it belongs, and I hope that is where Senate Republicans are headed and that they are going to start over on a new bill, because the bill that was passed in the House is very bad for the country.  Among the 3 million Pennsylvanians with preexisting conditions are two remarkable young women whose mother first contacted me in 2009. Stacie Ritter, from Manheim, PA, is the mom of four children, including her twin daughters, Hannah and Madeline, who are depicted here in this picture when they were much younger. Hannah and Madeline were diagnosed with a rare and dangerous type of leukemia when they were just 4 years old. You can see their picture there at that time.  Stacy and her husband Benjamin went bankrupt trying to pay their daughters' medical bills. She wrote to me at the time, saying that without healthcare reform, ``my girls will be unable to afford care, that is if they are eligible, for care that is critically necessary to maintain this chronic condition.''  Fortunately, things have changed in the last 8 or so years. Fortunately, Hannah and Madeline are healthy young women now. They are freshman at Arcadia University and are doing well. They rely on the Affordable Care Act's protections to ensure that they have access to affordable coverage, whether they are on their parents' plan or purchasing a plan in the individual market. As you can see on my left, this is a picture of Hannah and Madeline today as college freshmen.  Without the Affordable Care Act, Hannah and Madeline could be denied health insurance. As their mom said, they could be ``punished and rejected because they had the misfortune of developing cancer as a child.''  The Republican bill passed in the House would put them at risk of being denied health insurance or being charged more because they are cancer survivors.  I don't know why anyone would support a bill that would do that.  Just a number of months ago I received a letter from Pam Simpson from Chester County, Pam and her son Rowan have their story to tell. Rowan is 5 years old, and a number of years ago he was diagnosed with autism. I have talked about Rowan before on this floor and in other places and what Medicaid means for Rowan and his family. Medicaid provides important services for Rowan and others with disabilities, enabling Rowan to go to preschool and allowing his mother to work. Here is what his mom said to me. I won't read the whole letter, but I will just highlight the first page.  The first page is Rowan's life before he was diagnosed with autism--all of the challenges that he and his family had--and Rowan's life after the diagnosis of autism, but, then, ultimately, when he received Medicaid, or Medical Assistance, as we call it in Here is what his mom told me in the letter after he received word that he was going to be enrolled in Medical Assistance:       Late January 2016, I applied for  That is Medical       After Rowan was awarded Medical Assistance, we were able to      obtain wrap-around services. These services included a      Behavioral Specialist Consultant and a Therapeutic Staff      Support worker.  She goes on later in that paragraph to say that these wrap-around services ``have been a Godsend.''  Then she goes on later and says:       I am thrilled by Rowan's daily progress. I cannot say      enough good things about this program.  Then she says:       Without Medical Assistance, I am confident that I could not      work full time to support our family. Our family would be      bankrupt or my son would go without the therapies he      sincerely needs.  Here is the last line of her letter:       We are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance      and would be devastated if we lost these benefits.  She is referencing ``Medical Assistance'' for Medicaid, the same program at the State level.  So we have two families now that are totally reliant on these programs, either the ACA more broadly or, in particular, the Medicaid Both families have referenced bankruptcy because of healthcare challenges in the life of that family--one who would be on the brink of bankruptcy, Rowan's family, and the other, who actually went through bankruptcy because of those healthcare challenges. No family in the United States of America should have to worry about going bankrupt because of a healthcare problem. We are well on our way to solving these problems, and no one should pull the rug out from under those families. But, unfortunately, when it comes to this legislation, that is exactly what could happen to many of them.  I will give a third example: Recently I met Alex, who is from Southeastern He is 9 years old, and he has Down syndrome. Here is what Alex, a 9-year-old, wrote:       Although I have a medical diagnosis of Down Syndrome, I am      an excellent student. I get 100 percent on my spelling tests      and I get picked as the Math King quite often. . . . My      parents, my teachers, and everyone around me thought from the      beginning there was nothing that I could not do. . . . I am      able to get a good education because of the supports that I      get from Special That's why I am very concerned      about the possible cuts in Medicaid funding in schools. . . .      Medicaid funding in schools is a very, very important part of      what makes it possible for us to receive successful education      in school and become contributing members of our society.  That is a 9-year-old in Pennsylvania reminding us about this important program. Alex has tremendous potential that would be in jeopardy by the proposed cuts to Medicaid.[[Page S3321]]  Here is another example: Peg Fagan of The Republican bill includes an age tax that will allow insurers to charge older Americans up to five times more than younger Peg is from Bucks County, in Southeastern She is a three-time cancer survivor who could not afford health insurance prior to the Affordable Care She is approaching Medicare eligibility but still has a few years to go before she is old enough to enroll.  Peg was able to find affordable health insurance thanks to the ACA, but under the Republican bill, she could once again be discriminated against for being an older adult, and another possible object of discrimination would be that she is a cancer survivor.  That was the old law. That is where we were before, where insurance companies were allowed under the law to discriminate in that fashion. They could discriminate against you because you were a woman. They could discriminate against you because you had a preexisting condition. They could discriminate against you because you were a cancer survivor or because of your age, or so many other circumstances. I thought we were beyond that. I thought we had finally cured that problem, but some want to go back in time.  So the CBO tells us that the Republican bill would rip away healthcare from 23 million I just went through some Pennsylvania stories. We have a lot more, and my colleagues will be hearing them. But for Hannah and Madeline and Rowan and Alex and Peg, we should ask ourselves a couple of basic questions. Healthcare for those Pennsylvanians should not be made worse, and they should not be made worse off, in order to give the top one-tenth of 1 percent a $200,000 giveaway. That is what the first version of the House healthcare bill would do. It would give the top one-tenth of 1 percent an average tax cut of $197,000. I exaggerated; I said $200,000. Let's be exact. It is $197,000 each. Why would we take away healthcare or even risk or create uncertainty about healthcare for Hannah, Madeline, Rowan, Alex, and Peg because some people around here want to give tax cuts to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars to very wealthy people? That is not what I call a healthcare bill.  The Senate has an obligation, in my judgment--both parties--to stop this bill from being enacted into law. We cannot allow this legislation to pass or anything like it to become law. So I ask each Member of the Senate to consider these Pennsylvanians and plenty in your home States and the countless more like them who are anxiously hoping and praying this Congress will not vote to take away their healthcare.                   Drug and Veterans Treatment Courts  Mr.President, I rise to express my support for the drug and other treatment courts, including veterans treatment courts, in Pennsylvania and the more than 3,000 across the  Just last month during National Drug Court Month, drug courts across the country held graduation ceremonies to recognize individuals who completed this rigorous treatment program. These courts, which serve about 150,000 people a year, hold offenders with substance use and mental health disorders accountable for their actions through strict supervision while also connecting them to the treatment they need. More than 1.25 million people have successfully graduated from drug and treatment court programs and are now on a path to recovery.  Research has demonstrated that drug and other treatment courts not only reduce crime but also reduce spending by slowing the cycle of recidivism. Drug and other treatment courts are also an important resource to law enforcement and community stakeholders working to combat the opioid epidemic. Opioid addiction is a growing public health crisis in Pennsylvania and throughout the Nation, and it demands real action. As public officials, we have an obligation to ensure that the resources and policies are in place to fight this scourge so that more families won't have to endure the heartache of losing a loved one to addiction.  Veterans treatment courts are innovative and collaborative programs to address some of the unique challenges that face our veteran communities. There are approximately 22 million veterans in the United States, and Pennsylvania is home to nearly 1 million. The majority of veterans return to our communities as leaders and lead exemplary lives; however, not every veteran's path is straightforward. That is why we need to make sure the right programs and support services are in place.  According to the Department of Justice, in 2011 and 2012, approximately 8 percent of the total incarcerated population in the United States were, in fact, veterans. These veterans found themselves serving time in correctional facilities because they had not received the treatment they needed. While this represents a very small percentage of veterans, it is important that we support programs like veterans treatment courts for veterans who face significant obstacles returning to civilian life, including mental health concerns, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse issues. These treatment courts can have a lifelong impact on a veteran by helping them get out of the criminal justice system and get the necessary treatment they have earned. It is our obligation to work every day to ensure veterans are receiving the care and support they deserve.  There are many stories from across Pennsylvania and our country that exemplify why these veterans treatment courts are critical. Just to give one, shortly after Michael Colletti from Montgomery County received an honorable discharge from the U.Coast Guard, he found himself in the grips of a serious addiction to opioids. To support his growing habit, Michael began stealing from his employer, resulting in his arrest and jail time. His crimes were caused by his opioid use disorder, and Michael found himself in the Montgomery County Veterans Treatment  Finally, getting the accountability he needed and connecting with the benefits he earned as a veteran, Michael began the process of leaving behind his life of addiction and crime to start a new path. Today, Michael Colletti is a partner in a successful small business and a mentor to others in his community struggling with their own substance use.  He says of the veterans treatment court:       I wouldn't be here without the support network from the      court. I wouldn't have my girlfriend, I wouldn't have my      beautiful place, I wouldn't have my career, and most      importantly, I wouldn't have the sound clarity of mind to be      myself again. Now I am committed to paying it forward.  I and I know many others are proud to support a recent letter led by our colleagues, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Wicker, highlighting the importance of funding the Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program and veterans treatment courts. As we go through the appropriations process, I urge my colleagues to consider the proven track record of these courts in improving outcome for graduates, and I hope Congress will offer strong support for these important programs that have been helping the justice system better serve individuals, veterans, their families, friends, and communities.

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Santa Ana River Wash Plan      Land Exchange Act''.     2.       In this Act:       (1) Conservation district.--The term ``Conservation      District'' means the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation      District, a political subdivision of the State of       (2) Non-federal land.--The term ``non-Federal Land'' means      the approximately 310 acres of land owned by the Conservation      District generally depicted as ``SBVWCD to BLM'' on the       (3) Map.--The term ``Map'' means the map titled ``Santa Ana      River Wash Land Exchange'' and dated September 3, 2015.       (4) Non-federal exchange parcel.--The term ``non-Federal      exchange parcel'' means the approximately 59 acres of land      owned by the Conservation District generally depicted as      ``SBVWCD Equalization Land'' on the Map and is to be conveyed      to the United States if necessary to equalize the fair market      values of the lands otherwise to be exchanged.       (5) Federal exchange parcel.--The term ``Federal exchange      parcel'' means the approximately 90 acres of Federal land      administered by the Bureau of Land Management generally      depicted as ``BLM Equalization Land to SBVWCD'' on the Map      and is to be conveyed to the Conservation District if      necessary to equalize the fair market values of the lands      otherwise to be exchanged.

The fair      market value of the Federal exchange parcel or non-Federal      exchange parcel,[[Page H5203]]     as the case may be, shall be credited against any required      equalization payment. To the extent such credit is not      sufficient to offset the entire amount of equalization      payment so indicated, any remaining amount of equalization      payment shall be treated as follows:       (1) If the equalization payment is to equalize values by      which the Federal land exceeds the non-Federal land and the      credited value of the non-Federal exchange parcel,      Conservation District may make the equalization payment to      the United States, notwithstanding any limitation regarding      the amount of the equalization payment under section 206(b)      of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43      U.S.1716). In the event Conservation District opts not to      make the indicated equalization payment, the exchange shall      not proceed.       (2) If the equalization payment is to equalize values by      which the non-Federal land exceeds the Federal land and the      credited value of the Federal exchange parcel, the Secretary      shall order the exchange without requirement of any      additional equalization payment by the United States to the      Conservation       (c) Appraisals.--       (1) The value of the land to be exchanged under this Act      shall be determined by appraisals conducted by 1 or more      independent and qualified appraisers.       (2) The appraisals shall be conducted in accordance with      nationally recognized appraisal standards, including, as      appropriate, the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land      Acquisitions and the Uniform Standards of Professional      Appraisal       (d) Title Approval.--Title to the land to be exchanged      under this Act shall be in a format acceptable to the      Secretary and the Conservation District       (e) Map and Legal Descriptions.--As soon as practicable      after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary      shall finalize a map and legal descriptions of all land to be      conveyed under this The Secretary may correct any minor      errors in the map or in the legal descriptions.

6903,topic-id,303,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation, the Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange This bill reflects a compromise negotiated at the grassroots level among the cities, county, mining companies, wildlife agencies, and water organizations for over two decades in the Upper Santa Ana Wash area.  The bill simply authorizes a land exchange of 327 acres of Bureau of Land Management land for 310 acres of land currently owned by the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation This exchange facilitates the implementation of the broader Upper Santa Ana Wash Land Management and Habitat Conservation Plan, which identifies opportunities to expand existing aggregate mining operations to support new infrastructure developments; enhance water storage for the surrounding communities; and establish protected habitat for certain threatened and endangered plants and species.  After the exchange, the Bureau of Land Management will use the land to protect critical habitat and will enhance the region's water conservation and storage efforts by recharging more than 77 water basins. The land acquired by the Water Conservation District, which is currently adjacent to two aggregate mines, will allow local mining companies to expand and create greater efficiency in their current mining operations.  The companies estimate that this small exchange will result in approximately $8.5 million in new infrastructure projects and a $36 million increase in annual payrolls from the new sites.  This bill is supported by a wide variety of stakeholders in my district, including the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District, the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, San Bernardino County, the city of Highland, California, the city of Redlands, California, CEMEX, the Endangered Habitats League, Robertson's Ready Mix, and Inland  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

6875,topic-id,1712,"Mr.President, after weeks--make that months, make that years of discussions about the path forward to rescue the American people from ObamaCare, we find ourselves at an important fork in the road.  We have talked among ourselves about the necessity of keeping our promises to repeal and replace We are coming down to the reality that, without the Democrats being willing to participate in the process and given the strictures of the budget reconciliation process, it is not going to be possible for us to do as much as we would like to do. We will continue to talk, and my hope is that we will continue to make progress with some sort of consensus on how best to proceed.  In the meantime, we do have a bill that 51 Republicans voted for in 2015 to repeal ObamaCare and leave 2 years available for a transition on a bipartisan basis. Here is my concern. Under ObamaCare, there are massive amounts of money being paid to insurance companies for something called cost sharing in order to try to help bring the premiums down, in order to try to help bring the deductibles down to make them affordable. It is pretty clear it is not working, given the 105-percent increase in premiums since 2013 alone under Right now, we know the individual market, which is the insurance market where individuals and where small businesses buy their health insurance, is in a meltdown mode. That is after 7 years of  Our friends across the aisle would like to convince you that in the 6 months or so President Trump has been in office, he has been the cause of that. It is not true.  Many of us, myself included, would love to see us stabilize the individual insurance market while we get some important reforms done to try to help bring premiums down in order to reassure people that we are going to protect preexisting conditions and while we do some additional important work on Medicaid reform.  I would be lying if I said that this is easy. Frankly, people didn't send us here to do easy stuff. They sent us here to do the hard stuff, and we need to continue to use our best efforts to keep our commitments and to deliver something better than the broken status quo of  My concern is, if we are unsuccessful in doing that--we have already seen, for example, our friend, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, propose some additional mandatory cost sharing for insurance companies. According to the Kaiser Foundation, these are direct payments from taxpayers to insurance companies. Rather than working with us to try to make a course correction in ObamaCare and to put it on a sustainable path--our friends across the aisle want none of that. What they want is the cash. They want the billions of dollars that are going to go to insurance companies and no reform.  I personally find that to be an unacceptable alternative. We do need to do something to protect people who are being hurt right now from the sky-high premiums and the deductibles that render their health insurance unaffordable. My concern is, to be absolutely candid with you, right now the President is authorizing on a month-to-month basis the cost-sharing payments, which are sustaining the market as it currently is--not well enough, given the structural problems, but at least keeping some insurance companies available in most places, although not all.  My concern is, unless we pass something like the Better Care Act, we are left with an untenable alternative. The President's statement that he may decide not to make those cost-sharing payments would provoke an immediate crisis in the marketplace, which would force us to act. I don't think that is inherently bad, but I want to make sure that we act in a constructive way, that we are not just throwing billions more dollars at a broken system, but that we actually implement the reforms to put it on the right path.  I know in Washington people tend to think in terms of Republicans and Democrats, and this is all about Obama, this is about Trump, this is about personalities. It is not. It is not even about politics. It shouldn't be, ultimately. This should be about the people we represent in our States and the people we represent across the country. How can we do the best job, given the difficult hand we have been given, to try to help make things better?[[Page S4041]]  This is not going to be the end of the process. This is another step along the journey toward helping to make healthcare more affordable and more accessible.  There is a lot of great work that has been done. As the Presiding Officer knows, he has been at the forefront of trying to make sure we address things like the opioid crisis, which is devastating communities across the country. I was here showing a chart yesterday that the Presiding Officer has seen, showing HIV deaths going way down thanks to modern drugs, car wrecks were still in the 30,000 range, but deaths as a result of overdoses were up around 52,000 a year, I think, is the rough number. That is a public health crisis.  We need to do everything we can to make sure we are delivering services to the people who need it most who are suffering, but if all we do is bail out insurance companies, we will not have done our job, especially toward the communities hurt by the opioid crisis.  We are going to continue to work, but at some point we are going to have to vote, and, yes, people are going to have to be put on record. Now, we are all grownups. Most of us have held political office for a fair time now. We know how to explain our votes to the voters back home, to whom we are accountable.  If you don't vote, then nobody is accountable, and everybody can blame each other for the outcome. I really do worry, unless we redouble our efforts to come up with meaningful reforms to the broken ObamaCare system, that we will be left with an untenable choice, either an insurance company bailout of the same flawed structure of ObamaCare or an immediate crisis that is going to force us to act and do the bailout without any reforms.  Mr.President, the other thing I just want to point out, in the closing minutes I wish to speak, is the process by which our Democratic friends have dragged their heels to the point of almost bringing this place to a halt, particularly when it comes to a new President getting votes on his nominees for Cabinet positions and sub-Cabinet positions. They are the first to criticize the President for not getting things done that he wants to get done, but when they sabotage his ability to try to populate these important positions in the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions by dragging their heels on nominations, they are causing a large part of the problem.  To put this in perspective, in 2009, 90 percent of President Obama's confirmations happened by voice vote. That is without a recorded vote, and that is without 30 hours expiring after voting and closing off the debate. This was just essentially an agreement in 90 percent of the cases.  Democrats in the Senate under the Trump administration have allowed only 10 percent of his nominees to be voice-voted. We allowed 90 percent for President We didn't agree with President Obama on a lot of things, but we agreed that he won the election, and he was entitled to populate his Cabinet and sub-Cabinet with people of his choice, assuming they weren't disqualified for some other reason.  Well, this week, we have considered Patrick Shanahan, nominated to be Defense Secretary of the Department of Defense, which is a role vitally important to the Department as it works through readiness, modernization, and of course the service to our men and women in uniform, providing them the tools and equipment and the training they need in order to protect the country. In order to accomplish that, the Defense Department needs a full team.  We spend more than $600 billion a year on national defense, and yet the President can't get his full team put in place on a timely basis because of partisan foot-dragging.  Well, it serves another purpose, I suppose, because the more we are tied up on nominations, the less time we have to deal with legislation. These kinds of tactics remind me of the former majority leader, Harry Reid, whose political schemes cost his party a 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority.  I know the distinguished senior Senator from New York, my friend, the Democratic leader, remembers that when Members of his own party can't bring back home any record of accomplishment for what they have done during their time here in Washington, it is pretty hard to make the case you should be reelected. After Harry Reid blocked participation, not just from the minority but also from the majority so they couldn't go back home and demonstrate that they had fought and accomplished things for their constituents, their party suffered a very tough political price.  So I would urge our colleagues to end this perpetual obstruction on nominations, legislation, and everything else. Noncontroversial nominees should not require days to get confirmed or judges, for that matter, should not require a 30-hour postcloture vote in order to get confirmed by more than 90 votes. That indicates it is not a controversial vote so why burn up the time except out of spite or desire to slow down this administration or this Congress in terms of getting things done.  The American people sorely want leaders at every level of our government. They are hungry for us to lead and to demonstrate we are listening to them and doing what we believe to be in their best interest, and they deserve a Senate that fulfills one of our most fundamental responsibilities, which is to consider and vote on Presidential nominees.

As a result of drought and the bark beetle, there are an estimated over 107 million dead trees in over 33 million acres of forests in California, and it is also throughout the Part of this is due to climate change, which is one of the most vexing challenges of our time.  This unprecedented tree mortality has created serious fire risk of wildfires throughout the Today, in California, in the Central Valley, we have record temperatures of 109 degrees and 112 degrees. Obviously, that adds to the concern.  One thing that can be done, though, to prevent wildfires is to manage and control the amount of vegetation, particularly in areas where we have increased fire risk. We just, bottom line, have to manage our forests a lot better than we are. We are putting way too much of our budget for managing our forests to putting out fires, and that must change.  But an example of a location with higher fire risk is a utility corridor with exposed electrical lines that we have throughout the West in forested areas.  In 2015, the Butte fire in northern California, which was the seventh most destructive in California's history, was sparked by a tree that came into contact with a power line. This is easily prevented by removing those trees that could damage lines, reducing fire risk and the cost of repairs to the utility ratepayers, plus the people in the surrounding area, which these fires are devastating, and sometimes lives are lost as well as property.                              {time}  1515  H.1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, if enacted, would create a process to expedite routine maintenance of vegetation along electric utilities in and near utility corridors and would help prevent future tragedies like the 2015 Butte fire in northern California that was devastating, once again.  The bottom line is that we must do more, and we can. I concur that we should utilize the Stafford Act for forest fires, and that would free up more money to manage the forests. But that is a separate piece of legislation that, hopefully, we will get a chance to act on.  This is a separate piece, and I urge support of this commonsense legislation, for my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.

As we mark 1 year since the 49 souls were taken from us at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, this pride is much more than a celebration. It is a vibrant act of strength for a community that has endured persecution simply for being who they are and who they love.  As Pete looks forward to the celebration this weekend, I wish the community happy pride. Be loud and be proud because we are proud of you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgH4985.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,20.0,May

7014,topic-id,795,"Mr.President, I have some good news from A week ago yesterday, the U.Senate voted to confirm former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue to be our next Secretary of When we met prior to his confirmation hearing, Secretary Perdue and I discussed Montana ag and the need to expand agricultural access to foreign markets. I know he will prioritize the ag industry during his time in office, and I am pleased to share that I will be hosting the Secretary in Montana for the Montana Ag Summit that is going to be held in Great Falls at the end of this month.  Back in March, during the Secretary's confirmation hearing, I extended an invitation to join us in Montana's Golden Triangle as we discuss the issue of strengthening international relationships for Montana's agriculture. The Golden Triangle is where my great-great-grandmother homesteaded as she moved from Minnesota--a Norwegian immigrant--to  At the Ag Summit, we will showcase the technological advancements that are changing the way we produce crops and livestock, promote the next generation of ag producers, and discuss the challenges ag producers face as a result of our Federal policies and regulations. The Montana Ag Summit will bring together leaders from across the agricultural industry to hear from our keynote speakers, which include Secretary Perdue and my colleague and friend and the chairman of the U.Senate Ag Committee, Senator Pat Roberts from Nothing takes the place of hearing directly from Montanans and seeing our great State with your own eyes.  I have been a strong advocate for Montana ag since coming to Washington, DC, and it is a privilege to serve as Montana's only representative on the U.Senate Ag Whenever I get the chance, I talk about Montana's ag industry and advocate for regulation reform and for additional opportunities for our ag producers to compete on a level playing field.  Another critical issue for farmers and ranchers in Montana and around the Nation is opening up more market opportunities for the ag industry. In fact, earlier this past month, 38 of my colleagues and I wrote to President Trump asking him to prioritize reopening China's markets to U.beef in his discussions with Chinese President Xi China is Montana's third leading trade partner after Canada and South  It is important to remember that 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of the United While the Chinese ban on U.beef imports was lifted last fall, more needs to be done to actually see U.beef on the shelves of Chinese grocery stores. You see, China is the second largest beef import market in the world.  I can say it was an honor to personally present some of Miles City's famous and finest beef to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang from Fred Wacker's ranch out of Miles I will get Montana beef in China if I have to take it over myself.  Montana's 1 industry and economic driver is agriculture. With over 27,000 farms in the State, Montana ag is nearly $5 billion strong. By the way, Montana is now the leading pulse crop producer in the  Last week, President Trump unveiled his tax reform plan, which, among many proposals, includes a full repeal of the death tax--a full, permanent repeal of the death tax. This is a tax that directly impacts many Montana farm and ranch families. In fact, I heard a story from a Montana rancher a couple of weeks ago of his having the sudden, unexpected passing of his mother and his father. It is a multigenerational ranch operation in Montana that had a huge tax liability--in the millions of dollars--that it had to pay to the IRS because of the death tax.  I have been calling for a repeal of the death tax since I first came to Washington, DC--one of the most immoral taxes on the books--because I understand how these taxes can cause family farms and family ranches to break up and to be sold off.  The bottom line is this. You cannot feed a nation without farmers and[[Page S2669]]ranchers, and you cannot have opportunity economies without actual opportunities to meet the needs of not only our State, of not only our Nation but of the world.  As the U.Congress and the Trump administration continue to work together, I am excited to see that ag is a priority. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the U.Senate, as well as in the Trump administration, to advance policies and solutions to the barriers that our Nation's ag producers face, and I really look forward to the upcoming Montana Ag Summit in Great Falls later this month.

Reducing the threat of wildfires requires numerous proactive efforts, including the timely removal of fire hazards.

6754,topic-id,1293,"Mr.President, for all of the discussion about delays, politics, the process, vote counts, budget scores and analysis, it is critical we remember that this healthcare debate is first and foremost about people, our friends and neighbors, and their families. It is about moms and dads, sons and daughters, sisters and brothers, grandmas and grandpas.  We all agree everyone needs access to quality, affordable healthcare. Regardless of how healthy you are today, everyone needs the peace of mind that if they get sick, they will be able to get the care they need. We all know someone who has fought cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or has a child battling a chronic condition or disease.  In our shared experiences and relationships are shared values. Each of us wants our loved ones to be healthy and to live long, full, happy lives. We want what is in the best interests of our families, our friends, and our neighbors.  I have seen these values firsthand through the stories of Hoosiers who recently wrote to me out of desperate concern about the Senate healthcare bill. I have heard from everyone--from working parents to students, to seniors--that access to quality and affordable healthcare is critical to their ability to raise a healthy family, to contribute to our communities, and to live our final years in dignity.  Take Conor, who is a lawyer, and Sarah, a nurse practitioner, and their family in Fort Wayne, as an example. In 2015, Sarah was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that attacks the nerves in her brain and spinal cord. As Conor wrote me, ``Like everyone else who suffers from MS, my wife didn't make this choice.[[Page S3811]]She did not choose this disease . . . sometimes people get sick or are diagnosed with chronic conditions through no fault of their own.''  If untreated, she would become severely disabled, and her condition would get progressively worse. The best possible outcome for Sarah is controlling the disease and limiting the spread of the symptoms because there currently is not any cure.  Conor and Sarah worry that under the Senate healthcare proposal, they would be subject to annual and lifetime caps, making Sarah's treatment unaffordable. Through the Senate healthcare bill, States could seek waivers that would allow them to get rid of essential health benefits and implement annual and lifetime caps, even for health insurance plans that people receive through their work, just like Sarah does. For Conor and Sarah and others who suffer from conditions like MS, the reforms that prohibit limits on coverage allow them to have the peace of mind that they can live full lives, despite their disease and their diagnosis.  It is stories like Sarah's and Conor's that remind us why this is such an important debate. It is inherently personal. It is about the health, the well-being, and it is even about the life and death of our loved ones. It is about not going to the ER just to visit a doctor. It is about financial security. It is about financial security so our families aren't one illness or one sickness away from bankruptcy.  Take, for example, Beth and Brad from Plainfield, They are the proud parents of Kyle has special needs, and he relies on Medicaid, not only for his healthcare but literally to help keep the family together. Beth recently wrote me:       Kyle is on a home and community-based Medicaid waiver,      which is not mandated. If Medicaid is cut, Kyle and others      like him are in real danger of losing coverage for home      nursing and nutrition among many other things. Without home      nursing, Brad or I will also have to quit working. And      without enough income to pay for it ourselves, we'll be      placed in the horrific situation of either not being able to      give our child what he needs at home, or institutionalizing      our precious boy. We want to care for our son at home. We      want to work and pay for his primary insurance that reduces      the amount of Medicaid money needed. We want the      independence, freedom and responsibility that the minimal      supports through Medicaid allows.  And Lori from Kokomo, IN, wrote to me about her 3-year-old daughter Savannah:       She has a long list of medical issues. She has had 2 open-     heart surgeries, 8 heart catheterizations, 1 pacemaker      placement, and countless other procedures. Her medical bills,      at 3 years old, are in the millions, and she still will need      more cardiac surgery in the future. Her annual care--just her      medications, appointments with specialists, therapies, etc--     are more than our annual income, despite my husband working 3      jobs. The Senate GOP bill puts her life in grave danger.       Lifetime limits and waiving of Essential Health Benefits      means she will lose her private insurance. Allowing      alteration or waiver of Essential Health Benefits will be      catastrophic for Savannah and others with preexisting or      chronic conditions. I will be forced to look at my child and      say, ``I'm sorry honey, Mommy and Daddy don't have enough      money for your surgery.''  As a dad, the health and well-being of my family is on my mind every day, and I know that every mom and dad across our country feels the same way. My faith teaches me that we are all God's children, and every man, woman, and child should have a shot at being able to live up to their God-given potential. We will move Heaven and Earth to take care of our kids. These values are shared across Indiana and across our entire beloved country.  My faith also teaches me that we all deserve to live with dignity.  Claudia from Muncie wrote to me:       I am a 55-year-old, medically-retired flight paramedic and      My career was cut short when I was diagnosed with ALS--     Lou Gehrig's Disease--in 2005. Without Medicaid and the      waiver I would be institutionalized. Because of the things      Medicaid covers, I am still able to be a mother.       For two decades, I was the person who came to the aid of      others. Please, don't fail me or my family now.  This bill would fail Claudia and millions of others. It would force Claudia's family and families across the country to pay more, not less, or to even put critical healthcare out of reach. You don't have to take my word for it, though.  The American Heart Association calls this bill ``heartless.'' The Catholic Health Association says the bill is ``devastating.'' The American Academy of Pediatrics says it ``fails children.'' The American Cancer Society says the bill could ``greatly harm millions of cancer patients, survivors, and those at risk for the disease.'' AARP, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and Catholic Charities oppose this bill.  Here in the Senate, we have been hired by the people we represent to continue the proud American tradition of leaving our children a country that is even better than when it was given to us. We owe it to the people we serve to ensure they have healthcare that is affordable and accessible.  Ohio's Governor, John Kasich, recently said, when he talked about the challenges with our healthcare system, that this will never, ever be solved with a one-party approach. He is right.  In order to strengthen our healthcare system, we would be a lot better served by working together with a bipartisan effort and with input from those who provide healthcare every single day--the doctors, the nurses, the hospitals in urban communities and in rural communities all across our country. Most importantly, we need to remember the patients and the caregivers who rely on our healthcare system. We can do this together, and a big dose of Hoosier common sense would be a huge part of it.

6751,topic-id,2964,"Mr.President, the Senate will be going home this week for the Fourth of July recess, and most of us will be back in our homes with our families and in our hometowns and[[Page S3808]]moving around. I still think the topic of conversation is going to be healthcare.  I think this conversation and debate in Washington has really touched a lot of families and businesses and individuals across this country. The reason I say that is because about 6 years ago, I voted for the Affordable Care Act, what is known as For the longest time, I was sure it was the right vote, and I am still sure today, but I wondered why people didn't appreciate it because what we tried to do--and we achieved some success--was to provide health insurance for a lot of people in America who didn't have it. In my State of Illinois, we cut the percentage of uninsured people in half because of the Affordable Care A large number of them are now covered by Medicaid, and a large number are able to buy health insurance through private insurance exchanges.  But for the longest time, when we asked people across America ``What about ObamaCare? What about the Affordable Care Act?'' we got mixed reviews. Less than a majority supported it.  Then we embarked on this conversation, this debate in Washington in the Senate over the last 6 months, and an interesting thing happened. When the Republicans, who are in the majority in the Senate and the House, who were determined to repeal ObamaCare, set out to do it, they found out it was a big, heavy lift.  So now, today, we have an interesting thing that has happened. For the first time in the last several weeks, a majority of the American people support the Affordable Care All of those years after we passed it, when we were talking about the good things it did, people were skeptical, but when the notion of repealing it came up, people started saying: Well, what would I lose if you repealed it? And when they thought about what they would lose, they decided those things were valuable to them personally and to their families. And what were those things? Some pretty basic things--first, that you would have access to health insurance.  I have repeatedly told the story of my friend Judy is in hospitality. She works in a motel down in Southern Illinois that I have stayed in from time to time. She is a sweetheart of a lady. She is 62 years old and has had jobs that don't pay a lot of money, but she goes to work every day--there is not a lazy bone in her body. She is 62 years old, and Judy had never had health insurance in her life until we passed the Affordable Care Now she qualifies for Medicaid, and thank goodness she does because she has been diagnosed with diabetes, and she needs a good doctor she can count on, and she needs good medical advice.  So when we said that we were passing the Affordable Care Act so that more people would have access to health insurance, it happened.  We also said we were going to change the health insurance policies you buy so that you don't get tricked into buying something that is going to provide protection but only enough and not enough when you really need it.  For example, there used to be lifetime limits. People would buy health insurance and say: I am going to keep the premium low. I will sign up for a lifetime limit. How could I ever need health insurance for more than $100,000 a year?  Well, it is an eye-opener, but there are many diagnoses or accidents that could happen to you next week that would cost more than $100,000. So a lot of people found themselves facing personal bankruptcy because they had a limit on their health insurance policy and faced a cancer diagnosis and knew they would have to spend $150,000 or $200,000 for the most basic care.  We also said: When you sell health insurance, you can't discriminate against people because of a preexisting condition.  Well, it turned out that insurance companies defined ``preexisting condition'' to include everything, such as acne when you were a teenager or asthma--you name it. In fact, they went so far as to say that being a woman was a preexisting condition. Some of those things made no sense, so we said: That is over. We are not going to let that happen anymore.  One out of three Americans has a preexisting condition. You can't discriminate against a person because they are of a family with a child who has survived diabetes or is living with diabetes or a spouse who survived cancer surgery. So we said that from now on, under the Affordable Care Act, when you buy a health insurance policy, it is going to cover the basics.  We did something else that I want to mention because I don't want it overlooked. There used to be a Senator who sat back here in the last row, in the second seat, named Paul Wellstone of Paul Wellstone was a great guy. You couldn't help but love him whatever your politics. Over here was Pete Domenici, and he was a conservative Republican Senator from New Wellstone from Minnesota, Domenici from New Mexico--what would those two have in common? What they had in common was that each of them had someone in their family with a mental illness, and they watched what happened to their loved one in their family. The two teamed up and said: From this point forward, when you buy health insurance in America, it is not going to be just physical health that it is going to cover, it is going to cover mental health as well.  So many families are touched by mental illness, some very serious forms, some not so serious but need medical help, and they all should be covered. So they put that provision in the Affordable Care Act so that now, when you buy a health insurance policy in America, it is not hit or miss; it covers mental illness, as it should.  Then they added a provision that most of us didn't pay attention to, and we should, and we do now: mental illness and substance abuse treatment. Think of this opioid and heroin epidemic and the people who are dying right and left. Think of families who are absolutely consumed by the addiction of a child, of a teenager, wondering if they can get them into treatment so they can save their lives. For many of them, that health insurance plan is paying for that treatment--treatment that otherwise would come out of their pocket if they could afford it.  So we put all of these things into the law, and the law took place, and when the Republicans said they were going to repeal it, people stood up and said: Wait a minute. I have to face lifetime limits again? I have to face preexisting condition prejudice again? I am not going to have mental illness covered automatically or maternity care covered automatically?  Well, when people reflected on this, they realized their vulnerability. So simple repeal was not enough; the Republicans needed to replace. If they were going to eliminate ObamaCare and all the people protected by it, they needed to replace, and that is when the process fell apart. In the House of Representatives, they went through a process of writing the replacement. When it was all over, they didn't wait for the Congressional Budget Office to analyze it because they knew what was coming. The Congressional Budget Office announced that some 23 or 24 million Americans would lose their health insurance because of the plan that passed the House of They also knew that people could again face discrimination based on preexisting conditions. They knew basic health insurance didn't include the protections all of us really need to count on.  Do you remember the provision in the Affordable Care Act that said your son or daughter could stay on your family health insurance plan until you reached the age of 26? It is pretty valuable, isn't it? That son or daughter, whom you like a lot and helped get through college, doing internships and looking for a job--you wanted to make sure they have health insurance, didn't you? That was part of the Affordable Care Act, and we want to make sure the guarantee remains in any future change of the law too.  The House of Representatives passed their measure, and, unfortunately, it was a partisan roll call; only Republicans voted for it. It passed by four votes. If two Republican Congressmen had changed their votes, it would not have passed.  Then the measure came over to the Senate, as we remember from our civics lessons, and the Senate had its chance. So what happened? We had a chance to take this question to the committees of the U.Senate--Labor[[Page S3809]]and the Health and Education Committee, which is chaired by Senator Lamar Alexander, a friend of mine, Republican of Tennessee, and the ranking member, Senator Patty Murray of We had a chance to take the bill to the committee and to debate a better approach in the Senate, to have public hearings and witnesses. But we didn't do that.  Instead, the Republican majority said: We are going to do this on our own. We don't need any Democratic input. Thirteen Republican Senators will meet in a room and write the alternative to the House healthcare replacement bill, and they did. It went on for weeks, and no one saw it. There were no reports of what it included and what was inside of it. Then, 6 days ago--6 days ago--it was announced. We took a look at it, and it wasn't that much different from what the House had done.  The Congressional Budget Office released a report on Monday of this week and said that 22 million Americans would lose their health insurance under the Republican healthcare plan--22 million. And--this part was really troubling--there would be a dramatic increase in premium costs for people between the ages of 50 and 64. Some of them would see increases of up to $8,400 a year in premium costs because of the Senate Republican plan.  What was the reaction of the medical professionals across my State to both the House Republican plan and the Senate Republican plan? It was the same reaction. They said: Senator, vote against it.  The Illinois Hospital Association said that if we cut back on Medicaid, hospitals--particularly rural hospitals and downstate hospitals--will have to cut back in services and may face closure.  The doctors in my State, the Illinois State Medical Society, came forward and said: Vote against the Senate Republican plan and the House Republican plan because we know what happens when people lose health insurance. They still get sick. They don't come to see us early on when we can prevent things from getting worse; they come to see us when things are pretty bad and pretty expensive and pretty dangerous.  So the doctors opposed it, the nurses opposed it, the pediatricians opposed it. Not one single medical advocacy group in Illinois supported the Republican bill, which was unveiled 6 days ago.  When it came to preexisting conditions, it wasn't just the medical groups that opposed the Senate bill. The cancer society, the heart association, the lung association--most of the major disease groups stepped up and said: The preexisting condition provisions in this bill are unacceptable, and, sadly, the policies that are going to be sold may not cover the basics that people absolutely need.  Then the other thing came out. What drove this whole debate, what started healthcare reform in the House of Representatives and in the Senate was not healthcare reform, but a tax cut. You see, the Affordable Care Act imposed new taxes, particularly on higher income individuals, and the money from those taxes went into sponsoring people into Medicaid and helping people pay their health insurance premiums. The Republicans in both the House and the Senate said: The first thing we will do is cut those taxes--about $700 billion worth of taxes. Ultimately, they took $1.1 trillion out of our healthcare system with this tax cut and other cuts. When you pull that kind of money out of healthcare in America, fewer people have health insurance, fewer people have a helping hand when it comes to paying their premiums.  The reaction to the Senate Republican bill over the last 6 days has been growing opposition--growing opposition, until yesterday. Senator McConnell announced: We are not going to vote on it this week. We were supposed to, but we are not going to vote on it this week. He said that he may return to it when we come back from the July 4th recess.  Here is the point I wanted to make on the floor today. I am glad we have reached the point that these proposals from the House and the Senate are not going to move forward quickly to become the law of the land. Too many people would be hurt--too many innocent people. Too many families would lose their health insurance. The cost of health insurance would go up dramatically. The premiums would go up, particularly for people over the age of 50. We would see hospitals facing closure across our We would see cutbacks in treatment for mental illness and substance abuse. The list goes on and on. It would have been a terrible outcome, and certainly doing this in order to give a tax cut to the wealthy people of this country makes no sense.  Incidentally, how much is the tax cut? If your annual income is $1 million a year, under the Republican plan, your tax cut is over $50,000 a year. The people who are wealthy aren't asking me for that tax cut, and the people who will suffer because of it are folks who aren't making anywhere near $1 million a year.  Here is what we need to acknowledge: The current healthcare system in America needs to be improved. There are things in the Affordable Care Act that need to be addressed, and we need to do it in an honest fashion, and we need to do it on a bipartisan basis.  I have talked to some Republican Senator McConnell has pulled this bill back, and they want to sit down and talk.  Senator McConnell said that there will be no conversations with Democrats; Republicans will do it by themselves. I hope over the Fourth of July he reflects on that because there are Democratic Senators who, in good faith, want to sit down and make a better healthcare system for America so that more people have the peace of mind and security of health insurance and so that it is more affordable for families all across the board.  The biggest, toughest part of healthcare today is the so-called individual health insurance market; 5 or 6 percent of people who need to buy health insurance plans don't have it where they work, and they don't qualify for Those are the ones who are seeing their premiums spike. Can't we take the collective wisdom of Senators--Democrats and Republicans--and sit down and address that problem effectively? Of course we can, but we need to have a starting point.  So my plea to the Republican leadership is to listen carefully, as our Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday. Once you take repeal off the table, once you take this massive tax cut for the wealthy off the table, we are ready to pull up a chair and sit down at the table.  Wouldn't it be a breath of fresh air in America in this day and age, in light of all that is going on, if Democrats and Republicans worked constructively together to make the healthcare system better, more affordable, and stronger for families and businesses across our Nation? I think that is why we were sent here. I think that is the reason we are supposed to be here, and I sincerely hope that happens next.  So we are ending the debate in the Senate this week, but we are not ending the debate in I urge those who think this is an important issue, and I am one of them, to speak up and to go home--I am going home soon--and to meet with people and have a conversation about where we go next as a nation. We can solve this problem, and I know we can do it in a constructive way.  If we show that kind of bipartisan leadership in the Senate, I think the House will join us. I think they will do the same thing. I think they can have a bipartisan approach too. What a relief it would be, with all of the breakdown in comity, all of the breakdown in communications politically, the warring camps that have become the American political scene. If we can show why there is a Senate and why there is a House and why people run for these offices--it is to solve problems, not to put out a press release, not to stake out a political position, but to solve a problem. This is a problem that needs solving.  I hope that over the next week, both parties will reflect on it, and when we return after the Fourth of July recess, we can roll up our sleeves and go to work.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

6828,topic-id,579,"Mr.President, I voted no today on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of 722, the Iran sanctions bill.  I did so not because I oppose the underlying bill and the need to further sanction Iran's belligerent missile and terrorist activity; in fact, I support that legislation. I voted no to give a moment's pause after the terrible ISIS attack in Tehran that just occurred.  Earlier today, a pair of deadly attacks occurred over several hours in Tehran, including in the nation's parliament building, indiscriminately killing at least 12 people and wounding dozens more. The heavily armed assailants targeted guards, cleaners, and administrative employees of the parliament. ISIS later claimed responsibility for this barbaric attack.  I certainly have my differences with the Iranian regime, its continued sponsorship of Hezbollah and Hamas, its threats to Israel, its proxy wars in Yemen and Syria, and its human rights abuses, but we must remember that the Iranian regime isn't the same as the Iranian people, many of whom expressed sympathy with the American people after we suffered the horrific attack on September 11.  In fact, the Iranian Government issued a surprisingly strong statement of condemnation of the terrorists responsible after the September 11 attack.  There was even some hope after those statements that our two nations might work together on other shared interests, although unfortunately, other than the historic nuclear agreement, that has not come to pass.  Nevertheless, I think it is important that we pause and reaffirm the statement made today by our State Department that condemns the attack in Iran[[Page S3317]]and expresses condolences for the families and victims.  I also think it is critical that we finally take some action here in the Congress to address Russia's attack on our election, which occurred more than 7 months ago.  We have overwhelming evidence of this historic attack--an attack that I liken to a cyber act of war.  The majority party here in Congress has done nothing to respond to Russia's aggression or to help protect America against any future such attack on our democracy.  President Trump still refuses to acknowledge the Russian attack--seemingly more interested in befriending the Russians and complaining about former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Comey than convincingly telling Russia to never interfere in our election again or face the consequences.  This lack of resolve is truly an abdication of our national security responsibilities in  As one Polish security expert recently warned me, if the United States does not respond to the Russia attack on its own democracy, then Putin will feel emboldened and free to conduct further such attacks against other Western democracies.  Sadly, that has already proven true--just look at Russia's meddling in the recent French, German, and Dutch elections.  As we act to address Iran's troubling missile and destabilizing activity in the Middle East, including its continued threat against Israel, we must also act against Russia, which conducted a cyber act of war against our  We must ensure that existing sanctions placed on Russia for its destabilizing actions in Ukraine and Europe and its attack on our election are not lifted until such Russian actions are reversed or addressed.  I voted no on cloture today--out of respect for the Iranian people who suffered the horrific attack today and because I think it is long overdue for the Congress to finally respond to Russia's attack on our Nation--and stand prepared to support the final Iran sanctions bill after addressing these matters.

6883,topic-id,3426,"Mr.President, let me thank my colleagues for coming to the floor and speaking on behalf of Native Americans and the Indian Health Service, its shortcomings and challenges that it creates for us.  I don't have an Indian reservation in my State, but I certainly have visited these Indian reservations in other States and believe we have an ongoing responsibility--social and moral responsibility--to those who were in this country long before many of our ancestors and who have not been treated fairly many, many times when it comes to the poverty they face in this country and the challenges they face.  It is as bad as or worse than any other group in We can do better, and we need to start with the Indian Health Service and health services. I thank my colleagues for raising that issue.  Mr.President, it is interesting, this is a historic week in the Senate because we have been engaged in a debate for weeks about what to do about healthcare in The Senate, of course, is under the majority control of the Republicans, as the House of Representatives is, and, of course, with a Republican They all came to Washington at the beginning of this year and said: The first thing we want to do is to repeal We have said it for 6 years. We are finally going to do it. We are going to get rid of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, once and for all.  They set out to do it in a variety of ways. President Trump's first Executive order to the agencies of the Federal Government said: Do everything you can to discourage He turned around and did just that. His agency stopped advertising for people to sign up for They were determined to put an end to it.  In the House of Representatives, they took a step beyond that. They introduced legislation to repeal it and replace it. What they replaced it with was a disaster. The Congressional Budget Office took a look at the Republican repeal plan in the House and said 24 million people will lose their health insurance.  Beyond that, they talked about the changes that would take place in health insurance policies with the Republican repeal plan. It passed the House by four votes, which meant that if two Republican Members--and only Republicans voted for it--had voted the other way, it wouldn't have passed. It was that close.  Then it was sent to the Senate, and it was up to the Senate Republicans to decide what they would do with this bill and what they would do with the repeal of They spent many weeks in conversation and discussion about what they might do. Thirteen Members, Republican Senators, sat in private rooms and talked about what they would do to replace  Finally, they reported a bill. It turns out their bill was an improvement over the House bill. The House bill eliminated health insurance for 24 million The Senate bill eliminated health insurance for 23 million Still, when you look at it, it is a horrible thing.[[Page S4048]]  In my State of Illinois, a million people in my State would have lost health insurance with either the House or Senate Republican bills. It is the reason there has been resistance in my State to this Republican effort from the start.  You would expect it on a political basis. Sure, the Democrats will oppose the Republicans on issues, but this went beyond it. There wasn't a single medical advocacy group in the United States that supported what the Republicans were doing, not one. The hospital associations across America, the medical society of doctors, the nurses, the pediatricians, they all opposed what the Republicans set out to do.  When it looked like there were problems in passing one version of the Senate Republican repeal bill, they sat down to rewrite it. As they sat down to rewrite it, they got into deeper water and bigger problems.  Senator Cruz, the junior Senator from Texas, said: Well, one way to bring down the cost of health insurance is to take out some of the protections of a health insurance policy. We can get premiums down pretty low if we take away the protections of a health insurance policy that are in the Affordable Care  That was his proposal.  Just this weekend, Blue Cross Blue Shield and the major health insurance industry said that this will be a disaster. If you have some people buying real insurance and real protection and others paying rock-bottom premiums for little or no coverage, you are going to create two classes of Americans, and you are going to see premiums going through the roof for those who are buying full-coverage policies. They came out against the Cruz proposal.  This week, we returned to face the votes. We were supposed to be voting today, a vote on whether to repeal As of last night, things started changing. Two Republican Senators joined two others and said they were opposing the effort, and so the Republican majority did not have the votes it needed to go forward.  They said: Well, at least we will vote on repealing  Three Republican Senators have announced, as of today, that voting for simple repeal is something they will not do. Many of them make the argument that just repealing ObamaCare without replacing it is irresponsible. They are right.  If you don't like the current system, I believe you are duty-bound, as a Senator or Congressman, to come up with a better idea, something that serves America better. They have been unable to reach that point.  Where are we? At this moment, we are at a standstill. The Republican efforts to repeal and replace have stopped as of this moment. There may be a vote, an official vote this week. I don't know. That is up to Senator McConnell as the Republican leader, but it appears there is no plan coming out of the Republican side to replace the Affordable Care  I am proud to have voted for it. I voted for it for very simple reasons. When it comes to health insurance, I believe that is one of the basics in life. I am one of those politicians who believes healthcare is a right, just like police and fire protection. It should be part of who we are in I don't believe it is a question of how rich you are or how lucky you are as to whether you have health insurance in this country.  We can do better as a nation. The Affordable Care Act set out to do that. We reduced the number of uninsured Americans with ObamaCare when we passed it 6 years ago by 50 percent. We reduced by half the uninsured people living in my State of Many of them went to the insurance exchanges, bought private health insurance. If they had lower incomes, they got subsidies to help pay the premiums. Others picked up Medicaid coverage as their health insurance. It was significant.  I ran into people all across my State, from Chicago to downstate, who had never had health insurance 1 day in their lives. These are not lazy people. These are hard-working people who happen to have the kind of jobs that didn't offer health insurance.  Ray Romanowski, big Polish fellow, guitarist and musician in Chicago said: Senator, I have never had health insurance. I am a musician. Nobody was ever going to provide me with health insurance.  He said: Lucky I have it now because I have been diagnosed with diabetes. I am in my sixties, and I have, through the Affordable Care Act, health insurance through  Similar story, almost identical story in deep Southern Judy, who works as a hospitality hostess in a local motel--she is the one who greets you with a smile when you come in for that free breakfast. Judy is 62 years of age. She never had health insurance 1 day in her life. She holds down two and three jobs at a time. The only health insurance she ever had is what she has now under  What is going to happen to those people if we eliminate Medicaid coverage--which the proposals before us suggested--if Medicaid coverage is cut back dramatically?  Those two people, Ray and Judy, are still going to face health challenges. They are still going to get sick and go to the hospital, but if they don't have health insurance, will the hospital treat them? What will happen to their bills? Their costs will be passed on to everyone else. That is the way it used to be done.  What we have learned this week in Washington, in this national healthcare debate, is there are of course concerns about whether the current healthcare system is what it should be, and I think it can be improved, but we have learned one basic thing. We are not going back. We are not going back to the days when health insurance companies could deny coverage to you or your family because of a preexisting condition. We are not going back to the days where they put a limit on how much they would pay on your health insurance plan.  Remember when you first realized that a $100,000 limit was not worth that much if you had a serious diagnosis or a serious accident? We are not going back to the days when that health insurance plan literally expired in coverage, forcing you and your family into bankruptcy over medical bills.  We are not going back to the day when families couldn't cover their kids coming out of college. The Affordable Care Act said you can keep your child on your health insurance plan as a family until they reach the age of 26.  Those of us who have had kids who have graduated college realize they don't always get a great job right off the bat. Some of them start as interns or part-time workers, and they don't have health insurance. They now know they have the peace of mind of the family health insurance plan.  We want to make sure we protect that. We are not going back to the day when those young people had no coverage at a critical moment in their lives. We are not going back to the day when we allow these insurance companies to charge whatever premiums they wish.  We put provisions in the law that limit the premiums that can be charged on Americans, that limit the profits that are taken out of health insurance companies. Those were moves that had to be made to protect innocent American families who, unfortunately, were struggling with medical bills before this law passed and now at least have some chance of paying for them.  What we learned in the course of this national debate is significant. We learned that if you put up a proposal, as the Republicans did in the House and the Senate, that takes health insurance away from over 20 million Americans, you have a problem. People are going to push back and say that it isn't fair to take away health insurance and the protection and peace of mind that come with it. If you come up with a plan that ends up dramatically cutting back on Medicaid, you are going to get a lot of people who are concerned about it.  Across America, the Medicaid Program as we know it does many significant things. One-half of the babies born in my State of Illinois are covered by Mom and her prenatal care, the delivery of the baby, and the caring for mom and the child afterward are covered by If you make a cut in the reimbursement for Medicaid, you will endanger the basic treatment needed to have a healthy baby.  The second thing we know is that Medicaid is critical for people with disabilities. I met a mother in Champagne, IL, and she came up and told me[[Page S4049]]she has a 23-year-old autistic son. It has been a struggle for her and her family, but now he has a somewhat independent life. She said: Senator, if you take away Medicaid insurance from him, I will have to put him in some institutional program that I cannot afford. There is nowhere to turn.  I also want to remind people that Medicaid pays school districts to take care of kids with special education needs, transportation, counselors, even feeding tubes for the severely disabled. That is an important part of  I haven't touched on the most expensive part of the Medicaid Program in The most expensive part is for those who are in nursing homes, those who are older Americans and need Medicaid to get by. They have Social Security and they have Medicare, but they need If you cut back on Medicaid as proposed by the Republicans in both the House and the Senate, who will take care of these elderly folks who are in a situation where they have exhausted their savings? Do they move back in with the family? Sometimes that is not even possible, but that is one of the prospects faced.  What we need to do is to accept the obvious. We have reached an important political milestone here where the Republicans don't have the votes to move forward, but we still have the challenge of the current system. I was proud to vote for it, but it is far from perfect. The current healthcare system in America, the Affordable Care Act, needs help, needs changes. We need to do it. We ought to just surprise the heck out of America by working together, both political parties, to solve the problems.  Let's identify a few of the most obvious problems.  1, the Affordable Care Act in America today does not address the cost of prescription drugs. You ask a health insurance company: What is driving the cost of premiums? Prescription drugs.  Did you ever notice that when you turn on the television at certain times of the day, it is all about drugs? It is all about new drugs, things you can hardly pronounce. These new drugs are being advertised on television time and again. And then there is a 2- or 3-minute disclaimer: Be careful. If you take this drug, you might die. Be sure and tell your doctor if you have ever had a liver transplant.  I listen to all these warnings, and I am thinking, this is being sold in advertising for the general population? Did you know that there are only three countries in the world that allow television advertising of prescription drugs--the United States, New Zealand, and Brazil?  Why do the pharmaceutical companies advertise drugs on television? Certainly if you want to inform a doctor about a new drug, you wouldn't buy a television ad, would you? The reason they are on television is so that we, as individual consumers and patients, will walk into the doctor's office and say: Doctor, it took me five times, but I finally figured out how to spell ``Xarelto,'' and I want Xarelto as my blood thinner.  The doctor has a choice: He or she can explain to you that you may not need Xarelto, that there is a cheaper version of blood thinner or that this isn't the one that really fits your needs in this circumstance. Doctors don't do that. Many of them just write out the prescription. That is why the television advertising is taking place--to convince the consumer, who asks the doctor and who ends up with the high-priced drug being scripted for them. That is the reality of why the costs of healthcare keep going up.  What does the Affordable Care Act do about that? It does nothing when it comes to the cost of prescription drugs. I want these drug companies to make a profit, don't get me wrong. If they are profitable while looking for new cures, that is the way it should be. But when they charge through the roof and double and triple the cost of these pharmaceutical drugs, that is not fair. It is not fair to consumers, and it is not fair to taxpayers.  Think about the fact that many of exactly the same drugs made in the United States are sold in other countries for a fraction of what they cost in the United Even in Canada, they charge about one-half or one-third for many of the most popular drugs because the Canadian Government said to the drug companies in America: We are drawing the line. We are not going to let you charge anything you want to charge.  Why don't we do something in America to protect consumers? Why don't we at least inform people when pharmaceutical companies are overcharging so that we can put some pressure on them to stop? That is part of the change to the Affordable Care Act that I think will save us money and at the same time deal with an issue most Americans really are concerned about.  We also should be concerned about the fact that when it comes to the individual health insurance market, that is where most of the problems are. Six percent of the American population buying health insurance through the exchanges--half of them have to pay the full premiums, and some of those premiums go through the roof. Why? Because the people who are buying this insurance are usually people with a medical history or they are older folks and they want to have the peace of mind of coverage. The healthy, younger folks aren't buying it. As a result, the insurance risk pool gets pretty expensive when it comes to premiums. We need to fix that, and we can fix that. That is another thing on which we should come together as Democrats and Republicans to try to achieve.  For those who say: Well, I promised my entire political career that I couldn't wait for the day to come forward and vote to repeal ObamaCare, I just want to tell them that they should be aware that when the Congressional Budget Office looked at the impact of just repealing the Affordable Care Act and not replacing it, they said the following: This would force more insurance companies to leave the market immediately. It would increase premiums by 20 percent a year and double the price of premiums over 10 years, and it would take health insurance away from 32 million people.  So taking that vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act may earn you a cheer at some political rally, but it is not responsible. It is not good. It will raise the cost of health insurance for families across our country if we just repeal and don't replace, and it will take health insurance away from over 30 million people, according to the Congressional Budget It is better that we replace it with something responsible, better that we take the current system and make it stronger.  This has been an interesting debate. I have learned a lot in the course of this debate because I went and visited the hospitals in The Illinois Hospital Association opposed the Republican plan in the House and opposed the proposal in the They said it would cost us 60 to 80,000 jobs in Illinois and it would close down some hospitals we need in rural parts of our State, smalltown hospitals that are critically important. I don't want to see that happen, the people who live there don't want to see that happen, and you won't be able to keep and attract good employers and good jobs if that does happen. So I have worked with these hospital administrators and want to move forward with them on an alternative.  I will close by saying this: It is interesting how many people say ``I can't wait until I reach age 65 because I will qualify for Medicare.'' Medicare doesn't discriminate based on preexisting conditions and provides good health insurance for millions of It is an illustration and a lesson for us that if you have something that isn't driven by the profit motive, that people trust, that has provided basic, good care for Americans, good hospitals and good doctors, that is what people are looking for.

6853,topic-id,709,"Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman We are all grateful to you for being so clear and so principled.  As I have often said, Congress must fulfill its constitutional obligation to consider an updated AUMF, and as my colleagues said, that stands for the Authorization for the Use of Military Right now, the administration is still using the authorization we passed after September 11, 2001, in the legal justification to fight That is deeply problematic.  The 2001 AUMF has none of the limits many of us are seeking. We are a We are not a rubber stamp to any We have a right to vote on issues such as war and peace.  U.leadership to defeat ISIS is critical, but this doesn't require a large-scale deployment of U.forces. With American leadership, we were able to prevent the wholesale slaughter of the Yazidi people.  Iraqi partners were able to maintain control of the Mosul Dam, which, if breached by ISIS, could have resulted in death and displacement of up to 2 million people and endangered American personnel in With our support, local forces have taken back about 80 percent of the territory from ISIS in Iraq and  So another large-scale, open-ended commitment of American troops is certainly not the answer. The disastrous intervention in Iraq last decade set the stage for the rise of ISIS in the first place. The 2001 AUMF has no limits at all on U.ground troops.  As troop levels continue to rise in the fight against ISIS, we just cannot put our heads in the sand. We need to sit together as a deliberative body and make these important decisions, not give any President or any administration a blank check.  I am working on legislation to limit the authority Congress provided after September 11. We need to tailor this authority to the threat we face today. September 11 happened 16 years ago. We need new parameters to define our mission and our goals. I voted for that AUMF 16 years ago, but I never would have imagined that 16 years later it would still be there and give a blank check to any President who would use it anytime, anyplace, and to do anything. So we must fulfill our constitutional responsibility and consider what an appropriate authorization should include.  Using a 2001 authorization for a 2017 conflict sets a terrible constitutional precedent. Congress has a vital constitutional responsibility over America's war powers. This is one of the most important decisions we are charged with making. When we fail to live up to that responsibility, we weaken the balance of power that is the bedrock of our democracy. Considering an updated AUMF is not easy, but it is our job. We should do our job.  President Obama came to Congress well over a year ago with a proposed Not many people cared for it, but it was a proposed We could have changed it--it was a starting point--but we didn't do it. We threw it away because it just got too hard. That cannot happen again.  Congress has a responsibility to do its part here, and, unfortunately, we are not meeting that responsibility. We owe it to the American people and we owe it our men and women in uniform to do our job. Congressional inaction on an AUMF is inexcusable.                              {time}  1815  I want to say that it a separate issue from the recent strikes against Congress has made no authorization whatsoever for sustained military action against The 60-day clock started ticking when the President notified Congress of his missile strike.  The administration must come to Congress on that issue as well. There cannot be long-term military action against Assad without Congressional say-so.  Assad is a bad guy, and I think that he should be deposed, quite frankly. I think that any future for Syria cannot include Assad, who has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people.  But whether the United States must involve itself in every single war and ground troops using an outdated authorization for the use of force just strikes me as being something that should not happen and will lead us down a path in the future where we can't get out of it.

6885,topic-id,2002,"Mr.President, in our job, we get a lot of books, probably two or three a week at least, and for the last year most of those have been on[[Page S4050]]healthcare and healthcare reform. A book I received recently is one called ``Demystifying ObamaCare,'' by David Brown, who is a doctor. It was helpful enough to me that I thought I would share a part of it with anybody listening. It always fascinates me when we are here talking and maybe somebody is listening.  Page 7 starts out by talking about, ``How Does ObamaCare Look After Seven Years?'' Incidentally, this one is all well documented and footnoted, which is one of the unusual things about this book. It is not just speculation on his part--it is a lot of research that he has done and shared. He says:       ObamaCare actually reduces insurance market competition by      strict rules, regulations, and mandates.       ObamaCare significantly increases healthcare cost by the      way it attempts to assist those who cannot afford coverage.       ObamaCare does not tackle the underlying causes of      increased costs. Instead, it worsens the factors that drive      up the cost of healthcare with the addition of mandates,      regulations, and taxes. ObamaCare does nothing to decrease      the factors that increase costs.       ObamaCare has increased the total number of healthcare      spending. The cost is not $938 billion dollars, but now is      $2.6 trillion dollars over 10 years, or almost 3 times the      original figure.       ObamaCare increases cost for families, businesses, and      individuals for their healthcare. This includes not simply      ObamaCare exchanges but health insurance across the board.      Associated with this, there has been a marked increase in      healthcare premiums, costs for medications, deductibles, and      copays.       There has been reduction of access to care in ObamaCare      plans, i.e. ObamaCare exchanges (insurance does not equal      access).       ObamaCare, to some extent, has reduced the number of      uninsured but not handled the problem of the uninsured      population.       ObamaCare does not effectively address the problems of the      safety net system, i.e. putting new people into Medicaid has      exacerbated the problems for Medicaid, and removes its      original safety net function.       ObamaCare has reduced funding and thus care for programs      for the elderly,       ObamaCare has taken the decision making process out of the      hands of patients and their families. It has done so by      removing their freedom to make those decisions.  This is from the book, ``Demystifying ObamaCare,'' by David Brown, who is a doctor.  It goes on later to say:       The individual mandate was instituted as a way to force      patients into having health insurance or else pay a financial      penalty for not having it. The employer mandate, which was      just instituted in 2016 after several delays, was intended to      move those with employer-based insurance into the government      sector. Additionally, the HHS required all individual and      small group policies to meet the ``essential health benefit''      requirements. These benefits were determined by the secretary      of the HHS and required involvement of not simply government,      but also non-government plans. The individual and small group      policies then had to be sold at a more significant cost to      the consumer.       How is the Employer-Based System changed so employees could      be moved into a government system?       Businesses with 50 or more full-time employees had to      provide health insurance approved by HHS or be financially      penalized.       The cost for businesses for the penalties for not providing      insurance was less than the cost of the insurance.       ObamaCare exchanges were there to take in anyone who needed      to have insurance. Employer based mandates were a way of      moving employees out of the employee-based marketplace into a      government program. It is the back door way of having a      government based healthcare system. It was ingenious but      fortunately, for the American people it was flawed.       Yes, Americans in the individual market lost their      insurance (5 million Americans) but the employer-based      mandate was postponed through the efforts of Many      of the larger companies have self-insured their employees.      The ObamaCare exchange program has been very expensive for      the consumers. It has also significantly limited access to      care i.e. narrowed networks of providers, (doctors and      hospitals). ObamaCare has increased the numbers in Medicaid      but this program itself has severe flaws.  Again, in ``Demystifying ObamaCare'' by David Brown, a doctor, going to page 18, ``What Are the Facts About Medicaid and Medicaid Expansion?''       Costs of Medicaid (total federal and state spending) will      more than double i.e. more than $427 billion to $896 billion      between 2014 and 2024. The costs of this will be borne by the      taxpayers.       The cost of Medicaid to the states has a tremendous impact      on other services. It is often the second most expensive      budgetary item. With Medicaid expansion, there are increased      costs to the states, even in those states, which have      accepted Medicaid expansion and increased federal funding for      it. Other state services may have to be reduced even in      states who have not accepted Medicaid expansion.       Medicaid is actually a safety net for the poorest and most      vulnerable Americans but expansion changes this. It reduces      the access to care for others who are already in the system.      The single adult able-bodied American is competing for care      with those who need the care as a safety net.       It severely underpays doctors and hospitals, and the number      of Medicaid providers are declining. It compensates doctors      an average of 50% less than private insurance. By CBO      estimates, by the time of full implementation of ObamaCare,      one out of every six hospitals will be in the red because of      severe underpayment from Medicaid and       Medicaid expansion does not reduce inappropriate      utilization of emergency rooms. A recent study showed      Medicaid patients utilize the emergency rooms for their      routine care 40% more than those who are uninsured.       Medicaid has the worst clinical outcomes compared with any      other medical program. There are worse outcomes including      conditions such as heart disease, cancer, complications from      major surgery, transplants, and These outcomes are      independent of patient factors and reflect the program      itself. It may be no better than having no insurance at all.      A recent study comparing Medicaid patients with those who are      uninsured showed no difference in blood pressure, glucose,      and cholesterol levels after two years of observation.       In short Medicaid expansion reduces access to care,      increases cost of care and places people within the program      that has the worst possible outcomes to care.  Going on in ``Demystifying ObamaCare,'' by David Brown, page 25, ``Medicaid Expansion Update: How Does It Stand Today?''       Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have adopted      Medicaid expansion. Three states have considered it but      rejected Medicaid expansion. The other sixteen states have      refused to participate in it.       Medicaid expansion has increased the Medicaid number from      58 million to approximately 70 million people, 20% of the      uninsured population. It has caused overall expansion of the      number of people in the program.       ObamaCare has increased the number of individuals insured      by allowing them to participate in the existing Medicaid      program. In order to do so, the inclusion criteria for their      enrollments have changed. Medicaid expansion is now based on      age and financial criteria. That includes both the able-     bodied individuals who are able to work and chose not to and      those who were previously involved in the Medicaid safety      net. For example, the lower income mother with children.       It was thought that the states that accepted Medicaid      expansion would have ``free money'' if they participated with      this Federal program. 100% of the costs of adding new      patients were picked up by the federal government with that      figure gradually being reduced to 90% of the cost starting in      2017.       This was for new patients added to Medicaid and not the      existing patient population. States however found that their      Medicaid programs were flooded with new enrollees, many of      which had met the criteria for Medicaid before the ``woodwork      effect.''       The overall expansion of Medicaid with increasing numbers      of enrollees has led to marked increase in spending on      Medicaid and marked increase in total costs for  It goes on with a lot of numbers which have a lot of significance to accountants, but I will skip over those and continue on with his last two points.       Medicaid is associated with the worst possible clinical      success rate across the board for all medical and surgical      illnesses. It is worse than any other program, including any      government programs such as Medicare or any private program.      In certain studies, it has shown to have worse clinical      outcomes than having no insurance at all. No data has      developed during the course of Medicaid expansion to change      these findings.       Medicaid expansion is associated with a huge financial      burden on the states and the cost to the states with Medicaid      expansion has increased dramatically.  Again, at the end of the chapter it shows a lot of references for where he got this information.  Continuing with ``Demystifying ObamaCare'' and moving on to page 31 is ``What are ObamaCare Insurance Exchanges?''       ObamaCare insurance exchanges are federally constructed and      state run markets where individuals and families can purchase      insurance plans. Private healthcare insurance companies      participate but the insurance companies are only able to sell      plans that are acceptable to the Secretary of the Many      individuals and families then could receive subsidies      provided by the government, (i.e. taxpayers funded      subsidies). The subsidies are [to] be on a sliding scale,      families whose income is up to 400% of the federal poverty      level can be in the ObamaCare exchange ($97,000 dollars a      year for a family of four). The program is tightly regulated      by the Federal The choice is limited to four      plans (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.) Each state was      required to set up their own insurance exchanges and then      regulate them. If a state[[Page S4051]]     did not set up such an exchange, the Federal Government did      that for them.  ``What Effects These Policies Have on Those Inside and Outside the Exchanges?''       The public must know that the exchanges dramatically      restrict patient care by restricting access to care.      Exchanges decrease access by reducing access to doctors and      hospitals. This includes access to some of the most important      specialized care. The exchanges have a limited network of      providers.       The public must understand that they do [not have]      protection from fraud. Some of the most sensitive information      is given to navigators to help enroll people in the      exchanges. The enrollees then become ``fair game.''       The ObamaCare website, ``Healthcare.gov'' does not      automatically verify enrollee's eligibility, i.e., whether      they legally qualify for subsidies. Various sources indicate      that at least 2 million enrollees (some estimates are      significantly higher) are receiving subsidies that they did      not legally qualify for. Douglas Holtz-Eakins, former      director of the CBO, estimates that over the first 10 years      of ObamaCare, overpayments and inappropriate payments could      add up to $152 billion dollars. Who pays the bill? The      American taxpayer. The website, ``Healthcare.gov'' cost      taxpayers $1.4 billion dollars in 2014.  He goes on to explain how that increases the costs for all taxpayers.  I will continue with some of the other lessons in this book at another time. The leader is coming to the floor to speak in a few moments.  What we are trying to do is to find some solutions for the American people so they have access to healthcare--and more extensively than now. I recommend for reading this book called ``Demystifying ObamaCare'' by David It is very eye-opening. There is a section I will cover later that covers some of the solutions that will be useful.

6728,topic-id,386,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Rates This critical health care reform bill would address the soaring cost of insurance premiums.  Many factors contribute to increasing premiums, from the increased prevalence of chronic disease to the consolidation of the insurance market. But no matter the root cause of premium hikes, it is important that rate increases are reviewed to ensure they are fair. When consumers see insurance premiums increase by double digits, it can add an additional burden on top of[[Page S4431]]mortgage payments, childcare, and student loans. If rates are unreasonable, they should be blocked or modified.  The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Rates Act would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to act on behalf of consumers to protect them against egregious increases in health insurance rates in States that do not take this action.  In California and several other States across the Nation, State regulators lack the authority to block or modify extreme health insurance rate increases. This legislation does not change any State's ability to take this action. Rather, it simply allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to help fill in the gaps in the health care regulatory space so consumers in all States would have adequate protections against this type of price gouging.  The Affordable Care Act slowed the growth of premium increases and improved the value of health insurance--including how much of premiums insurers must spend on actual medical care and ensuring rate increases are at least reviewed. These were good first steps, but more needs to be done. Far too many Americans are facing rate increases and full consumer protections must be in place to ensure that prices reflect true cost and not simply profits. Providing all Americans with affordable, quality healthcare is of the utmost importance and Congress ought to be building on the successes of the Affordable Care Act while making improvements where necessary.  This bill provides a straightforward, direct enforcement mechanism to ensure that insurers may not impose unreasonably high costs on consumers, by empowering the Secretary of Health and Human Services to step in when State regulators do not, or are unable to.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to protect Americans from unreasonable rate hikes and move toward real, commonsense health care solutions.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4426-2.txt,1332,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017--MOTION TO,2017.0,27.0,June

I issued a simple request to I asked you to show me your plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care  I asked you to show me the plan that was going to be ``terrific.''  As to the bill that President Trump promised during his campaign and the one Republicans had 7 years to come up with, I asked you to explain how you would meet the standards set by one of President Trump's top advisers, Kelly Anne Conway, who said: ``We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance.''  I asked you all to show me the plan that retains coverage for the nearly 20 million people who have gained it, continues to contain healthcare costs, and ensures that nobody gets denied or has to pay more because of their gender or because of preexisting conditions.  I never got that plan from you. Instead, what we received was the American Health Care Act, or the AHCA, a heartless, terrible bill that passed the House in early May, a bill that President Trump heralded in the Rose Garden, after its passage, as ``great.''  The AHCA is a far cry from what President Trump and his allies promised. If the AHCA becomes law, 23 million more people would be uninsured. The bill ends protections for people with preexisting conditions and drives up healthcare costs dramatically for older, sicker folks. Worse still, the AHCA would end the Medicaid expansion and slash Medicaid by $834 billion over 10 years. For what? To offer massive tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, for the wealthiest Georgians in the Presiding Officer's The average tax savings for the 400 richest families under this plan is $7 million apiece each year--$7 million each for every year, because they need it.  No wonder people are outraged. Just 8 percent of Americans think the Senate should pass this bill into law unchanged. Well, 8 percent has to be a new low.  Americans do not want Three in four Americans want President Trump and his administration to do what he can to make the ACA work rather than undermining it.  Even President Trump reportedly now considers the House bill to be ``mean.'' It went from ``great'' to ``mean.'' In the Rose Garden, it was great. Now, a few weeks later, that same great bill is mean.  Instead of listening to the American people, Republicans are pursuing a strategy that former Acting Administrator of CMS Andy Slavitt has described as sabotage, secrecy, and speed.  Up first, sabotage.  In a few years, Republicans have choked off the Risk Corridors Program, which was designed to help stabilize premiums in the first years of the new exchanges. The Trump administration has gone even further. It has stopped enforcing the individual mandate, has undermined outreach efforts to help people sign up for health insurance, and has cut in half the amount of time that people have to sign up for health insurance coverage.  Perhaps the most troubling of all is that Republicans have refused to commit to funding cost-sharing reduction payments. These payments help low-income families cover their out-of-pocket costs. Since insurers are not sure if they can count on the administration to continue to provide these payments, some are pulling out of the individual market or are dramatically increasing their premiums to account for this instability, this uncertainty.  There is much more we can do to shore up the individual market, but my colleague Senator Stabenow had it right when she said to Secretary Price, of the Presiding Officer's State, regarding the administration's sabotage efforts: ``It's like pulling the rug out from under somebody and going, `Oh, my gosh. They fell down.' ''  That was from Debbie Stabenow, of  The next tenet of the Republican approach is secrecy.  A group of 13 men has been meeting in secret to draft the Senate version of the What little we do know is that Senator Cornyn estimates there will be about an 80-percent overlap between the Senate and House bills. Prior to now, our understanding was that the Senate Republicans would completely rewrite the bill, with Senator Burr even saying the House bill was ``dead on arrival.'' It sounds like that plan has been jettisoned, but we cannot be sure because the Senate has had precisely zero hearings, zero days of public floor debate, and we have yet to see or hear about the revised draft of the AHCA, despite the forthcoming vote.  I urge my Republican colleagues to recall that during the long debate over the Affordable Care Act, the Senate held nearly 100 bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs, and had 25 consecutive days of public floor debate. Let me repeat that--nearly 100[[Page S3597]]bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs in the Senate alone, with 25 consecutive days of public floor debate on a bill that affects one-sixth of our economy. In the Senate HELP Committee, Senators considered nearly 300 amendments during a 13-day markup--one of the longest in congressional history--and ultimately accepted more than 160 Republican amendments in the process.  In 2009, then-House Budget Committee Ranking Member Paul Ryan argued:       Before Congress changes healthcare as the American people      know it, we must know the likely consequences of the House      Democrat legislation, including the number of people who      would lose access to their current insurance.  The irony is palpable. Feel the palpable irony. Do you feel it? Does everybody feel it?  That brings me to the final component of the Republican approach, and that is speed.  Leader McConnell would prefer to have a vote on the Senate plan before the July 4 recess or shortly thereafter. That timing only leaves us with a few days to go. There will just not be enough time to truly understand how this bill would affect the healthcare system, which, again, is one-sixth of our economy and affects all of the millions of Americans who rely on it.  Republicans plan to schedule the vote in such a way as to keep the American people in the dark about this bill for as long as possible. The American people deserve a chance to weigh in on a bill that would affect their lives and those of their friends and families in my State of Minnesota and the Presiding Officer's State of  My office has received over 15,000 letters from very worried Minnesotans these past few months, and I have gone to visit rural healthcare facilities that would be among the hardest hit by the My constituents--the people of Minnesota--are frankly scared about what will happen to them or their families if they lose their health insurance, and I am too.

I rise to discuss the devastating effects the various Republican healthcare proposals that have been made would have on Indian  Republicans are now considering a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act, with no replacement. This policy, like others that have come before it, would have a devastating effect on Native communities. Today, I want to describe some of the healthcare challenges that these communities face, how the Affordable Care Act has helped to address some of those challenges, and how repealing the Affordable Care Act would undermine these gains and further jeopardize healthcare for an already vulnerable population.  I have served on the Indian Affairs Committee for the past 8 years, and I am continually shocked by what I hear almost every week from Tribal leaders and other witnesses about the challenges that face Native communities. One of the biggest challenges is that the Federal Government consistently falls short of its responsibilities to Indian communities. There is a lack of attention to the concerns of Native communities. There is a dysfunctional bureaucracy and a Congress that doesn't adequately fund Indian programs, and this can create a vicious cycle. When programs don't have adequate funding, they don't work as they should.  Some of my colleagues who have failed to provide Indian Country with the funding they need point to the resulting program inefficacies as justification for continuing to cut and underfund critical programs. That just doesn't make sense to me. Healthcare has fallen prey to this vicious cycle even though the Federal Government has a trust responsibility to provide healthcare to Tribes and to their members.  Medicaid and the Indian Health Service are both part of this trust responsibility. Over the years, the Indian Health Service has suffered from lack of resources, poor staffing, and other challenges. The vice chairman was right: ``Don't get sick after June'' is unfortunately something we hear over and over again, and it is said with some irony but also hurt in Indian Country because the funding runs out then.  These challenges mean that many in Indian Country, particularly those living in remote areas, don't have reliable access to the medical care they need on a timely basis. This is healthcare that was promised by treaty and by our  Prior to the ACA, funding shortages meant that IHS was only able to provide people with the most basic services, so a lot of the care that people needed was simply not available. For example, prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Indian Health Service could not afford to provide vital services, including women's health screenings, like mammograms, or basic diabetes care. If you suffered from diabetes, you often had to wait until dialysis was required or limb amputation was needed before being able to receive care. That is just unconscionable. That is terrible. What is more, American Indians and Alaska Natives were more likely to be uninsured than non-Native populations, which meant that many people who needed care that wasn't covered by the IHS simply went without.  The ACA helped change all of this for the better. First, the ACA gave States the option to expand their Medicaid Programs to include low-income adults without dependent children. Thanks to Medicaid expansion, 11 million Americans, including more than 290,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives, were able to get health insurance. The ACA's Medicaid expansion made it possible for an estimated 60 percent of uninsured American Indians and Alaska Natives to qualify for healthcare coverage.  This expansion, coupled with other Medicaid policy reforms, such as those that simplified the enrollment process, helped increase the total number of people covered under the program. In fact, IHS reported earlier this year that 42 percent of patients receiving services--of those who receive the services--did so because they had coverage through That is what the Indian Health Service said. Forty-two percent of those who received healthcare services did so because they are covered by In Grand Portage, which is a beautiful spot on the[[Page S4045]]northeastern corner of Minnesota, this meant that well over 20 more band members, many of them children, received coverage. We know from a recent report out of Georgetown University that, nationwide, 54 percent of children in American Indian and Alaska Native families were enrolled in Medicaid in 2015, compared to 39 percent of all children.  This program has been a vital source of coverage, and, with health insurance coverage, people have finally been able to access the healthcare they need. That is what healthcare is really about. Healthcare is about having coverage so that you have routine visits for primary care. So if you are diabetic, you have routine visits. It is not about the emergency heroic event; healthcare is about the constancy of care. That is what improves people's health. That is what improves their lives.  Another way the ACA helped improve healthcare for Native populations was by transitioning the IHS to be the payer of last resort. By establishing that Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance would be the primary payers, the ACA ensured that there was more money going to provide a wider range of services that people needed, while simultaneously reducing the financial burden on the  Yet there is more that we need to do to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and improve rates of coverage and access within Native communities. For example, we need to do more to address workforce shortages and lack of competition in insurance markets in rural areas. The Presiding Officer knows that. Also, it is imperative that we tackle the opioid epidemic in Indian But recent Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act will do nothing to address these outstanding needs and would undermine the recent health and coverage gains Tribal communities have been able to achieve. I know the last bill had money targeted at opioid treatment, but it wasn't anywhere near what will be taken away when the Medicaid expansion and cuts to Medicaid are figured in.  The Republicans' proposals would hurt Indian communities in a number of important ways.  First, they would cause tens of millions of people, including many American Indians and Alaska Natives, to lose coverage, with between 15 million and 18 million Americans losing coverage immediately. For example, Republican plans would end the Medicaid expansion, as I have said, which has been central to providing health coverage to many in Native communities.  Second, they would jeopardize the sustainability and stability of the individual market, while giving huge tax breaks to powerful corporate interests.  Finally, they would increase premiums and reduce subsidies that low-income people receive to help pay for their healthcare, which would put private health coverage out of reach for so many.  Efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act are just bad for Native communities and bad for the country as a whole.  As many of my colleagues know well, American Indians and Alaska Natives are twice as likely, as compared to non-Hispanic Whites, to be overweight, obese, diagnosed with diabetes, and experience hopelessness and depression. In Minnesota, American Indian women are also more likely than Whites to be diagnosed with maternal opiate dependency during pregnancy, and more children are born opioid dependent. Reducing coverage and driving up healthcare costs is the last thing these communities need.  Indian Tribes in Minnesota and in North Dakota and in all of our States are grappling with challenging and complex healthcare needs. They need our help. They don't need legislation that is hastily put together for ideological reasons. They don't need policies that undercut their care and livelihood.  I believe we need to work together across partisan lines. I really hope that is what we are going to do.  The Republican healthcare plans that have been put forward so far break the Federal Government's trust responsibility and undermine the very programs that are helping Indian communities. That is what I sincerely believe.  I urge my colleagues to reject Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and instead work with us on a bipartisan basis, in regular order, with hearings before our committees, to strengthen care options for our Native communities and for all I believe we can do that, and I believe we can work together. It is just the right thing to do.

6920,topic-id,609,"Madam President, today I wish to recognize and commend MG Michael Edwards, who retired on March 31, 2017, after 43 years of exceptional leadership and service to our country, including 36 years in the Colorado Air National For almost a decade in the position of the Adjutant General for Colorado, General Edwards was responsible for the command administration of over 5,300 Army and Air National Guard members. He also served as the Executive Director of the Department of Military & Veterans Affairs and was a member of the Governor's cabinet. He had responsibility for the Colorado National Guard's primary missions of national defense and State emergency response. In addition, he was responsible for supporting the missions of the Civil Air Patrol's Colorado wing.  General Edwards received his commission in 1973, after graduating from the U.Air Force Academy, and earned his pilot wings in 1974 at Reese Air Force Base,  He served as an F-4 pilot and AT-38 fighter lead-in instructor pilot at Osan Air Base, Korea, and Holloman Air Force Base, NM, respectively.  General Edwards joined the Colorado Air National Guard in August 1980. He has served in numerous assignments in flying and operations, as well as command positions at squadron, group, and wing levels--culminating as the Adjutant General for During his tenure as Adjutant General, more than 6,000 Colorado National Guard citizen-soldiers and citizen-airmen have mobilized in support of overseas contingency operations.  He also oversaw the Colorado National Guard's record-setting response to some of the worst natural disasters impacting Colorado, including the High Park Fire and the Waldo Canyon Fire during 2012, followed by the Black Forest Fire and historic flooding along the Colorado Front Range in 2013.  Furthermore, General Edwards was instrumental in bringing a new National Guard cyber protection team to Colorado, bolstering the state's cyber defenses. He also diversified the Colorado National Guard through the appointment of its first female general officer.  Over a period of 10 years, General Edwards significantly grew the Colorado National Guard's enduring relationships with the Republic of Slovenia and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan under the National Guard State Partnership These military-to-military exchanges have supported combatant command security cooperation objectives, promoted regional stability, and increased partner capacity and interoperability.  General Edwards has also overseen the missions of the Civil Air Patrol's Colorado wing, consisting of more than 1,600 volunteers. Under his leadership, the Civil Air Patrol took on a bigger role in State response, flying fire watch and conducting flood damage surveys. Colorado's Civil Air Patrol was first to fly support of the U.Army's on-base unmanned aerial systems operations.  General Edwards has flown over 4,600 mishap-free flight hours in a variety of aircraft to include the AT-38, A-7, C-21, F-4, F-16, T-37, and T-38. Of note, he has achieved the distinction of the Wing's Top Gun award on five separate occasions in his decorated flying career. Major Edwards has received numerous military decorations, including two Legion of Merit awards and three Meritorious Service medal awards, along with many others from the State of  General Edwards' operational experience, charismatic leadership, and unyielding patriotism have served him well in a lifetime of military service, both in the Colorado Air National Guard and abroad. Today we honor his distinguished service to our Nation as one of the most accomplished Adjutant[[Page S3286]]Generals in Colorado history. We offer our heartfelt appreciation to his family for their countless sacrifices and selfless support to our country spanning over four decades.

6655,topic-id,514,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In preventing child victimization, Congress, working in tandem with law enforcement, has long recognized the importance of monitoring sex offenders.  In 1994, Congress passed the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration This legislation mandated that States track violent sex offenders and establish guidelines for tracking those offenders.  Over the years, Congress continued its vigilance in monitoring sex offenders, which ultimately culminated in a comprehensive piece of legislation titled the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. Among other things, the Adam Walsh Act established a national sex offender registry, provided for post-conviction civil commitment of certain sex offenders, eliminated the statute of limitations for certain sex offenses against children, and created an office at the Justice Department specifically designed to monitor sex offenders.  Today I am proud to be here on the floor to champion the reauthorization of this landmark legislation.  H.1188, the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2017, authorizes funds for the Department of Justice's Sex Offender Management Assistance program and for the great work the United States Marshals do in locating and apprehending fugitive sex offenders who do not comply with the law's requirements.  H.1188 also contains numerous measures to encourage more States and Tribal jurisdictions to comply with the requirements of the Federal system, in part by making changes to the law to address concerns some States have expressed.  For instance, the bill lowers the duration of sex offender registration requirements for certain juveniles and allows States to register juveniles adjudicated delinquent on a nonpublic system. It also clarifies that only juveniles who commit violent sexual assaults should be placed on a State registry.  The bill also permits alternative methods for in-person verification so that rural jurisdictions can verify location of offenders remotely, in most instances only requiring in-person verification once per year.  H.1188 requires parole officers and pretrial services officers to stay informed of the conduct and provide supervision of sexually dangerous persons. Moreover, the bill strengthens civil remedies for survivors of exploitation and trafficking by allowing individuals who were victims of exploitation or trafficking as juveniles to have 10 years after becoming an adult to file suit for a civil remedy.  Mr.Speaker, we must not forget why we are here. In 1981, Adam Walsh, a 7-year-old boy, was abducted and brutally murdered in Hollywood, His death was devastating. And for many families, that kind of inconsolable pain would be incapacitating. As a father and grandfather, I cannot even imagine it.  We are thankful for the work of the Walsh family, who have dedicated their lives to child advocacy and whose work is responsible for saving the lives of countless children. I am also grateful to our colleague, Mr.Sensenbrenner, the author of the original Adam Walsh Act, for introducing this reauthorization bill and for his own tireless advocacy on behalf of our Nation's children.

6968,topic-id,339,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of H.1873, legislation sponsored by my colleagues from the Western Caucus, which improves the reliability of our electrical grid while, at the same time, protecting our Federal lands and forests from the ravages of wildfires.  This bipartisan legislation is common sense, plain and simple. This bill allows electric co-ops to prune or remove a tree that would fall on a power line in an electricity corridor if left unmanaged.  Maintaining healthy and well-managed rights-of-way is important for many reasons, not the least of which are the safety of our communities and reliable electricity delivery.  Now, if you knew that a tree was going to fall on a power line and potentially cause a massive blackout or spark a fire, you would probably want to cut it back or get rid of it, right? Of course you would. It is common sense.  Unfortunately, inconsistent and unpredictable viewpoints between Federal land managers at the Departments of Interior and Agriculture have prevented co-ops from ensuring safety along the corridors, putting many at risk.  Timely decisionmaking is crucial for these co-ops to protect the land, but for far too long, bureaucratic red tape has delayed the removal of hazardous trees for weeks and, in some cases, months. Too many times, co-ops have notified the proper Department of a dangerous situation only to have the request to remove a hazardous tree either denied or bogged down by unnecessary and duplicative reviews. Not only that, but when the very tree they reported inevitably falls on a power line and sparks a fire, the co-op is left holding the bill for the damages.  Mr.Chairman, this is absurd, and I am pleased that this legislation shifts liability for a fire started under those circumstances back to the party responsible for inaction.

6987,topic-id,240,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment to H.1873. This bipartisan amendment would ensure that personnel involved in vegetation management decisions understand the benefit that unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, or drones, can add to the maintenance and management of transmission lines.  In 2017, not only does this policy make sense, it is essential. Our electric grid and forests should be protected with this effective and cost-efficient technology, which has proven its worth in so many other areas, including national defense and private industry.  In my home State of Arizona, UAVs have proven to be highly valuable tools in forest management. Utilizing UAV expertise from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, as well as Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, land managers have greatly improved their ability to monitor forest conditions both at scale and down to the detail of individual trees and branches.  Proper vegetation management around transmission lines is essential to preventing power outages and dangerous forest fires. UAV technology makes transmission line monitoring safer, cheaper, and more effective.  As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to our constituents to pursue smarter, safer, and cheaper approaches to public policy and resource management. This amendment and this bill allow us to do so in a bipartisan way. I am proud to partner with the gentlewoman from Arizona on this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

6963,topic-id,468,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Wildfires are a huge problem in our country. They are becoming more frequent and more intense, and they pose a growing threat to public safety and local economies.  But, instead of taking steps to reduce wildfire threats, this bill tries to scare us into weakening environmental safeguards and giving away public land management to States and localities.  I agree with the bill's sponsor that overgrown vegetation and falling trees can spark forest fires. However, government data shows that this accounts for less than one-third of 1 percent of fires in the past 5 years.  Why are we focusing on this minor problem when it is clear that real wildfire solutions require treating these fires like the disasters that they are under the law, and allowing the Forest Service to use its base budget for preventing wildfires, not just fighting them?  Given what we have seen from Republicans in the Natural Resources Committee, the answer is simple: to chip away at the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA; shut expert Federal agencies and concerned citizens out of the land management process; and allow Big Business to profit at the expense of taxpayers and our public lands.  The bill lets State and local electricity reliability standards trump public land management rules. There is not even any requirement that the standards are based on sound science or principles of risk assessment.  If a county says it needs to clear-cut a half mile into a national forest to protect power lines, this bill would allow it, and the Forest Service could only watch. Further, there is no prohibition on selling timber harvested during these operations.  The bill also mandates the Forest Service and BLM use its NEPA categorical exclusion authority, even when vegetation management projects could cause environmental damage. This means that people who value public lands would be completely shut out from the management process. So much for transparency and public input.  Adding insult to injury, the bill waives liability for companies that start forest fires or cause other damage. This is nonsense and shifts an incredible burden and risk onto American taxpayers.  The bill also fails to deal with the root causes of our fire crisis, including the fact that the Forest Service cannot afford mitigation work to prevent wildfires because it spends half of its budget fighting them.  I support legislation making wildfire disasters eligible for disaster assistance under the Stafford Act, and I know many of my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, do as well. I am disappointed that we are not passing a bill to do that today, and, instead, are here just pretending to do something about a very serious problem.  I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgH5022.txt,1708,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,21.0,May

In the 33 years since then, I am aware of no example of a Federal agency refusing to allow a company to do vegetation management work and then holding the company liable for the damages.  In fact, as the committee report for this bill states, the issue of land managers allowing access to rights-of-way was largely resolved by language in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, stating:       Federal agencies responsible for approving access to      electric transmission and distribution facilities located on      lands within the United States shall, in accordance with      applicable law, expedite any Federal agency approvals that      are necessary to allow owners and operators of such      facilities to comply with any reliability standard approved      by the Commission under section 215 of the Federal Power Act      that pertains to vegetation management, service restorations,      or any situation that imminently endangers the reliability or      safety of the facilities.

6972,topic-id,292,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  At a hearing on similar legislation in the Natural Resources Committee last Congress, both the Forest Service and BLM testified in opposition and explained how they work with utility companies to address vegetation management issues.[[Page H5026]]  In addition to entering into voluntary vegetation management plans, the Forest Service testified that the agency's 2013 vegetation management guide specifies for field staffs the procedures and practices that should be included in operation and maintenance plans for power lines. This guide states that, where vegetation conditions inside or outside the authorized right-of-way pose an imminent threat to power line facilities, utility companies may remove those threats immediately, without prior approval from the Forest  For its part, BLM testified that, under the terms and conditions typically included in a right-of-way grant, a utility company may conduct minor trimming, pruning, and weed management to maintain the right-of-way of a facility after simply notifying The utility company can often obtain BLM approval for removal of hazardous trees through a streamlined process.

It belongs to the American people, and Federal agencies have a responsibility to all Americans to ensure that those lands are not abused.  Again, facts do matter, and 0.03 percent of fires in public lands were caused by trees falling on transmission lines in the last 5 years--0.03 percent.

My colleague from California (Mr.Costa) brought up one of the real causes of wildfire, and that was climate change, the lack of mitigation, and the situation within the Forest Service budget in which half of the revenue dedicated to that department is used to suppress wildfires.  This administration has denied the existence of climate change, scrubbed it from its vocabulary, from its science, from its study. If we are going to look at the causes of wildfires, if we are going to look at strategies and how we protect the urban and forest interface, if we are going to look at really addressing the subject, then the very salient point that Mr.Costa brought up regarding climate change has to be part and parcel of the discussion.

6975,topic-id,304,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  You know, this legislation, with a few modifications, could help prevent the 0.03 percent of wildfires that are caused by electricity infrastructure, but the majority refused to work with us on those modifications.  Most importantly, the failure to make vegetation management plans for utility rights-of-way mandatory negates any positive impact this bill might have had. As we have heard from Forest Service and industry at a hearing on similar legislation last Congress, voluntary vegetation management is already allowed and is quite common. This includes the ability for rights-of-way holders to access these areas and conduct vegetation management without notifying Federal land managers until after the fact. This is current law.  The majority claims we need this bill to address delays caused by the approval of unplanned work and delays[[Page H5027]]associated with removing dead trees on public lands outside of rights-of-way.  Without an up-front planning requirement, I can see authorizing limited activity for utility companies to do targeted vegetation management adjacent to rights-of-way. But instead of offering the commonsense trade off, the bill before us today simply cuts Federal agencies out of the process of managing the American people's land by requiring the Forest Service and BLM to approve plans with no option to modify or reject them if the plans are inadequate.  So whatever the company turns in--the utility company turns in, that is the plan that will become the management plan for that vegetation, regardless of any opinion by Forest Service or  Further, the bill does not define ``adjacent,'' meaning that companies could cut trees that are well outside the rights-of-way on public lands. This makes public lands vulnerable to a level of abuse that no one who values them would be willing to support.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

And as I mentioned earlier several times, facts do matter.  When we are doing a whole-scale change of how we manage rights-of-way on public lands because of 0.03 percent of the causation by utility lines of fires on public lands, that is a heavyhanded way to approach doing legislation. There have been opportunities and modifications, opportunities of expediting the process, but those were not allowed as part of this legislation.  If we, indeed, are going to look at both the wildfire situation, the budget stress on Forest Service to suppress those fires, and this rights-of-way issue, which is miniscule compared to the bigger issues, then I think this legislation has to be rejected, and work on a piece of legislation that has consensus, that is bipartisan, and that addresses the real problems with wildfires in this country, not this utility giveaway that we are doing here today.

6691,topic-id,1732,"Mr.President, Senator Carper talked about It reminds me of a greeting I have often heard from people who live in various African countries. When you meet someone for the first time, instead of what we would normally say--``Pleased to meet you''--the greeting is ``I see you.'' I see you. I think that really is part of our concern here: Do we see the people who will be impacted in the way they are actually living their lives, and do we understand, if we see them, that this bill will not be in their best interests?  Right now, for example, we know 13 Senators--all Republicans--are crafting a bill. This bill would restructure our Nation's entire healthcare system, which, when we add up what Americans spend on hospitals, doctors, prescription drugs, and all the rest, we understand it makes up one-sixth of our economy. It would affect the lives of everyone--our parents, grandparents, those who are in need of caregiving, our children struggling with asthma or opioid abuse, our spouses, who may be battling cancer.  What is equally distressing is that this bill is being written in secret. The chairman of the Finance Committee says he has not seen the bill. The Secretary of Health and Human Services says he has not seen the bill. The American people, the people we all represent, have certainly not seen the bill.  I think the American people deserve better. This bill is being written entirely along partisan lines without any attempt to bring Democrats on board, and the American people deserve better. This bill is being written and rushed through the Senate with hardly any time to debate the cost or the details of this proposal, and the American people deserve better.  I remember when our colleagues across the aisle said the Affordable Care Act was being rammed down the American people's throats in the middle of the night. The ACA, in fact, went through 106 public hearings. It incorporated more than 170 Republican amendments. The whole process took an entire year. But this healthcare plan involves no hearings, no bill text, and no transparency at all.  As Senators, we were sent here to represent the American people. We answer to the American people.  Why are my colleagues from across the aisle trying to put one over on the American people? I have met folks all across California and this country, and they see what is happening. They know that if this bill were as wonderful as its proponents would like us to believe, it would be out in the open.  The American people deserve greater transparency. Even though the authors of this proposal have tried to conceal the details of their plan, we know enough to know this bill would be nothing short of a disaster. We know because we have been told it is about 80 percent the same as the bill that was passed by the House--a bill so catastrophic that even the President of the United States who hailed its passage now calls it ``mean.''  We know it would throw 23 million Americans off their health insurance within a decade, including putting 4 to 5 million Californians at risk of losing coverage. We know it would raise costs for middle-class families and seniors. In every county of California, average monthly premium costs would go up while financial support to pay premiums would fall.  We know it would put Americans with preexisting conditions at risk and leave people who need maternity care or opioid treatment without coverage or force them to pay huge out-of-pocket costs. We know it would cut about $834 billion from Medicaid, which means less money for families to pay for nursing homes, to support children with special needs, or to treat substance abuse. We need the Affordable Care Act to be in place, in a way that we fix what is wrong, but we mend what is broken and not repeal it altogether.  I recently visited a really remarkable treatment clinic in Los It is called the Martin Luther King Outpatient Everyone from the doctors to the patients can tell you that when 4,600 Californians are dying every year from substance abuse and opioid overdoses, it is wrong and irrational to cut  It really makes you wonder why anyone would support this bill. How does this bill help real people with real challenges?  At a healthcare rally in Los Angeles in January, I met a woman named Before the ACA, she had signed up for insurance just long enough to see a doctor, have a few tests done, and fill a prescription. Then she would realize she couldn't pay and couldn't afford to pay for the insurance beyond that. She said:       It's the worst feeling in the world to have to tell your      doctor--who is trying to make you well--that you cannot      afford the treatment prescribed.  Tonia told me:       Before the Affordable Care Act, living without health      coverage was a nightmare in this country.  She went on to say:       But that has all changed, and thanks to the ACA I can now      see a doctor when I need to, monitor my condition, and stay      healthy so that I can keep working and contribute to our      nation's economy. If the Republicans in Congress repeal the      law, I don't know what I will do.  I ask, How does the Republican healthcare plan help Tonia?  Another woman, Krista, told me:       I am married with four children, one of whom is a 10-year-     old type one diabetic. He requires daily active insulin      management to stay alive--24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  She went on to say:       Healthcare is not optional for us; even with health      insurance, diabetes management is the type of thing that can      bankrupt you. Without health insurance, I can't imagine. ACA      is a huge relief for my family.  I ask, How does this bill help Krista and her family?  Then, there is Rhett, in Marin More than 7 years ago, he was diagnosed with leukemia. Rhett is 9 years old. He says:       Cancer cells are the bad guys.  This is what he wrote me.       For 3\1/2\ years I took chemo to get the bad guys out. I      had more than one thousand doses of chemotherapy. . . . My      parents had to tell my sister that I might die of cancer.  And then he went on to write:       Thanks to my doctors and nurses, my family and friends, my      church and my community, and the Affordable Care Act . . .      now I'm Gone-with-the-I have a pre-existing      condition. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, my parents      don't worry about losing coverage.  A 9-year-old Rhett is showing us the way. How does this bill help Rhett?  I don't know the party affiliation of any of these folks. I don't know if they are I don't know if they are I don't know if they are I don't know if they are members of the Green I am not asking them those questions. I am asking them: How are you doing? What is helping you? What do you need? How will this impact you?  I know I am one of two Senators whom they have. When it comes to their needs and their need to be represented in the U.Congress and their need to be heard and their need to be seen, party affiliation should not matter. What should matter are the needs of the American people.  Regardless of whom they vote for in a partisan election, I am certain of this. This healthcare plan that is being proposed by my colleagues from across the aisle will not solve their problems. It will only create more problems and potentially devastate people's lives.  To my colleagues I say, this shouldn't be a matter of supporting this bill automatically if you are a Republican or objecting just because you are a Democrat; this is about what is right and what is wrong.[[Page S3582]]  If you know this bill is bad, stand up and stop it. Speak that truth. Now is not the time to keep quiet and hope nobody notices. Forget the politics. Forget partisan pressure and talk radio and primary ads. Instead, just listen to the voices of the American people, not just in California but in Nevada, in Arizona, in Ohio, in Alaska, in Maine, in Pennsylvania, in West Virginia because they have made themselves overwhelmingly clear. Only 20 percent of Americans support this bill.  A majority opposes it in every State in this country. It is the least popular piece of legislation in modern history. I am asking you to think about the American people. I am asking you to think about Think about Think about Rhett living with leukemia since he was just 2\1/2\ years old, undergoing 2\1/2\-hour infusions every night with such incredible bravery.  Let the determination of Americans like Rhett bring us together--a 9-year-old boy who tells us, in his words: ``Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act, Improve it!'' We all agree, the ACA can be improved. It must be improved. It isn't perfect. I am ready to work with anyone who really wants to make it better.  Instead of playing politics, instead of playing politics with public health and people's lives, we can actually work together to strengthen our healthcare system.  In fact, I am proud to have recently cosponsored a bill with Senator Dianne Feinstein and a number of my Democratic colleagues. Our bill would make it safer and easier for middle-class Americans to buy insurance if they currently don't qualify for any help paying their premiums.  These are the kinds of solutions Democrats can get behind. These are the kinds of solutions that would help and not hurt the people we represent. We took an oath to represent all the people. I am asking every Member of this Chamber to think long and hard about the consequences of this bill. Think about the responsibility we have been entrusted with.  We owe it to the American people to tell the truth, not to hide it. We owe it to the American people to solve real problems, not to manufacture new ones. We owe it to the American people to do the job we were sent here to do.  I urge my colleagues to vote down this bill and stand up for the people we represent and serve.  I yield back.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3573-2.txt,2026,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,19.0,May
6759,topic-id,1255,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my friend and colleague, Senator Shaheen, to discuss the stories and concerns we heard from our constituents in New Hampshire about how they would be hurt if TrumpCare becomes law.  Even though Republican leadership has delayed a vote on TrumpCare this week, we know that the fundamentals of what is wrong with TrumpCare will not change.  TrumpCare would force Granite Staters to pay more for worse insurance, all to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to corporate special interests--including Big Pharma--at the expense of hard-working Americans and the programs they rely on. This is the basic principle of TrumpCare, and it is unacceptable.  TrumpCare would be a disaster for people in New Granite Staters know this, and they have been standing up and speaking out against this dangerous bill.  As Senator Shaheen discussed, we held an emergency hearing last week in Concord to hear from our constituents about how TrumpCare would impact them. We held this emergency hearing at 2 p.m., on a Friday afternoon, in the summer, and with just a day's notice. Yet hundreds of people showed up.  Over 50 people shared their personal stories about the importance of healthcare, of how they have benefited from the important protections that are provided under current law--including maternity care, prescription drug coverage, and coverage for substance use disorder services--of the protections against insurance company[[Page S3815]]abuses, of Medicaid expansion, and of traditional They told us what their lives were like and why TrumpCare would be devastating to them and their families. I wish to share some of those stories today.  We heard from Ariel, from Rochester, NH, a mother who is benefitting from substance use disorder services that are included in Medicaid expansion and would be taken away under Ariel said:       I am a mother of 3 children and I have a substance abuse      disorder. I come from a long line of women who never had much      opportunity. With the opportunity to have Medicaid I have      been given the chance of treatment.       Without the chance of treatment I wouldn't have been taught      that there is a solution and a way to live a full, beautiful      life as a woman in recovery . . . as a mother of 3 beautiful      children. . . . As a woman of dignity and grace. . . .       If the opportunity of Medicaid is taken away, the chance of      positive change in this world is going to drastically drop. .      . . Women like me may never know a world outside of drug use      and hopelessness.  She goes on to say:       Today because of the opportunity of change, I am able to be      a positive role model to my children and most importantly our      future.  When we met Ariel, she was pregnant with that third child, and she went into labor immediately following our field hearing. She told us over the weekend that she had a healthy baby boy. Because of the treatment Ariel received through Medicaid, she is in a better position to take care of that new baby boy.  Our Medicaid Program is not only critical to providing key support to combat the substance misuse crisis, but, as Senator Shaheen mentioned, it also helps seniors and those who experience disabilities get the care they need--services that would be taken away under  This is something we heard from a Granite Stater named Jeff, who has a form of muscular dystrophy. Jeff said:       I am able to live a life that's independent in my own home,      pursuing my own career, only by virtue of the fact that I am      able to receive Medicaid services. Specifically, all this      discussion about private insurance is well and good, but I      think what some Senators aren't remembering or don't know is      that private insurance doesn't cover many of the types of      services that Medicaid does. . . . Especially personal care      services that allow us to live independently in our homes and      communities, which is where all of us would like to be, if      we're able to. So, I'm concerned about that.  He continued:       I'm concerned about the fact that my understanding is that      this bill would allow states to opt out of providing optional      Medicaid services, many of which are the waiver programs here      in the state that frankly are so vital to folks with physical      disabilities, developmental disabilities, acquired brain      injuries, and all sorts of other conditions. So that part      concerns me.  Medicaid coverage makes it possible for Jeff and so many others to work and participate in their communities. Jeff also said that he was concerned about the fact that TrumpCare cuts and caps Medicaid, which we know is really just code for massive cuts that would force States to choose between slashing benefits, reducing the number of people who can get care, or both.  Senator Shaheen and I also heard from several Granite Staters who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act and who are concerned that TrumpCare would reduce the care they receive while raising their costs. One of these people was Enna, from Exeter, Enna said:       I am self-employed and purchase health insurance through      the Marketplace here in New The ACA had given me      the opportunity to purchase affordable health insurance for      myself and my family of four.  She explained:       We were unable to maintain insurance consistently prior to      the ACA, and even when we did have it, critical preventative      care--for myself, as a woman--was not covered by our previous      policy.  She said this about TrumpCare:       [It] would make our health coverage less comprehensive and      less affordable. I am certain that our risk of financial and/     or health catastrophe would be significantly greater [under      TrumpCare].  There is no doubt that we should all be working together in order to improve the Affordable Care Act, build on the progress we have made, and lower healthcare costs for all of our citizens. I am willing to work with any of my colleagues on bipartisan solutions in order to make that happen, but we know that TrumpCare is not the answer. While my Republican colleagues have delayed a vote on this bill, no one believes that TrumpCare is dead yet.  I am going to continue to share the stories of Granite Staters who would have to pay more money for less care under I will keep working to ensure that TrumpCare never becomes law. I urge my colleagues to take the time to listen to their constituents who would be hurt under  The people of New Hampshire have been so brave. They have come forward, and they have talked about their most personal, difficult, and challenging experiences. They have laid themselves bare before the rest of us so we could understand what they have gone through and so we could understand that if we are not committed to a healthcare system in which every American--citizens in a democracy--have meaningful, truly affordable access to the type of care that each of us would want for our own family, then we are not doing our job as a democracy at all.  We need to protect and defend what we have, and, then, we need to improve what we have. We need to come together and make sure that healthcare is truly available to every one of us, so that we can be healthy and productive and so that we can lead together.

6870,topic-id,1437,"Mr.President, the final pieces of ObamaCare were signed into law a little over 7 years ago. Since that time, Republicans--not just in Congress but throughout the country--have been united in their opposition to the law and our commitment to repeal it. This hasn't been simply a political or partisan endeavor. We are not just trying to take a notch out of President Obama's ``win'' column. The simple truth is that ObamaCare is not working.  The law was poorly written, and the system it created was poorly designed. Even a number of ObamaCare supporters have come to acknowledge that it hasn't been working the way it was promised to work. As a result, millions of Americans have suffered astronomical increases in their health insurance premiums and fewer and fewer insurance options to choose from. That is ObamaCare's great irony: The law requires people to buy health insurance while also making it impossible to do so.  For 7\1/2\ years, Republicans have fought to expose the failures of ObamaCare and have pledged time and time again to repeal it. Every single Republican Member of the Senate has expressed support for repealing Most of us have made promises to our constituents to do just that. And those promises, coupled with the obvious failures of ObamaCare, are a big reason why we now find ourselves in control of both Chambers of Congress and the  For the last 6 months, Republicans have worked in good faith to find a path forward to both repeal and replace The released discussion drafts attempted to bridge the divide between our more conservative and moderate Members, so the products were never going to be perfect. Such is the inherent nature of compromise. The draft released last week included additions to address Member priorities and was likely the best chance we had at a compromise bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare with significant entitlement reform. But last night a handful of our Members announced they would not support the compromise bill, even though it would have repealed ObamaCare's taxes, reformed Medicaid by putting it on a sustainable path for future generations, and included the largest pro-life protections on Federal spending I have ever seen.  This was the opportunity we had been working toward. All we had to do was come together and compromise, and 7\1/2\ years of promises would have been much, much closer to being fulfilled. But last night we blinked. And, frankly, I think the Members who opted to scuttle the compromise bill will eventually have to explain to their constituents why they left so many ObamaCare fixes on the table and walked away from this historic opportunity.  So where does that leave us? The majority leader has announced his intention to shelve the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare with a single piece of legislation. Instead, the Senate will move forward to vote on legislation to simply repeal ObamaCare, with a 2-year delay. So, long story short, we have one more chance to do what we have all said we wanted to do.  I am aware that some Members have already expressed their skepticism, if not their opposition, to this approach. I hope they will take the time to reconsider. As Senators contemplate this path, they should keep in mind that the upcoming vote is not about the next 2 years, nor is it about the past 6 months. We are not going to be voting to approve a specific process for drafting and enacting an ObamaCare replacement, and we are not voting to approve the way this effort has moved forward during this  I know some of our colleagues have doubts about the path forward. Others have complaints about the path that got us here. But this vote, in my view, will simply be about whether we intend to live up to our promises. Do we want to repeal ObamaCare, or are we fine with leaving it in place? That is the question we have to ask ourselves.  Keep in mind, the vast majority of Republican Senators are already on record having voted 2 years ago in favor of a full ObamaCare repeal with a 2-year delay. Of course, in 2015, we knew that the President would veto that legislation, and we now know that the current occupant of the White House would surely sign it. That is really the only difference between then and now. Was the vote in 2015 just a political stunt? Was it just pure partisanship? I know some of our Democratic colleagues claim that was the case. Were they right? I sure hope not. On the contrary, I sincerely hope that any Member of the Senate who voted for the 2015 bill and who has spent the last 7\1/2\ years pledging to repeal ObamaCare hasn't suddenly decided to change his or her position now that the vote has a chance to actually matter.  If we vote to pass a full repeal, will we be solving all of our healthcare problems with a single vote? Certainly not. But that was never going to be the case. Anyone who thought repealing and replacing ObamaCare would be easy once we had the votes was likely not paying attention to the problems plaguing our healthcare system. However, if we act now to pass the full repeal, we will be taking significant steps toward accomplishing our goal and keeping our promises.  If we pass up yet another opportunity, if we can't muster the votes to pass something we have already passed, I have a hard time believing we will get another shot to fulfill our promise and repeal this unworkable law anytime soon. What does that mean? Among other things, it means a congressional bailout of failing insurance markets, probably before the end of 2017. Frankly, that ship may have sailed on that one after last night's developments. We are probably looking at an insurance bailout one way or another. Those who will be interested in moving an insurance bailout later this year should be ready to explain how they want to pay for it.  Failure would also mean premiums will continue to skyrocket and people will be left with few, if any, available insurance options, even though they[[Page S4039]]will still face penalties if they don't make a purchase. It would mean that the ObamaCare taxes and mandates remain in place, and it would keep Medicaid expansion on the books indefinitely, most certainly creating a scenario for Governors to advocate for the Federal Government to continue paying close to 100 percent of the share for able-bodied adults.  We already know what happens if we leave ObamaCare in place. That scenario is playing out before our very eyes. That downward spiral of broken promises--the one the American people have to deal with every day--is the reason we have all committed to repealing  Don't get me wrong. I wish the path that got us to this point had been easier, with less melodrama and acrimony. To be honest, I wish we had simply moved to this full repeal strategy at the outset because, as I noted several times earlier in this year, it is probably the most feasible path forward if we want to achieve our goals.  It would be nice if things had gone differently. But this is where we are, with only 52 Republicans in the Senate and a minority that from the beginning has wanted no part of this process.  Right now, we have essentially two choices. We can keep talking about repealing ObamaCare and wishing for a better future, one with more Republican votes or more Democrats willing to acknowledge the reality, or we can press forward with the numbers we have and make good on the commitments we have made to the American people.  To quote the old Scottish nursery rhyme, if wishes were horses, then beggars would ride. Translation: More talking and more wishing will not get us anywhere.  We can either take a significant step forward to undo ObamaCare's mandates and taxes, which have collectively wreaked havoc on our healthcare system, or we can dither about some more and leave them in place for the foreseeable future. In my view, the choice is an easy one.  I urge all of my colleagues to once again vote with me to repeal We have blown a number of opportunities already in recent weeks. Last night, we blew a big one. I hope we can avoid doing the same with this upcoming vote. If not, we will have to answer to the American people and explain to them why we failed.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgS4038-3.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,18.0,May

6769,topic-id,757,"Mr.President, one of the things that the healthcare law changes here have demonstrated is that partisanship in Congress has reached a new high--or I would say a new low. I am tired of reading about who is to blame for what, and I know Americans and North Dakotans are too. Most importantly, it certainly doesn't do anything to help American families' healthcare get any better.  We should all want to improve our healthcare system so it works better for families and for businesses. It should be a bipartisan discussion, not a political exercise. I am here, as are many of my colleagues, because that is what we hope to accomplish.  For years, I have been offering reasonable reforms to make the current health reform law work better. I want such reforms to be bipartisan. I want to have a larger conversation about healthcare in this country. But the Republican Senate bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, is simply not the way to have those discussions. Frankly, this bill is a nonstarter.  I have heard from so many North Dakota children with disabilities, seniors in nursing homes, men and women with preexisting conditions in my State, and hospitals, doctors, and nurses, especially in rural communities, who are deeply concerned--in fact, I can tell you, deeply panicked--about how this bill would make care less available and less affordable.  There are commonsense actions we can and should take right now to make sure American families aren't hurt in the near term. That is why we are here today.  Action and uncertainty caused by the administration, as well as House Republicans, exacerbated instability in the insurance markets, threatening significant cost increases for consumers in 2018. The administration has been unwilling to commit funding for cost-sharing reduction payments, and some Republicans have been working to dismantle the health reform law by not funding critical reinsurance programs. These actions make it extraordinarily difficult for insurers to plan and make business decisions for 2018--yes, 2018, the year we are talking about today. If insurers can't rely on these funds to support healthcare programs that make it possible for health insurance costs to remain affordable for families, the health insurance premium filings for the next term year will reflect that uncertainty. Health insurance rates for 2018 that have already been filed in some of our States demonstrate that fact.  Let's talk about the facts. Independent reports from the Congressional Budget Office and Standard & Poor's have said that the insurance markets were expected to stabilize this year and could stabilize this year unless the administration causes disruption. If you look at the numbers from last year, you will see that health plans were offered in every county in this country.  Today, we are here to offer a few bills that will make an immediate and real difference for families to address health insurance rate increases that we expect in 2018. These are commonsense bills that should be bipartisan.  We hope our colleagues across the aisle will work with us in a bipartisan way so we can provide immediate relief and guarantee stability for the individual market--stability that will enable individuals and families in all of our States to avoid serious increases in their health insurance rates.  No family should face bankruptcy to cover their healthcare costs because in Washington, DC, we can't implement the bill that we have and instead continue to stall and play the game of politics against the interests of the American people and, certainly in many cases, some of sickest among us and people who have a whole lot of healthcare insecurity. This is politics. We cannot continue to play politics with people's health.  Some of the issues we are working to address were included, interestingly enough, in the Senate healthcare bill--a clear acknowledgment from the Republicans that these changes are necessary for the health market to function in 2018.  Right now, we are standing here because time is of the essence. I hope our colleagues will join us in this effort. We want to work with them. We hope they will work with us. We hope we can at least at a minimum get together and solve the problem for 2018 while we are debating the future of healthcare delivery in this country.  I will call on my friend, the great Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, to offer what I think is a terrific idea and to talk about a bill on which I am a cosponsor.

6782,topic-id,1422,"Mr.President, I wish to make some concluding remarks.  1, I share the concerns that Senator Barrasso expressed. I hear from ranch families and I hear from farm families about the unaffordability of their healthcare premiums. I hear about high deductibles. I hear about how what has happened in the health insurance market has made it more difficult for them to cover their families. I hear that.  We have solutions we have been talking about that could lower those costs. I would include dealing with people with chronic conditions. Reports from the RAND Commission tell us that 12 percent of the people in this country who have five or more chronic conditions cost the healthcare system over 40 percent. Some of those people are on the exchanges, and when they are on the exchanges, that drives the healthcare costs up.  But I have a question. I have a question for people who are advancing the Republican healthcare bill: Why do you have to give the richest Americans in this country a tremendous tax break to solve that problem? How does giving the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers in this[[Page S3827]]country over a $250,000 a year tax break--how does that fix the problem for my ranchers? How does that fix the problem for my farm families? You know the honest answer: It doesn't.  I need to understand how taking billions of dollars out of the Medicaid system, driving sicker, older people who tend to be in the Medicaid population onto the exchanges into the individual marketplace--how does that help that farm family we talk about almost every week on the floor of the Senate, that farm family, that individual who is paying excess premiums? It does nothing for them.  This is all some smoke-and-mirrors deal. What we have done today--almost 15 of us have come to the floor, and what we are saying is: Let's fix the problems. We can all acknowledge that we have a healthcare system where really sick people have a hard time finding affordability. When you put really sick people into an insurance pool, it drives up the cost for everyone. How do we manage that? The insurance industry tells me the average time on the individual exchange is 10 months. How do you take someone with five chronic conditions and manage them in a 10-month plan? You know what, you don't. So they hop from plan to plan, costing more and more.  If you want to reduce costs, you have to figure out how we can better treat the sickest among us. Until we do that, we will not achieve the common goal, which is reducing and bending the costs of healthcare in this country. We cannot achieve that goal. When all we are doing is saying: No, we don't want to pay, we are going to make the States pay or we are going to make people on the individual exchange pay or we are going to make people do what they have done before, which is not have coverage and put them into uncompensated care, that will not solve the problem.  We have some great examples here for the immediate concern that we have about the premiums that are going to be expressed. In some ways, this reflects concerns about the increased costs of healthcare and what is happening in that individual market, but it is being driven by the failure to fulfill the statutory obligation--reinsurance, cost sharing.  I do have to point out that I found it interesting that the objection to Senator Shaheen's bill was that, oh, we haven't had time to take a look at it, haven't had time to even considering this cost-sharing issue. Really?  This is the last page of the Republican bill, page 145, stating in section 208, ``Funding for Cost-Sharing Payments.'' I will give you, it is a different schedule, different formula in the Shaheen bill, but this is not a new concept. If we wanted today to give the insurance industry the certainty they needed that would make sure that the premium increases reflected not uncertainty but reflected actual costs, we would do this: We would take up Jeanne's bill. The very bill that the Republicans have advanced says, ``There is appropriated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums that may be necessary for payments for cost-sharing reductions authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (including adjustments to any prior obligations).''  The same provision was in the House bill. How can it be objectionable to have a debate about a provision that has been advanced in both Republican bills? How can that be objectionable when so much is riding on that, when the healthcare and availability of insurance to our families is riding on making sure we at least have some kind of stopgap measures in the exchanges that will guarantee a stability that will make insurance available.  If we don't know what is going to happen with those counties--we know we have huge counties that don't even have uninsured in them. Senator McCaskill offered an opportunity. Guess what. How about they get their insurance where our staff get our insurance or some among us get our insurance? That is objected to because it is some kind of Washington solution.  What is ironic about that is that provision that made Senate staff in our home States get their health insurance on the DC exchange came from Senator Grassley during the debate on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, not a Democratic idea. It was a Republican idea and certainly something that bears at least a discussion, certainly something that ought to be talked about here.  Let's not pretend there has been an outreach to people on the Democratic side. Today the Democratic leader offered to go to Blair House, offered to bring people together at Blair House, have a sitdown on healthcare, offered to go to the Senate--the Old Senate Chamber, no cameras, let's talk about healthcare. What we get is: You are not serious.  I want you to know I am dead serious about sitting down and trying to fashion a healthcare plan that actually fixes the problems we have right now in affordability of health insurance.  When someone says, well, you have to accept tax breaks as part of that for the richest Americans, think about this: 400 Americans will get a tax break under the Republican bill--400. Just 400 Americans will get a tax break under the Republican bill, equal to what it would cost for Medicaid expansion in four  Make no mistake, this is not healthcare reform we are talking about. That bill is not healthcare reform. It is entitlement reform in Medicaid, shifting costs to States and patients. It is tax reform, making sure the wealthiest among us get a tax break.  If we want to talk about healthcare reform, if we want to talk about fixing the ACA, let's not throw out what is working. Let's make sure we are fixing and addressing the problems that we here express every day that come in our mail and that we know we have to address in order to make the system fair; that is, younger, healthier people need a break. They need to find an affordable product.  How are we going to do that? We have seen ideas here today, ideas that could take care of--even if we just made them temporary, even if we said this is only going to be there until 2019, we could stabilize all of this today and begin that today, but yet it is objected to.  I think the message we want to send is we stand ready to fix the healthcare system. We stand ready to work with the other side of the aisle. We stand ready to address the concerns we hear from our constituents about the healthcare system.  If we really want to respond to the concerns the American public has about the U.Congress, we better start working together. We better start finding a path forward to solve problems, real problems, not pretend problems but real problems in this country. That way we will, in fact, enrich and enhance our democracy.

6821,topic-id,2264,"Mr.President, I thank my good friend the Senator from She just exists to the east of me. We share a common border, but we also share a common belief that Washington is not devoid of ideas. Somehow, it has just lost the capacity to bring those ideas to fruition. As my great friend the Senator from Minnesota can attest, there are hundreds--[[Page S3312]]and probably thousands--of great ideas for small business, for workers, for improving the economic conditions of people in this country that are here, ready for debate, and ready for passage.  What is not a formula for success for America is the budget. The President's budget would devastate rural communities. I am not given to hyperbole, and I am not given to exaggeration, but the absolute, bare fact is that this budget will decimate economic opportunity not only for American agriculture but for economic opportunity and security for rural communities.  When we think about North Dakota, it is hard to imagine a State that most of the people in this country would imagine more equated with rural I tease Amy many times when I tell her: Oh, it is coming up from the Cities, because our big opportunity to travel and to see the sites of the big city really is Minneapolis and But a lot of Minnesota--a lot of western Minnesota in particular, the area that I know about--is engaged in agriculture, and we share a common border, but we share a common purpose.  I wanted to start off by saying that in North Dakota, we understand the value of rural communities. We understand the value of investing in agriculture and infrastructure and how important those things are to boosting our local economy. We see the direct impacts of it on our families, businesses, and towns.  Most of us--me included--come from towns of fewer than 100 people. In fact, I am proud to say that growing up, there were nine people in my family, and my family was one-tenth of the population of the small town I lived in. We are proud of that. We are proud of our rural roots, and we are proud that from those life experiences growing up, we learned a lot about compromise, we learned a lot about work ethic, and we learned a lot about the importance of community and working together.  We also learned a lot about the importance of investment. Without critical investment, our rural communities are at risk, and I think that could have dramatic and drastic ramifications for our State, our counties, our families, and our neighbors. Instead of lifting up rural communities, the Presidential budget pushes us down.  Rural communities and the jobs there--including agriculture--are vital to many of the families I know but really families across the country. There are over 30,000 farmers and ranchers in North Dakota who lead the country in producing spring wheat, durum, sunflowers, canola, dry edible beans, flax, honey, and many more specialty crops and grain crops. These farmers feed North Dakota, our country, and the world.  In 2015, agriculture contributed more than $9.1 billion to my State's economy. That may not seem like a lot when we are talking about California, but that is a huge amount when we are talking about North  About one-third of North Dakota's jobs are directly tied to agriculture. There are implement dealers, veterinarians, agriculture retailers, and many more who are closely associated with agribusiness. There are countless other jobs that support these rural communities, such as teachers, firefighters, police officers, and more.  Since the election, there has been a great deal of talk in Washington about rural I think rural America reared up its head in this past election and said ``We are not to be forgotten'' and they believed they had secured an advocate in Washington in this current administration, only to be basically told otherwise by a Presidential budget.  So what does the budget mean, and why should we pay attention to it? I think the first thing we need to know about a budget is that it is about priorities. It is really a values document. Unfortunately, the President's budget shows that the administration doesn't value North Dakota or really, in fact, rural In fact, it targets both.  Today I want to talk a little bit more specifically about how devastating this budget would be for rural communities across my State and across the country.  This budget would slash USDA's budget by over 21 percent, cutting $231 billion from funding from the farm bill over the next decade. It would specifically cut $29 billion--$29 billion--from crop insurance over the next decade. This is crop insurance our farmers rely on, especially at a time of challenging weather and low commodity prices. Crop insurance helps prevent family farms from going under when disaster strikes. Without an affordable crop insurance program, a drought or a flood could wipe out the wealth of an entire family and basically bankrupt a family farm.  When ranchers and farmers do well, North Dakota does well, and so will all the rest of the country. To challenge these farmers with a crop insurance program that will be nonexistent is to take away the opportunity for food security in this country--food security that is so closely linked and important to national security.  By drastically reducing field staff, the President's budget also prevents USDA from achieving its mission to support rural communities. The budget calls for reducing staffing levels at USDA by 5,200 employees. Nearly 2,500 of those employees are with the Farm Service Agency, Rural Development, and Natural What does that mean? The Farm Service Agency's caseloads have increased in North Dakota, and the current hiring ban has hampered efforts to administer the farm programs--those efforts which are critical to farmers as they make their business decisions.  I can't tell my colleagues the number of times farmers across my State have come up to me and said how grateful they are that the Farm Service Agency is available in their county and available to them to provide advice and much needed documentation on their decisionmaking on how they are going to implement the farm program.  In fact, I tease those farmers a little bit, because they always say: You know, that Farm Service gal--usually a woman who has been with the Agency over decades and knows that farm as well as that farmer, and when that farmer walks through the door to get that advice and to get that number, they know that not only do they have a friend sitting across the table from them--probably a neighbor--they also have an advocate sitting across the table. We don't want to lose that connection to this vital service, the Farm Service Agency, by making this about picking up the phone and pressing buttons and talking to someone who would barely even understand or even know North Dakota or the county the farmer is in. So at a time when farmers and ranchers are already experiencing low commodity prices, these cuts to the Farm Service Agency would limit the ability of that Agency to provide timely, accurate, and useful services to our family farmers and our ranchers.  The budget would create huge challenges for rural healthcare. On top of the $800-plus billion taken out of the Medicaid Program by the Republican healthcare bill, this budget would also cut $610 billion from Medicaid by reducing it to a block grant program.  Medicaid is a lifesaving, cost-effective program that enables more than 90,000 seniors, individuals and children with disabilities, and low-income families to get affordable, quality care.  I want my colleagues to think about the enormous challenge of delivering healthcare in a sparsely populated area. One of the challenges my rural healthcare providers have not had in the last many years since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is uncompensated care. But when we go back to uncompensated care, on top of operating on razor-thin margins, we are now going to say that not only are you operating on razor-thin margins, but you are not going to have your bills paid, making it impossible for you to meet payroll and impossible for you to continue to provide these resources.  So we have real challenges in rural healthcare as a result of this budget and the Republican proposal.  The President's budget also cuts nearly $400 million in Federal funds for substance abuse prevention and behavioral health workforce training programs at the same time that every part of this country--particularly rural parts of our country--is facing opioid abuse. In North Dakota alone, fatalities from opioid abuse have grown 125 percent.  I met just yesterday with the North Dakota Medical Association, which told me that every day this week in Fargo, ND, there has been a death as a[[Page S3313]]result of overdoses. It is hard to imagine that is happening in our rural communities in places like North Dakota, but it is.  I talked to a healthcare provider in Dickinson, ND, who told me that while his average percentage of Medicaid recipients in his hospital is about 15 to 20 percent, as it relates to opioids and behavior and mental health, it is well over 60, bordering on 70 percent. So the population, without Medicaid dollars, would not be able to get important rehabilitation and treatment services.  Last week, I also visited one of our rural airports that are dependent on the Essential Air That is absolutely critical to maintaining air service in Jamestown, in Devil's Lake, and now in Dickinson, which has gone back to Essential Air Service after years of not needing that support because of the growth in the Bakken oilfield.  Last week, while talking to the folks in Dickinson, they told me there are 475 jobs which are dependent on the airport, which helped generate $76.6 million for the area in 2015. The Dickinson Airport would receive about $4.2 million in assistance from the Essential Air Service each year, but when we look at how that investment pays off in terms of dividends, it seems like a small price to pay.  It would eliminate funding to protect water programs and infrastructure in rural areas which have improved water and wastewater systems for more than 40 North Dakota towns, Tribal reservations, and water districts since 2010.  This budget would also eliminate the Community Development Block Grant Program, which helped the State of North Dakota improve housing conditions for low- and moderate-income families with $4.9 million in investments in 2016.  It would eliminate the Economic Development Administration, which has provided over $34 million in investments since 2009 to local economic development organizations in North Dakota, particularly those in rural towns.  The list goes on and on and on. We haven't talked about the reduction in services for export markets. We haven't talked about research reductions at USDA and what that would mean. We haven't talked about eliminating trade assistance. All of these things have huge consequences for large pieces of the United States of  What I would say to the administration is that rural America expects better. Rural America thought they were going to get better than this. Rural America has enough challenges. We have volatile commodity prices, healthcare shortages, declining populations, and I will tell my colleagues that today in North Dakota, there is a potential disaster from drought. The President's budget would not only not help rural America thrive, it would only make matters worse.  Rather than taking an ax to proven, successful programs that strengthen our rural communities, we need strong investments in rural communities, jobs, and families, that help support North Dakota's future.  With this budget, the administration's priorities are clear for everyone to see. It is now Congress's job to set spending priorities and fund programs in rural America to a level so that we know rural America can not only survive but can thrive.  North Dakota needs and deserves a strong voice at the table. I will make sure that we tell the story of all of these programs, that we tell the story of how critically important these programs are to maintaining our opportunity to produce food in our country but also to raise our children in rural settings. It is beyond belief to me that we are in this situation given the level of support that rural America provided to this administration and to this President during the last election.  We know we can do better, and we will do better. We know we can't waste money. We know we have to deploy these valuable resources in ways that actually produce results. I can show my colleagues result after result after result and the importance of providing these services so that rural communities can thrive.  I will close with this: A little-known fact is that so many of our rural communities today are the most impoverished places in When people think of poverty, they think of inner city poverty, they think of other pieces of America they have seen, but we know that the rates of poverty, the rates of challenges in terms of healthcare, education--those challenges are much greater in rural The last thing we need to do is saddle rural America with a 500-pound rock, put it on their backs, and still expect them to thrive. This budget is a 500-pound rock on the backs of our farmers who work every day to put food on their table, but more importantly, work every day to feed  With that, I yield the floor and turn it back to my friend from the State of  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgS3303-4.txt,2174,ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY AND FOREST PROTECTION ACT,2017.0,7.0,May
6881,topic-id,2493,"Mr.President, I think that anyone who picked up the Wall Street Journal over the last couple of weeks and read the stories about Indian health and what is happening, especially in our region of the world in the Great Plains--it shocked the conscience. It should have resulted in a prolonged level of outrage that would bring us all together.  Unfortunately, we have seen this movie one too many times. Things happen where we see national stories about challenges in Indian Country, about the failure to fulfill commitments under treaty rights. We see despair. We see the incredible rates of poverty, the incredible rates of unemployment, even in a State like ours where unemployment rates are never the issue. We wonder, why isn't something being done? Guess who wasn't shocked. Those of us who serve on the Indian Affairs  We on the committee spent a lot of time looking at this last year, trying to figure out how we could engage the bureaucracy to be more responsive and more responsible and how we could look at sourcing the dollars we needed to make sure that Indian health was supplemented and that the level of care we expect when we walk into our hospitals--that that is the level of care Native American people who go to the Indian Health Service on their reservations and who might go to an Indian run, a Tribal run facility, would expect. That is what we expect, and I think that is what the American public might think is actually going on, but those of us on the committee know differently.  We held a roundtable today to talk about what those challenges are, what Native American leaders believe are those challenges, and to ask them a simple question: What has Medicaid expansion meant to your Tribes? What does access to Medicare and Medicaid mean for delivery of healthcare services?  I want to start off by saying that they have a lot of great ideas, and I will run through some of these.  Chairman Keplin from Turtle Mountain said: We need local doctors. It is hard to get people to live on the reservation if they are not from the reservation, so we need to figure out how we are going to get local folks to be trained, and we are willing to do that in our Tribal colleges. We need to build relationships with other healthcare providers, like Sanford, that can bring specialists. We need our cancer infusion center to be there so that people can get cancer treatment right at home. And we need to make sure we are doing everything we can to make sure we can treat diabetes right there at home.  So the healthcare challenges were amazing, but the cost challenges were also amazing.  Duane from Pueblo in New Mexico had some very interesting perspectives. Eighty percent of his patient load comes to the clinic. They speak their Native language. They have had stability in their workforce, but they are looking at transitioning to a Tribal facility. But those people don't want to transition because of Federal retirement. So is there something we can do to keep these treasured healthcare providers working for the Tribe and working for their people--the people who know the language and who are familiar with the case studies?[[Page S4046]]  Lincoln from Alaska said: One of our biggest problems is year-to-year funding. The VA has 2-year funding. We don't know what the money is going to be and when it is going to come. We also need to train local people.  Sam said: We have a huge need to continue to build out our cultural resources and our attention to culture and prevention.  Ron from Washington talked a lot about the recruitment of workforce. The employer mandate came up because so much of the employment on the reservations is in fact Tribal members. They are talking about that they are mandated to buy this health insurance, but these same members have a treaty right to that healthcare. Is there a way to help those stretched Tribal resources go a little further by taking a look at some relief from the employer mandate?  The definition of what constitutes an Indian came up over and over.  From Massachusetts, Cheryl talked about permanent reauthorization of Indian healthcare and more resources in diabetes, because that is a pervasive problem, and Indian employment, again, talking about that issue of buying health insurance.  As to marketplace access for Native American enrollees who are not living on the reservation, how do they make sure they are able to get their treaty rights?  Talking about mental well-being and talking about culture is prevention. One of my favorite lines that came out of this was when we asked about prevention, and Ashley said: Culture is prevention. We need better access to 1115 waivers. Take a look at the Canadian model, she suggested. They do more with cultural sensitivity.  The list goes on and on of great ideas. Not one of these ideas said: Repeal the Affordable Care Not one of them said: Let's get rid of Medicaid expansion; let's not look at what we can do.  Let's just all acknowledge what we who serve on this committee know: We have challenges that far exceed many other populations. We have come to the floor to talk about how the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and how the Republican healthcare bill would hurt different populations. We have talked about the elderly. We have talked about children with disabilities. We have talked about rural communities. We have talked about many, many more folks. I think we haven't done enough to talk about what this means for Indian people.  We have a special relationship with Indian people in my State because every Tribe in my State is, in fact, a treaty Tribe with a treaty right to healthcare.  Last night, it obviously became clear that the bill, as it stands, wouldn't get enough votes to move forward. But we need to keep talking about this bill, and we need to keep talking about what the questions are. Instead of talking about this bill or that bill or all of the acronyms, let's start with healthcare. Let's have a conversation about healthcare that starts with healthcare. Where are we doing it right? Where are we doing it wrong? How can we reduce costs? Who is being left behind?  It is clear to me that in the healthcare world--never mind the Affordable Care Act or the Better Care Act, whatever the Republican bill was called. That is a discussion for politics. That is not a discussion for healthcare. So let's talk about what Native Americans need. Let's talk about how we have failed.  As I said earlier today, Senator Udall led a really important discussion about how we need to preserve When we look at the Indian Health Service, I think anyone who really looks at the numbers has to admit that it is chronically underfunded.  Last year, I brought the former IHS Director to North Dakota to press her on maintaining quality care in our Tribal communities. This was especially important because of the severe challenges Indian healthcare has. We know that the lack of funding for Indian healthcare can be critically augmented by three main sources: Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance. If every person walking in has the ability to pay, we are going to improve access to care, and we are going to improve the opportunity to recruit a workforce.  I think some people may roll their eyes when they say: Don't get sick in My husband is a family physician and practices about 60 miles north of the Standing Rock Sioux He can tell you that there have been times when people from the reservation have come to the clinic to see him because the clinic in Fort Yates is shuttered--no money that day, no opportunity for healthcare. So people come to get the healthcare they need, but they have to drive a long way. It is wrong. You see a new doctor whom you have never seen before and who may not, in fact, understand your condition.  So the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, who are represented today, have over 33,000 enrolled members, of which approximately 14,500 actively receive treatment and benefits for services at the local IHS hospital. Thanks to Medicaid expansion and increased enrollment efforts by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in my State of North Dakota, their Indian Health Service hospital is now able to offer so much more in services to their people and increase their outreach and prevention.  In June alone, Turtle Mountain's IHS clinic served nearly 13,000 clinical patients and provided over 1,000 emergency room services. Third-party billing revenue has now allowed the Tribes to make renovations to their emergency room and their clinic, to purchase new medical equipment, including neonatal monitors, to recruit and hire additional staff, including licensed professionals, to increase staff training and education, to provide Wi-Fi throughout the hospital, and to expand their behavioral healthcare facility to serve more patients.  Since the Medicaid expansion, they have had a 9-percent increase in the number of individuals they have served. Their hospital is also experiencing a decrease in the number of uninsured patients--still too high, in my opinion, at 39 percent. We can get that lower if we get more people to take advantage of Medicaid expansion.  But, unfortunately, a Republican healthcare plan that would eliminate cost-sharing subsidies is making that private health insurance less affordable and less successful.  So let's be honest about how we are affecting our Native American population and talk about the multiple times this expansion has been so important to our Native families.  In North Dakota, the Republican bill would cause an estimated 984 Native Americans to lose cost-sharing reduction subsidies. The Senate Republican healthcare bill would also get rid of the Medicaid expansion and cap the amount of Federal funding States can get to cover those on traditional As a result, it would drastically reduce the amount of Medicaid funding going to the This would push the remaining costs to the States and counties that can't afford it.  The American Hospital Association estimates that North Dakota Medicaid would lose $1.2 billion. I will say that again. North Dakota Medicaid would lose $1.2 billion through 2026.  Right now, 9,000 North Dakota children and individuals with disabilities--Native Americans, seniors, and low-income families--rely on Medicaid for affordable, quality care, but this bill would rip it away in so many wrong ways.  The uninsured rate for Native Americans has fallen nationally from 24 percent to 15 percent, largely due to Medicaid expansion.  We go on and on. Currently, Medicaid accounts for 24 percent of the Indian Health Service workforce. The Senate Republican bill would strip away $772 billion from Medicaid, and the White House proposes cutting an already underfunded Indian Health Service budget by 6 percent.  We already know that the per-patient cost in the Indian healthcare system is greatly below that of Medicaid reimbursement cost, on average. So if we take away Medicaid reimbursement, we are hurting not only the providers, but we are once again making healthcare less affordable.  This is a crisis. I can't begin to tell the Members of this body what a crisis Indian healthcare is in. We have known it on the committee for many, many years. In fact, Senator Dorgan was the first one to really sound the alarm of the crisis in the Great Plains area,[[Page S4047]]thinking that a report that was so damaging would result in change. Guess what. It didn't. It didn't result in change. But the one thing we can point to that is a bright shining light has been access to Medicaid dollars. It has given them access to capital expenditure, and it has given them access to workforce. It has given a more consistent way for people who don't live on the reservations to get healthcare.  I have said this many, many times: We need to not go backward; we need to go forward. When people say: We are going to take a step back, we are going to reduce actual appropriations by 6 percent for Indian health, and we are going to eliminate Medicaid expansion, I say: You had better look before you take a step backward because you might be off the cliff. That is how dire it is in Indian  The one thing I am going to conclude with is that for many, many years in healthcare we have not done what we need to do to consult with Tribal people: Here is the facility; this is what we are going to provide. Good luck. One size fits all.  What we need to do and what Medicaid has allowed is that flexibility for Tribes to engage, for Tribal people to engage in what their needs are, and to take a look at those community health models that do dental care, eye care, and mental health and addiction counseling. All of this needs to be wrapped up. When people say there is no hope, there certainly is no hope without help.  There is an old saying: When you have your health, you have everything. I can tell you from personal experience that it is absolutely true. You could be the richest man in the world, but if you don't have good health, your quality of life is not what it could be.  When we look across the indicators of what has happened in Indian health with indigenous people throughout our country, when we know this is our obligation--this is that treaty obligation, the treaty right that has been bargained for--shame on us.  Medicaid can be that bridge. It can be the bridge to better healthcare. That is why it is so critical, Mr.President and my vice chairman, that we be out here speaking for our communities, speaking for these unique groups of folks who depend so much on Medicaid expansion but who also depend on us to do a better job, to be better stewards of that relationship, to be better citizens as it relates to living up to the obligations that our ancestors negotiated.  I ask everybody who hasn't really been exposed to this issue to read the articles in the Wall Street But don't just read them and wring your hands and say: This is horrible. Take a step to change the outcome. Don't just read them and say: Boy, that is horrible. Take responsibility for what you read. Every one of us in the Senate and in the Congress is responsible for fulfilling the obligations of these treaties. When we aren't doing it, it is a failure on every one of us, and it is a failure to protect some of the most vulnerable people in our country--and that is Native American children.

One of my very favorite--maybe my most favorite--of spectator sports is, of all things, girls' softball.  Now, a lot of people don't even know anything about the sport. It is pretty incredible.

This is where the Big 12 Softball Championship and the Women's College World Series are held.  This past May, the Sooners won the championship game at the Big 12 softball tournament between Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, which also has a great team, at this impressive stadium. The Sooners won.  Then, on June 6, they became the 2017 Women's College World Series national champions in Oklahoma  After facing diversity in the earlier game against North Dakota State in the NCAA regionals, the Sooners proceeded to win 11 consecutive games--think about that, 11 consecutive games--ultimately achieving a 5-to-4 victory over the University of Florida  In the first game of the championship series, Oklahoma outlasted Florida in a recordbreaking--I was here; we were actually in session at that time--17 innings. It went until 3 o'clock in the morning. Of course, we won. It was the longest game in the history of women's college series of all time.  This win is the women's softball team's second consecutive national championship and the third in the last 5 years. This is a big deal. These girls come from all over the country and end up playing softball there. It is something where they are clearly national champions. It makes me very proud to see that they are doing so well.  I would like to take a moment to congratulate all of the players. Their hard work clearly paid off. It is important to thank the coaches as well. Thank you for your skills, your tenacity, and your dedication, which helped lead these ladies to victory.

These women will continue to make Oklahoma proud through their various roles as students, athletes, and leaders.  Just last week, junior pitcher Paige Parker was warming up before she threw the ceremonial first pitch of the game between the Kansas City Royals and the Boston Red It was during this warmup that the Royals players were able to see firsthand how impressive girls' softball pitchers are.

It is also critical to the economic productivity of our  In a purely partisan move, the House barely passed a bill that would take health insurance away from 23 million American people over the next 10 years, dramatically increase premiums to seniors, jeopardize coverage of people with preexisting conditions, and impose huge burdens on  One of the reasons the House bill was so bad--condemned even by President Trump, who labeled it ``mean''--was because it flowed from a bad process. The House held no hearings on the final bill. There was no meaningful testimony from patients or healthcare providers. They did not accept any amendments from They rushed the bill through to vote before the Congressional Budget Office could score the bill. So no wonder. No wonder the House bill is opposed by the American Medical Association, the AARP, nurses, hospitals, patient organizations, Democratic and Republican Yet the Senate is poised to make exactly the same mistake--preparing a secret bill, with no testimony, no public scrutiny, no opportunity for meaningful amendments, no opportunity for Democrats to participate.  We have the opportunity to get this right, and we have the responsibility to get this right.  There are so many problems with the House bill. As a member of the HELP Committee, I went on Friday to the Culpeper Free Clinic about 75 miles from here to talk about the need for real improvement in our healthcare system, not a repeal that would hurt vulnerable people. At this clinic, which is celebrating its 25th year, I saw dedicated staffers and volunteers, and I talked to patients. I talked to them about how this organization has provided compassionate care to working people in this region of Northern Virginia who don't have health insurance.  The fact that Virginia has refused to expand Medicaid is one of the reasons the need for their care is so significant. Fully 70 percent of the free clinic patients in Virginia would be eligible for Medicaid if the State would just join the 35 other States that have expanded  What I heard at the Culpeper Free Clinic is that they are already bursting at the seams because we haven't expanded  If there are additional cuts to Medicaid, it would overwhelm the ability of the 60 free clinics in Virginia to provide compassionate care.  Just a few hours ago, earlier today, I went to Albemarle County near Charlottesville and had a roundtable session with educators, families, and children's advocates to highlight another key problem with the Republican approach. By dramatically cutting Medicaid, who is the most likely victim? The most numerous victims of Medicaid cuts are children.  In Virginia and nationally, nearly 60 percent of the recipients of Medicaid are kids. Yet the President, through the TrumpCare bill and the President's submitted budget, proposes to cut Medicaid by $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years--$1.3 trillion over the next 10 years--and this deeply frightens parents, educators, and kids I talked to today.  I heard from parents of kids with cerebral palsy and autism, parents whose kids are receiving support through Medicaid to buy a wheelchair or get services so they can learn to adjust with autism. This will help them grow into adults who have a chance of living independently. These parents had heartbreaking stories, often telling me: I had no idea of the challenges of parenting a disabled child until I had one myself. They view Medicaid as absolutely critical to their children's educational and life success.  They talked about the current shortfalls in the Medicaid funding that leave their kids on waiting lists for services. One mom has been on a waiting list for a developmental disability waiver. I asked her what they told her about the waiting list, and this was her quote: ``They have told me my child will die before he is off the waiting list.'' And that is under the current program, before $1.3 trillion is cut out of it.  I heard from school administrators who talked about the importance of Medicaid funding for their programs that serve students and special ed teachers who are worried about the effect on their work if Medicaid is slashed.  Local superintendents and school board members talked about the difficult challenges of funding their school budget if Medicaid funding is cut. They posed it as a difficult choice. If the Feds cut $1.3 trillion out of Medicaid, do they reduce their funding for their students with disabilities, or do they take local funds away from other important programs to backstop those programs, or do they have to raise their own State and local taxes to make up for the Federal cuts?  I heard from child service advocates today who would see their program slashed if Medicaid is cut. Here is an example. Many of them serve court-involved young people--not kids charged with crime but kids who are in court because of difficult home lives and challenging situations with their parents or guardian, and they are in danger of being pushed into the foster care system or into institutions because of problems at home. Medicaid pays for support services to help stabilize their family lives. If these services are reduced and more children get institutionalized, how does that help anyone? How does it help these kids? How does it help society? How does it help our budget? It is much more expensive to put a child in a group home or an institution than to provide a few hours of Medicaid services in their home once a week.  The 60 percent of Virginia Medicaid recipients who are children and the parents and teachers and nurses and others who worry about them and help them don't see this as a partisan issue. It is fundamentally an issue of compassion. We will and should be judged by how we treat our children. Why slash funds that are used to help our kids? Is it really important to cut Medicaid by $1.3 trillion, hurting millions of children, so we can give a few adults a $900 billion tax cut?  I am on the Budget We had a hearing recently with OMB Director Mulvaney, within the last 2[[Page S3591]]weeks. Director Mulvaney tried to reassure us in his opening statement that the Medicaid cuts were really about doing people a favor--about doing people a favor. He testified: We are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on programs like Medicaid; we are going to measure compassion by the number of people we get off these programs and back in charge of their own lives.  I want to repeat that, from the President's chief budget official: We are going to measure compassion by the number of people we get off these programs and back in charge of their own lives. What a cruel thought. That reads like something a villain in a novel by Charles Dickens would say, but that is the philosophy of this administration and this effort. Will we now tell a kid who loses the wheelchair that is partly paid for by Medicaid ``You are now back in charge of your own life''? Will we tell a single mom whose child is receiving services to help with autism but now loses access to these services ``Guess what. You are back in charge of your own life''? Will we tell a teenager in a broken home whose Medicaid services are the only difference between staying in the community and being put in an institution ``Guess what. You are now back in charge of your own life''?  Since Medicaid also provides funding for our parents and grandparents who can no longer care for themselves and have to be cared for in nursing homes, will we go to those seniors who lose places in nursing homes and say ``Guess what. Now you are back in charge of your own life''?  Slashing Medicaid isn't about putting anyone back in charge of their own life. Medicaid enables kids to go to school and succeed. Medicaid enables disabled people to function well enough to go to work and pay taxes. Medicaid enables seniors to receive compassionate care when they can't care for themselves, and cutting Medicaid jeopardizes the ability of people to live with independence and dignity.  No, folks, let's not kid ourselves. This is not an effort to empower anyone. It is about casting them aside because they are too young or too old or too sick or too poor, and it is about giving a tax break to some people with the very funds we are taking away from the most vulnerable members of our society.  That is why I oppose this ``mean'' effort by the majority as a secretly crafted bill to repeal the We can improve healthcare if we work together. Let the Finance and the HELP Committees discuss any bill, hear from patients and providers, allow amendments and debates before rushing anything to a vote that would so cruelly affect the lives of millions and millions of people.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3573-2.txt,2176,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,19.0,June
6781,topic-id,1827,"Mr.President, I also rise with my colleagues to speak in favor of commonsense solutions. I think the GOP leadership made a wise decision--and I thank them for it--to pull the vote on their healthcare bill this week when the CBO came out and said that 22 million people would lose health insurance, 15 million in the first year, and Medicaid cuts would be significant. Obviously, the public was very concerned, and I am glad the GOP has taken a step back. I think we now have a chance to get this right.  I want to tell a personal story about my own involvement in this in the last few months. The story, to me, exemplifies an important principle, and that is a bad process will produce a bad product. This bill was the subject of a very bad process.  The bill that was put on the floor was a bill that ignored and shut out all Democrats from participating. More importantly, it shut out the committees from participating. Most importantly, it shut out the public from participating. That led to a bill that was destined to be bad. So we ought to fix it.  Our Democratic leader is just exiting the He asked me after I came back from the national ticket--as a consolation prize, I guess--can you be on the HELP Committee? This is the committee I have wanted to be on since I came to the Senate--Health, Education, Labor, and  I have been a mayor, and I have been a I have been in local and State government for 60 years. Education is the biggest line item, and health is the second biggest line item. This is what I actually know something about. I was so thrilled to join the committee. But, boy, was I naive. I assumed that being on the HELP Committee meant we would get to have a hearing about a healthcare bill.  I got on the committee on the 3rd of On the 5th of January, with many of my colleagues, we wrote a letter to the Republican leader and to the Republican chair of Health and Finance--13 of us; we had been on the committee for 2 days--and said: If you want to talk about improving healthcare, we have ideas. We want to sit down with you right now and talk about improvements to healthcare.  I guess I am a naive 58-year-old. I thought, now I am on the committee. Now I am where things will happen, and we will get to actually fix healthcare. But instead, since I have been on the committee--and I have committee colleagues here who will attest to this--we have had hearings on higher ed, we have had hearings on Cabinet nominees, we have had hearings on FDA reform issues. But the one taboo topic on our committee is that we are not allowed to have a hearing about the healthcare bill.  We asked for one after the House passed their bill; we couldn't have a hearing. The Senate bill has been put on the floor; we haven't had a hearing, and as far as we know, there will be no hearing. So those of us who are focused on this issue have no opportunity, but, more important--it is not about committee For those watching this and wondering what a hearing is about, a hearing is about hearing from the public. You have a witness table.[[Page S3826]]You get a patient and a doctor and a nurse. You get an insurance executive and a pharmaceutical executive. You get a small business having a hard time buying health insurance. You get them all to sit there and tell you what they like, what they don't like, and what can be fixed. All of that--all of that--has been shunted aside in this process, so the public isn't heard and the committees can't do their work.  Our ranking member on this committee, the Senator from Washington--I had watched her as the Budget chair when I was a Budget Committee member work out a great bipartisan budget deal in December of 2013, with then-House Budget chair, now-House Speaker Paul We worked it out. It was bipartisan.  I watched our ranking Democrat on the HELP Committee work with the chair on the HELP Committee, Lamar Alexander, 2 years ago to do something most people thought was impossible: have hearings and rewrite No Child Left Behind into the Every Student Succeeds It was 7 years past the reauthorization date because it was too controversial. But I watched them use the committee process, entertain ideas from both sides, hear from the public, rewrite the bill, then conference with the House, and then get it to the President for signature.  Why is healthcare taboo on the HELP Committee? Let the committees do their work. Let the greatest deliberative body in the world deliberate. Let the Senate be the Senate, and let us work together.  My colleagues have mentioned that I put an idea on the table. It is not a fix-everything idea, but it is a particular idea with a lot of bipartisan cred, and it is the notion, as some of my colleagues have said, of reinsurance. Senator Carper and I have introduced the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act, and it is going to a very particular problem that I think Democrats and Republicans recognize as a significant challenge in the current healthcare law.  President Trump, from the beginning of his administration, has injected uncertainty: We are not going to continue enrolling people--or we will reduce the market for enrollment. We are not sure we are going to pay the cost sharing. Maybe we should let ObamaCare crash and burn--a tweet that he did recently. Because this has happened, the individual market has become very unstable, and many insurers pulling out of the market are citing this unpredictability as contributing to an instability in the individual market.  Here is what Senator Carper and I proposed, and we have numerous cosponsors: We take the tool that Senator Nelson was describing, reinsurance, a tool that provides a backstop against very high-cost claims, and we put it into the Affordable Care Act as it was for the first 3 years of the Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act in its first 3 years had a reinsurance mechanism to backstop high-cost claims. If an insurance company knows there is a backstop, they can actually set premiums at a lower and more affordable level for everybody. Having that backstop also gives some certainty, so you can actually write a plan in a market where, if you don't have certainty, you might choose not to write it.  In the first 3 years of the Affordable Care Act, this reinsurance provision worked out very well, held premiums down, and kept insurers in the marketplace. It expired. But we actually know reinsurance works because it is part of a great bill that was passed during a Republican Presidency with overwhelming Republican support. Medicare Part D was passed during the administration of President George Reinsurance was made a permanent part of that bill to do exactly the same thing: to cover high-cost claims, seniors who had multiple high-cost medications. Because reinsurance was included in that bill--it was put in the original bill, authored by Republicans--it enables pricing to be more affordable for our seniors who are on Medicare, and it enables pricing actually to be more affordable for the public treasury.  Reinsurance is just one of a number of ideas that are out there, but it is an idea that has bipartisan bona fides. It has been demonstrated to work. You are not going to put reinsurance in this bill and have an unintended consequence that you didn't think would happen. We know how reinsurance works, and we know how it will work here.  I would just conclude and say that I hope we will take a bad process, which produced a bad product, set that aside, and engage in a good process to find a good product on the most important expenditure anyone ever makes in their life--on their health--a good product in the largest sector of the American economy; one-sixth of our economy is health.  The right process is this: When the Republicans get to the point that they think this bill is all they would want it to be, why not just put it in the Finance Committee, put it in the HELP Committee, and let's be the U.Let those of us who are on the committees do what we want to do. We have good committee chairs in these committees: Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, the chair and ranking on Finance; Senator Alexander and Senator Murray on Put it in the committees; let's hear from the public about what works, what doesn't, and what can be fixed. Then let's dialogue and listen to one another and come up with solutions--just as in that budget deal, just as in the rewrite of No Child Left  The Presiding Officer knows the next thing I am going to say, I bet. I am in the minority on those committees. I have some amendments like reinsurance that I want to put up, but I can't get them accepted unless I can convince some in the Republican majority that it is a good idea. I have to convince Republicans it is a good idea for my amendment to be accepted. Shouldn't I have that opportunity? Why would anybody be afraid of being open to an idea that might actually improve the bill?  Just this morning, I came out of a markup that the Presiding Officer is very familiar with, the markup of the We finished it this morning on Armed We went back and forth across the table, 27 Democrats and We traded amendments, we voted some up, and we voted some down. We had Senator McCain and Senator Reed leading us in that. We got to the end of the day, and we had a committee vote. After that discussion and listening to one another across the table, back and forth, the committee vote was 27 to 0--27 to 0. We got all the Dems on board.  I will not be naive enough to think healthcare is going to be simple and noncontroversial. I am sure we will have some tough discussions. I am sure I will offer an amendment that will be turned down. Maybe I will offer one that will be accepted. But we are much more likely to produce a good product and help people's healthcare if we actually will sit down in the committees that have jurisdiction and dialogue and amend before we bring this thing to the floor. It is just not worth rushing, because it is life and death.  We have a chance to get it right. The step-back this week enables us to take that chance, and we should seize it and work together.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from North  ",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgS3807-6.txt,2176,AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET,2017.0,28.0,June
7018,topic-id,1302,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the short-term budget resolution we will be voting on within the next couple of days and a quote the President made this morning.  The bipartisan agreement we are going to tackle on the floor to extend the Federal budget past the CR deadline through the end of September is salutary. It is salutary because the two Houses worked together to find an agreement.  I can see things in the agreement I like, and I can see things in the agreement I don't like. That is the nature of budget agreements. My principal disappointment with the agreement is that we should have done it in I will actually give credit to my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We were ready to do this deal in The Appropriations Committees in both Houses had met. We were ready to do a deal that would then give everybody in government--but, more importantly, all of our citizens and all of our businesses--some certainty about what would happen between that vote in December and the end of the fiscal year, September 30.  The incoming administration, not yet in office, dispatched the Vice President and others to the Hill and said: Don't do a budget. Don't do the omnibus bill. We want to have the ability to work on it ourselves.  I think this was against the better judgment of both sides in the A decision was made: We won't do an omnibus bill in We recessed on the 10th. We had plenty of time to get work done. Instead, we would do a CR through April 28.  I think my colleagues were right to want to do it in Nevertheless, we put everybody through the hoops of this: Is there going to be a shutdown, or what are we going to do?  Now, apparently, we will have a deal. We will discuss it, and I hope we will vote in favor of it.  We could have gotten the same deal in We would have given people more certainty. They could have adjusted. We could have not frightened people about a shutdown and done other productive work. Nevertheless, we have a deal which I plan to support.  But I was very interested this morning--very interested and, I will be blunt, very disturbed--with the President's words. At 8:07 this morning, he put out a tweet about the deal, about a bipartisan deal reached by two Republican Houses, with Democrats included--as we ought to be, because we represent a lot of the American public. This is the quote:       Either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the      rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good ``shutdown'' in      September to fix mess!  So what I want to talk about today is whether there is a good shutdown of the government of the United States--whether there is such a thing as a good shutdown. Is it right for the President of the United States to hope for a good shutdown of the government of the greatest Nation on Earth?  I can't imagine that a CEO--any CEO we would admire--would call for a shutdown of his own company. That is what President Trump now is. He is the Commander in Chief and the Chief Executive of the government of the greatest Nation on He apparently believes there could be a good shutdown of this government in  I want to take us back to the fall of 2013. In the fall of 2013, the government was shut down for about 16 days in It was my first year as a That was bad. It was bad in Virginia, a State with 170,000 Federal employees, who didn't know whether or not there would be work to do, when they would return to work, or whether they would be paid for those days. It was bad for veterans whose claims to get a disability benefit were already too backed up and who couldn't get their calls and questions answered. It was bad for veterans whose requests for medical appointments were already too backed up and, in the uncertainty of a shutdown, they didn't know when they would be resolved. It was in October, which is the high season of tourism in It was bad for one of my smallest communities, Accomack County, on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, which is adjacent to the Chincoteague National They count on October tourism as a huge part of their local economy, but when the Federal parks shut down, it was bad for their economy. It was bad for economies near Shenandoah National Park to have that park shut down in the heart of fall leaf season, which is the time they count on to help their small businesses succeed. It was bad for people on military bases, when DOD civilians were being furloughed--civilians like nurses at hospitals, and childcare workers who provide childcare to military families on military bases. They didn't know when they would be reopening. I see nothing good about a shutdown of the Government of the United  In fact, it was the first Republican President in the address at Gettysburg who said: The question that we always have to grapple with is whether government by, of, and for the people shall perish from the I think the answer to that question is that it should not perish from the Earth--not for a year, not for a month, not for a week, not for a day, not for an hour. There should not be a shutdown of the government of the United There is no such thing as a good shutdown.  So I just wanted to come to the floor today and be very, very blunt. On behalf of anybody in Virginia and in this country who is afraid of how a government shutdown could impact them or their communities; on behalf of troops, veterans, military families, and members of our Department of Defense who keep us safe every day; on behalf of veterans who fought for this country and who need the Federal Government to cut the backlog on disability claims or medical appointments at the VA; on behalf of every senior citizen or disabled person who has a case awaiting resolution by Social Security or Medicare or CMS; on behalf of 170,000 Federal employees living in Virginia and the people and communities they serve; on behalf of cities and counties around Virginia that rely on Federal support for infrastructure projects, economic development assistance, opioid prevention efforts, export promotion, and so many other critical programs; on behalf of Virginians struggling with disease and illness who pray for lifesaving cures developed through federally funded medical research; on behalf of our dynamic businesses and all of their workers, who need certainty from Washington in order to create jobs and expand the economy; on behalf of Virginia students and families who rely on Head Start Programs or rely on federally funded work study programs so they can work their way through college; on behalf of all Virginians and all Americans who deserve to have clean water, breathable air, beautiful open space, safe food and drugs, violence-free communities, a functional immigration system, and protection from cyber threats; and on behalf of the reputation of this Nation and the values that we proudly claim as American values, I will do anything and everything in my power as a U.Senator to stop any Trump shutdown, to stop any good shutdown of the government of the greatest Nation on this Earth, either now or during September or during the remainder of his term.

6916,topic-id,339,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to express a simple principle: People who are working to bag groceries should not have to rely on government assistance, on nutrition assistance, to be able to buy groceries. Yet, across this country, there are thousands of workers who go and put in a full day's work yet can't afford the basic necessities of food and clothing.  And it is the taxpayers, all of us, that bear the responsibility for the underpayment by large corporations. A Berkeley study has said that this underpayment by large corporations, low wages, is costing the American taxpayers $153 billion a year.  I am proud to introduce the Corporate Responsibility and Taxpayer Protection Act with nine other colleagues that would require companies to be responsible for the underpayment of their employees. The idea is simple: If people are putting in a hard day's work and a full week's work, they deserve wages that will allow them to be part of the middle class. Too often, what happens is corporations, even if they are paying a $15 minimum wage, will adjust an employee's hours so that they don't get more take-home pay for the month.  What this bill will do is say that a corporation that isn't paying a fair wage, where employees are relying on government assistance, the corporation is responsible for that government assistance. It is not the taxpayers who should be paying for that; it is the corporations who should be held responsible for the underpayment of wages.  My hope is that none of the corporations will have to pay this tax. That they will do the right thing by working families in the middle class. That they[[Page H4710]]will recognize that, in a time of record corporate profits, they can afford to pay a decent wage.  I am hopeful that this bill will receive bipartisan support, because it is the very premise of this country that if you work hard, if you play by the rules, you should be able to be part of the middle class.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgH4709-2.txt,99999999999999,TRUMP-RUSSIA TIES,2017.0,8.0,May

6761,topic-id,4384,"Mr.President, I want to talk about the healthcare bill, the healthcare issue, and talk a bit about how we can find a solution and then what the solution should look like.  For the last 2 days, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have been in our markup. In that markup, we considered somewhere in the neighborhood of 250 to 300 amendments. Of those 250 amendments, approximately 210 of them were either compromised--an agreement was worked out between the proponents of the amendment and those who had reservations--and they were either withdrawn or became part of the bill by unanimous consent. Of the 25 or 30 that were left for votes, however, we had good debate. The members talked about their point of view. The people who opposed them gave their points of view. We had a vigorous discussion and debate and then we voted. The important thing to me--and I am pretty sure I am right about this, I kept a mental note as we went through the votes--I don't believe there was a single party-line vote in the Armed Services Committee on any amendment. The votes were sometimes more Republicans, more Democrats, but there wasn't a single party-line vote. In other words, the process worked as it was intended to work, as it should work, and as it can work.  So I have a radical suggestion for those who are seeking a solution to this healthcare issue; that is, submit a bill and put it before the requisite committees, have hearings, have debates, have information, get information from around the country, from experts, from people who know about the topic, and that is how we make good laws. A bill that doesn't go through any of that process, that is concocted in secret and sprung on the Congress at the last minute, almost by definition will not be a good bill. Bad process--bad bill, and that is what we had happen in this case.  I think this is a time--we are going into a recess at the end of this week. Let's take a deep breath, and instead of trying to tinker around and attract a few extra votes and find something that will barely pass by the skin of its teeth, let's step back and submit this issue to the Finance Committee and the HELP Let's try to work through to find a real solution involving both parties, involving all of the wisdom that has been accumulated in this country on this incredibly complex and difficult and incredibly important issue. We don't have to try to do it in the dark. Let's do it in the light of day. Let's have open hearings and considerations, votes and amendments, discussion and debate, and then as our system is designed, we can come to a good result.[[Page S3816]]  Let's talk about the bill that is currently before us. I guess it is before us. It hasn't really been submitted to any of the committees, but I am told it is coming to the floor. It was going to be this week. Now it is going to be the week, I guess, after the recess--at least that is what we were told yesterday.  Why is this a bad bill? I have been watching some of the commentary on this bill, and there is a lot of discussion about the Congressional Budget Office analysis: Is it correct, did they use the right baseline, are they good at projecting how many people are going to sign up for healthcare, and all of those kinds of questions. People are questioning the Congressional Budget I happen to think they tend to be pretty nonpartisan, straightforward, good, scientific, and quantitative analysts of these kinds of issues. They issued their report saying 22 million people lose their healthcare. This is about people. It is not about ideology. It is about real people.  There is a really easy way to cut through all of the questions about whether they analyzed it properly and who is going to lose and who is going to win; that is, to look at a simple chart that is on, I think, the third page of the Congressional Budget Office analysis. This is really all you need to know about this bill: Medicaid loses $772 billion over the next 10 years, and the tax credit and selective coverage provisions--that is the ACA--loses $400 billion. It is $1.1 trillion out of the healthcare system. You cannot take $1.1 trillion out of the healthcare system and not hurt people. You can't do it. We don't have to argue about how many here, what age, and all of that kind of thing. We are talking about a massive cut to the support that is enabling American people to get healthcare.  In Maine, if you cut all these numbers back, as near as I can tell, it is about $400 to $500 million a year. I was the Governor of I know that $400 and $500 million a year is huge. People talk about: Well, we are going to cut Medicaid back. We are going to trim the growth rate. We are going to lower the way it is calculated and make it a per capita cap, all of these things, and we are going to give the States flexibility. The magic word ``flexibility''--as if the flexibility enables you to somehow conjure up $1 trillion. What you are really giving the States is the flexibility to decide between the elderly and the disabled or children. That is what this is all about.  There is another option, by the way. The States can always raise taxes to make up for this difference, and that is one of the most frustrating things to me, again, as a former We are talking about this reduces the Federal deficit by $330 billion over 10 years. Yes, because you shifted almost a trillion dollars to the That is nice work if you can get it. That is balancing the Federal books on the backs of the If we want to make the Federal budget look better, why don't we just let the States pay for the Air Force? That is a Federal expenditure. Shift that to the That will help us with our budget deficit, but it is a fake balancing of the budget because you are simply shifting the cost over to somebody else--another level of government.  The shorthand for that is shift and shaft. That is what we are talking about, either the State government is going to be shafted because they are going to have to raise taxes or the people who are going to lose the support are going to be shafted. We are talking about real people.  Let me talk about Medicaid for a minute. Medicaid is sometimes characterized--and I have even heard some of my colleagues use Medicaid and welfare in the same breath, as if Medicaid is a welfare program. It is not. It is a critically necessary support for healthcare for people who need it, many of whom are not welfare people--as we would denote them--not welfare recipients. They are getting a lifeline, a true lifeline that is actually keeping them alive.  In Maine, 70 percent of the people in nursing homes are on Nationwide, the number is 62 percent. So when you talk about Medicaid and cutting Medicaid, you are talking about Aunt Minnie in the nursing home. You are not talking about some welfare recipient who is ripping off the system. You are talking about your relatives who are in nursing homes, and 70 percent of the people in nursing homes are being supported by In Maine, we call it  So you can't shrink this amount of money and think it is not going to have impacts on people, and that is why this bill is so pernicious. Here is what the bill is all about: a one-half trillion-dollar tax cut to the top 2 percent of wage earners in Let's be clear what is going on here. There is an equation of one-half trillion dollars of tax cuts and more than one-half trillion dollars of cuts to benefits--money to the wealthy; healthcare away from those who need it. That is the equation. That is what this bill is all about. This isn't a healthcare bill. This is a tax cut bill dressed up like a healthcare bill, and it is also an ideological bill because people don't like  Here is the problem: Our healthcare system is the most expensive in the world. We pay the most per capita for healthcare as anyone on the planet, by far--just about twice as much as most other countries. If you do the math and you take the annual healthcare bill and divide it by the number of people in America, you get about $8,700 a year per person. That is what we spend on healthcare. So for a family of four, that is $35,000 a year. That is what healthcare costs us. By the way, that is the real problem. When we are talking about Medicaid and Medicare, Anthem and private insurance, and all of those things, we are really talking about who pays. The deeper issue is how much we are paying. The problem is--and the reason we need Medicaid and the reason we need Medicare and the reason we need the Affordable Care Act--American people can't afford it without help. It is as simple as that. They can't afford it. The government has to provide some support. If it doesn't, it would break every family in We have to have the support. Right now, in the private sector, it is breaking our companies that are trying dutifully to keep up with the increase in costs of healthcare.  Don't fall for this idea that somehow the Affordable Care Act caused all the increases. I remember--again, harking back to when I was the Governor of Maine in the late 1990s, early 2000s--healthcare costs were going up 6 percent, 8 percent a year--10 years before the Affordable Care Act went into place. The private--the individual market for health insurance was already on a drastic upward climb. So to blame it somehow on the Affordable Care Act just doesn't wash in terms of the history.  The deep problem, as I say, is the overall cost of healthcare. We have to start talking about that issue. That is a separate issue from what we are talking about here as to who pays. We have to talk about different kinds of delivery systems. We have to talk about a huge increase in preventive care. We have to talk about helping people stay out of the hospital, stay out of the medical system. The cheapest medical procedure of all is the one you don't have to perform. So many of our diseases--our chronic diseases like diabetes--are based upon the choices people are making and their lack of adequate care early in the disease. That is a separate discussion. I think that is one we really have to look at. However this debate is resolved in the next few weeks or few days, we have to talk about the deeper issue of the overall cost. If we don't get a handle on that, then all of this other stuff is going to be--it is not going to solve the problem because the deeper issue is the enormous cost we pay in this country, which is almost twice as much as anybody in the world per capita.  You could say: But we have the best healthcare in the world. Yes, we do, for the people who can afford it. But for millions of people who can't afford it, who have either no or skimpy care, it is not the best healthcare system in the world.  There are no statistical indicators that tell us we are doing very well. On things like longevity, prenatal care, infant mortality, we are way down. We are like 17th, 20th. You would think that if we are spending the most money in the world, we ought to have great results. We don't. So that is something we have to talk about.  The cost of pharmaceuticals, the cost of drugs is higher here than anywhere else in the world. Why is that? That is a problem we have to discuss.[[Page S3817]]  I had a tele-townhall Monday night. It was sponsored by the AARP of At the peak, they tell me there were 10,000 people on that call. I took questions, and the questions from seniors in Maine were full of concern--``fear'' may be too strong a word, although in several cases it wasn't, but very deep concern about what the effect of this will be on them, on their mothers, on people who are depending on Medicaid for their care.  One lady who called pays $8,000 a month for her chemotherapy drugs. If it weren't for her support under the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, she said on the phone, ``I'd be dead.'' That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about real people.  The final sort of general point I want to make before I talk about some of the people who are going to be affected by this is that I hear sometimes the proponents saying: The free market is going to solve this problem. The free market is miraculous; it can solve all problems.  I am a huge believer in the free market. I am a thoroughgoing capitalist. I started a business. I ran a business. I understand the free market. The problem is that healthcare is not a free market. If you go to buy a car, that is a free market. You can go online and compare. You can test drive. You can find the prices at the four dealers that are in your neighborhood. You can do all of those things. That is a free market. You don't have that in healthcare.  1, you don't know the price. You call your local hospital and say: What will it cost me to get my knee replaced? Nobody can tell you. You don't know the price.  2, it is very hard to compare products. You can do it if you can really dig and get word of mouth on who is a good doctor and who isn't.  3, you don't say what you want; the provider tells you what you need. Imagine going into a car dealership and the car dealer saying: I am going to tell you I think you need this Mercedes over here. I think that is what you need, and by the way, you pay for it.  Our system is set up such that providers are paid for delivering a service, not keeping you well. They get paid by procedures, fee-for-service, not for keeping you well. There is no money in prevention. We have to change that. We have to change that.  Now let me talk about people. These are some people I have talked about before, and I just want to sort of go through them.  You know who this is. This is a Maine lobsterman. This is a guy; his name is David The ACA gave them a chance to get insurance. It gave them an opportunity to get insurance where before it was practically impossible. He said it has given them some comfort, some reassurance. He said: ``We'll be okay.'' That is the Maine way. ``We'll be okay.'' This is one of the most independent, toughest professions there is in this country, but he is not part of a big corporation, and he doesn't have somebody to pay part of his healthcare. He has to make it work, and the ACA gave him an opportunity that he didn't have before to give some confidence to his family and to his life.  By the way, there are about 75,000 people in Maine just like him who got coverage under the ACA, many of them for the first time, and those are the calls we are getting in my office.  This is Jonathan Edwards and Jen This is sort of a funny story; it tells you what Maine is like. I know Jen's mother. I worked with Jen's mother in the early eighties. Maine is a big small town with very long roads. We all know each other. And it just happens that here we are, 25 years later, and I have become acquainted with  She and her husband are farmers. They are small farmers in coastal She thinks it is irresponsible to go without health insurance, especially when you have a family, but it was so expensive, they couldn't get it. They couldn't acquire health insurance in the individual market because they are not a member of a big corporation. The ACA gave them access to insurance for the first time--real insurance that covers what they need, not skinny insurance that only covers certain things and doesn't cover other things and just gives you the illusion of coverage until you go to make a claim.  Jonathan Edwards and Jen Schroth are farmers in Brooklin, ME--that is the real Brooklin, by the way, Brooklin, Forget about that place in New York; this is Brooklin with an l-i-n. They are farmers in Maine to whom the ACA gave an opportunity to get insurance for the first time for their family.  Cora and Jim Banks from Portland raised four boys. This is amazing. They raised four boys, and every single one was an Eagle That is amazing. I mean, to be an Eagle Scout is a real achievement in this day and age. Cora worked at her home. She developed Alzheimer's in her late fifties. That is a tragic disease. When Jim could no longer care for her safely at home, she went to a nursing home, and Medicaid helped her be there. Medicaid helped her be there. If you start taking away Medicaid, what will become of Cora? What will become of Jim? He took care of her as long as he could. If she has to go home, if she has to leave that home, that will be a tragedy for her and for her family.  Again, as I mentioned before, 70 percent of the residents in nursing homes in Maine are on That is the kind of difference it makes in real life.  Here is Dan Dan Humphrey is a young man with autism who volunteers at local soup kitchens and delivers Meals on Wheels in Lewiston, He depends on a Medicaid waiver to support his independent living. If it weren't for Medicaid, Daniel would be in an institution, or he would be with his parents. They wouldn't be able to work because he would need care 24 hours a day. He does need care and support 24 hours a day. Under Medicaid, he is able to lead a real life and feel good about it. You can tell he is a great guy; look at his smile. Medicaid is a lifeline.  I talked about Dan 2 or 3 weeks ago, and since then, I have had an outpouring from people across the country and especially in Maine, people who have children or relatives or friends with disabilities, on what this has meant for them and how terrifying it is that anybody wants to take three-quarters of a trillion dollars out of Medicaid, which is providing an opportunity for Daniel to lead a decent life. Why would anybody want to do that? I don't get it. I don't get it.  Of course it can be made more efficient. Of course the ACA can be made more efficient but not three-quarters of a trillion dollars more efficient. That is a huge amount--$450 million a year in  Daniel waited 8 years, under the current program, for the services he gets now. And if we put in caps and block grants--that sounds good in Washington: We are going to put in caps. Caps mean Daniel may not get his services next year or the year after or another guy like Daniel in Peoria or Philadelphia or San That is a tragedy. These are real people. We are not talking ideology; we are talking real people.  Here is Lydia She lives near where I live. She just graduated from Mount Ararat High School in Two of my boys graduated from Mount She even has a job she was offered after years of volunteering. Everything she has achieved has been accomplished with help from her family and dedicated teachers and therapists almost exclusively funded through special education in the public schools and  By the way, having a child with disabilities has nothing to do with your income. You could be high income, low income, middle income. It has to do with the luck of the draw. It has to do with bad fortune, and it could hit anybody. So, again, this idea that Medicaid is some kind of welfare program is just not true. It is not true.  So, Mr.President, the reason I am here is because of these people. The reason I am here is to stand up for these people because they can't be here to do it themselves.  We can do better. The failure to get the votes to vote on this bill this week gives us all a chance to take a deep breath, to step back and say: Sure, there are things wrong with the Affordable Care There are things we can debate. There are things we can argue about. We can have amendments. We can do what we did in the Armed Services Committee over the last 2 days and have a real discussion and debate. I know it is possible because I sat there and saw it happen. It can be done, and we can do it here.  Let's take a week not to try to browbeat and push and make special deals[[Page S3818]]to try to get 51 votes or 50 votes and then the Vice President breaks the tie. It goes to the House, and they don't even look at it--they will pass it. And then we will be embarked on a path that is really going to hurt the American people.  We have to have help. Healthcare is too expensive, and regular people in this country can't afford it. We have to have help, and this is the place where people are looking to find that help. Let's try to work together. I am certainly willing to work with anybody who will listen. But if they are starting from a premise of gutting Medicaid and giving somebody else a huge tax cut, that doesn't work. Let's talk about the real problem. You want to talk about healthcare, let's talk about it. Let's talk about how we can lower the cost of healthcare, how we can lower the cost of deductibles, how we can lower premiums, and how we can provide new options to people in the health insurance system. But let's not talk about what we are going to do that is going to have such tragic results on individuals and families and on the fabric of our society.  Mr.President, I believe we can do better. I believe we can do better, and we have an opportunity to do so. It sort of dropped into our laps this week. We have 10 days to work on this, to think about it, to try to come up with a solution or at least begin the process of a solution. There is no deadline here next week, but let's begin the process.  As we begin, I have this radical idea of referring these bills to committees here in the Senate, having hearings, getting expert opinions, listening to the country, listening to the hospital association that says this is a terrible bill. The American Medical Association says this bill violates the basic principle of the medical profession: First, do no harm. This bill will do harm.  There is no group whom I have heard of who is for it--only people who have an agenda to cut Medicaid because they don't like Federal support or people who have an agenda to change the Affordable Care Act because it has Obama's name on it. That is not a good enough reason to strike at the heart of our people, our communities, and our society.  One final point. I have been talking about people; let me talk about jobs. In Maine, in 8 of our 16 counties, the hospital is the largest employer. I talked to a hospital director an hour ago. They are desperate about what is going on down here because it is going to make it difficult for them to survive and serve their communities--the rural hospitals especially. I have met with them across Maine--in Farmington, Bridgton, Skowhegan, Maybe you haven't heard of those towns because they are small towns in Maine, but they have a hospital that is the heart of the community and the biggest employer in the community. They all told me the same thing. This idea of this bill, this approach, is going to kill them. It is going to cause them to at least shrink their services or close. In Maine, because we are a rural State with far-flung communities, that means people are going to be a long way from available care--1 hour, 2 hours--and that is a tragedy for our communities in terms of economic development, in terms of jobs, but mostly, as I keep saying, because of people.  People say: Why are you so impassioned about this, Angus?  It is because this is what the people of Maine sent me to do. They sent me down here to help them, not hurt them. They sent me down here to speak for them, not stifle their voices. They sent me down here to do the right thing, to do the ethical thing, to protect them when nobody else will. That is why I am here, and I believe that this Senate, this Congress, this government, can do better, and I hope we will.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

6678,topic-id,275,"Madam President, one of the things that I would most like to work on is the cost of prescription drugs. I think we should be making sensible changes to the Affordable Care Act, but the bill that came over from the House does not really do that at all. Whether it is bringing the cost of drugs down for seniors by having negotiations under Medicare Part D or whether it is allowing for less expensive drugs to come in--probably generic drugs or from other countries--the bill just does not do that. Now, supposedly, a bill is being considered here, but it is being done in secret. So I cannot have my say.  For any bill in the Senate, committees meet and debate and vote on amendments that are offered by Senators on both sides of the aisle. We need to hear ideas from Members of both parties as to how to fix this bill--in the HELP Committee, for starters. I ask that we agree today that the bill will not come to the floor until the HELP Committee has had an open meeting and has considered amendments from both parties.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that no motion to proceed to Calendar 120, H.1628, the American Health Care Act, be in order until the bill has been the subject of executive session meetings in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, during which amendments from the majority and minority will have received votes and the bill will have been reported favorably from the committee.

6703,topic-id,1473,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my colleagues, to speak out, and to ask for a normal process here and to ask for hearings, to ask for debate, and to ask for amendments because the healthcare repeal bill is a major step backward, throwing over 20 million people off of health insurance. It is strongly opposed by  We don't know what is being concocted here in the Senate, but clearly something is going on, and we would like to have a say, and, most importantly, the people of my State would like to have a say.  Look at Laura from North Paul, who wrote to me about her concerns about that health bill. Laura is recently retired, but she will not be eligible for Medicare until next year, and she has a daughter with several chronic health conditions. Laura is worried that if the proposal goes through this Chamber, she will end up paying far more for her health insurance, and her daughter might lose her coverage altogether. Like so many others, Laura asked that we work across the aisle to make improvements to the bill that her family needs and that so many families across the country need.  Take Mike from Grand Marais, which is in the far corner of Minnesota, right at the tip of our State, not too far from Mike knows the kind of healthcare they have across the border in He knows what the prices are for the prescription drugs there, but here in America that healthcare bill doesn't do anything to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.  Mike has been self-employed his whole life and is now approaching retirement. He told me that he is very worried that, just as he is about to retire, he will not be able to afford health insurance because the premiums that are under that bill for older Minnesotans like him would skyrocket.  Take a woman from Andover, She wrote to me to say that she is so worried ``about the GOP's slam dunk attempt to check off a box on their to do list'' with the healthcare proposal. She asked me to put a face on the type of person that will be a part of that checklist on that to-do list, and that would be her 28-year-old son. She says that Medicaid coverage has been a lifesaver for her son because it helps him afford the treatment he needs to strive for an independent, productive life.  The truth of the matter is that I have heard so many people like these three, from all corners of my State, from the old to the young to the middle-aged. I have heard from so many people from the rural parts of my State about this bill. They are especially worried about the $834 billion in cuts to Medicaid covers more than 1.2 million Minnesotans, including more than one-fifth of our rural population. That is 20 percent of our rural population. This funding is vital for our rural hospitals and the healthcare providers' ability in those parts of our State to stay open and serve their patients.  Many people who work in rural hospitals and those who are served by rural hospitals have come up to me to talk about their concerns. These hospitals are not like big urban hospitals.  I see the Senator from Hawaii here. I thank him for organizing this along with Senator  Our rural hospitals actually treat a lot of accidents, people out snowmobiling or on In fact one of them has a chart every summer showing all the places where they had to remove fish hooks from people's hands. They usually have over 100 of them by the end of the summer. You wouldn't see that in an urban area--that is for sure--but it just shows that different parts of our country, different parts of our State have different issues they are dealing with.  Rural hospitals are particularly concerned about these cuts. These drastic cuts would cause many of our rural hospitals to close, forcing families to drive 60, 70, 80 miles or more when they need the healthcare the most.  The other issue that this bill brings up to me, when looking at rural areas, is the opioid epidemic that is hitting communities across the country. In my State, deaths from prescription drug use now claim more lives than homicides or car crashes. While there is more work to do to combat this epidemic, I want to recognize that we have made meaningful progress so far in a bipartisan way. We passed the framework bill, the CARA bill. We passed the Cures Act last December, as well as money to fund treatment. Unfortunately, just as we are starting to move forward on this issue, the healthcare repeal bill passed by the House would put us at the risk of moving backward. There is money in that bill for opioid treatment, but guess what. Medicaid and children's health insurance covers 3 out of every 10 people with an opioid addiction. But according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, mental health and substance abuse benefits could be cut under the House bill, increasing out-of-pocket costs.[[Page S3596]]  It is clear that this healthcare legislation has massive life-changing implications for families all over this country. Yet we haven't even seen a draft in the What we do know is that, just last week, the President of the United States, who is known for not really mincing words and known for using direct language, called the House bill ``mean.''  He called it ``mean.'' He didn't need a poll or a focus group. He didn't need to know every detail of the bill, but when you hear that 20 million people can lose health insurance, that is a pretty good word to describe it--mean. What we don't want to have in the Senate is that we bring forward the Senate mean, or mean 2. But guess what. We don't even know what we have because we haven't seen it, because the legislation is being drafted behind closed doors. Most of us agree that we must make changes to the Affordable Care I certainly think so. I would love to pass my bills or include them in amendments to the Affordable Care Act to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.  My bill would allow 41 million seniors to harness their negotiating power to bring drug prices down. Right now they are banned to do that. That is wrong.  I would love to see more competition come into the market in the form of less expensive drugs from other countries, like Canada--a bill I have with Senator Kaine or a bill to make it easier to get generics on the market, like the bill Senator Grassley and I have to stop something that is called ``pay for delay.'' I think the American people would be surprised that the big pharmaceutical companies are paying their generic competitors to keep their products off the market. These are improvements to the bill.  We can make improvements to the exchanges. Just as we have done some of that work in the State of Minnesota, we can do that nationally. We can make improvements to small business rates. Those are things we can do, but we cannot do it if we can't get through the door because the door is closed. When the door is closed, it is not just closed to the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, but the door is closed to the American people.  What it all comes down to is that we need to work in a bipartisan way to make healthcare better and less expensive for the people in our country. Last week, we all came together. I was at that Congressional Baseball It was an amazing moment, with 25,000 people in the stands. All four leaders were out there looking like they actually liked each other. There they were, and there our teams were--two teams, a Republican team and a Democratic team. In the end it was a hard fought game. One team won. The Democratic team won, but do you know what they did with their trophy? They handed it to the Republican team, and they said: Put it in Representative Scalise's office.  We want to take that spirit and go even further--instead of two teams, one team for That is the way we make the changes to an issue that has been long fought on both sides. I know Republicans weren't happy with everything that happened during the debate on the Affordable Care They have made that clear. But now we have a moment in time where we could come together and make some sensible changes and make things better for the people of this country. Let's do it.  I yield the floor.

6777,topic-id,670,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for her good idea and for her passion for this issue and for her correct statement that when people sign up for these exchanges, they don't have to go by train, plane, or automobile to Washington, DC, to get their insurance.  I heard, when I was home this weekend, over and over, concern from people whom I was surprised to see come up to me. Several people in Winona, MN, came up to me and said: We are Republicans, but we don't think it is fair if seniors have to pay more when tax cuts are going to the wealthiest.  I heard from people in Lanesboro, MN, small business owners who were[[Page S3824]]worried about what was happening with the proposal from the other side. In Northfield, MN, the town of ``Cows, Colleges and Contentment,'' I can tell you that they were not very content at the Northfield Hospital as they saw the devastating impact this bill would have on rural hospitals.  So that is why I so appreciate my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, bringing people together today to talk about the fact that there is another way forward.  There is another way forward, and the people in this Chamber have done this before. Senator McConnell negotiated with Senator Boxer on a major transportation bill. The last time we had an issue with doctors' fees, we were able to get that done on a bipartisan basis. So what we are simply asking our colleagues to do is to start afresh and to look at what we could do together to help the people of this country without sabotaging the current healthcare delivery system and without taking this out on the most vulnerable through Medicaid cuts.  Here are some ideas. As to prescription drug prices, why would we not allow the 41 million seniors in this country to use their bargaining power--to harness their bargaining power--as my friend Senator Nelson from Florida understands because he knows there are a lot of seniors in Florida--to harness that bargaining power to negotiate for lower costs on prescription drugs. The current law bans us from doing that. So all we want to do is to lift that ban and let our seniors negotiate. That is not in this bill we are considering from the Republican side. This is something we can come together and work on.  We can get less expensive drugs in the form of generic drugs. Yet, right now, we have a situation where major prescription drug companies are paying generic companies to keep their products off the market. It is called pay for delay. Senator Grassley and I have a bill to eliminate that. We can bring in less expensive drugs from other countries if, in fact, we have a situation where the prices have ballooned, as they have for the top 10 selling drugs in Four of them have gone up over 100 percent.  The exchanges are another area where we have agreement. Senator Collins has been working on this. Senator Kaine and Senator Carper have a bill on this, and Senator Shaheen is working on the cost-sharing issue. We can work together to make insurance more affordable for people who are in the exchange.  As to our small business rates, we must work on that.  I truly believe we can come together.  I will end with this. I got to be at that baseball game in the crowd with the 25,000 people who were watching the two teams play each other. Senator Donnelly of Indiana was on the field. At the end of the game, after the Democratic team won, they didn't keep the trophy. They handed the trophy to the Republican team and asked them to place that trophy in Congressman Scalise's office.  We are not two teams. We are one team, and that is for our country, for So let's work together on this bill.  Thank you very much, Mr. I yield the floor.

We represent the people who are truly in the middle of this country--the middle of the country economically, politically--and who are often middle-income people who need representatives who are focused on what matters to them.  Each year I visit all 87 counties in my State, and I hear a lot. I hear about dads who can't be sure their sons or daughters will have the support they need to take over the family farm when the time comes, small business owners who can't get a broadband connection, moms who can't figure out how to pay for their kids' prescriptions when the costs go up, and manufacturers who can't find workers to fill jobs.  Rural America has been left behind. The poverty rate in their areas for kids is higher than it is in urban areas. Businesses may not invest when they can't get reliable internet access or they can't get the right people to support their operation. Housing is hard to come by.  We should be focused on supporting our farmers and ensuring that people can raise a family in a small town and have the healthcare they need. We should be making sure that high-quality education is attainable and that job training options are available and affordable. We should be able to provide every person in this country with a clear path to a good job.  Unfortunately, from the administration we have seen a disconnect between rhetoric and policy. We have seen a budget that hits the heartland with 21 percent cuts in the Department of Agriculture--cuts to grant programs that support rural homeownership, provide clean drinking water and wastewater systems, and promote access to critical services such as rural hospitals. It eliminates rural business programs that help create hundreds of thousands of jobs. If enacted, these cuts would have a damaging impact on rural communities throughout the country.  Rural communities help our country get ahead. They are the backbone of our country. We need to work to find common ground on these issues, and we need a budget that helps and not hurts the heartland.  I see my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, is here as well.

It took some Herculean efforts to get the last farm bill done, and it would not have happened without her. I appreciate what she said about the importance of the farm bill and the  I would also add another important pillar of strong rural economics, and that is job training.  Starting with high school, I think we all have to come to grips with the fact that not every kid wants to get a 4-year degree. In fact, we have so many openings across this country--millions of job openings--whether it be on a plant floor, whether it be as a plumber or as a welder, that can be obtained with a 1-year or a 2-year degree. My own sister did not graduate from high school. She went on, years later, and got her GED, and then she went on to get a 2-year degree. After that, she got 2 more years of training and became an accountant. There is not just one path in  Part of this is investing in STEM--science, technology, engineering, and mathematics--and doing it early so that kids get a jump start on the jobs of tomorrow. By the way, this is not just your Ph.D.s and Silicon Valley jobs. This also includes blue-collar jobs. I call it blue There is a shortage, as I said, of welders and auto mechanics, and those can be good-paying jobs. We need to talk about them with dignity, and we have to realize that this is where the openings are.  The other piece of this, in addition to training kids in high school, is to make sure we have apprenticeship programs available. This year, a report came out in my State that 68 percent of Minnesota manufacturers found it was difficult for them to find workers with the right skills and experience. That is up from 40 percent in 2010.  I see that Senator Heitkamp is here. As they are starting to add some more jobs in the oil patch in North Dakota, it is going to become even harder to find Minnesotans to fill some of our jobs because some of them like to go over to North  Senator Collins and I have introduced a bill called the American Apprenticeship Act, which would expand tuition assistance for pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs. The President has talked about workforce development as being a priority. Yet we have seen a cut of 15 percent in Department of Education grants for career and technical education, as well as a 36-percent cut to Labor Department funding for training and employment services.  As I noted before, there is this disconnect between the rhetoric we hear and what we are reading in the black and white of this budget. I know there are people on both sides of the aisle here, including the Senator from North Dakota, who want to work on bridging that difference and getting a good budget done that really helps rural  I see Senator Heitkamp is here, and I thank her for coming.

6822,topic-id,511,"Mr.President, I again thank Senator Heitkamp for her understanding not just of farm policy but also the importance of keeping towns strong, manufacturing strong, and transportation strong.  I will note that the infrastructure portions of this budget are very concerning. The point has been made by others that right now, under the proposed budget, at a time when our deteriorating infrastructure is costing our economy a lot of money--not just congestion, not just potholes, but in delaying getting goods to market--unfortunately, this budget proposal would cut funding for vital transportation programs.  It will eliminate funding for the TIGER Grant Currently, the program provides $500 million per year to help fund local transportation priorities. It eliminates funding for Essential Air Service, which helps support commercial air service to rural airports. It eliminates the Federal Transit Administration's Capital Investment Grant Program, which funds light rail, heavy rail, commuter rail, street car, and bus rapid transit projects. We can't wait any longer to make critical investments in our infrastructure.  Probably right up there with any of these infrastructure needs in rural America is broadband. Internet access is a great equalizing force for creating jobs and leveling the playing field. There is a big digital gap when it comes to rural I know the percentages; close to 40 percent of Americans in rural areas do not have access to high-speed broadband. It used to be that slow speed would be OK if someone were trying to email their kid in school maybe 10, 15 years ago, but this is not true anymore. Now, if you want to do your work, if you want to go to the hospital--whatever you want to do in rural America, you are going to have to have high-speed internet.  I think about the doctor in Brainerd, MN, who for so long could look at x rays in the hospital but couldn't look at them in his home. If he had some emergency and wanted to talk to someone when he got home that evening, he had to go to the McDonald's parking lot to be able to do that.  There was a student at one of our reservations who got Wi-Fi in his house, looked out the window, and all of a sudden all these kids were doing their homework in his front yard. That is just not right. Rural Americans deserve equal footing so they can launch new businesses, export their goods, or just Skype with their loved ones.  This is about the farm bill, yes, but it is also about this budget and making sure this budget works for all Americans and leaves no one behind.  Sadly, these cuts are specifically targeted at rural That is why we are going to fight to make sure, hopefully on a bipartisan basis with colleagues on the Republican side, we produce a budget that is fair to everyone.

I invite all of my colleagues to join me in demanding that this House immediately repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military  Nearly 16 years ago, Congress passed an open-ended, blank check for endless war. This authorization gives any President the authority to wage limitless war at any time, anywhere, for any reason in perpetuity.

Thank God that because of the Affordable Care Act, many of those people received treatment who otherwise would have passed away last year. The number would have been a much larger number across our State and across the country. Because of the Affordable Care Act, the number was low, but that number was still much too high.  I want to be able to tell the people in Massachusetts what the impact of the Republican healthcare bill will be on their families in terms of getting access to the opioid addiction treatment they will need so that the number does not continue to go up but to go down.

6688,topic-id,352,"Mr.President, when I was home in Massachusetts this weekend, I constantly had people coming up to me and asking me about the secret Republican healthcare bill--what is in it and how it is going to affect their families--because, to use Donald Trump's words, they are afraid that it is going to increase premiums, and that would be mean; that it is going to make it possible for insurers to deny coverage for preexisting conditions, and that would be mean; that it would create an age tax for older Americans, and that would be mean; that it would cut Medicaid coverage for grandma and grandpa to get a nursing home bed if they had Alzheimer's, and that would be mean.  So the question that kept coming to me all weekend was, is this secret bill really meant to cut all of the funding that goes for the poor, the sick, the elderly, and the disabled so they can give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America? Can we get that out so people can see that?  They also said to me that they didn't want to be fooled, because their fear is that TrumpCare is as much a healthcare bill as Trump University was a college institution and that there really isn't any healthcare in it and that it is cruel, inhumane, and immoral.

6693,topic-id,2067,"Mr.President, when a Pope dies, the cardinals meet in secret to select the next A white cloud goes up in smoke. When the Senate Republicans meet in secret to craft a healthcare bill, coverage for the sick, the disabled, and the elderly is what goes up in smoke--all of that coverage. The only thing more secret than the Republican healthcare bill is Donald Trump's tax returns.  We might need ultimately to have a special counsel to go and to find out what is inside of that healthcare bill because right now the Democrats don't know, the American public doesn't know, and no one knows what is in that bill. While we may not have details on the Republicans' secretive proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, we know that they are not completely rewriting the House-passed legislation that eviscerates the Medicaid Program and reduces coverage and increases costs for most Americans and for the individuals, the families, and the communities caught in an opioid crisis. This bill will be a complete calamity, and it is being done totally in secret.  Right now, the press is being stifled. The White House didn't even let reporters audiotape the press briefing today. Last week, the Senate Republicans tried to keep the press from asking questions of Senators in the hall. They don't want the press to know about this bill or to cover it.  But for families who need treatment for opioids, the Republicans want to take the money from substance use disorder coverage and care and use it to offset a $5.5 trillion tax cut for the healthy wealthy and for massive corporations. That would be cruel. It would be immoral. It would be inhumane. Like President Trump himself has said, it would be ``mean.''  We know the opioid epidemic knows no demographic, economic, or political boundaries. It has ruined the lives of men and women from Lexington, MA, to Lexington, It is an equal opportunity destroyer. That is one of the reasons why, over the last year, combating the opioid epidemic has been a bipartisan issue.  Eleven months ago, this body passed and sent to the President's desk the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Known as CARA, this bipartisan law strengthens the States' responses to the opioid crisis, and it passed the Senate 92 to 2.  Six months ago, the Senate passed the 21st Century Cures Act 94 to 5. This bill quickly became law and allocated $1 billion to States to provide much needed resources to help them address the opioid epidemic on the ground and in their communities.  Yet today Senate Republicans are singlehandedly attempting to betray that progress and to erase it from the history books. They are doing so by crafting in secret a bill to gut Medicaid and repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a shell that hides a massive tax break for the wealthiest people in our country--people who do not need or deserve a tax break, especially if it is coming from the healthcare coverage of those people who are sickest, those people who are oldest, those people who are most disabled, those people who are most vulnerable to having an addiction to opioids and need treatment. It would be wrong to take their money for that healthcare coverage and give it as a tax break to the wealthiest billionaires in America, who already have enough money for their healthcare coverage.  This would be a death sentence to the 2.8 million Americans with substance use disorders, including 220,000 with an opioid use disorder at risk of losing their insurance coverage altogether in order to ensure that their family member can get treatment.  For those who do manage to get insurance coverage, TrumpCare will make it more expensive to get the treatment and the care they need. The Congressional Budget Office explicitly said that out-of-pocket spending on mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars per individual in any one given year. For a disease as critical as an opioid use disorder, any delay in treatment can be the difference between life and death, not to mention that, because TrumpCare reduces protections for people with preexisting conditions, even those with insurance may find out that the coverage they have won't work for them when they need it the most. Under the Republican proposal, a substance use disorder could be classified as a preexisting condition and, therefore, you couldn't get coverage for it.  The Congressional Budget Office also said that TrumpCare would slash Medicaid by $834 billion, permanently decapitating They say they are moving to a per capita system. Another way of saying that, if you are an[[Page S3585]]ordinary person, is decapitation of Medicaid for the families across our country who need it.  If this becomes law, there is no Narcan for Once it is cut by TrumpCare, it is dead.  Those devastating cuts would grind the progress we have made in expanding access to opioid treatment to a screeching halt and kick people currently in treatment to the curb. Medicaid spent $7 billion on substance use disorder treatment alone in 2014. That money facilitated access to care, access to recovery, and access to hope for millions of Medicaid can cover in-patient detox treatment, care coordination, access to naloxone.  Additionally, Medicaid pays for one-third of the medication-assisted treatments in the country, more than any other payer. In Massachusetts, Medicaid pays for nearly one-half of the medication-assisted treatment provided in the So think about that. One half of the people who get medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction will lose their coverage, and, then, the Republicans are going to take the money they save and give it to the wealthiest people in our country, who also need the same coverage, leaving them with the money needed for those who are the one-half who won't have it. What happens to those other individuals? It could be a death sentence without treatment.  Those of us from States hardest hit by the opioid epidemic hear time and again how Medicaid coverage of those services saves lives.  Dawn from Swansea, MA, shared the story of her son, who became addicted to opioids after experimenting with prescription pain pills from a family member. Through Medicaid, he was able to access medication-assisted treatment to help treat his substance use disorder. Dawn said:       He has done very well with his recovery so far but I fear      that without insurance coverage that will allow him to      continue obtaining his medication and counseling . . . he may      lose all that he has gained and fall back into the cycle of      addiction. His medical insurance is literally his lifeline.      Please don't abandon my son and others like him who need      Medicaid assistance to continue their fight against      addiction.  Instead of recognizing the importance of Medicaid for families like Dawn's across the country, Republicans are proposing to starve this lifesaving program from Federal funding through TrumpCare by cutting more than a quarter of its budget. Because that is not enough to fund the massive tax breaks that Republicans want for their donor friends, President Trump has proposed in his budget to cut the program by an additional $600 billion, leaving Medicaid a shell of its former self.  Although Republicans refer to the changes as capping the Medicaid Program, for Dawn's son, what that really means is they will decapitate his access to medication-assisted treatment, decapitate his ability to seek counseling, and decapitate the peace of mind Dawn receives in knowing her son is accessing the help he needs.  We also have to consider the Affordable Care Act's Prevention and Public Health Fund and its role in the opioid epidemic. It is the Federal Government's single largest investment in prevention.  Since 2010, Massachusetts has received more than $95 million through the prevention fund. Importantly for Massachusetts, nearly $4.5 million has been given to the preventive health services block grant that has helped the State respond to the heroin, prescription drug, and fentanyl drug crisis. Eliminating this fund will only hurt our ability to respond to the opioid and other drug epidemics popping up in every one of our communities.  We should not be building bridges to recovery with money that is stolen from those programs in order to be spent on a wall that is going to pretend to block the drugs from coming in from overseas. We should be building bridges to recovery, not walls to isolation.  Instead of more commissions, we need more commitments from the administration and congressional Republicans to not undo the progress we have made in preventing and treating substance abuse disorder. It is unfortunate that Republicans who touted our progress on opioid issues aren't standing up to the policies in TrumpCare that would negate their hard work. By supporting this, they are betraying the families and communities who have suffered from the relentless grip of substance use disorders. When discussing the opioid crisis, the only thing the GOP stands for right now is Gutting Overdose That is the new GOP--Gutting Overdose  While devastating, this isn't surprising for those of us who have been watching many congressional Republicans salivate over ways to annihilate Medicaid for decades. Republicans harbor an ancient animosity toward Raiding the Medicaid coffers achieves two of their goals: First, it kills a lifeline for more than 70 million low-income and working-class Second, it provides the GOP a piggybank to aid their donors and pay for these tax breaks for their friends. In fact, TrumpCare alone would provide the wealthiest individuals and national corporations with over $660 billion in tax breaks over 10 years. Included in this figure is the repeal of the health insurance tax, which gives a $145 billion tax break to insurance conglomerations and their Millionaires will get a tax break of $50,000 a year--more than three times the income of most Medicaid beneficiaries--and the top 400 highest income earners would save $7 million in taxes annually. All of this comes at the expense of the 23 million Americans who will lose health insurance coverage under  Don't let the GOP fool you--TrumpCare is not about creating health, it is about concentrating wealth in the hands of a small number of It is about making middle-class and working Americans pay for a tax break for people who need it least.  We can do better than this. We owe it to the families of the 33,000 Americans who died from an opioid overdose last year. The proposals under consideration with Republicans is going to only add to the tally of overdose deaths. We are hearing that Senate Republicans could create an opioid fund as a paltry attempt to appease those who have called out the cruelties in this bill. That extra funding would be crumbs. It would be like trading a full-body cast for a bandaid, like trading land for a couple of beads, like trading a Cadillac for a tricycle.  We will not be fooled. We know it took Republicans more than 1 year to agree to providing the funding for emergency opioid response in the CURES bill. One can only imagine how long it will take to get any money the Republicans are promoting as a consolation prize out to the communities who need it. We know that a vote for TrumpCare is a vote to perpetuate overdose deaths. Passing this bill will be just aiding and abetting one of public health's most wanted and most notorious serial killers.  Americans from both political parties are not fooled by President Trump's tax cut shell game on the backs of families and communities who have been ravaged by opioids. That is why Democrats will continue to be a public megaphone and shout from the rooftops that eviscerating Medicaid to give a tax cut to the healthy and wealthy is mean, inhumane, and immoral, and we are not going to stand for it, and the American people are not going to stand for it.  The best vote I ever cast in my political career of 41 years in Congress was for the Affordable Care The second best vote I will ever cast is to block the repeal of the Affordable Care Act because of the good it has done for tens of millions of families in our country who otherwise would not have the coverage they need.

Managing vegetation around power lines is important for ensuring electric grid reliability, and for keeping overgrown and falling trees from interfering with nearby power lines which can cause blackouts, wildfires, and other safety hazards.  This bill would ensure utility companies, who are responsible for vegetation management near power lines on federal lands, are no longer delayed by bureaucratic red tape and inconsistent federal standards between agencies.  With the passage of this bill, we will be a step closer to providing expedited forestry management plan approval, while also giving utility companies the authority to remove hazardous debris in emergency situations.  Mr.Chair, I am pleased we are advancing a bipartisan proposal today--I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

6808,topic-id,1477,"Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017, but first I would like to offer my strongest condemnation of the terrorist attack allegedly carried out by ISIS this morning in Tehran, which claimed the lives of 12 people. Attacks on civilians in any corner of the world must be strongly condemned by the United States, and I offer my condolences to the people of Iran and the families who lost loved ones in this latest act of terror.  If anything, these events remind us that the entire Middle East is increasingly under siege, and the United States and the entire international community must unite to confront terrorism and extremism in all of its forms. That means holding governments that continue to foment, fund, and encourage terrorism accountable.  While the people of Iran suffered a heinous attack today, the unfortunate reality is that the violence, volatility, and profound human suffering that imperils the Middle East are all too often linked back to the Government of Across the region, this regime continues to pursue policies that threaten the national security interests of the United It continues to support terrorism and exert influence through the growing power of proxy actors throughout the Levant and Even as it continues to supply terrorists across the region with money, weapons, and resources, the people of Iran continue to suffer under an oppressive regime with absolutely no respect for basic human rights.  We all know the United States faces a multitude of threats at home and abroad, from Russia's cyber attack on our elections, to North Korea's continued belligerence, to new questions about America's leadership in the world. But even as Congress rightly remains focused on these challenges, we must not lose sight of Iran's ongoing, ever-growing efforts to exert more control, more power, and more influence throughout the Middle Whether we are talking about an adversary like Russia or Iran or an international challenge like climate change or the refugee crisis, we cannot let issues of such importance to our future be obscured by partisan politics, derailed by divisive tweets, or lost amid the revelations of our relentless 24-hour news cycle.  I have always believed politics must stop at the water's edge, and I know many of my colleagues share that principle. That is why there is such broad bipartisan support for the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities I am pleased to have worked with Senators Corker, Cardin, and a number of other colleagues on legislation that has earned the support of nearly 60 cosponsors. We crafted this legislation by listening to an array of different voices with experience addressing Iran's destabilizing influence.  But let me be clear. This bill is not--is not--about Iran's nuclear program. This bill is not about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of With the regime's tentacles reaching across the region--from its support of a Shia proxy network in Iraq, to its growing influence in Afghanistan, to its continued sponsorship of terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas--we need a strategic approach, one that energizes our partners in the region and recognizes their capacity to counter Iran's behavior. That is exactly what the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act does.  Our legislation calls on the President of the United States to develop a regional strategy to counter Iran's asymmetric and conventional threats across the Middle We know that Iran, for example, continues to develop sophisticated ballistic missile technologies. They aren't exactly hiding it. Just a few weeks ago, a semi-official news service for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard announced it had built a third underground facility dedicated to ballistic missiles. Iran continues to test launch missiles, some of which may be capable of reaching Europe or Israel--both critical allies of the United In fact, some of the missiles launched earlier this year had the words ``Israel must be wiped off the Earth'' etched on their sides. That is why 722 requires the President to impose sanctions on any person who knowingly engages and materially contributes in support of Iran's ballistic missiles program.  Some argue that imposing new sanctions on Iran violates the spirit of the JCPOA, but I would argue that actively building underground ballistic missile facilities does little to promote good will or the spirit of the JCPOA in the region.  Beyond its missile program, Iran remains actively engaged in importing and exporting small and conventional arms to terrorist proxies around the world and bad actors like North In January of this year, the outgoing United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern that Iran might have violated an arms embargo by supplying weapons and missiles to Yet, not all of Iran's violations make high-profile news. We know Iran has ramped up its supply of weapons to the Houthi rebels in Yemen and other proxies throughout the region. That is why this legislation imposes sanctions on any individual who knowingly engages in activity that materially contributes to the supply, sale, or transfer of arms as defined and established by U.standards.  Finally, when it comes to human rights, some try to paint a pretty picture of reform in Iran, but a closer look reveals chilling and deplorable human rights abuses. According to Human Rights Watch, by October of last year, Iran had executed more than 250 people--that is 1 person sent to death every day--and many were executed for nonviolent drug offenses. That is why our legislation expands the scope of violations eligible for sanctions, including those behind the extrajudicial killings of journalists and activists who seek to expose the oppression of the Iranian people.  Finally, this bill calls for a comprehensive report on Americans who suffer at the hands of the Iranian regime, including those who have been unjustly detained and those who have remained missing in Iran for more than a decade.  In short, this bill is a carefully crafted response to Iran's ongoing aggression in the Middle  Let me turn to a provision that continues to be misrepresented, and that[[Page S3306]]involves the Iranian Revolutionary Guard The IRGC is officially responsible for Iran's internal security, with a ground force of about 100,000, but like many other quasi-military-political entities in undemocratic countries throughout the world, the IRGC holds enormous influence in Iran's economy and public affairs. On paper, the IRGC Quds Force is the lead supporter of Iran's terrorist networks around the world, and the United States has designated it as such, but the reality is, the IRGC exercises tremendous economic and political power throughout It pulls the regime's levers to fund and support terrorists in the Middle East and beyond. That is why our bill specifically calls for terrorism-related sanctions on the IRGC, but it does not--let me repeat--it does not, as some have claimed, label the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization. We heard the concerns of our military and intelligence community. Let me repeat. This bill does not label the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. What it does do is require the President to acknowledge the role the IRGC plays in supporting terrorism globally.  I know some of my colleagues have expressed concerns as well about whether this bill gives a green light to the administration's decidedly confrontational approach to Iran, but that is precisely why Congress must step up and define our strategy in the Middle We need to look at the big picture here. As the United States and our partners work to build democratic governance structures--promote tolerance across the region and protect civilians and refugees living under siege--Iran remains aligned with Russia and Syria, actively working to undermine U.security interests. Indeed, Putin, Assad, and the Ayatollah continue to take advantage of the strife that imperils the region. Meanwhile, the world continues to struggle with extremism, with mass migration, and with the largest humanitarian crisis since World War  With this administration unable to articulate a clear vision for American leadership in the world, the time is ripe for Congress to assert its influence in our foreign policy, to provide guidance and expertise, and to develop a framework for securing our interests in the Middle  Now is not the time for Congress to turn a blind eye to Iran's hostile behavior. Now is the time for all of us to demand nothing less than vigorous oversight, constant vigilance, and strict enforcement of our entire arsenal of diplomatic tools, including sanctions on That is our effort--outside of the nuclear proposal--to make it very clear that you cannot get a green light to do all of these things just because you signed on to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of I think it is important for us to send this message, and when the appropriate time comes for this vote, I urge my colleagues to support the measure.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

7016,topic-id,1344,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the confirmation of Jay Clayton as Chair of the U.Securities and Exchange  Just 100 days into the Trump administration, the truth is becoming crystal clear to the American people: There is no ``America first'' policy, and there certainly is no ``middle class first'' policy. There is just one policy, and that is a ``Wall Street first'' policy. It is a policy designed to steer even more wealth and more power to those who are plenty wealthy and plenty powerful, a policy built on the misguided view that our economy does better when banks do as they please, when CEOs receive runaway pay, and when bigger profits never translate into bigger paychecks for workers. That is why we have seen no Executive orders designed to hold big banks accountable, no Executive orders designed to protect borrowers from abusive student loan companies, no Executive orders helping more workers save for retirement. Instead, we see the administration rolling back protections for consumers and students and seniors, actively exploring how to put taxpayers back on the hook for Wall Street's recklessness, and ordering oversight agencies to, quite simply, conduct less oversight.  There is no greater example of the Trump administration's ``Wall Street first'' policy than its decision to nominate Jay Clayton as the Chair of the Securities and Exchange  The SEC is our Federal Government's cop on the Wall Street beat. And let's remember why we have a Securities and Exchange Commission and why it needs to be the cop on the beat. In 1929, the stock market crashed, and our Nation was sent into a deep and devastating depression. That is why President Franklin Roosevelt signed financial reforms into law aimed at curbing rampant speculation and risky behavior on Wall Street, and the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission was one of those reforms.  The SEC was designed to enact safeguards and promote fairness in our markets, to protect investors and prosecute fraud, and to ensure that our businesses have access to capital so they can grow and create jobs. When we have a watchdog ensuring that everyone plays by the rules, risk is more distributed, markets are more stable, and capital is more available.  The American people know all too well what happens when we take our eyes off of Wall Not even a decade has passed since the worst financial collapse in 80 years put taxpayers on the line for billions of dollars--billions of dollars--in bailouts.  In the years leading up to the crash, our regulators, including the SEC, turned a blind eye to excessive risk-taking and corporate misconduct. We needed a cop on the beat, but instead we had a regulator asleep at the switch. As a result, we suffered a crisis that cost 8.5 million Americans their jobs and 10 million Americans their homes--8.5 million Americans their jobs and 10 million Americans their homes--a crisis that destroyed $19 trillion in household wealth and left small businesses devastated nationwide, a crisis that sank local and State governments into a sea of red ink. And, of course, it left us with the great recession. It took us years to dig this economy out of that ditch. Now, after all we have been through, is it really time to go easier on Wall Street?  Since the financial crisis, the SEC has been instrumental in reshaping the rules of the road and holding corporation wrongdoers accountable. Now, less than a decade since that devastating crisis, this administration wants to give the keys to the castle to one of Wall Street's most loyal guardians.  We need someone at the helm willing to root out bad behavior in our financial sector, but Mr.Clayton is not that someone. He is no expert in enforcing the law. Indeed, Mr.Clayton has made a career out of fighting the SEC and other financial regulators on behalf of Wall Street's biggest institutions. His resume is built around defending Wall Street's most notorious offenders from ever being held accountable.  Let me again remind my colleagues that the SEC was not created to be Wall Street's support group in Investors and the American public at large deserve an SEC Chair who will fight to hold firms accountable, who will prosecute misconduct and wrongdoing, and who will improve investor protections. Mr.Clayton has not met that burden.  There are three reasons why I am concerned that an SEC led by Mr.Clayton would be an SEC that bends the rules for corporations and ignores the needs of hard-working  First is Mr.Clayton's singular focus on corporate bottom lines. When asked to lay out his vision for the agency, Mr.Clayton offered no path to preventing another financial crisis. He provided no commitment to strengthening the agency's enforcement abilities, and he callously overlooked investor protections. Mr.Clayton failed to give an iota of support to anything other than boosting corporate bottom lines. He spoke exclusively about reducing compliance and registration costs for companies, and that is all fine, but not at the expense of critical investor protections and of healthy, stable, and fair markets for the economy at large.  Let's remember why this is important. Without strong protections and disclosures, we will sacrifice investor confidence. And when we sacrifice investor confidence, less capital will flow through our markets. When less capital flows through markets, businesses will struggle to grow and to innovate. In other words, a stable and fair financial sector is vital to our economy as a whole.  My second concern involves Mr.Clayton's potential conflicts of interest. Mr.Clayton has spent his entire career representing big players on Wall Street before, during, and after the crisis. His work has undoubtedly produced many conflicts of interest. As a result, Mr.Clayton will be forced to sit out of numerous important decisions integral to the role of the SEC This is a problem because the SEC currently has just two The absence of Mr.Clayton could very well undermine the agency's ability to prosecute wrongdoing on Wall  Finally, I was alarmed by Mr.Clayton's refusal to answer any questions of substance during his confirmation hearing.  When asked if he would implement congressionally mandated rules, like the provision I wrote into Dodd-Frank requiring corporations to disclose how much money CEOs make in comparison to their employees, Mr.Clayton gave no straight answer.  When asked if he would fairly consider the 1.2 million comments--the greatest number of comments ever received on any SEC rulemaking process by the SEC--urging that companies disclose their political spending, Mr.Clayton gave no straight answer.  Finally, when asked if he would restore the subpoena power of the SEC attorneys so that they can initiate investigations, Mr.Clayton showed his true colors. When it comes to enforcement at the SEC, he said we had to be ``mindful that even the commencement of an investigation can have significant adverse impacts'' on public companies. So instead of explaining his vision as SEC's Chair and the SEC's role as a cop on the beat, he said the agency should consider a company's bottom line before investigating potential wrongdoing. This, to me, is in essence what defines this nominee's approach and this administration's approach: Wall Street profits that prevail over Main Street protections, no matter the risks[[Page S2670]]posed to the American people. It is precisely this kind of thinking that made our system too vulnerable to a financial crisis of epic proportions.  Given Mr.Clayton's inability and refusal to answer basic questions about important issues--like whether he would restore the authority of the Securities and Exchange Enforcement Division or implement the CEO-to-worker pay ratio rule mandated by Congress or require disclosure of corporate political spending--1.2 million citizen comments, the greatest in the history of the SEC--or ensure that retail investors receive advice that is in their best interests--I can't help but conclude that Mr.Clayton appears best suited to continue representing Wall Street rather than to working on behalf of the American people.  The President's nomination of Mr.Clayton is a bow to Wall Street and a cold shoulder to hard-working, middle-class families. I will not be voting for his confirmation.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgS2666-2.txt,791,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,2.0,June
6702,topic-id,1533,"Mr.President, I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania, who is putting forth a powerful message about our values, and that is that every child in America should have access to healthcare, and no one in this Chamber should vote in a process or for a bill that eviscerates that coverage. In fact, our value is that no one in America, including our adults, including our older Americans, including our seniors, and including our children for sure--everyone should have access to affordable healthcare and never have the stress of being worried that if their loved one gets sick, they might not receive the care they need. They should never have the stress of concern that their family member might go bankrupt because they need medical care. It is that value which we are here tonight fighting for, and it is that value which the Republican bill will destroy, ripping healthcare away from millions of So we come here tonight with a battle cry, and that cry is: No hearing, no vote. No hearing, no vote.  We are a democratic republic. We are a legislative Have Members of this Chamber forgotten that we are a ``we the people'' form of government where the people are in charge? The people are not in charge if a secret 13 group of Senators is hiding in the basement crafting a bill to rip healthcare away from millions of people. The people are not in charge if they are afraid to show their bill to everyday They are not in charge if they are planning to destroy healthcare so those with preexisting conditions can't gain access to care.  Never have we seen a group in the majority so against the fundamental principles of our democratic Republic, so against the ``we the people'' vision of our Constitution, and that is why we are calling on them to stop, rethink, remember, absorb the values embedded in our beautiful ``we the people'' They want no public disclosure--fear of how the public will respond. They want no committee hearings--fear of how the people in America will respond. They want no committee amendments because that will take time in which the people can see what is going on and respond. And they want no substantial floor consideration in order to shove this through so they can go and celebrate the Fourth of July with their constituents, while having eviscerated the Constitution of the United States in the process of attending that Fourth of July gathering.  This has been called the vampire bill, the Republican vampire bill. Why? Because the writers of it, the secret 13 writers, are afraid for the bill to see the light of day. It is hiding in the darkness. And it is called the vampire bill because its general intent is to suck the life out of the healthcare system for struggling families, suck the life out of the healthcare system for working families and for middle-class families.  This is quite different from the consideration when we created the system that we have now back in 2009. In that year, in the HELP Committee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--there were 47 hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs, a markup that went for more than a month--the longest markup in that committee in the history of the United States of America; a markup that considered over 300 amendments; a markup with, in fact, a group of Senators, bipartisan, sitting around the table with the television cameras rolling while they debated those amendments and voted on those amendments. And in that committee, they accepted or approved by vote more than 100 minority amendments.  Then there is the Finance Committee, which held 53 hearings and roundtables. In fact, the minutes of the roundtable are available, and if you want to print them out and read them, they go for 800 pages--just the roundtable minutes. And then they had their own Finance Committee markup, where they considered 135 amendments. Then the bill came to the floor in December 2009, and there was 25 days of debate on the floor.  Let's compare that to the plan of the majority leader and the secret 13. Well, how many hearings do they want? They want zero in the HELP How many hearings do they want in the Finance Committee? They want zero. How many Democratic amendments do they want to consider--or Republican amendments--in the HELP or Finance Committee? The answer is zero. How much floor time do they want to have? They want to have just 1 day--just 1 day. They want to introduce it as an amendment to the House TrumpCare bill and pass it on the same day. And how many days do they want experts to be able to weigh in on a healthcare system? But here is the most important zero of all: How much time do they want for the American citizens to be able to see this bill and respond to this bill? They want zero time. That is completely against all the premises of our responsibility as legislators. It is against all the fundamental visions of a body that will deliberate and debate and take into account the opinions of the people and the insights of the experts.  Well, we can turn the clock back not so long ago to the majority leader, who said: ``Fast-tracking a major legislative overhaul such as healthcare reform . . . without the benefit of a full and transparent debate does a disservice to the American people.'' That was Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaking not so long ago. What happened to that value? That was being said when we had 25 days of debate here[[Page S3595]]on the floor; when we had over 100 minority amendments--that is, Republican amendments--accepted; when we had a lengthy debate in the Finance Committee and a lengthy debate in the HELP Committee, but the majority leader wanted more time. Here he is today leading the effort to have zero input from the American public, zero input from healthcare experts, zero committee deliberation, zero bipartisan discussion of the pros and cons.  Well, we can turn to Paul What did he think back in 2009? He said: ``Congress is moving fast to rush through a health care overhaul that lacks a key ingredient: The full participation of you, the American people.''  He went on to write: ``Congress and the White House have focused their public efforts on platitudes and press conferences, while the substance and the details have remained behind closed doors.''  Well, it was kind of a rewriting of history even at that moment in time when he said that when there was a record-setting debate in the HELP Committee, the second longest debate in history in the Finance Committee, television cameras running the whole time, 100 Republican amendments adopted, more than 100 meetings and walkthroughs and roundtables and committee meetings, and 25 days on the floor. But Paul Ryan said that what it was lacking was full participation of you, the American people.  Well, if it was lacking in 2009, what do we say about this when the majority deliberately wants to exclude the American people, when the American people are standing at the door, when they are standing at the windows and they are leaning in and saying: What is in this bill? We want to have a say because it is so important to our families.  And the Republicans are slamming the door, and they are shuttering the windows and saying: We will not share one word with you because we know you won't like what we are doing.  That is not the way democracy is supposed to work.  Erin from Portland wrote because she has been diagnosed with diabetes and is terrified that if the Republican plan goes into effect, she won't be able to afford coverage because of her preexisting condition.

6687,topic-id,359,"Mr.President, this weekend, I was out doing townhalls in rural I was in Klamath County and Lake County--counties that on any map would be described as solidly red. At my townhalls, people were turning out with one huge anxiety; that is, the healthcare bill that might be considered next week, with no consideration in committee, no consideration for amendments, no opportunity for experts to weigh in, and, most importantly, no opportunity for the citizens of America to weigh in.  So two veterans came up to me after one of the townhalls, at the Paisley Saloon, and they asked: Does DC understand the despair, the anxiety in rural Oregon over this healthcare bill plan? The answer, of course, at this point is no, but we hope the answer will be yes.  Then I was visiting a nursing home, and two different individuals I spoke to noted that virtually everyone on long-term care was there through They said: You know, if we lose Medicaid, we are out on the street. As one woman said: I will be out on the street, and I can't walk so that is a problem. Well, yes, it is a problem for folks on long-term care to be dumped onto the street.  That is why, at this moment, I am asking for our normal process for any bill, any modest bill, but certainly a major bill to get thorough democratic consideration in this beautiful, ``we the people,'' democratic Republic, and that means committee hearings, that means experts testifying, and that means input from citizens.

6812,topic-id,2681,"Mr.President, the most important words in our Constitution are the first three--``We the People''--written in a beautiful script and written in a font size so that one can see it from across the room. They set out the mission statement for our Constitution, for our vision of government--not government of, by, and for the privileged and the powerful but government of, by, and for the people, as President Lincoln so eloquently summarized.  It is our responsibility as elected officials to look out for decisions that serve this mission of government of, by, and for the people, to fight in times of trouble for policies that provide a ladder of opportunity and a foundation for families to thrive. But at this very moment, a secret group of 13 Senators is devising a healthcare plan with the intention of bringing it to this floor with no public debate, no committee meeting, and no public notice. They want to just bring it to the floor, have a few hours of debate, and put it forward, even though it will affect millions of It probably will hurt millions of Americans, but the secret 13 want to craft this policy. And why in secret? Because they are plotting a plan that will hurt so many people, they don't want the public involved in the process. They don't want to hear from the citizens from rural America or urban America who are so concerned about the TrumpCare bill--the bill that will immediately destroy healthcare for 14 million Americans; the bill that will immediately undermine the solvency and success of our rural healthcare clinics and our rural hospitals; the bill that breaks every promise the President put forward on healthcare.  It breaks the promise that every person will be covered, breaks the promise that people with preexisting connections will get the same price as everyone else, breaks the promise that the[[Page S3308]]policies will be even better, higher quality. Instead, it guts the essential benefits. It breaks the promise that the insurance will be at a lower cost. In fact, for someone roughly 64 years of age earning about $26,500, their healthcare bill would go from $140 a month to $1,200 a month--a sum that is clearly impossible to pay on an annual income of $26,500. That is why it is being done in secret--because it involves broken promise after broken promise, destroying healthcare in every town and hamlet across  That is quite a contrast to the way ObamaCare was forged. ObamaCare had a yearlong debate. It proceeded to be in committee markup--that means with amendments being offered--in the HELP Committee for about 5 weeks, with television cameras rolling and 150 Republican amendments accepted during that process. Then the Finance Committee had its turn, and it had a very long markup, and it had dozens and dozens, if not 100 or more, Republican amendments adopted. The debate was all over the country. It was in the newspapers. It was in every forum. It was right there, square center, nothing hidden. But this is quite different. The majority leader today has started the rule XIV process, specifically intending to bypass those Senate committees and bring the TrumpCare bill to the Senate floor, completely bypassing government of, by, and for the people.  This is unacceptable. I think my colleagues know it is unacceptable, but they are hoping to do it so quickly and so fast that they will have a minimum of criticism across the country. There should be a maximum amount of criticism on the floor of the Every Senator who believes that this democracy--this democratic Republic--is one in which we do the people's work should see the light of day. The debate should see the light of day in the forging of the bill, as well as the final debate here on the floor.  We know another reason this bill--this replacement or addition or modification of the House bill--is being crafted in secret. That is because the very premise of it is to give a massive tax break to the wealthiest Americans, another promise broken in which Trump said that this would not be done. But there it is, TrumpCare out of the House, $600 billion given away to the richest Americans while devastating healthcare for working  Has no one noticed that we have an incredible gap in income in this country, with massive numbers of people earning very little and a few at the top earning massive amounts? Has no one noticed that we have a huge wealth gap in this Nation, with those at the bottom having few, if any, savings and those at the top having billions upon billions? If we have noticed, then we should care that that is not a foundation for families to thrive. Indeed, it is something that is only made much worse in a bill that takes away the foundation of healthcare--essentially, the quality of life for families across America--and, in turn, takes the savings and gives it to the wealthiest families.  There is a reason to hide this bill. There are a lot of reasons to hide this bill. But it is undemocratic to have this secret group developing this bill with an intention to bring it to the floor without a committee hearing, without public exposure.  Folks back home are very worried, and I would like to share a few of their stories.  Lynda of Talent, OR, who survived her battle with stomach cancer, thanks to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion--Lynda's friend wrote to share her story. Lynda was a self-employed plumber, working hard to get her business off the ground, but she was diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer. Lynda couldn't afford insurance, and she and her husband couldn't afford to pay for treatment out of pocket because they were already paying off enormous debt from care her husband had received.  So what did Lynda do? She ignored the symptoms. She tried to go about her life as best as she could. As her friend wrote, ``She would have died rather than take on more debt that she was not sure she could pay.'' But that changed with the Affordable Care Act the day Lynda found out she would receive coverage under the Oregon Health Plan--Oregon's Medicaid expansion.  Now there is good news to share. Lynda received treatment. She has been cancer-free for almost a year, and her friend describes this as ``nothing short of a miracle.'' ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, delivered a miracle to an individual who was planning just to die rather than get treatment and then could get treatment, thanks to Medicaid expansion, and is now in remission.  TrumpCare is being reworked in secret by 13 of my colleagues out of public sight. It wants to strip away that expansion of Medicaid, wants to rip away the chance for people like Lynda to receive lifesaving care.  Yvonne from Elmira, OR, sent a note to us about the high-risk pools that Republicans want to institute under She says:       Before the ACA existed, I was in our state's high risk pool      because no company would insure me because I had Asthma and      had an ovary removed because of cysts.       The $1500 deductible and $550 per month was hard to pay and      then it only covered 70%.       When I was severely injured in an accident and required      reconstructive surgery I ended up bankrupt.  But then, 2 years ago, she qualified for the Oregon Health Now Yvonne has her medical needs covered at an affordable price and can't be denied coverage or charged a higher premium because of her preexisting conditions. Yvonne, like so many others, would suffer under the Republican plan to strip away the protection for preexisting conditions. She has had an accident, she has had an ovary removed, she has had asthma. It would be extraordinarily difficult for her to get insurance without the protection of everyone being in the same healthcare pool together. If she could get insurance--which is not at all clear--it would be at sky-high, unaffordable prices.  Bernard from Portland wrote to us. He said that an important thing that often gets lost in this whole debate over the future of the Affordable Care Act is the support it gives for Americans to innovate.  In 2011, Bernard in Portland chose to leave his job and pursue his passion of becoming a freelance artist. Here is what he said, in his words:       With my departure, I left behind the security of medical      coverage. For two years, I was not covered by medical      insurance, and fortunately nothing happened, but that is a      gamble nobody should have to take. And it's a gamble that I      could take being under 40 years old, and in relatively good      health.       A person should not have to stay in a job they may not even      like, and could be better filled by someone else, just for      fear of not having medical coverage.  He is right. One of the powerful things that has occurred under ObamaCare is that individuals worked for firms and wanted to become entrepreneurs but were afraid to do so because of the loss of healthcare coverage, but now, either through the expansion of Medicaid or through the exchanges, they can acquire insurance without being part of a large company. That has unleashed entrepreneurship across the country. People are pursuing their dreams and contributing to the economy in all kinds of ways because they can now access healthcare without being part of a company that provides healthcare.  Eventually, Bernard was able to afford a basic coverage plan. But it didn't provide much, and it cost a significant portion of his income, but it all changed with the  An October 2016 survey of American small businesses and a January 2017 followup survey found that one-third of 5,400 small business owners interviewed had the confidence to start their own businesses because they had access to healthcare through the According to the Department of Labor, between 2013 when the ACA went into effect and the end of 2015, the number of self-employed Americans increased by 3.5 percent.  These are just different ways of noting what we hear about all the time--people launching their entrepreneurial efforts, launching their companies because of the confidence they have that they can get healthcare. That is the powerful unleashing of creativity. It is an economic engine. It is a small business driver.  Lisa from Phoenix also wrote to share her powerful story. Lisa's daughter suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, so Lisa has stayed home and[[Page S3309]]cared for her for the last 15 years while her husband worked. Now, thanks to ACA's Medicaid expansion, her family has been able to hire in-home help and it has been transformative.  Lisa's daughter has become more connected to the community, gained new skills and independence, is contributing to household chores, and has shown a great deal more vitality and engagement since the family was able to get some assistance. It has gotten to the point where Lisa can start thinking about her own needs a bit more. In fact, for the first time in quite a while, she is considering taking on a job outside her home to help provide more income.  The ACA isn't just saving lives in emergency health situations or by addressing diseases. It is improving the quality of life for millions of American families like Lisa's.  I will share one more constituent story today. It is hard to pick just one more because there are so many stories coming in each and every day. As we continue to talk about the assault on the health and peace of mind of millions of Americans, I will be coming back to the floor to share those stories coming in from other But this last story comes from Warren in Tigard,  Warren and his wife Joyce have been happily married for over 60 years, but in the last few years, Joyce has been suffering from Alzheimer's. Joyce's disease has progressed very far. Among other things, she has lost her mobility, much of her cognition, and she is wheelchair bound. Her condition has progressed so far that Warren and the home caregivers who were helping him care for his wife just couldn't meet the need requirements any longer, so they admitted Joyce to a nearby adult care facility, where she is now secure, stable, and comfortable. But, as we know, the kind of care Joyce is receiving is expensive. Warren writes:       This care costs $4,000 per month. Our long-term care      insurance is currently covering most of this cost, but only      about 4 months' worth of insurance coverage remains. So we      will have to obtain Medicaid coverage for her continued care.       But proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act could      jeopardize this coverage. I have not anticipated this      disastrous change, but fear it would be a tragedy for both of      us.  Yes, it would be a tragedy for Warren and for Joyce to have TrumpCare pass and dismantle Medicaid and dismantle the exchanges. It would be a tragedy for so many others in similar situations across the country.  Many people don't realize that Medicaid helps pay for nursing home care for more than half of the nursing home residents--residents like But here is TrumpCare, planning to cut $880 billion in direct Medicaid spending. It is basically: Well, too bad Warren and too bad We want to save some money so we can give big tax breaks to the wealthiest  I must say, there is not a lot of caring in that perspective. It embodies a principle, but is it really the principle we want in the United States of America--the principle that the goal of the majority party is to take away from those who have little to give more to those who have most? Is that really the principle my Republican colleagues want to embrace on the floor of the Senate?  Is that really the principle the secret 13 with their secret meetings out of public sight to develop a new version of TrumpCare want to embrace? I would suggest that is simply wrong. It is wrong from the point of view of providing an opportunity for all Americans to thrive. It is wrong from a moral point of view to pull healthcare--and the peace of mind that comes with healthcare--out of the hands of struggling Americans and working Americans across our country.  Finally, I want to address one more issue. We heard earlier today that Anthem is pulling out of Why are they pulling out? Because of President Why is that connected? Because he refuses to confirm that his administration will make the cost-sharing reduction payments that have been part of the Affordable Care Those payments reduce the premiums. Those payments proceed also to reduce the level of deductibles so you get more care sooner. So insurance companies don't know whether to raise their insurance policy a little or a tremendous amount, and that instability means they simply can't price their policies.  In addition, my Republican colleagues have assaulted the risk quarters, or reinsurance programs, that make it possible for an insurance company to go into a new market and know that if they get a disproportionate share of sick patients, they will get compensated for that risk and that result. So that reinsurance is essential for more companies to be in a particular market.  Moreover, the administration proceeded to not spend the money on advertising in the last stage of signups and reduced the number of people who were in the markets. So that is another assault on the stability of health insurance in This is a deliberate, straight-out effort to undermine healthcare in America to the disadvantage of millions of It is being done by the President without any action even happening on TrumpCare here in the It is wrong. It is hurting a lot of people, and the President should stop.  With that, I conclude my comments.  Thank you, Mr. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

6629,topic-id,467,"Mr.President, 100 years ago today, Lions Clubs International was created in Chicago, IL, and today the Senate is considering adoption of this resolution, 174, commemorating this tremendous occasion. One hundred years later, Lions Clubs International is the world's largest service club, with more than 1.4 million members who participate in more than 46,000 clubs across the globe.  In my State of Kansas alone, we have more than 270 Lions Clubs, and I have been a member of Lions Clubs since I graduated from college, went to work, and got involved in the community. I have seen firsthand how Lions Clubs make a significant difference in the communities they are in, as well as their reach around the globe in addressing problems in their communities and humanitarian needs around the world. Lions are committed to caring for those less fortunate, from young to old, and they do so in a way that shows care and compassion. It is all about the right motivation. They care about people, and they make a difference. It is this selfless service and commitment to a greater good that is needed in our country today.  In the face of serious challenges, I believe those who volunteer their time and their resources in community civic clubs, not-for-profits, schools and fundraisers, in churches and charities are the ones who have the greatest impact on people's lives. This kind of involvement at the local level has the potential to make meaningful and tangible differences in the lives of people around us, perhaps more so than even the best intentioned Federal programs that come from the Nation's I am of the view that we change the world one soul, one person at a time, and it happens in Lions Clubs and their efforts in their communities and globally every day.  Over their 100 years of existence, the Lions Clubs have supported the blind, encouraged the young, provided relief to those struck by tragedy, and fought to eradicate disease. They have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to humanitarian work internationally and are committed to serving 100 million people around the globe.  As we reflect upon all the good that has come from the last 100 years among Lions Clubs members, may our commitment to our neighbors, our communities, and our fellow men and women be strengthened and renewed. Today, Lions Clubs begin another century of service to others as they seek out ways to better our world.  I offer my congratulations to Bob Corlew of Milton, TN, who is the international president, and I welcome Lions members from around the globe as they gather in Chicago later this month for their international convention. From 100 years ago in Chicago to this month, 100 years in which they celebrate their birth, the Lions Clubs motto is ``We serve.''

6707,topic-id,1868,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Hawaii for convening us here tonight.  This isn't theoretical. This isn't about numbers. This is about real people. We know them. They exist throughout our  I have told this story a few times before on the floor of the When I think about the progress that has been made over the course of the last 6 years, I think about Betty Betty is a woman who lives in Meriden, Betty and her husband did everything we asked them to do. They were morally upstanding citizens, contributed to their community, had full employment, raised good kids.  Her husband switched jobs. He switched jobs, and he had a 1-week, maybe a 2-week period of time in between those two jobs. As luck--or lack of it--would have it, during that brief intermission between employment, their son was diagnosed with cancer. The cancer then became a preexisting condition, which meant her husband's new employer would not cover the son as part of a family plan. The cancer progressed and progressed and progressed, and this family, the Burgers, had no means to keep up with the payments.  Their story, unfortunately, is not foreign to folks who have heard from constituents who have gone bankrupt because of healthcare costs. The Burgers lost everything. The Burgers first went through their savings, then they went into their son's college account, then they sold their car, then they sold their house. They lost everything they had trying to make sure they had healthcare for their son simply because he got diagnosed with cancer during the one tiny interim between their family's insurance coverage. That preexisting condition doomed that family. There but for the grace of God--that could be us. That could happen to any one of us.  Yet, today, medical bankruptcy is, frankly, a thing of the past. Why? Well, it is not because healthcare costs any less; it is because we said we are not going to allow insurance companies to deny coverage to someone because they have a cancer diagnosis. In fact, we are not going to allow insurance companies to charge you more just because you are sick. Guess what. People have been able to keep their college savings account. They have been able to keep their car. They have been able to keep their house even if they get sick. That is what this bill has meant. Twenty million more people are insured, yes, but the number of personal bankruptcies in this country has plummeted by 50 percent, almost entirely because there aren't Burgers any longer. There aren't people who had to live through what the Burger family had to live through.  That is what this is about. This is about real people who are going to go through miserable, terrible experiences because of the bill Senate Republicans are just days away from putting onto the floor.  I know my colleagues have covered this exhaustively, but I just want to show visually what CBO says the House bill does.  I know it is in vogue for the President and Republicans to say that ObamaCare is in a death spiral, but that is not what CBO says. CBO says that if you keep the Affordable Healthcare Act and actually implement it rather than undermine it, rather than sabotage it, as the President of the United States is today, the number of people who don't have health insurance will remain fairly stable from 2017 to 2026. It is about 28 million people. But if you enact the American Health Care Act, the bill that passed through the House, that number goes almost immediately from about 26 million up to 40 million. Right about 14 million people lose insurance right off the bat. Like within a heartbeat of passing this bill, about 14 million people will lose insurance, and then, over time, it grows to 51 million people. That is not the affordable healthcare act in a death spiral. That is market stability. This is a death spiral. The death spiral starts upon passage of the act being secretly negotiated today.  I get it that 23 million is kind of a hard number to get your head wrapped around. What does 23 million people really mean? These numbers are so huge. So here is what 23 million people is. It is the entire population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and let's just throw in West That is what 23 million people is. That is a humanitarian catastrophe.  Remember, 23 million people is what you get to at the end of 10 years, but 14 million people lose it right off the bat. There is no way for our healthcare system to provide coverage to 14 million people who had insurance one day and then don't have it the next. By the way, they tend to be the sickest people because that is who is going to lose healthcare first.  Why are we doing this? Why would you choose to inflict this kind of pain on people? Why would you ask to run for Congress in order to put this kind of hurt on the American public?  Here is the answer. I wish this weren't the answer. I wish there were a different answer, but here is the answer. Twenty-three million people lose health insurance, and the cost of that is about $800 billion of money out of the healthcare system. It is not coincidence that that then gets transferred into 650 or so odd-billion dollars in tax breaks for the pharmaceutical companies, the insurance companies, and for really, really rich people. It is not just by accident that it worked out that the amount of money you took from poor people and from middle-class people and from sick people is the exact amount of money you are transferring to the pharmaceutical industry, the insurance industry, and rich people.  Here is another way of looking at it. Here is where the tax cuts go: The lowest quintile, the second quintile, the middle quintile, even the fourth quintile don't get a lot of money out of this tax break. It is the top quintile, the top 20 percent of income earners who get an average tax cut of $2,700.  Here is the big benefit: The top 1 percent of income earners--a $37,000 tax cut out of this bill. The top 1 percent of income earners get a $37,000 tax cut from this bill. Let me say that again: 23 million people lose healthcare so that the top 1 percent of income earners get a $37,000 tax cut. Who runs for Congress to do that? What constituency is asking for the U.Congress to pass a bill that takes health insurance from all sorts of working Americans, people who are playing by the rules--people like the Burgers--in order to pass a tax cut for the super wealthy?  I don't know what is happening behind those closed doors. I don't know[[Page S3601]]exactly what they are talking about, but I am going to guarantee you that it is not fundamentally different than what the House bill did, which is what I am describing here. There are still massive numbers of people losing healthcare, rich people getting a tax cut, and lots of folks getting hurt. Why? Just because Republicans made a political promise to do this.  I know I have other colleagues who want to talk. Let me turn for a moment to this process because the process does matter. The majority is breaking the They are breaking the Don't think this will not be how this works if you are in the minority. The fact is, we acknowledge that there is a lot that is still very wrong with the American healthcare system. Our constituents command us to try to make those things better. We would love nothing more than to sit down with the Republicans and try to figure out how we can come together on a path forward to make this healthcare system better. I know you don't believe us, but you didn't even try.  I am not sure we believed you at the beginning of 2009 when you said: We want to help people get insurance. We watched Republicans have control of the Presidency and the House and the time Senate for a long time without a lot of progress being made, but Democrats tried.  Democrats spent a whole year sitting down with the Republicans, trying to figure out if there was common ground--holding committee processes, exhaustive hearings. There were 30 days of Senate debate on the floor. I get it; in the end Republicans didn't support that package. I get that Republicans can lay blame at the feet of Democrats for not crafting something that could win Republican support. I understand how that argument works.  The fact is that when Democrats were in the majority, they tried. They opened up the committee process. They let everyone in the public see the debate we were having. Why? Because it is a big deal.  We are talking about one-fifth to one-sixth of the American economy. If you are talking about reordering that biggest segment of the U.economy, if you are talking about millions of people benefiting or losing, that shouldn't happen behind closed doors.  My constituents, even though they are represented by Democrats, have no fewer rights than the citizens of Iowa or the citizens of Texas who are represented by Why are my constituents not allowed to see the details of what is about to happen to their lives? Why are only a select group of Americans able to have a voice inside that room? Why are the people of Connecticut going to get 3 minutes to look at this bill once it hits the Senate floor? My constituents are Americans, just as the constituents in Republican States are They deserve to know what is about to happen to them.  You are breaking the It will not get put back together that easily. These are tough questions. They are partisan questions, but it doesn't mean there is not an obligation to try to find common ground. If you can't find common ground, don't bury the proceedings behind closed doors where nobody can see it.  People hate this bill. They hate this bill. They hate it in part because they don't trust the process. When they see this balance--tax breaks for pharma, insurance, and rich people--and then losing coverage, they want to know why they lose and why super rich people win, but they can't get answers because it is all happening behind closed doors.  It is not too late. I will just end there. Senator Schatz said it right: It is not too late. My Republican colleagues can reject this and say: Let's start over. Let's sit down and see if there are some Democrats who want to work on stabilizing these exchanges, seeing if there is some middle ground, being able to build a bipartisan consensus when it comes to the future of the healthcare system.  It is not too late. I think you are going hear that consistently from my colleagues this evening.  I yield the floor.

6712,topic-id,328,"I think we all got a gut punch earlier today. We received news that the young man who just returned from North Korea, after being abused and tortured there, had passed. If you read the statement from his family, it was hard to read. You couldn't help but read that without feeling your heart drop into your stomach. Why? Because this was a young man with such promise ahead of him, who had that future robbed from him.  I didn't know him. My colleague didn't know him. The people in my State who were similarly affected didn't know him, yet they felt something.  I think the reason this bill is so wildly unpopular is that people are going to die. The fact is, if people don't get coverage for addiction, if folks who are mentally ill don't get to see a doctor, they aren't going to survive. Even those who have enough money to be able to pay for the premium increases in this bill--they know there is something a little evil in wanting to do this to people.  As my colleague remarked, even if you are not amongst the 23 million people who lose insurance, the CBO also says your rates are going up because when those people don't get health insurance, they show up somewhere else in the system. They show up at the emergency rooms. They get much more expensive care. That cost gets passed on to the rest of us.  Even if you are lucky enough not to be amongst the 23 million, you are going to be personally, financially affected by this. The CBO says that everyone's rates will go up by 15 to 20 percent. Even if it is not the money you care about, we are all connected, and nobody should want this to happen to people.

6714,topic-id,319,"I think it is important to understand what the law says. The[[Page S3602]]law says there is only one healthcare provider that by law has to treat every single person who comes in the door; they can't turn away individuals based upon their ability to pay. That is the emergency room.  What we also know is that the emergency room is the place you get the most expensive care. By the time you get there, you are often in crisis. The care you receive in the emergency room is expensive, and then all of the care you need afterward is expensive as well.  I always remember a woman from Connecticut who lost her Medicaid coverage. In losing her Medicaid coverage, she didn't end up being able to see a doctor for an infection she had in her foot. It was hurting her for a long time, that infection. She didn't have Medicaid any longer, so she just decided to let it hurt. She popped some Tylenol and hoped it would go away. One day it was so painful that she went to the emergency room, and it was too late. It was too late. Her foot had become so badly infected that she had to have that foot--that leg below her knee--amputated.  She had no insurance, so we all picked up the cost of that, but she had her life altered in a way that is hard for us to fathom, and there is not a single winner in that scenario because, obviously, her entire life is changed because of that.  It is not as if we had saved any money in treating her so shabbily because we ended up having to cover all of those costs. That is one story. If you think about what the House bill does, it repeats that story millions of times over. It is morally bankrupt, but it is also fiscally imprudent and foolish.

6718,topic-id,402,"I appreciate that shout out to You are right. The idea of the House is that it is supposed to respond, perhaps, more quickly to the temporary passions of the public, which is ironic, given that the passion of the public today is in deep opposition to this piece of legislation. Unfortunately, the House is responding to the passions of one very small portion of the public, which is the extreme Republican base, which maybe is the only remaining segment of this country that supports the American Health Care  This place is supposed to be able to step back and look at the long term and look at the long view. That is why we have 6-year terms, so we don't do something that may feel good in the moment politically but has devastating impacts over the course of time. That is exactly what this debate is about. It is about a massive reordering of one-fifth of our economy that has just enormous consequences over time, when these people who lose insurance start to feel the effects of that as they bleed through their savings over 5 or 10 years and go bankrupt at the back end of that time period.  So this is a place where both parties should be able to sit down and talk about what this really means for folks. I thought Senator Schatz put it well. When you don't engage in regular order, not only do you do things that are very partisan and political, but you also do things that don't make sense.  One of the things that regular order brings is the ability to talk to experts. We all sit on committees, and those committees bring experts to the table to tell us what the impact of legislation is. There has been no committee process on this bill. We haven't had a single committee meeting. We had one hearing in the HELP committee upon which I sit.  So as Senator Schatz said, the result is a product that is garbage--that, logistically, does not work because neither the House nor the Senate engaged in the kind of deliberation that would get you to the facts. Yes, this place is supposed to work differently, but also you are supposed to use the committee process to make sure that you are not passing something that just makes sense politically but makes sense from a policy standpoint as well.

6806,topic-id,611,"Mr.President, I come to the floor very briefly to make what, I hope, is a reasonable recommendation to my colleagues on both sides.  We are due to vote later today on moving forward on a piece of legislation that I support. Last week, we voted out of the Foreign Relations Committee a new sanctions bill against the Iranian regime for its continued movement toward a ballistic missile program that, ultimately, could threaten the security of the Middle East and could threaten the security of our sacred ally in the region, It also speaks to Iran's continued problematic human rights record and its support for terrorism in the region.  We should move forward on this piece of legislation, but I would recommend that we not do so today. There is reason to have this debate, but given the terrorist attack that occurred in Iran, given the fact that today we know that there are 12 dead and 40 wounded in 2 very coordinated attacks, my worry is that, literally, at the moment of grieving in Iran, this resolution would look as directed not at the regime, as it is, but at the Iranian people. It would seem intemperate and, ultimately, do more damage than good.  This is an important resolution to debate. We can find the time to get this done, but given the unfortunate timing--obviously, not intentional in our moving this forward this week--given the attacks that just occurred and for which ISIS has claimed responsibility, I would hope that we could find a way[[Page S3305]]to move this to another time. I think it is really important because, ultimately, it is in the United States' national security interest for the Iranian people to get their way, who are, broadly speaking, Western-oriented and who, broadly speaking, want a democratic, internationalist future.  In everything we do, we need to make it clear that we have deep disagreements with the Iranian regime--its rhetoric toward Israel, its inflaming of tensions, its funding of proxy wars in the region--and that our beef is not with the people of From time to time, that is a difficult distinction to make, but it is a very important distinction to make. By choosing to postpone this debate and this vote to another time, I think we will send an important message to the Iranian people that we want to give them the time to grieve and that we want to give them the time to understand the scope of this attack.  I do not think it comes at much of a cost or loss to us. It is important to remember that when we were attacked on September 11, there were vigils held throughout The regime itself was not sponsoring those, but the Iranian people did stand up and, in substantial numbers, displayed a common cause with the people of this country--again, another sign that this disagreement is not with the people of Iran but with the regime.  Despite my having some reservations about this piece of legislation--I do not endorse it wholeheartedly, but I am a supporter of it and will vote for it when it comes to the floor of the Senate--I would hope that the leadership on both sides of the aisle might find a path so as to give the people of Iran some grieving space, to make sure that we are not sending the wrong message with this vote this afternoon, and to find some time later this summer to take up a very, very important issue.

6695,topic-id,1557,"Mr.President, Democrats come to the floor this evening as a voice for the people we represent, to fight back against Republican plans to jam TrumpCare through this Senate, increase healthcare costs, and hurt families across the country. Republican leaders may hope that nobody pays attention. They can hope that they can go into these secret rooms and cut secret deals and come out with a TrumpCare bill that they can jam through before anybody notices.  We are not going to allow that to happen. We are here. We are going to fight back. I can only hope that just a few Republicans will decide to listen to their constituents, reverse course, and work with us to improve healthcare instead of standing with President Trump to destroy it.  I start by talking about a constituent of mine whose story I heard and whose voice and perspective should be a part of this debate.  Her name is She is from Spokane, which is in my home State of Lisa served our country in the Navy for 6 years. She goes to school. She works part time, and she says she relies on Medicaid to afford the healthcare she needs. She is very worried that, if TrumpCare passes, she will not only suffer from cuts to Medicaid, but she will lose her coverage altogether because, like many Americans, she has a preexisting condition--asthma.  Lisa is not alone. There are millions of people just like her in Washington State and across this country, and each of them--every patient, every family--has a stake in this fight. They deserve to be a part of this debate, and they have a right to know how TrumpCare would impact them if it is signed into law.  That should not be a partisan sentiment. I have heard Republicans come to the floor time and again, demanding transparency, railing against secrecy, calling for hearings. One Republican Senator who is now the chairman of the Senate HELP Committee came here to the Senate floor back in 2009 to blast Democrats for writing an amendment ``in secret.'' He said: ``None of us on the Republican side knew what was in it,'' and he accused Democrats of trying to pass our bill ``before the American people find out what's in it.''  My friend, the chairman of the HELP Committee, is certainly not alone. Back then, the current Republican majority leader said: ``This massive piece of legislation that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy is being written behind closed doors, without input from anyone, in an effort to jam it past not only the Senate but the American people.''  That was not true back then. We held dozens of bipartisan hearings and meetings over months and months and months. But it is what Republicans are doing right now.  The chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, whom I respect and would never think would be a part of an effort like this, told me that he was not planning to hold a single hearing on The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which is where a lot of work on this bill should be getting done, told my friend the Senator from Missouri that he was not going to hold a hearing either.  There are reports now that Republicans actually have the text of their bill--something is written and almost ready. Democrats do not get to see that bill. People across the country are being kept in the dark. Republican leaders are treating it like President Trump's tax returns and are not allowing it to see the light of day. It is absurd, and it is unprecedented.  We could be just days away from a massive bill being jammed through this Senate, and many Republican Senators are telling press and constituents that they could not even say what was in the bill if they wanted to because they have not seen it either. This bill is so secret that even President Trump's top health adviser, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, told us in a hearing last week that he has not seen how TrumpCare is being changed in the back rooms of the  Let me ask this. Why are Republican leaders so focused on keeping their TrumpCare work secret? Why are they keeping it locked down so tight and not letting people see what is even in it? What are they so ashamed of?  One Republican Senate aide was quoted as saying: ``We aren't stupid.'' In other words, Republicans know it would be ``stupid'' to put this bill in the public because they know that people across the country--the people they are supposed to represent--would hate it.  That explains a lot.  Republican leaders--those who are writing this TrumpCare bill in secret--know that they would not be able to go back home and defend it. They know that the more people who learn about what is actually in it and what the fine print might mean for them and their families the more people back home are going to rise up and fight back. So they want to keep it wrapped up tight, under lock and key--no hearings, no scrutiny, no public input. When they first announced their secret working group, not even any women were in it. Republican leaders are in their back rooms, desperately trying to cut those final deals, doing whatever they can to bully those last few Republicans into supporting something they know their constituents will hate.  We are here tonight to say that enough is enough. This has to end. Healthcare is too important, and TrumpCare would be too devastating to allow this kind of secrecy to continue.  We do not know exactly what is in the TrumpCare bill that is being written in secret, but--do you know what?--we have a pretty good idea. No matter how much lipstick they put on this pig, based on everything we have heard, this is going the same way that TrumpCare went in the House, and the impact on patients and families would be just as bad. There would be higher costs for families, especially seniors and people with preexisting conditions. Insurance companies would no longer be required to cover basic healthcare--things like maternity care or mental health services, and much more. Women would lose access to see their doctors and the care they need at Planned Parenthood, and millions of people across the country would see their Medicaid coverage taken away.  That means that, nationwide, people who are finally getting treatment for substance use disorders, like opioid addiction, or mental healthcare or access to a primary care doctor under Medicaid are going to lose that access.  This would be so devastating for families across the country. Over the past year, I have had so many families in my home State who have lost a loved one to the opioid crisis. In Bellingham, in Spokane--in community after community--the story is always the same. I have heard directly from people on the path to recovery, like Tyler in Yakima and Mechele in the Tri-Cities, who told me how getting treatment changed their lives for the better.  I could not imagine that any Senator would want to go home, look in his constituents' eyes, and tell them that he helped pass a bill that would take away the tools that those communities need to fight this crisis, but that is what my Republican colleagues are planning to do as we speak.  Let's remember that all of this damage would be done--why?--to give a massive tax break to special interests in the health industry and to hand President Trump a hollow political win. It is truly shameful and it needs to stop.  Last week, we learned that President Trump is now saying that the House bill is ``mean.'' That is, certainly, an understatement from a President who does not often do subtlety, and it is pretty surprising to hear after we all saw him celebrate the House bill at the White House when it passed.  Here is the truth: The House TrumpCare bill is not just mean; it is[[Page S3588]]devastating. The Senate TrumpCare bill is going to be just as bad, no matter how they try to spin it or how many side deals they cut to claim it has changed.  I have a message for Senate Republicans who are so ashamed of what is in this bill that they are keeping it secret: It is not too late to change course. It is not too late to bring this process out from the shadows. It is not too late to be honest with people across the country about what you are doing. It is not too late to listen to the voices of people like It is not too late to abandon this plan to jam TrumpCare through If you do that, if you stop, Democrats stand ready, as we always have, to work with you to actually make healthcare more affordable and accessible for patients and families across the country.  People across the country are watching. They are paying attention to this. They are not going to allow Republicans to slip this through without any scrutiny, and we Democrats are here to say, loud and clear, that we are going to keep fighting to make sure they have a voice.

So, last night, I had a telephone townhall meeting in my State of Florida and 6,000 people joined. They asked questions for an hour. Often, they would get through asking their question and they would say: I wish you guys could work together. So that is what we have been hearing in all of these speeches.  Well, let me give one suggestion that would lower premiums in the existing law, the Affordable Care Act, 13 percent. I had it costed out in Every now and then, you are going to have a catastrophic loss. It is kind of like when I was the elected insurance commissioner of Florida, and I inherited the mess after the monster hurricane. Hurricane Andrew was such a monster hurricane that it took down a number of insurance companies because the losses were so big. So we had to try to get insurance companies to come back into We created a reinsurance fund. We called it the Florida Hurricane Catastrophic Fund, which would reinsure, or insure, the insurance companies against catastrophic loss.  That is what we can do right here. We could be like my poor constituent, Megan, who fought cancer for 2 years, with two transplants, and ultimately lost the battle, but the bill was $8 million. That is hard for any insurance company to swallow, but those are going to be limited, isolated cases.  Why don't we create a reinsurance fund for the marketplace in the Affordable Care Act to help the insurance companies with catastrophic loss? I asked: If we did that in Florida, with the Florida marketplace, what would it mean? It would reduce the insurance premiums under the marketplace in Florida by 13 percent. That is just one suggestion.  Every one of us has a suggestion. Put all of these suggestions together, and we are talking about really fixing the current law, instead of this roadway we see our friends on the other side of the aisle going down--a solution that is going to take coverage away from 22 million people and is going to cut $800 billion out of Medicaid and eviscerate Medicaid or that is going to charge older Americans over younger Americans five times as much as the younger.

6896,topic-id,335,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.2258, as amended, which will allow current servicemembers who have military experience operating commercial motor vehicles to more easily obtain a commercial driver's license.  In 2015, Congress included a provision in the FAST Act to allow States to waive the written CDL knowledge test for drivers with military commercial motor vehicle driving experience, but it restricts the waiver to former members of the military. There are a significant number of current reservists and members of the National Guard with military commercial motor vehicle experience who could benefit from the waiver. This legislation allows them to more easily use the skills they learned serving our country to earn a decent wage and feed their families.  These servicemen and servicewomen receive from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, what they describe as thorough and comprehensive training, including many hours of behind-the-wheel training--something that we have long advocated for as a requirement for civilian drivers. There is a shortage of commercial truck drivers, and these well-trained military drivers are exactly the type of individuals that we would want to help enter the trucking profession.  Using its existing exemption authority, FMCSA has already taken action to make current servicemembers eligible for the knowledge test waiver on a temporary basis. Last October, FMCSA issued an exemption that allows States to waive the CDL knowledge test for trained military truck drivers, whether they are current members of the military or veterans.  FMCSA cited the fact that training these drivers receive in the military includes ``many hours of classroom training, practical skills training, and on-the-road training that are essential for safe driving.'' However, FMCSA's temporary exemption expires in October 2018. This bill would make permanent the ability for current members of the military to utilize the FAST Act waiver.

6755,topic-id,1410,"Mr.President, I have always believed that elected officials should do more listening than talking.  The breadth of issues that we address here in the Senate is as vast and diverse as our We rely on input from experts, from stakeholders, and from constituents to craft responsible, meaningful policy. In the past month alone, I have had the opportunity to attend bipartisan hearings on cyber security, countering violent extremism, self-driving cars, rural broadband, nuclear defense policy, and the posture of our Armed Forces, just to name a few. These issues are vital to our economy and our national security, and they are worthy of the time and effort that went into convening these very important hearings.  But over the same timespan, the Senate did not hold a single hearing on healthcare, while a handful of Republican Members drafted a flawed healthcare bill behind closed doors.  Healthcare policy is unique. It is very complex, while also being deeply personal. Throughout our lives, doctors and nurses are with us for some of our most significant moments. Whether it is responding to trauma in an emergency, helping us live with chronic conditions, devising treatment plans for an ailing parent, or delivering a newborn child, our medical professionals are there for us when we are at our most vulnerable.  We are all vulnerable. Life does not discriminate. Anyone can get in a car accident and need months of physical therapy. Anyone can be diagnosed with cancer and require surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Anyone can have a son or daughter born with cystic fibrosis. But in this great country, I believe no one should ever go bankrupt because they get sick, and no one should ever die because they cannot afford quality health insurance.  I believe healthcare policy is very complex, and we have to work very hard at it, but I am also guided by a very simple moral concept: No matter who you are and no matter where you live in this country, no citizen should ever be forced into bankruptcy because they are sick and no one should ever die because they can't afford quality insurance.  I urge my colleagues to use the coming days to think about their goals for healthcare in our Nation and be guided by their own moral conscience. Passing a politically expedient proposal that can get 51 Republican votes after significant arm-twisting so that the Senate can move on to tax reform is not in the best interest of the American people, and I believe it is simply irresponsible.  I believe that we should provide the best care possible to as many Americans as possible while making sure that it is affordable. Now, I honestly can't say whether my Republican colleagues share these goals, but I can say[[Page S3812]]that the Senate healthcare bill that we saw this week does not hit the mark. I urge my colleagues to use the coming days to really think about what this bill will mean for the families in their  I feel fortunate that Michiganders have been willing to share their heartfelt stories with me in recent years. They are fearful that repealing the Affordable Care Act will not only put them in jeopardy but also their friends, family, and neighbors.  I have heard from Amy from Metro She is 53 years old and has type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes. Amy is a self-employed small business owner. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies viewed her diabetes diagnosis as a preexisting condition and were able to charge her more because of it. After the Affordable Care Act was implemented, Amy was able to shop around and find a much more affordable plan with the same level of benefits that she had before. While Amy does not qualify for subsidies to help purchase insurance, she was still able to cut her healthcare costs in half because of the Affordable Care Amy fears--and rightfully so--that if the Republican healthcare bill passes, her costs may skyrocket, jeopardizing her business and everything she has worked her entire life for.  I have heard from Tammy, who lives in Marne, Tammy's daughter Erin is 10 years old. Erin was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at 18 months. She takes 23 pills and does 2 hours of breathing treatments each and every day. She is a fighter, and her whole family has pulled together to support her, but they are also very worried about her future. Erin's family has private insurance, but they supplement the high cost of her care through Tammy is afraid that the $800 billion cut to Medicaid will jeopardize their ability to afford Erin's care and would cast an absolutely devastating blow to their family.  Finally, take Stefanie from Livonia, Stefanie worked her entire life in the customer service industry, primarily in retail and in restaurants. She was never offered health insurance by her previous employers, and, until the Affordable Care Act, she never had health insurance as an adult. Then, in December 2015, Stephanie's third floor apartment caught fire, and she was left to make a horrific decision about whether to jump from her third floor apartment or die inside the burning building. Well, Stefanie jumped from the window to save her life, and she sustained serious injuries, including a broken back and a shattered foot. Because of the Affordable Care Act, she was able to receive treatment for her injuries, which included a month's stay in the hospital, multiple surgeries, and absolutely excruciating physical therapy to finally heal in the end. Stephanie's treatment came in close to $700,000, an amount that would surely bankrupt nearly any  These stories and many more are what health insurance is truly about. For people like Stefanie, Amy, and Erin, we should do more listening than talking. We should listen to Stefanie, Amy, and Erin, and we should listen to the hundreds of healthcare experts who have expressed their strong opposition to this bill and the impact that it will have on the healthcare system in this country.  I would urge my colleagues to listen to the AARP, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Diabetes Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Heart Association, the American Medical Association, the Children's Hospital Association, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, and the National Council on Aging, just to name a few.  I am not just hearing from these national groups. I am also hearing from local healthcare professionals all across my Hospitals and community clinics in Michigan--particularly, the ones in the rural areas--are telling me this bill could cause them to close their doors. This will jeopardize access to care in communities that are already medically underserved. Costs will go up for seniors and individuals with preexisting conditions, like  No one chooses to get sick. But when we are confronting a disease or injury, health insurance is a lifeline. It allows us to get better, to get back on our feet, and it simply allows us to keep living.  In American society, healthcare coverage is our promise that if you work hard and you play by the rules, you will have the healthcare you need when you need it the most. As I have already said, no one in this great country should be forced into bankruptcy because they are sick, and no one--no one--should ever die because they can't afford quality insurance.  The Republican healthcare bill is irresponsible. This bill will strip away health insurance from 22 million This bill would put more and more Americans at risk of financial ruin from unpaid medical bills, and it would put more Americans at risk of dying because they can't afford the care they so desperately need.  This bill cannot and should not be salvaged with minor tweaks and arm-twisting to win a few votes.  I urge my colleagues to go back to the drawing board and begin an open, bipartisan process where we all listen to our constituents, hold hearings with experts, and work together to keep what works and to fix what doesn't. Let's let common sense rule the day and not partisan ideology. We should do what is best for our folks back home and ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare.

6978,topic-id,372,"Mr.Chair, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R.1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection This important legislation is meant to proactively prevent major utility reliability problems before they happen.  Currently, electric cooperatives in my district own transmission lines which cross lands managed by the U.Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to provide essential services to rural areas. I've heard from my electric coops that before addressing problems with these transmission lines, such as clearing downed trees or excess debris near utility poles, they must first be granted approval to do the work from these federal agencies. Any delay in receiving approval costs time, money, and amplifies the impacts of major power outages to my constituents.  Currently, electric coops can be held responsible for damages if a tree falls on a power line and causes a fire, even if the coop is still awaiting approval to work on clearing the hazardous debris.  H.1873 will save utilities unnecessary costs and improve electricity reliability for consumers by streamlining outdated federal land management policies. The language minimizes the need for case-by-case approvals and instead provides expedited review and approvals for routine vegetation management and maintenance activities. Cutting red tape will make it easier for electric utility companies to initiate preventative measures to manage vegetation and woody debris on right-of-way transmission lines. This proactive work will mitigate the effects of fires and storms by clearing hazardous material before the natural disaster hits.  Just two weeks ago, a major storm with winds up to seventy miles-per-hour blew through my district and left thousands of my constituents without power. The strong winds downed trees and took out power lines, severely damaged homes and businesses, and ripped the roofs off of barns. Lengthy power outages delay the repairs needed to get storm victims' lives back on track. So I am eager to support legislation which helps my communities recover from these painful storms as fast as possible.  Storms like these are commonplace in Our electric coops are ready to complete the work necessary to mitigate the effects of these disasters as much as possible so consumers can have better access to electricity, especially during natural disasters.

I suppose I can make a partisan speech with the best of them, but we are called upon during these very trying days to speak not as partisans but as patriots and as constitutional patriots.  I have been a professor of constitutional law for 27 years at American[[Page H4348]]University's Washington College of Law, and I am aware that the Founders of this country were determined to see that while we acted as partisans in the normal push and pull of legislative politics, when it comes to the basic character of our democracy, all of us try to need to act in a way that is consistent with the constitutional values that unify us.  Thomas Jefferson said: ``If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all.''  And George Washington said that we should never forget that the word ``party'' comes from the French word ``partie.'' One part, each party is one part of the whole, and we have to try to keep our mind focused on the whole thing.  Well, the whole country is in danger right now. The events of the last week have been breathtaking and extraordinary. So let's take a moment to try to catch our breath to remember what is really at stake with the Russian connection, with the firing of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn after 24 days, with the firing of FBI Director James Comey this week after he refused to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn, and the Russian connection.  All of this is about, in the big picture, an organized and systematic assault on the American form of government and our Democratic political institutions.  During the 2016 Presidential election, 17 of our U.intelligence agencies, including the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and more than a dozen of others, got together and produced a report where they said, with a very high degree of certainty, that Vladimir Putin and Russian agents had an organized campaign orchestrated to engage in cyber espionage of the United States of America and our political institutions, and cyber sabotage of our political institutions with paid operatives working to disseminate fake news and propaganda, and to engineer leaks of mixtures of real emails mixed in with fake news, and so on.  All of it meant to throw the Presidential election, to destroy the chances of Hillary Clinton, and to destabilize American political democracy. We know that this modus operandi was used before the 2016 election in America, and it was used again after, as recently as the election in the Netherlands with Mr.Wilders, who was the favorite of Vladimir Putin, and then again in France with Marine Le Pen and the National Front where Mr.Putin and his operatives did a data dump the weekend before the French Presidential election.  Right before the blackout on campaigning, they again orchestrated hacks of the Macron campaign, and then tried to put out, again, a complete disinformation package on behalf of Le  Well, the intelligence agencies warned us that this was just a dress rehearsal for 2020. This is what Vladimir Putin is doing. He is trying to organize every dictator, despot, and kleptocrat on Earth together to destroy the liberal democracies, from the outside and from the inside.  Now, militarily, he is no match for the United States of Economically, he is no match for the United States of Intellectually, in terms of our political institutions and the democracy we have built, our Constitution, he is no match for  But he perceives a weakness, and the weakness is all about the internet because the internet links the whole world together. And if he can use the internet in order to hack into our institutions, both our party institutions and our election systems, and the media, and political campaigns, and then use that to sew confusion and propaganda, then he may, indeed, be able to gain control over the direction of our country, the sovereign people of  We were warned in that intelligence agency report, which is public, which everybody can find online, that this is their plan. It wasn't as if 2016 was a one-shot deal. This is exactly what Putin will continue to do.  So that is the background. Now, why is the firing of FBI Director James Comey so disturbing? He, of course, had a 10-year term, which was abruptly and suddenly cut off by President Trump after Comey told him--according Comey's account, at least--that he would refuse to drop the investigation into Michael  There are lots of people involved in this Russian connection story, including Page, and Stone, and Manafort, and Jared Kushner that go way beyond what we can talk about here tonight. But I just want to focus for the moment on  Why is this sequence of events so disturbing? Well, it came out this week also that the Trump transition team, headed by none other than Vice President Pence, knew that Flynn was under criminal investigation at the time that they decided to hire him as America's National Security At a point when they decided to make him America's number one national security operative, they knew he was under criminal investigation for being a paid operative of the Turkish Government, a paid agent of the Turkish And nonetheless, they brought him on.  And then when it was learned from the Acting Attorney General Sally Yates that Mr.Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail by Russians for having misled Vice President Pence about his entanglement with the Russian Ambassador and his conversations with the Russian Ambassador, still they kept him on. So they brought him on, knowing he was under investigation, then they knew he lied about his connections to the Russians, and still they kept him on.  When the media finally broke the story of Flynn's collusive actions with foreign governments while he was the National Security Agency Director, Trump finally fired him, grudgingly, let him go, but said that Flynn was the victim somehow, and even tried to disassociate himself from the firing of  Then we learn that the President tried to get the FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation. Now, that is according to the FBI Director James Comey, who has never been accused of lying or perjury. So it is going to be his word against that of the President of the United States, who has said things like: Well, Ted Cruz' father participated in the assassination of JFK; and 5 million people voted illegally in the United States, with no evidence at all; and Barack Obama was born in Kenya, or Indonesia; and he had his phones tapped, and so on.  And so that issue might come down to a swearing contest between the former Director of the FBI, Mr.Comey, and President But in any event, according to Comey, Trump said to him: Will you let it go? Will you let the investigation of Flynn go? And Comey said he would not. And then Comey was let go instead.  So the question is: What does Michael Flynn know that everybody bends over backwards in the Trump administration to try to please him and placate him?  This is an administration that doesn't mind insulting our longest and most cherished allies in the world: NATO, which he has said is obsolete; Mexico, which he has had no problem insulting and affronting; Australia; and so on. Yet with Michael Flynn, everybody is tiptoeing. Everybody is doing a tap dance. What does Michael Flynn know about President Trump? It would seem as if he has got some kind of information about the President that the President doesn't want to get out there.  That is why a special counsel had to be appointed, and I am glad a special counsel was appointed. And I believe that Mr.Mueller is up to the task. And he has been known as a straight shooter, and a nonpartisan, someone who will follow the facts where they will go.  Well, in the meantime, we have got to look at the much broader issue. Because, of course, that is about the criminal deeds or actions of particular people. And some people may end up facing prosecution for what they did. But there is a much larger issue here. Because as a country, we have got to stand up for strong democracy all over the world.  But what is happening with all of these shenanigans, and sinister contacts and connections with the Turkish Government, and the Russian Government, and Orban in Hungary, and the killer dictator Duterte in the Philippines who orders that people he thinks are drug users should be shot on[[Page H4349]]sight in his country, who has been invited to the White House by President Trump?  Well, our country has got to stand up for what is great about our country: our Constitution and our Bill of President Trump said this is a witch hunt. But I want to close by telling you about a real witch hunt that is going on right now on the planet  And if we were not so distracted by the spreading staph infection in the White House, we would be able to help in terms of this situation.

But now we have got a human being--a governor, no less--who is in prison for hard time in Indonesia, one of our allies. We should not let that stand.  There are hundreds of people all over the Earth who are in prison for blasphemy or apostasy or heresy--religious offenses--and we are saying nothing about it. In Russia itself, there were just marches a month ago against political corruption and authoritarianism. Tens of thousands of people. Our government did nothing. Why? Some of them are on the payroll of Russian autocrats, and others just don't care.  We should be on the side of the people of Russia who are fighting for democracy, fighting for religious freedom, fighting for human rights. That is what America should be about. That is what is really at stake here.  Our government should not be consumed with self-interest and promoting people's corporate agendas.

6725,topic-id,280,"Mr.President, today I am joined by Senators Casey, Gillibrand, Hassan, and Whitehouse to introduce the Layoff Prevention Act of 2017. This bill renews and extends Federal support for State short-time compensation--or work sharing--programs, which help avert layoffs and the economic effects of long-term unemployment.  Work sharing is a proven concept that is endorsed by economists across the political spectrum. When business slows down, employers feel pressure to lay off employees. Under work sharing, employers may instead opt to reduce hours across-the-board, and employees may then collect a pro-rata unemployment compensation check for the hours they lost. This prevents layoffs, lowers employers' rehiring and training expenses, and costs States only a fraction of what they would pay if workers went on full unemployment.  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 included my Layoff Prevention Act, which modernized[[Page S4427]]Federal work sharing laws. Partly as a result of this increased Federal support for work sharing, State work sharing programs helped to save over 130,000 jobs between 2012 and the expiration of Federal incentives in 2015.  The legislation I am introducing today would renew incentives so that States with existing work sharing programs, and those considering enacting a program, can qualify for Federal support. Our economy has come a long way in recent years, and we should invest in proven programs like work sharing to ensure we do not experience again the same scale of job loss that we endured during the Great  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this bill to keep American workers on the job, save taxpayers money, and provide employers with a practical, positive, and cost-effective alternative to layoffs.                                 ______                                   By ",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4426-2.txt,1982,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,27.0,May
7017,topic-id,929,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Jay Clayton to be Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,  Mr.Clayton has achieved great personal success as a corporate attorney, where for years he represented some of our Nation's largest financial institutions, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Goldman Personal success is not the same as being willing to safeguard the interests of all who participate in and rely on our capital markets, especially working-class Americans, as I believe a good SEC Chairman must. Based on Mr.Clayton's testimony and his answers to my questions and those of my colleagues on the Banking Committee, I am unable to support his confirmation.  As more and more working-class Americans know, pensions are becoming rarer, and more American families, assuming they even have extra money to spare from their paychecks, must invest in securities to save for retirement or send their kids to college. The integrity and efficiency of our capital markets then are not only of great importance to the megabanks and tycoon investors, but also to working-class  It is therefore in all of our interests to have strong and vigilant Federal financial regulators who can help ensure we avoid another financial crisis. While the megabanks have bounced back after staring into the abyss, the last financial crisis, which began in the Bush administration, had devastating consequences on working-class Americans, too many of whom lost their jobs, their nest eggs, and their homes. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered, the impacts are still felt by too many in Rhode Island and throughout the country.  While it is vitally important to help small businesses raise capital and grow their companies by actually creating jobs here in the United States, it is also equally essential that we have a strong cop on the beat that upholds and improves the integrity of our capital markets.  Initially, I was encouraged to read in Mr.Clayton's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee that ``there is zero room for bad actors in our capital markets'' and that ``I am 100 percent committed to rooting out any fraud and shady practices in our financial system.''  During his confirmation hearing, I asked Mr.Clayton if he would support my bipartisan legislation with Senator Grassley that would deter fraud by increasing the statutory limits on civil monetary penalties. Our legislation responds to former SEC Chair Mary Shapiro's statement that ``the Commission's statutory authority to obtain civil monetary penalties with appropriate deterrent effect is limited in many circumstances.'' In his response to me, Mr.Clayton said, ``I am very willing to take a look at the issue and work with you on it and give you my views after I've been better educated on it.'' I accepted this response for the time being and wrote to Mr.Clayton after the hearing to ask for his thoughts on this matter now that he had time to study the issue.  He responded: ``As a general matter, I believe that the effective empowerment and functioning of the SEC Enforcement Division are fundamental to the fair and efficient functioning of our markets and the protection of investors. Under existing law, the Commission has the authority to seek civil monetary penalties in a number of circumstances. I would not want the Division or Commission to be unnecessarily or inappropriately constrained in pursuing civil monetary penalties, which can serve an important deterrent effect in appropriate circumstances. If confirmed as Chair, I will work with my fellow Commissioners and the Enforcement Division staff to enforce the law as it is written, including with respect to civil monetary penalties. I also would be willing to engage with Congress regarding any changes to the SEC's statutory authority to seek monetary penalties that Congress deems appropriate.''  I am glad Mr.Clayton agrees that penalties can serve as deterrents, and I appreciate the fact that Mr.Clayton would not want the SEC to be ``unnecessarily or inappropriately constrained in pursuing civil monetary penalties.'' Indeed, what appears to be constraining the SEC in part is exactly what former Chair Schapiro said, that penalty limits are not high enough to serve as effective deterrents. Given this, I do not understand Mr.Clayton's hesitation in clearly supporting my bipartisan legislation with Senator This does not sound like a 100 percent commitment to ``rooting out any fraud and shady practices in our financial system.''  This is just one example, but based on a review of his record and his responses to the committee's questions, I am not confident Mr.Clayton will vigorously work to protect all investors, in the same way as he throughout his career has defended the interests of his corporate and megabank clients, particularly when those interests may come into conflict, as we know they will. In my opinion, there should be no question of an SEC chairman's willingness to stand up and fight for working-class Americans and mom-and-pop investors.  Indeed, as Senator Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, has stated himself, ``it's not the first time we've seen a nominee like Mr.I was concerned about Mary Jo White's conflicts and corporate law background. She was conflicted in dozens of high-profile cases, and then a month after stepping down as Chair, she returned to her old law firm. As a lawyer might say--that's bad precedent.''  What we need is a strong SEC Chair that will vigorously protect and defend the interests of all American investors. I hope he proves me wrong, but based on the record before me, I am not convinced Mr.Clayton is up to this task, and therefore, I cannot vote to confirm him.

This week, a new generation of Americans witnessed the barbarity of the evil of communism. I extend my condolences to the family and friends of Otto Warmbier, whose funeral was held yesterday.

6743,topic-id,368,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to also commend my friend and my colleague from the great State of Michigan, the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, my longstanding friend, Mr.Upton, for working with my office to bring H.3050, the Enhancing State Energy Security Planning and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2017, to the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, this Upton-Rush bill represents bipartisan negotiation between Chairman Upton and myself to much-needed Federal guidance and resources to the States that are on the front lines when it comes to protecting critical energy infrastructure and responding once disaster strikes.  Members on both side of the aisle, Mr.Speaker, support the State Energy Program, and this bill will help provide resources to further develop and enhance the State energy security plans.  Since their inception in the 1970s, State Energy Programs, bolstered by Federal aid, have assisted States in developing these energy security plans in order to help prevent disasters from happening and to mitigate the damage once they do occur.  Mr.Speaker, funding provided in this bill will help States to implement, revise, and to review their energy security plans while also laying out criteria for the contents of these plans. These emergency plans have been instrumental in improving States' abilities to identify potential energy disruptions, quantify the effects of the disruptions, establish response plans, and limit the risk of further disturbances, whether they be natural or manmade.  Federal funding and leadership has also been critical in helping States and local stakeholders identify the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies in times of emergencies while also supporting training and response exercises.  Mr.Speaker, as the Trump administration weakens America's leadership role globally by signaling its intentions to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, it is even more vital that we provide the resources and funding needed for States to take more of a permanent role in advancing smart and sustainable energy policy.

6694,topic-id,1597,"Mr.President, let me thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his very cogent and important remarks.  Let me just start off by asking the Chair, asking the leader of the Republican party, what are you afraid of? What are you afraid of? Health care constitutes one-sixth of the American economy. It impacts every man, woman, and child in our Yet we have 13 Republicans, all men, working behind closed doors to produce legislation that will be brought to the Senate at the last moment so the American people don't know the disaster that it is.[[Page S3586]]  You know, what politics is about or should be about is, if you are proud of what you do, you tell the world about it. You explain to the American people and to your constituents why this is what you are proposing, this is how you voted, and this is why it is good for the people in your State and your country.  It should tell every American--whether you are a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent, whether you are conservative or progressive, it should tell you something that major legislation is being written at this moment and that most Republicans don't have a clue as to what is in that legislation, let alone the Democrats, let alone average  So I say to the Republican leadership, what are you afraid of? Bring out that bill.  I am a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the HELP The HELP Committee is supposed to be the committee that deals with health issues.  I see Senator Murray is here, the ranking member of that committee. She will concur with me that the HELP Committee has held zero hearings.  It is the HELP We have had not one hearing to ask members of the administration, people throughout this country, what the impact of this legislation will be on the children, on the elderly, on working families, on those who have chronic diseases, on ordinary What impact will this legislation have on the lives of 300-plus million people? We have not had one hearing, not one open discussion. I would think that every Republican would be embarrassed by this. I know many of them are embarrassed by it.  So before there is any vote on any health care legislation, we need to have a series of hearings to discuss the implications of what the legislation is about.  Mr.President, as I think you heard during the debate on the Affordable Care Act--and I am a member of that committee, and we had 47 bipartisan hearings, not only in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee but also in the Finance Committee and other committees. There were roundtables and there were walkthroughs of the Affordable Care There was consideration of more than 300 amendments. Some 150 amendments offered by Republicans were accepted.  In 2009 and 2010, the Finance Committee held 53 hearings, meetings, negotiations, and walkthroughs on the Affordable Care That committee marked up the Affordable Care Act for 8 days. A markup means you accept amendments and you have debates on amendments. That was the longest markup in 22 years, and adopted during that process were over 10 Republican amendments.  When the bill was considered on the Senate floor, the Senate spent 25 consecutive days in session on health reform--the second longest session in history. Oddly enough and interestingly enough, many of my Republican colleagues, during that process--after 25 consecutive days on the Senate floor and after numerous hearings in the HELP Committee and in the Finance Committee, there were Senators who said that wasn't enough time. They said: This is such an important piece of legislation, and it is going to impact so many people. We need even more time.  Senator Enzi said that ``cutting off Senate debate and deliberation with a budget reconciliation process would shortchange legislation with enormous impact.''  Senator Lamar Alexander said:       I don't think people are going to feel as good about a bill      that restructures one-sixth of our economy, that affects      every single American's health, and the healthcare bill is      being written behind closed doors in the Democratic leader's      office.  In other words, you had Republican leaders thinking that the hundreds and hundreds of hours of discussion and debate on the Affordable Care Act was not enough. I find it amazing that those same Republicans seem to think it is OK for legislation to be written behind closed doors and not have one single committee hearing.  Now the truth is, I can understand why Republicans do not want open discussion and open debate on this issue--because the bill they are working on, which is based on the disastrous bill passed in the House last month, is a bill that would do incalculable harm to people all over our country and really should not be considered as a healthcare bill.  How do you talk about a so-called healthcare bill when you are throwing 23 million people off of health insurance? When we talk about a healthcare bill, the assumption is that we are improving healthcare in America, not doing what the Republican House bill does--wants to throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance. Surely that is not improving healthcare for the American people.  Cutting Medicaid by over $800 billion--and God only knows what the implication of that will be for the children, for the elderly, for people who are in nursing homes.  You are not improving healthcare when you defund Planned After all the rhetoric about choice, choice, choice--we want the American people to be able to go to their provider of choice--oh, 2.5 million women who today get their healthcare through Planned Parenthood, I guess their choice doesn't matter.  We hear about the needs of working-class people. We had the candidate Donald Trump who talked about the needs of working-class people. The House Republican bill--and we think the Senate bill will be very close to it--substantially raises premiums for older workers. That is why, among other groups opposing the House bill, the AARP made the point that this would be a disaster for older workers.  The truth is, this is not a healthcare bill; this is a tax break for the rich and multinational corporations bill. This is a bill that would provide over $200 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent. This is a bill that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the drug companies and the insurance companies. Last information I received, the pharmaceutical corporations, the major drug companies, made over $50 billion in profit, but this legislation would throw Americans off of health insurance to give drug companies even more profit.  This legislation, the House bill--and, I think, similarly, the bill being worked on behind closed doors--is not only opposed by the AARP, which is the largest seniors group in America, but it is opposed by the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the American Medical Association because the doctors know what a disaster this will be for healthcare for millions of Americans--also, by the American Nurses Association and the American Hospital You have all of these groups that are the pillars of healthcare in America saying: No, no, this is a disastrous bill. Yet we have the Republican leadership and a dozen or so Members who are working behind closed doors.  Nobody here has suggested that the Affordable Care Act should not be improved. In my view, it should be improved. In my view, deductibles are too high, copayments are too high, and premiums are too high. Certainly, the fact that we are paying twice as much as any other country for prescription drugs has to be dealt with also.  The task right now, among sensible people, is to put it on the table and to be honest about it. What are the problems of the Affordable Care Act? How do we lower deductibles? How do we lower copayments? How do we control the escalating cost of healthcare?  Those are reasonable questions that honest people should debate, but the answer is not to throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance. That is not a solution to the problem. That is an insult to the American people.  Let me just conclude by stating this. Our job right now is to make sure that this disastrous Republican proposal never sees the light of day. I would urge my Democratic colleagues, on behalf of the American people--the vast majority of whom know how bad this legislation is--to stand up and fight in an unprecedented way to make sure that that legislation never sees the light of day.  After we win that struggle, I would hope that we would come forward as a nation and join every other major country on Earth, whether it is Canada--and I live 50 miles away from the[[Page S3587]]Canadian border--the United Kingdom, France, or Germany--and say that healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege. If you are an American, you are entitled to healthcare. You should not be one of the 23 million people thrown off of healthcare, bringing the total of uninsured in America to over 50 million people. That is outrageous.  I think you are going to hear the American people stand up loudly and clearly and demand transparency and demand serious debate on an issue of this consequence. I think, at the end of the day, this legislation will be defeated.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3573-2.txt,1010,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,19.0,June

As we have heard from former Obama administration officials, including Secretary Kerry and Ambassador Sherman, these measures could undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the very important nuclear agreement signed in 2015 between the United States, our P5+1 partners, and But above and beyond that, let us be aware and cognizant that earlier today, the people of Iran suffered a horrific terror attack in their capital, Tehran, in which 12 people were killed and many more were injured. The Islamic State has claimed credit for this attack.  At a time when tensions are extremely high in that part of the world, our goal must be to find ways to bring people together to reduce tensions rather than to exacerbate this very painful and dangerous situation. Let us also remember that the leaders of Iran immediately expressed condolences for the September 11 attacks against the United States and that hundreds of Iranians held a candlelight vigil.  It seems to me to be the right thing to do--on a day when Iran has been attacked by ISIS, by terrorism, now is not the time to go forward with legislation calling for sanctions against I would respectfully request that we delay our vote on this bill until next week. Let us tell the people of Iran that while we have serious disagreements with them on a number of issues, that today, when they are mourning, when they are dealing with the shock of a terrorist attack, today is not the day to go forward with this piece of legislation.

6683,topic-id,1136,"Mr.President, we Democrats are here on the floor to take a stand against a bill that is a disaster for our Nation's healthcare--Medicaid patients, families with loved ones in nursing homes, people who struggle with opioid addiction, women who rely on Planned Parenthood, and people who work in the healthcare industry. We stand with them and for them tonight, but we also stand for the American public, who is being left in the dark about what TrumpCare will mean for them.  This is not the normal order of Senate business. The Republicans are going about this in a way that is so procedurally flawed that it is an embarrassment to democracy itself. They are hiding this bill. They are hiding this bill because people will be outraged when they find out what is in it.  That is why a Republican aide said that they are not releasing the bill--because ``we aren't stupid.'' Think about what that statement means. First, it means that they have a bill. Second, it means that they think it is political suicide to make the bill public. So they are bypassing the normal and necessary process that is needed to make good legislation.  The way you make legislation is to allow the Sun to shine in, and that starts with hearings. Every legislative body in the country--from a school board to a county council--has hearings because we have figured out over the centuries--for all of our flaws--that you need hearings, not just to placate the masses but to figure out whether your legislation is any good or not.  Republicans have not held a single hearing on No one who knows anything about healthcare is allowed to say anything about this bill because they are not even allowed to see it, but anyone who has ever tried to understand the American healthcare system knows that it is complicated. The President said so himself. You need expert testimony, public input, and time to talk to your home That is the way you get a good product, but Republicans have totally bypassed the two committees that exist in order to consider legislation like this.  Think about it. Under normal circumstances, this legislation would be in the Finance and HELP Committees' jurisdictions. There would be hearings, and there would be a markup, but that is not the process that is being used. There is no markup. There are no committee hearings. It is just 13 dudes, and they are rushing to pass a bill without[[Page S3578]]women, without Democrats, and without input from the American people. Here is the order of the people who get to see the healthcare bill: 13 men in secret, Republican lobbyists, POLITICO, Republicans, Democrats, and, then, the American people.  This is shameful. This is a violation of the way democracy itself should work. When they are done, the product will be the fruit from the poisonous tree. It will not be good because the process that will have produced it will have been so flawed.  There are many, many Americans who do not support this bill, and I am going to highlight just three groups who stand to lose.  First, you have people who are going to pay more for insurance, lose their insurance altogether, or lose the ability to choose their providers. Families will not be able to afford nursing home care for their loved ones or to pay the hospital bills for a parent after she has had a heart attack. Americans who have preexisting conditions will struggle to buy insurance because insurance companies will be able to charge more for conditions like diabetes or cancer or asthma. Women will be blocked from getting annual checkups or cancer screenings at their local Planned Parenthood clinics. All of these people stand to lose if the bill moves forward.  Second, you have people whose jobs may be at risk. Healthcare makes up about one-sixth of the American economy, and it does not exist in a vacuum. It is an industry that impacts millions of workers, and you can bet that those jobs will be affected by this bill. One study found that TrumpCare will take away nearly 1 million jobs by the year 2026. We are supposed to be helping American workers, not taking away their jobs or making it harder for them to get healthcare.  Finally, this bill hurts the working poor. These are the people who will struggle even more under TrumpCare, and I do not know why we would punish them. Why would we leave them with nowhere to turn? I know that millions of Americans feel the same way that I do. They care deeply about the poor, the vulnerable, and the sick among us, because they have made news in standing up for their neighbors.  One woman named Jessie went to a town hall to make her voice heard on TrumpCare, and I want to read what she said:       It is my understanding the ACA mandate requires everybody      to have insurance because the healthy people pull up the sick      people, right? And as a Christian, my whole philosophy on      life is pull up the unfortunate. So the individual mandate,      that's what it does. The healthy people pull up the sick. If      we take those people and put them in high-risk insurance      pools, they're costlier and there's less coverage for them.      That's the way it's been in the past, and that's the way it      will be again. So we are effectively punishing our sickest      people.  Look, we may not agree on policy, but I hope we can agree on the process. So what will it take? What will it take for this process to be restored and for TrumpCare to be considered in the way that it ought to be considered?  The answer is actually very straightforward. We need three It only takes three Republicans, and you can be a person who hates the Affordable Care Act or has mixed feelings about the Affordable Care Act or anywhere in between. It only takes three Republicans in the U.Senate to restore the U.Senate itself--to restore the hearing process, to restore public confidence, and to restore bipartisanship.  All we need are three Republican Senators to say: I will not vote for anything if there hasn't been a public hearing. I will not vote for anything that is being jammed down Americans' throats. I will not vote for anything without being able to go back home and figure out how it will impact my State's hospitals.  This is not an unreasonable task. We are just asking for three Republicans to say: Let's be a Senate again. Let's restore order and transparency and do things the right way because that is the only way this bill will not be a total disaster.  I yield the floor.

6706,topic-id,2357,"Mr.President, I want to give a status report on this bill. Right now, we think it is with the 13 men who are working on it in secret; they will show it to Republican lobbyists, and then they will send it over to the CBO for a score, and eventually the American public and the Senate will be able to see the bill.  We will have a process called vote-arama, which is mostly nonsense, and there will be lots of opportunities to offer amendments, but let's be clear about what happens at the end of vote-arama. The leader will offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute. So what does that mean? That means all of the amendments that were adopted along the way get taken out, with one 51-vote margin, and all of that vote-arama was for show because Mitch McConnell will put his bill on the floor that was negotiated in secret with those 13 people.  If there was any question that our democracy is being rolled over by Senate Republicans, I want you to think about these 13 men. They are drafting a bill without any input from women, from Democrats, from experts, and by working in secret they are cutting out about 250 million people who are from the 40 States who aren't represented among those 13 men. You can bet that those 40 States have unique healthcare needs and unique healthcare laws. And without the right language, the bill could throw healthcare in each of those States or any of those States into total chaos.  They have also cut out Senators on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, even though these committees are actually constructed for the purpose of working on legislation like this. They know how to get things done like this. There are members of the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee who are among the experts on this issue, yet they don't get a chance to even see the bill. These Senators have jurisdiction over this legislation, but they are being left out. This is just not the way it is supposed to work.  We need transparency. We need bipartisanship. But now the Republicans will try to tell us that the hearings are bypassed all the time. That is not true. In fact, this body will hold a hearing on almost anything. In 2017 alone, the Senate has had hearings on hot tub safety, self-driving cars, a treaty for outer space, multimodal shipping, the maritime administration, and dozens of other issues. Look, those are actually not to be trivialized. It is important for the Senate to have hearings. It is important for subcommittees to do their work. But nobody can tell me that hot tub safety, self-driving cars, a treaty for outer space, multimodal shipping, and the maritime administration are more important than one-sixth of the American economy. It is a joke.  We are talking about one-sixth of the American economy, about millions of jobs, and about people with life-threatening diseases and life-changing medical bills, so we know how important hearings are to do legislation. When the Senate took up the ACA, there were almost 100 hearings. Think about that: 100 hearings versus 0. There were roundtables and walk-throughs held by the two committees. We considered hundreds of amendments and accepted[[Page S3599]]more than 150 amendments from But, for this bill, no markup, no transparency, no bipartisanship--just 13 men meeting in secret outside of the regular process.  The only thing that has changed is now the market is under siege, but the market is under siege because of the Republican administration. They are purposefully creating uncertainty. That is not a rhetorical flourish; they are saying they are doing that. President Trump actually said he wanted to create uncertainty in the healthcare market in order to create leverage with  Think about how unusual that is. Think about how offensive that is. It is perfectly appropriate for one party to try to generate leverage in a negotiation against the other. That is part of politics, either in an election context or in the public policy context. But the way that this President and Tom Price are trying to generate leverage is by raising healthcare premiums in order to force Democrats to buckle. That is unheard of. It really is unheard of. And it hurts everybody across the country to create this uncertainty.  It is bad enough that the Republicans are trying to take healthcare away from 23 million people--from nursing home patients and their families, from women who are pregnant or fighting breast cancer, from sons and daughters and moms and dads who struggle with opioids. But to add insult to injury, they are going to jam it down your throat. You don't get to read what it is about before it passes or hear from doctors or nurses or experts about how it will affect you.  So why are they working on this bill in secret? The answer is very simple. The bill stinks. They are ashamed of it. The bill itself is an embarrassment. The process is an embarrassment. They have said so themselves. No matter how you look at this, this bill is a disaster for people and their families. It will be a disaster for anyone who relies on Medicaid, which will be cut by at least $800 billion, and Medicaid is a safety net for people who need care but can't afford it.  Look at nursing home care. Medicaid covers three out of every four long-stay nursing home residents. My wife's grandmother was in a nursing home and just passed away, had great care, and wouldn't have been able to get the care she needed were it not for This is not an uncommon story--millions of Americans across the country of all income levels. People think of Medicaid as for people who are not financially in a position to get care in any given moment. That is true. It does take care of the poor. But it also takes care of nursing home care for people who worked all their lives and just don't have enough. It is $9,000 a month in the State of Hawaii for nursing home care. It is more than that for hospice care. We all know that nobody escapes end-of-life care. Rich or poor, left or right, red, blue, purple, nobody escapes this part of your life, and everybody needs help. There might be a few people who save up enough cash money to be able to shell out $10,000 a month for that kind of care, but for the rest of us, Medicaid is that lifeline.  There are actually some Republicans who don't want to cut They have seen how the program improves people's lives. Arkansas and Kentucky, for example, expanded These States have seen big jumps in the number of the people who now have their own doctor or have gotten a checkup in the past year, people who are now more likely to say they are in excellent health. But under TrumpCare, we will be back to the bad old days.  This bill is also a disaster for older people, who will be hit with what the AARP is calling an age tax. This will get a little wonky--not as wonky as that referred to by my colleague who spoke about 5 minutes ago but a little wonky. Right now, companies are not allowed to charge any more than three times as much for an older person as a younger person. Three times is the cap. But TrumpCare will increase that rate to five times. So what happens is every year, as you get older, your insurance costs will go up and up and up. That is why they call it an age tax. In other words, many seniors will see premium increases that can cost them thousands of dollars more each year at a time when people are already struggling to find money to pay for healthcare.  This is also a disaster for patients who don't want to lose their healthcare provider. Right now, an estimated one in five women goes to Planned Parenthood clinics. I understand we have different views about reproductive choice. I understand that. But we also understand--when we are talking on the level about Planned Parenthood and when we are talking about Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, everybody who pays any bit of attention to this understands what Planned Parenthood does for women across the country--again, conservative women, progressive women; Planned Parenthood doesn't care. Planned Parenthood is not using Federal funding for abortion. We all know that by now. It is cancer screenings, and it is quality healthcare and birth control.  People talk about giving more choices for healthcare and saving taxpayers' money, but the CBO estimates that defunding Planned Parenthood will take away options for nearly 400,000 women across the country and will cost taxpayers more than $130 million.  It is also a disaster for those struggling with opioid addiction. This bill will take away treatment for mental health and addiction, leaving hundreds of thousands of people fighting opioid addiction without adequate health insurance. We saw the statistics that opioid addiction, I believe, is killing more people annually than HIV/AIDS killed at its apex. I believe it has either surpassed or is comparable, in terms of cause of death, with car accidents. This is one of the leading killers in the country, and Medicaid is the program that funds opioid addiction for most of the people who get help.  This bill is also a disaster for patients with preexisting conditions because it means we will be going back to the dark days when insurance companies could charge you more for having a preexisting condition.  I have heard from people back home in Hawaii who are terrified of what this could mean for their health. One woman wrote that she is in the middle of a fight for her life against breast cancer, and she is scared that under TrumpCare, she will lose her insurance, that she will have to stop her treatments and could lose her life. A husband wrote to me that his wife has stage IV breast cancer. She has had every possible treatment and surgery imaginable to extend her life, but without the guarantee of affordable coverage for all, her fight will quickly come to an end. She is 29.  Even people without serious medical conditions will be affected by this preexisting condition's nonsense. We know that because before the Affordable Care Act became law, insurance companies were able to discriminate based on what they determined to be a preexisting condition.  One woman in Hawaii told me that in the days before the Affordable Care Act, she was rejected by insurance companies because she had back pain at one point in her life. The pain never came back, and she never needed treatment again. She was young and healthy, but the insurance company wouldn't give her insurance.  We cannot accept the end of nationwide protections for people with preexisting conditions. We cannot accept high premiums or so-called high-risk pools that have historically failed in giving people the coverage they need and deserve. We don't have to do it this way.  We don't have the majority, and this is being done under a process called reconciliation, which means that you don't need a filibuster-proof majority; you just need 51 votes. So if you are proud of your bill--we have Senator Hatch, chairman of the Finance Committee and one of the most respected Republicans in the country, actually. We have Senator Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Both have a long history of being able to do deals--Orrin Hatch with Teddy Kennedy and my predecessor, Dan Inouye; Lamar Alexander with just about everybody--Chuck Schumer, Patty These are conservative Members of the There is no doubt about their Republican credentials. But they are also people who are capable of crafting legislation in the right way. I have no doubt they like their gavels. I have no doubt they like chairing hearings. I have no doubt they have the personal, intellectual, emotional, and political[[Page S3600]]stamina to go through a process which may take more than a couple of days.  I will tell you, this is the world's greatest deliberative body--it is--and these are a bunch of impressive people I serve with in the But without a hearing, you get a garbage product. You get a bill that just stinks, that staffers say they are keeping secret because ``we're not stupid.'' They are so embarrassed at this product that they are keeping it secret, because they know the moment this thing gets posted, everybody from everybody's home State--and not just Democratic States and not just purple States, but every home State is going to say: My community health center is going to get shut down. My opioid treatment center is going to get shut down. My hospital may no longer exist.  They know this bill stinks.  There is a simple solution. All we need is three Republicans to say: Let the Senate be the The House did whatever the House was going to do.  There was a weird White House Rose Garden signing ceremony without a bill even being enacted. It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen, where everybody was congratulating each other for inflicting pain on the American people.  But the Senate has to be the Senate here, and what that means is that we have to be that cooling saucer. We have to actually slow down and have a deliberative process. All we need is three Members of the Senate on the Republican side to say a very simple thing. They can be as critical of ObamaCare as they want, they can be as partisan against us as they want, but all they have to say is this: I am not voting for a bill that doesn't get a hearing.

This bill is just common sense. Putting it quite simply, we are just helping our utilities better enhance safety and reliability of the grid and protecting against wildfires and blackouts.  Contrary to what some folks have asserted, this is actually a bipartisan bill supported by quite a few This bill is especially vital for most of those in the West, where much of our land is federally owned.  Many of your utilities' and co-ops' service territory can be more than 50 percent federally managed. We have witnessed extreme variations and approaches not only between the Forest Service and the BLM, but within the management agency districts themselves.  Jim Pena, out in Oregon: ``There is little consistency from agency to agency, district to district, or even within the same offices.'' This is the Forest Service talking.  We read and listened to the specter of big companies coming in and clear-cutting our Federal lands. I respectfully suggest that that is why we need these vegetative management plans. They are short, concise, deal with only the utility's right-of-way and the land adjacent to it that could cause problems.  I wonder sometimes what the heck folks are talking about. We have heard complaints about absolving companies from liability. That is not true. What we are saying is, if the Secretary fails to allow the utility to manage the vegetation on Federal lands or adjacent right-of-way in a way that is consistent with their approved vegetative[[Page H5025]]management plan that they have worked out with them or if the hazard tree or tree is in imminent danger of contacting an electricity line, the utility will not be held liable for wildfire damage or loss. It does not absolve a utility from liability if they are negligent or act in a way that is inconsistent with their vegetative management plan.  I give you a great example our colleague from Arizona talked about. In Oregon, a rural co-op requested trimming some dangerous trees along the rights-of-way by the Forest The Forest Service denied the request. A tree fell on the power line, sparked a fire. The utility was held responsible for paying for that fire when they had actually brought the issue to them in the first place. That is ridiculous.  I urge my colleagues to support H.1873.

The idea that we could affect one-sixth of the Nation's economy--the life and death, literally, of millions of Americans; the whole structure of our healthcare system, affecting doctors, nurses, and rural hospital workers--and that we could do all of that in such darkness, behind such closed doors is the greatest miscarriage of legislative practice that I have seen since I have been here in the House and  We heard our colleagues, when the ACA came up, talk about an open process: Read the bill.

To say that we are having regular order, to say that we are having an amendment process, in all due respect, is a joke.  Let me go over when we were in charge to show the complete contradiction.

A markup, 8 days--can we get any commitment from our friends on the Republican side that we will have 8 days of markup in the Finance Committee when their bill is ready? I doubt it. Some 130 amendments were considered. Two dozen Republican amendments were agreed to--all in the committee process.  Then, a bill went to the HELP There were 47 bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs. They considered nearly 300 amendments during the 13-day markup. That was one of the longest in history, as it should have been on such a major bill. There were 160 Republican amendments. Our ranking member on the HELP Committee couldn't be here because of plane delays, but she will augment that when she gets here.  The Senate Finance Committee posted its legislation online for 6 days before the markup. I ask rhetorically of my friend the majority leader: When his bill is ready, is it going to be posted for 6 days prior to debate or markup? Are the American people, our doctors, our nurses, our patients, and the cancer care groups going to get a chance to see it? I doubt it. That is not what it seems like.  The Senate spent 25 consecutive days in session on healthcare reform. Again, I would ask my friend the leader, rhetorically: How many days are we going to spend on it under reconciliation?

Our Democratic friends didn't want anybody to go home. They didn't want anybody to go home and have to explain what they were in the process of writing in the majority leader's office.  I think it is pretty safe to say that this subject has been very partisan from the beginning. Not a single Republican voted for the bill, and our friends on the other side have made it perfectly clear that no Democrats will be voting to replace it.  So through that process, when our colleagues on the other side had 60 votes at the time, ObamaCare was imposed on our country. Over the last 7 years, we have all witnessed and debated its many failures. Over the last 7 years, Republicans have offered ideas on a better way forward. Over the last 7 years, Democrats have worked to prevent Congress from acting. Basically, it is the same dynamic that we see today: ObamaCare continues to collapse, Republicans are working to implement better ideas, and Democrats are trying to prevent Congress from acting. I regret that Democrats announced their intention early on that they didn't want to be a part of a serious bipartisan process to move past the failures of this law. Congress still has a responsibility to act, and the reconciliation process will allow us to do so.  Later, after that period in late 2009, our Democratic friends used reconciliation to force ObamaCare on It is a process that can be used in 2017, the same way they used it in 2010, to move beyond its failures.

It is an open process. There is an unlimited number of amendments.  First, the bill text is received. Then a CBO score is issued. Members will have time to review both. After that, there is an open amendment process and a robust debate. It is the one type of amendment we have on the floor of the Senate on which no one can prevent amendments. Ultimately, at the end of the process, the Senate votes. That is how reconciliation works.  We have been debating ObamaCare's failures and what to do about them for so many years now.

6667,topic-id,269,"Madam President, I heard what the leader had to say. I think anyone who has observed the reconciliation vote-arama process knows it is not a robust amendment process. There are ways to correct that. Certainly, we have our differences pretty much on partisan lines between repealing ACA and amending it and making it better, but what we ought to be doing is discussing it with one another.  So I would renew my request to the majority leader. What is the harm in us gathering in the Old Senate Chamber, 100 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, and maybe trying to come together? Is there any harm? I would renew my request that he join us in that because what the American people clamor for is some kind of bipartisan coming together. We have different views on how that should occur.  You say: Join us in repeal.  We think that would hurt millions of people.  We say: Make it better.  You say that the ACA is irretrievable.

6753,topic-id,1105,"Mr.President, yesterday afternoon, my friend the Republican leader announced that the majority would delay the vote on the motion to proceed to this particular Senate Republican healthcare bill. We Democrats take no solace in that fact. Unfortunately, the majority seems intent on continuing their efforts to pass this healthcare bill.  Over the next few days and weeks, I expect to see buyouts and bailouts, backroom deals and kickbacks to individual Senators to try and buy their vote. What I don't expect to see yet is a dramatic rethink of the core of the Republican healthcare bill, but I am hopeful we can get to that point.  So far, every single version of the Republican TrumpCare bill in the House and the Senate has the same basic core to it. The details have changed a bit around the edges, but the core remains the same in each and every version: slash Medicaid to the bone in order to give a massive tax break to a very small number of wealthy Americans, cut support for Americans in nursing homes, those suffering from opioid addiction, and those with a preexisting condition to pay for a tax break for the wealthiest few.  The basic premise of every Republican healthcare bill so far is to cut back on healthcare for Americans who need it most in order to give a tax break to the people who need it the least. There is just no moral calculus to justify it. It doesn't fix any of the problems in our current healthcare system like high premiums, high deductibles, counties where there are not enough insurance options, and it is not what the American people are for. The American people are not for tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans, nor are they for cutting  A USA TODAY poll this morning showed only 12 percent of Americans support this bill. At a level of 12 percent, even huge numbers of Trump supporters are opposed to this bill. The level of popular support is not going to change one bit with a tweak that wins over this Senator or that. A bill with this twisted idea at its core will fail time and time again. That is why the vote had to be pulled yesterday. You can be sure, if it were popular with the American people, it wouldn't have had to be pulled.  I make my friends on the Republican side and President Trump an offer. Let's turn over a new leaf. Let's start over. Let's abandon more tax breaks for the rich. Let's abandon cuts to Medicaid, and discuss what the American people are really concerned about: premiums, deductibles, the cost and quality of healthcare.  President Obama invited both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to Blair House to discuss healthcare reform in front of the American people early in his first term as President Trump, I challenge you to invite us--all 100 of us, Republicans and Democrats--to Blair House to discuss a new bipartisan way forward on healthcare in front of all the American people. It would focus on what you, Mr.President, have talked about in your campaign: lower costs, better healthcare, covering everybody--not on tax cuts for the rich, not on slashing President Trump, you said you wouldn't cut We don't want to either.  We Democrats are genuinely interested in finding a place where our two parties can come together on healthcare. We want to bring down premiums. We want to bring down deductibles too. We want to stabilize the marketplace. We want to control the outrageous costs of prescription drugs--another thing the President talked about in his campaign.  There is plenty of common ground for us to come together around. We believe our healthcare system has made important progress over the past 8 years, but it still needs to be improved in many ways. We admit the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. There are ways we can improve on that law and on our entire healthcare system. So let's talk together about how we can achieve that in a bipartisan way.  If my Republican friends abandon cuts to Medicaid, highly unpopular with the American people; abandon tax breaks for the wealthiest few, highly unpopular with the American people, we Democrats are more than willing to meet with them and the White House to talk about how to improve healthcare for the American people, how to lower deductibles, how to provide better healthcare for more people at a lower cost because that is what we Democrats are fighting for: the average American family, not the wealthy few.  Today, we can turn over a new leaf and discuss healthcare legislation the way our Founders intended our government to discuss legislation: as a true debate between all of our country's representatives.  Yesterday, the majority leader reminded Republican Senators that if they failed on their partisan healthcare bill, they would have to negotiate with me, the minority leader, and by implication, our Democratic colleagues. When did the prospect of bipartisanship become a cudgel instead of an opportunity? When did bipartisanship become a threat? That is not how Congress is supposed to work. Negotiations with the minority to seek a compromise should be the first option, not the last resort.  Let's start over and get back to legislating in a way deserving of the grand tradition of the Senate as the world's greatest deliberative body. Providing affordable and quality healthcare is an issue we should grapple with, all of us together. It is one of the most important things we can do for our country. We can do it but only if we do it together and put the partisan ideology aside.  So I challenge the President, invite us all to Blair Let's see what we can come up with. Let's try. We Democrats have, on several occasions, sent letters to our Republican colleagues asking for bipartisan talks on healthcare. So far we have been rebuffed. Now, with the demise of this bill yesterday--its inability to get enough votes to proceed--we have an opportunity to go back to the drawing board.  We are willing to debate and compromise on healthcare, but we have to be included, and it has to be a discussion on how to actually improve our healthcare system for the American people, not slash Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. We can meet, and we can try or the Republicans can stick to the same partisan approach on healthcare, which so hurts working families and so benefits millionaires.

6657,topic-id,494,"Mr.Speaker, as the chief sponsor of this legislation, as well as the chief sponsor of the original Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, I rise in support of this legislation and hope that it is swiftly enacted.  The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, enacted in 2006, is landmark legislation intended to keep our communities, and, most importantly, our children safe from sex offenders and other dangerous predators.  This bipartisan bill strengthened the sex offender registry requirements and enforcement, extended Federal registry requirements to Indian Tribes, and authorized funding for Federal programs intended to address and deter child exploitation.                              {time}  1615  The centerpiece of the Adam Walsh Act is the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, or SORNA for short. SORNA's goal is to create a seamless national sex offender registry to assist law enforcement efforts to detect and track offenders. SORNA provides minimum standards for State sex offender registries and created the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website, which allows law enforcement officials and the general public to search for sex offenders nationwide from just one website.  H.1188, the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2017, reauthorizes two key programs from the original Adam Walsh Act: grants to the States and other jurisdictions to implement the Adam Walsh Act's sex offender registry requirements and funding for the U.marshals to locate and apprehend sex offenders who violate registration requirements. These programs are crucial to efforts to complete and enforce the national network of sex offender registries, particularly in light of the already passed deadline for States to come into compliance with SORNA.[[Page H4399]]  Based on feedback from the States, H.1188 makes targeted changes to the SORNA sex offender registry requirements. The bill changes the period of time after which juveniles adjudicated delinquent can petition to be removed from the sex offender registry for a clean record from 25 to 15 years, and provides that juveniles do not need to be included on publicly viewed sex offender registries. Instead, it is sufficient for juveniles to be included on registries that are only viewed by law enforcement entities. I believe these provisions strike an appropriate balance between being tough on juveniles who commit serious sex crimes and understanding that there can be differences between adult and juvenile offenders.  The bill also recognizes the unique challenges that tribes face in implementing H.1188 provides technical assistance to tribes so they can access, and enter information into, the Federal criminal information databases.  Finally, H.1188 amends the statute of limitations to allow individuals who were victims of exploitation or trafficking as juveniles to have 10 years after becoming an adult to file suit for a civil remedy. It is my hope that, with these commonsense changes, more States will come into compliance.  With the passage of this legislation, Congress can send a strong message to all Americans about our continued commitment to keeping our Nation's children safe. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgH4396-7.txt,1041,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,22.0,June
6758,topic-id,1495,"Mr.President, after weeks of secrecy, after not engaging with the public, after an effort to prevent not only Democrats in this body but women in this body from participating in putting together a new healthcare bill, last week we saw Senate Republican leaders put forward their bill to repeal the Affordable Care  Like its companion bill in the House, this legislation imposes draconian cuts to Medicaid, our Nation's principal program for insuring children, people with disabilities, and seniors in nursing homes. It drives up costs for middle- and low-income Americans while delivering huge new tax cuts to the wealthiest in this country.  I start with the premise that you can't take health insurance away from 22 million Americans and call it reform or better care. I think President Trump was accurate when he described this approach simply as mean. The fact is, this legislation is a direct threat to the health and well-being of millions of Americans, including tens of thousands in New  The opioid epidemic in the country and in New Hampshire is the worst public health crisis in modern history. In New Hampshire, thanks to the expansion of Medicaid, done by a Republican legislature and a Democratic Governor, my colleague from New Hampshire who is now in the Senate, who is here with me today--thanks to their bipartisan work, nearly 11,000 Granite Staters have been able to access lifesaving treatment under the Medicaid Program for substance use disorders. By completely reversing the Medicaid expansion, the Senate bill released last week would cost who knows how many lives and would be a crippling setback in our fight against the opioid crisis.  Medicaid covers one out of three children in New Hampshire, as well as people with disabilities and seniors in nursing homes.  In concert with the President's budget, this bill being proposed by the Senate would cut Medicaid funding in half by the year 2027. Cuts of that magnitude simply cannot be done without[[Page S3814]]having devastating effects on children and other vulnerable people across New  Then, of course, this legislation blocks all Federal funding for Planned We have more than 12,000 Granite State women and men who depend on Planned Parenthood for essential health services, including cancer screenings.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, nearly 45,500 Granite Staters would lose coverage under the Republican leader's bill. These are people who rely on that coverage for basic care, as well as for treatment of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses, and they are deeply afraid that they will be among the 22 million Americans who will lose their health coverage if the Senate bill becomes law.  Last Friday, Senator Hassan and I convened an emergency public field hearing in We wanted to hear directly from Granite Staters who would be affected by the Senate bill. I have to say--and I am sure my colleague agrees with me--it was an extraordinary event, with over 200 attendees. They overflowed the overflow room. This is a picture of the room where we held the hearing, and we can see people lined up on either side of the room, waiting to take their turn to testify.  Senator Hassan and I heard firsthand from healthcare providers, from people in recovery from substance use disorders, from parents of children with chronic diseases and disabilities, and so many others who are concerned about this legislation. We listened to emotional, heartfelt statements about the uncertainty, anxiety, and anger this Senate bill has caused. I was especially moved by testimony from parents who are worried their children will lose access to the lifesaving treatment they need that for so many of these kids is the difference between life and death.  People like Paula Garvey, of Amherst, NH, who talked about her 19-year-old daughter Rosie, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis just 2 weeks after birth. Rosie also suffers from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Rosie must follow a strict regimen of medications to keep the cystic fibrosis under control. Paula fears that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and cuts to Medicaid will leave her daughter without coverage for her preexisting condition and that insurance companies will once again impose a lifetime dollar limit on benefits.  For Paula, and for any parent, the prospect of not being able to access lifesaving care for a child is profoundly upsetting. Paula said: I don't know what I am going to do if the Affordable Care Act goes away. What will Rosie do when she is off of our insurance and she is not able to find insurance again?  Sarah Sadowski of Concord, NH, testified about her 9-year-old daughter who has cerebral palsy. She said:       The Affordable Care Act was a huge moment of hope. I cannot      face what life would look like with pre-existing conditions,      lifetime limits, and countless hours on the phone with      insurance companies.  At the field hearing, we also heard important testimony about others who rely on For example, Medicaid provides coverage for more than 10 million Americans with disabilities and nearly 6 million seniors in nursing homes. In fact, these two groups alone account for nearly two-thirds of all Medicaid expenditures. Yet the Republican leader's plan to cut Medicaid funding in half over the next decade would have dire consequences for these  Brendan Williams, CEO of the New Hampshire Health Care Association, told our hearing that 63 percent of nursing home residents in New Hampshire rely on As was reported on Sunday in the New York Times, the deep cuts to Medicaid included in the Senate bill would force many retirees out of nursing homes or lead States to require residents' families to help pay for care. For many families, this is just not an option. They don't have the finances to be able to do that. So what happens? Their loved ones get kicked out of their residential care.  We also heard compelling testimony from healthcare providers who treat people with substance use disorders. Melissa Fernald is a private clinician in Wolfeboro, She told us:       For the majority of [Medicaid expansion] patients, it is      the first time they have had health insurance. It allowed me      to assist them in properly diagnosing their mental health      conditions . . . and securing primary care providers to treat      their medical needs. It has been a powerful experience to      watch them heal and grow as a result of receiving proper      care. . . . My clients are more motivated and capable of      getting a job and gaining financial independence.  Again, if your heart is not moved by the morality of these kinds of stories and by the values I think we should have in this country to help people who need help, we should be moved by the economics of this. It is going to cost a whole lot more when we kick people with substance use disorders off of their insurance, when they go to emergency rooms to get their care, or when they die than to make sure they get the help they need.  The Senate bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and radically cut Medicaid is a threat to healthcare coverage for people in New Hampshire and in every other State in this country. I am so grateful to all of those Granite Staters who attended our field hearing on I know that in other States across this country, large numbers of people are turning out to express overwhelming opposition to the Republican leader's bill. I heard this morning that polling shows that just 17 percent of Americans support this legislation. We need to listen. We need to stop this headlong rush to pass a cruel and heartless bill.  For ordinary people in New Hampshire--the people whom Senator Hassan and I heard from on Friday--repealing the Affordable Care Act and gutting the Medicaid Program isn't about politics. It is a matter of life and death. We need to listen to the voices of ordinary people whose lives and finances would be turned upside down by this bill.  There is a better way forward for both the Senate and our country. It is time for Republicans and Democrats to put ideology and partisanship aside and come together to do what is right for ordinary working people in this country.  The majority leader's decision to delay a vote on the bill is an opportunity for all of us in the When we come back after next week's July 4th recess, let's come together in an open and inclusive process. The right way forward is for Republicans and Democrats to work together to strengthen the parts of the Affordable Care Act that are working, including Medicaid expansion, and to fix what is not working.  According to poll after poll, this is what the majority of the American people want us to do. It is time now to respect their wishes and to strengthen the Affordable Care Act so it works for all  I yield the floor.

6770,topic-id,862,"Mr.President, I am very pleased to join my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, and appreciate all of the efforts she is making to try to address the challenges we are facing in the healthcare markets across this country. Like her and like so many of my colleagues who are going to be here, I have come to the floor this afternoon because we want to take urgent steps and we can take steps today to address the uncertainty in our health insurance markets. We can take steps today that can hold down premiums.  I have heard Senators on both sides of the aisle who have expressed concern about looming premium increases in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. We all need to understand, as Senator Heitkamp pointed out, what some of the causes of these premium increases are.  Insurers regularly cite the Trump administration's refusal to commit to making cost-sharing reduction payments, also known as These CSR payments were included in the Affordable Care Act in order to help Americans afford insurance once they had it. The ACA requires insurers to reduce deductibles and copayments for working families who are buying insurance in the marketplace. Because of the cost-sharing reduction payments, the CSRs, patients pay less for their care and the government reimburses the insurers.  These reductions and payments are built into the rates insurers are charging for 2017. Yet the Trump administration has refused to commit to paying these reimbursements because of a partisan lawsuit that has been brought by House Republican leaders.  Because of the radically uncertain landscape insurers are facing right now, many of them are doing one of[[Page S3822]]two things: Some are pulling out of the ACA marketplaces altogether, and others are dramatically increasing premiums. The end result is fewer choices and higher costs for American families.  Last year in my State of New Hampshire--and Senator Hassan is here. We represent New Hampshire, and we have been very concerned about what is happening right now. Last year, the insurance markets were stable, and health insurance premiums increased an average of just 2 percent--the lowest annual increase in history. Today is a radically different story, in large part because of the uncertainty this administration is causing by refusing to guarantee insurers cost-sharing reduction payments. What we are seeing is that those insurance companies are protecting themselves by raising premiums on patients.  The same thing is happening in other In some cases, insurers are filing two different sets of rates--a set that is premised on the administration continuing to make cost-sharing reduction payments and an alternative set with higher premiums to account for continuing uncertainty and the possibility that this administration will stop making those payments.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration continues to send mixed signals to insurers, and of course it has threatened to stop paying cost-sharing reduction payments altogether. If this were to happen, insurers could immediately exit the markets for breach of contract.  So we are kind of in this perverse limbo situation. The administration creates uncertainty by refusing to commit to continuing the CSR payments, and the insurers protect themselves by exiting the markets or raising rates. And it is the premium holders, the families out there, who are hurt by this political football that the administration seems to be intent on continuing.  That is why I have introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act, which is a bill to appropriate funding for the cost-sharing reduction payments in order to make good on our commitment to help working families with their deductibles and cost sharing.  I believe that the House Republican leaders' lawsuit has no merit but that the chaos it has caused by allowing the Trump administration to waver on these promised payments requires that we act now.  I am pleased to be joined in this legislation by Senators Baldwin, Blumenthal, Cardin, Carper, Coons, Kaine, Hassan, Heitkamp, Cortez Masto, King, Leahy, Markey, Wyden, Stabenow, and I am sure that by tomorrow, we will have even more Senators on this bill.  We could pass it right now. Right now, we could end this manufactured crisis. We could immediately restore certainty and stability to the health insurance markets for all of our constituents. That would be good for the Republicans, and it would be good for the Mostly, it would be good for the families out there who are experiencing this uncertainty.  We could do this. It would give us the breathing space we need to come together on a bipartisan basis to improve the law, to strengthen what is working and to fix what is not. In poll after poll, that is what the American people want us to do. They want us to stop the partisan bickering. They want us to work together. They want us to make commonsense improvements so that this law works for every  Mr.President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of 1462, the Marketplace Certainty Act; that the bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

Senator Barrasso is objecting to a commonsense step to stabilize the insurance marketplaces.  This is not going to be the last word because this is a commitment we made to American families. The instability here in Washington is what is causing the instability not only in insurance markets but in the country at large.  We are approaching the Fourth of July, which is next week.

I also thank Congressman LaMalfa, Congressman Schrader, and all of the other Members for their hard work on this issue. In particular, I thank Congressman Gosar, who is here today, Congressman Tipton, and Congressman O'Halleran for cosponsoring our bipartisan amendment.  Mr.Chairman, the Sinema amendment ensures the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior are educated on how unmanned technologies are transforming the energy industry to improve maintenance, lower costs, and reduce the risk of wildfires. Unmanned technology is changing the way Arizonans do business.  Currently, energy companies use manned helicopters to check transmission lines and direct repair and maintenance crews. This work ensures Arizona's electric grid remains resilient, reliable, efficient, and that it[[Page H5030]]works when Arizona families and businesses need it. But utilities and cooperatives believe that unmanned technology can improve the way we manage our energy infrastructure. Unmanned technologies can monitor transmission lines quickly and safely in multiple locations, enabling more efficient operations and maintenance.  They provide better situational awareness to crews and managers, reducing accidents and workplace injuries. It also improves vegetation management, disaster prevention, and disaster response. These are critical issues in my home State of In rural areas, our transmission and distribution lines run through Federal land that are prone to wildfires.  I am a cosponsor of the underlying bill because I recognize the importance of keeping these rights-of-way clear of dry brush and fallen trees. Streamlining the process that allows us to perform routine maintenance and prevent wildfires that too often endanger our communities is just commonsense. Our bipartisan amendment improves the underlying bill by ensuring that unmanned technologies integrate appropriately, quickly, and effectively into broader vegetation management, disaster prevention, and disaster response strategies.  Unmanned technologies have the potential to improve efficiency, lower energy costs for Arizona families and businesses, and reduce the risk of dangerous wildfires by ensuring that rights-of-way are reliable and properly maintained. Federal agencies should be prepared to embrace these smart technologies.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Sinema amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

6692,topic-id,2256,"Mr.President, first, I want to thank the Senator from We are so pleased that she is here and her voice is so strong for the citizens of Nevada and appreciate very much her comments this evening.  I am rising this evening to talk about an issue that affects every single person, every single family in Michigan and all across the Nation, and that is healthcare. I feel very confident that I can say that each one of the 48 members of the Democratic caucus--each and every one of us would love to be on this floor working with Republican colleagues across the aisle to lower the costs of prescription drugs, to lower the out-of-pocket costs of healthcare, to create more competition and more[[Page S3583]]insurance choices for people in the insurance pools than are there now--to basically fix the problems.  I am proud to be with colleagues tonight because we are not willing to support anything that unravels the healthcare system, raises costs, takes away healthcare for people, and, on top of that, gives a tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, insurance executives, and pharmaceutical companies with the dollars that are cut.  So here we are. The House has passed a bill that, in fact, raises costs, takes away healthcare, gives the tax cuts I talked about. Now we are in the The Republicans have a healthcare bill, but they will not let us see it.  I am the ranking Democrat on the Health Subcommittee of the Finance You would think someone would have reached out to have conversations with me and members of our subcommittee--members of our whole committee--but that has not happened. They are letting the Trump administration see it, but not the American public. They are letting K Street lobbyists see it. That is probably where I will get a copy first--through lobbyists--but not the American public, who will lose their healthcare and pay more.  If you have cancer and you are not going to be able to get coverage, if you are going to potentially be dropped or have preexisting conditions or get caps put on the number of cancer treatments you can receive, I believe you have a right to see this bill. If you have epilepsy and will lose your insurance, you have a right to see this bill. If you are a woman who will be charged more for insurance and be considered to have a preexisting condition just because you are a woman, you have a right to see this bill. If you are senior whose rates are going to go skyrocketing upward, you have a right to see this bill. But the sad fact is, Republicans don't think the American people have a right to know or to see this bill or to review it or to comment on it--to have a chance to give their opinion on it.  The difference in process couldn't be more clear between the way the Affordable Care Act was originally worked on for about 18 months and then passed and what is happening right now. In 2009, Republicans called for a fair, collaborative, and deliberative legislative process. I agree. In fact, we all agree.  From 2009 to 2010, the Senate Finance Committee held more than 53 hearings on health reform--hearings, open committee meetings, work sessions. As a new member of Finance at that time, I was involved in every single one of those, with hours and hours of listening, deliberating, people sharing their opinions, and debating. Counting the HELP Committee deliberations, there were 100 hearings and committee meetings before the bill was finalized and debated to be reported out of committee.  The Republicans have had no hearings--zero hearings. They have had no public meetings--zero public meetings.  During the Finance Committee markup, when we were working through and voting out the bill, we considered 135 amendments, often late into the night. The final Senate bill included 147 Republican amendments. In the end, we were trying to do everything we could to get bipartisan support, when it was clear that politically there was not a desire--even with 147 Republican amendments in the bill--to have a bipartisan healthcare bill.  Republicans will not even allow us to see the bill, let alone amend it. Our position is very clear. If there is no hearing, there is no vote. We need them to show us the bill.  There is, I think, a really good reason they will not show us the bill. They will not let us see it because it is a disaster for the American people. It is a disaster for the people in Michigan whom I represent.  From the House bill, we know that 14 million fewer people will be insured after the first year; 23 million fewer people will be insured after 10 years. This may change somewhat back and forth. We have no idea. But we know the general framework the Senate is working in is the same general framework as the We know that in 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 51 million people under the age of 65 will be uninsured--no insurance.  We are told that premiums would go up 20 percent next year, and States would be allowed to opt out of key insurance laws that protect consumers. To really understand what that means--that means all of the decisions about your care go back to the insurance companies, not your doctor. Laws that protect people with preexisting conditions are gone. Rules that prevent women from being charged more are gone. Laws that prevent seniors from being charged more are gone. And the way it used to be is that if you got sick, the insurance company could decide to drop you. It was the insurance company that said how many cancer treatments you were able to receive or mental health visits, if any, you would receive. You always paid more than for physical health--the same with addiction.  This all goes away with what is being talked about here. In other words, costs are going to go up, and care is going to go down. To add insult to injury, all of this is going to go to tax cuts for multimillionaires and billionaires, to drug companies and insurance companies--while someone is losing nursing home care, cancer treatments, maternity care, and children will be unable to go to the doctor and parents forced to go back to using the emergency room.  I want to share with my colleagues what these changes would mean for people in There are so many people I have talked to, so many stories I have heard. I received a letter from a woman named Amy who owns a small retail business in She has health insurance through her husband's job--a small business owner. Amy has chronic myeloid leukemia. It is managed with a medication that costs $20,000 a month--not a year, a month. After her deductible and 10-percent copay, she said she quickly reaches the maximum out-of-pocket expense on her insurance each year. Amy wrote:       Preexisting conditions, maximum out-of-pocket costs and      lifetime cap costs are important to me. . . . [Without them]      I could never afford my health care. Without the ACA, I could      quickly bankrupt my family and still die. . . . Please      consider my situation when deciding your vote on any changes      to the I need your help. I want and need to stay alive      and raise my children.  Healthcare reform allows Amy to stay on her husband's insurance plan and pay for the cancer treatments that are keeping her alive. The Republican plan would put people with preexisting conditions like cancer at the mercy of health insurance companies.  Here is another way the Republican plan would hurt American families. Thanks to the Medicaid expansion, 650,000 people are newly covered under what we call the Healthy Michigan The good news is, 97 percent of Michigan children can now go to the doctor. They don't have to wait and go to the emergency room. If they have a cold, their mom or dad can take them to a doctor. They can get preventive care, rather than waiting until something awful happens and going to the emergency room. What is the good news for the State of Michigan out of that? Michigan will end up, this year going into next year, with $432 million more in the treasury. Taxpayer dollars aren't going to have to be used on healthcare because the right thing was done--creating a way for children to see a doctor. What has happened? We have a 50-percent reduction on folks who don't have insurance going into the emergency room, and it saves money when you do that. The number of people treated has gone down 50 percent--the number of people treated without insurance.  The great thing about healthcare to understand is that if we ignore it, it doesn't mean people don't get sick, that they don't get cancer, that they don't need a nursing home or that their child doesn't get sick. If you just ignore it, the costs go up because people ultimately use the most expensive ways to get treated.  If you actually plan it out and do the right thing on the front end and people can see a doctor and they can get the checkups and the care they need and the treatments they need, you actually save money. That is the example of the State of  The Republican plan would end the Medicaid expansion. Healthy Michigan would go away. One young man in Michigan only 19 years old shared his story of living with his single mom when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He was working, but his employer didn't offer health insurance. He[[Page S3584]]didn't have transportation to get to his appointments or treatments.  Thanks to Healthy Michigan, he got insurance and treatment at Munson Healthcare in Traverse He is now free from cancer, has a job with benefits, and is engaged to be married, and we wish him well. Healthy Michigan and the Medicaid expansion saved this young man's life.  The Republican plan would end the Healthy Michigan plan, ripping coverage from 650,000 people in Michigan, including cancer patients. And for what? And for what? To pay for tax breaks for drug companies and the ultrawealthy one more time. This means Michigan families will be unable to care for their loved ones when they need it most.  In January, I led a forum on Secretary Price's healthcare policies, and a woman came from Michigan to tell her story. Ann was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was 40 years old, and she has very limited use of her arms and legs. We are so grateful that she made the trip to DC to share her story. Medicare and secondary insurance cover most of the cost of her medication, which costs an astonishing $75,000 a year. That is nearly her entire household income, including Social Security benefits.  Ann had been caring for her aging mom when her mom's dementia worsened. Ann didn't know where she would find the $6,000 a month for nursing home care. How many families are in that situation?  Fortunately, Ann's mom qualified for By the way, three out of five seniors in Michigan are able to get their nursing home care through Three out of five are getting nursing home care because of Medicaid, including Ann's mom.  This nursing home care paid for the final 3 years of her life. Here is what Ann said:       It was only because of Medicaid that she was able to get      the help that she needed at the end of her life. I don't know      how I could have cared for my mother on top of managing my      own care. My family would have lost our home and all our      savings in trying to keep up with their bills.  Medicaid helped Ann care for her mom at the end of her life. This is a good thing.  Again, the Republican plan would cut Medicaid by $834 billion. That is the House plan coming over. We don't know how much would be cut here, but we know whatever will be cut will be used to pay for tax breaks for drug companies, insurance CEOs, millionaires, and billionaires. How does that reflect American values?  In conclusion, Republicans are hiding their bill because they know it is a bad deal for American families. It is a bad deal. The President of the United States called it ``mean.'' I agree with him. It is mean, and it is definitely a bad deal for the people I represent in Costs go up and care goes down, all to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires. We are better than this as a country. Our Nation is better than this.  It is time for Republicans to show us the bill so we can work on it together. Give us a chance. Give the American people a chance to have input, to say what they think before it is forced on them in a secret process that is rammed through this floor. It is time to move beyond partisanship to get something done for the American people.  Again, I know that the 48 Democratic Senators in this Chamber want to work on lowering the cost of prescription drugs, reducing out-of-pocket costs, helping small businesses that want to provide coverage for their employees, and making the healthcare system better.  Let's stop this bad bill and work together on behalf of the American people.  I yield the floor.

When he enlisted in the Army in 1947, his choice of overseas assignments was, according to him, ``anything but Alaska''--``anyplace but Alaska.'' But he got Alaska, and he stayed and he loved it, and he settled in Chugiak-Eagle  Before long, he owned the local newspaper, the Alaska Star--now the Chugiak-Eagle River Star--and he was coaching his son's Little League baseball team. When they got too old for Little League, he began to form new leagues for them to play in, which his boys did. Eventually, his sons got too old for all the leagues, but Lee kept up the love of the game.  Then he and former State Senator Bill Stoltze, a good friend of mine and another huge booster of baseball in Alaska, hatched a plan to get a team to their area as part of the Alaska Baseball So the first Chugiak-Eagle River-Chinook game was in 2011, and it is now called the Lee Jordan Field and the Loretta French Sports Complex, and they have been going strong ever since.

7012,topic-id,1841,"Mr.President, the past 8 years have been tough on Despite the fact that the recession officially ended in June of 2009, the economy never really rebounded. President Obama presided over the weakest economic recovery in 60 years. His Presidency was characterized by poor economic growth, a dearth of jobs and opportunities, and almost nonexistent wage increases.  In 2016, the economy grew at a dismal 1.6 percent, far below the level of growth displayed by a healthy economy. Typically 3 to 3\1/2\ percent is the average, going back to World War The GDP report for the first quarter of this year underscored the need to implement the kind of pro-growth policies that were lacking during the Obama years. Republicans in Congress and the White House have already acted to repeal a number of burdensome Obama regulations that were foisted onto the American people near the end of his We plan to keep up our efforts.  Getting rid of unnecessary regulations will go a long way toward freeing up businesses to grow and create jobs and put more money in Americans pockets. Of course, repealing burdensome regulations is just one of the things we need to get our economy healthy again. Fixing our broken Tax Code is another. As a member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, I will be introducing tax reform legislation in the near future, targeted primarily for Main Street businesses that pay taxes at the individual rate.  I am looking forward to working on comprehensive tax reform with Chairman Hatch and the rest of my colleagues on the Finance Committee as we move forward this year. It is critical that passthrough businesses, which are the main focus of my bill, are not left behind in this effort.  Today, I want to talk about spurring growth in a specific sector of our economy, one that is very important to my home state; that is, the agricultural sector. Like so many other Americans, farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and across the country have had a rough time of it over the past few years. Market prices for farm and ranch products have been on a steady decline since 2013, and net farm income has dropped substantially as a result of that. Worse, there is little expectation that prices will improve over the next few years, which means farmers' and ranchers' incomes are likely to continue to decrease.  Farmers are struggling to repay their debts. Between 2014 and 2016, the delinquency rates on farm non-real estate loans more than doubled. Delinquencies on farm real estate loans rose from $1.18 billion in 2014 to $1.66 billion in 2016. While these numbers are not all-time highs, the increases are disturbing and show no signs of reversing any time soon.  Farming and ranching are not just careers in South Dakota; they are a way of life, one that connects communities and families to the land and one generation to the next. Nearly 3,000 South Dakota farm families have been honored as operating century farms, meaning the same family has operated at least 80 acres of that farm for 100 years or more. But in today's weak agricultural economy, many families are afraid they will be the ones to lose the farm or ranch that has been in their family for generations. That would be a loss not just for them but for our country.  Few of us understand the sacrifices that go into this way of life. When we pick up a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread at the grocery store, we don't think of the farmer who rose long before the Sun and finished his day long after the Sun had set. Our country is made stronger by the hard work, fierce dedication, and unconquerable spirit of America's farmers.  We need to make a concerted effort to help farmers meet the challenges they are facing right now so that America can continue to help feed the world and Americans can continue to have access to the home-grown products they depend upon.  So how do we do that? One thing we can do that would immediately improve agricultural prices would be to quickly negotiate new bilateral trade agreements. Agriculture is heavily dependent upon trade, and in today's economic climate, we cannot afford to have our agricultural exports restricted by inadequate trade policies.  U.farmers have lost ground internationally. Our current share of the global grain market is just 30 percent, down from 65 percent in the mid-1970s. We need to take steps to level the playing field for American farmers and ranchers so they can be more competitive internationally. I have encouraged the President to start by negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with  Japan is one of our most important trading partners, but U.farmers too often face hefty tariffs on the products they sell in U.negotiators made important progress toward reducing these barriers during the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.  We need to build on the work they did and negotiate a bilateral agreement with Japan as soon as possible. This would benefit a wide variety of American producers, including South Dakota beef producers who currently face a massive 38.5-percent tariff on the beef they sell in  Trade agreements would help tremendously, but there is more we need to do to ensure the long-term sustainability of production agriculture in the United  Every 5 years, Congress has the opportunity to reset Federal farm policy when it passes the farm bill. The current farm bill expires in 2018, and it is not too early to start the drafting process for the next bill.  I served on the Agriculture Committee in the House and now serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee under the strong leadership of my friend from Kansas, Chairmanship Pat I will be working on my fourth farm bill, and I take this responsibility very seriously.  I spend a lot of time talking to farmers and ranchers while I am back home in South Dakota, and I have been developing legislation based on the feedback they give me about Federal programs. I have already introduced two key proposals that I hope will be part of the final farm bill that we pass next year, and I will be introducing several more farm bill legislative proposals this year.  All farmers are familiar with the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, which provides incentives for farmers to take environmentally sensitive land out of production for 10 to 15 years. But a lot of farmers have told me that they don't want to retire portions of their land for a decade or more. To address this, I am proposing a new program that would reduce operating costs by providing a modest rental payment and increasing crop insurance premium discounts.  The program I am proposing, the Soil Health and Income Protection Program, would provide a new, short-term option for farmers that would allow them to take their worst performing cropland out of production for 3 to 5 years, instead of the 10 to 15 years required by CRP rules. This program would result in improved soil health and reduced crop insurance costs, and it would provide beneficial areas for wildlife while also improving the bottom line for participating farms.[[Page S2668]]  The other key proposal I have introduced would make a number of revisions and management improvements to the CRP program and other U.Department of Agriculture easement programs.  CRP plays a very significant role in South Dakota's economy, as it provides a major portion of the habitat for the Chinese ringneck pheasant, which brings more than $250 million each year to my State's rural areas, towns, and cities. Unfortunately, farmers have spent years frustrated by some of the ways the Department of Agriculture has managed this program.  We need to make sure that Federal farm programs don't discourage farmers and ranchers from participating, especially in times like these, when these programs are sorely needed to provide valuable safety net assistance and to help protect soil and water.  My conservation program legislation addresses major concerns that farmers have with CRP and other USDA conservation programs by allowing commonsense use and management of land enrolled in these programs, which improves these programs for farmers and at the same time saves taxpayers' money.  My legislation also expands the CRP acreage cap by 25 percent and uses historical acreage averages to make sure CRP will be available in States that have used it and that need it the most. Above all, the acres enrolled in CRP and other easement programs must be effectively used and managed to maximize their usefulness and effectiveness for land and water conservation and wildlife, and I will work to make that happen.  In addition, both of my legislative proposals contain provisions to provide additional support to young, beginning, and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, as well as to military veterans. We need to ensure that young and beginning farmers and ranchers and others have opportunities to succeed, especially now, when even seasoned farmers are struggling.  Along with trade agreements and the farm bill, there are other things we can do to help farmers and ranchers and small businesses. This year, we plan to take up major reform of our broken, bloated Tax Making sure that we consider the needs of farmers and ranchers during this debate will be one of my priorities.  We can also help farmers and ranchers by removing burdensome government regulations that do little to help the environment but force farmers to spend untold hours and dollars on compliance.  One example of this kind of burdensome regulation is the so-called waters of the United States rule, something with which every farmer and rancher is familiar. This EPA regulation improperly used the Clean Water Act to justify expanding the EPA's regulatory authority to waters like small wetlands, creeks, stock ponds, and ditches. The rule specifically targeted the Prairie Pothole Region, which covers five States, including nearly all of eastern South I am grateful that the President chose to protect farmers and ranchers by announcing a review of this rule in February of this year.  We could further support American farmers by removing yet another unnecessary regulatory hurdle, and that is the Reid vapor pressure regulation, which restricts the sale of E15 fuel during the summer driving season.  Providing a waiver for E15, as enjoyed by other fuels, is a bipartisan, no-cost way to roll back regulation and grant consumers real choice at the pumps, as well as to help our farmers.  Our Nation and the world depend on American farmers and ranchers. We need to make sure they can sustain their operations and continue to efficiently feed America and the world.  I look forward to continuing our work on tax, trade, regulatory, and farm bill policies that support farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and throughout our country.  When agriculture does well, I would argue, our national economy does well.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

6768,topic-id,1607,"Mr.President, I rise to defend the essential healthcare that 300,000 New Mexicans and millions of Americans depend on.  Leader McConnell calls his TrumpCare bill the Better Care Reconciliation Act, but actually the bill will mean worse care for seniors, children, the disabled, rural communities, and working families all trying to make ends meet. It will mean no care for 22 million people, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office report. The bill cancels health insurance and slashes Medicaid funding, all so Republicans can give big tax breaks to the richest  President Trump called the original House bill mean. The Senate Republicans' healthcare bill isn't just mean; it is cruel. It is cruel to take away nursing home care that seniors depend on, cruel to take away necessary medical services from disabled children. Make no mistake, this bill will cost lives.  This version of TrumpCare is a massive redistribution of wealth from working families, seniors, and the disabled to the wealthy. But the Republicans' bill is not Robin Hood in reverse. TrumpCare doesn't just take money away from the poor to give to the rich; it takes away people's healthcare and robs families of their health and ability to work, care for their families, contribute to society, and lead happy and healthy lives.  This bill was drafted in secret. Only a handful of Republicans and their lobbyist friends got to see the bill. It is no wonder the American people hate what TrumpCare would do to them and to their families. TrumpCare is cruel; there is no doubt about it.  It is good that Leader McConnell decided not to call a vote this week on this terrible bill, but I am by no means satisfied. We need to hear from the Republican leadership that they are ready to work with Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act, not gut it, and to truly improve our healthcare system. This is what the American people are demanding, and this is what we in Congress should be working toward on a bipartisan basis.  We created Medicaid in 1965 to serve a critical need. Since then, Medicaid has become one of the most successful programs for making sure low-income people get the healthcare they need. People get treatment for illnesses that once were a death sentence.  The American people support a government that doesn't leave its most vulnerable to suffer and die, but the current Senate bill cuts Medicaid by more than $770 billion. Let's be clear, these cuts have nothing to do with better healthcare. They are a ruthless tactic to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.  On the campaign trail, the President vowed not to cut He said it a number of times. Last week, he tweeted that he is ``very supportive'' of the bill. Yesterday, he met with the Republican caucus and told them to pass the bill. By supporting this bill, the President breaks the promise he made during the campaign.  Medicaid expansion has allowed millions of Americans and over 265,000 people in my State to see a doctor. Many of these folks work but don't have health insurance through their jobs or can't afford private health insurance. Medicaid expansion is literally a lifeline, but TrumpCare wipes this out. I can't believe that our Republican friends are doing this to New Mexico children and families.  Take 1\1/2\ year old Rafe--this is Rafe is here with his mom Jessica and his dad Sam, a veteran. They are from Albuquerque, Rafe was born with cortical visual impairment--a kind of legal blindness--and significant developmental delays. He faced monumental medical challenges. But Jessica and Sam have been able to access the intensive medical care, early intervention services, medical equipment, and therapies he needs through a combination of their military insurance and  Now Rafe's parents are scared he will lose his Medicaid services. Their military insurance alone doesn't cover all the services and equipment Rafe needs. They need Without it, Rafe's chances for a better life are threatened. They worry about--and this is their quote--``dealing with insurance, finding healthcare, tracking down specialty doctors, keeping up with therapy appointments and doctor's appointments.'' They worry whether Rafe will be able to walk, feed himself, graduate from high school, and get a job. Now they must worry whether he will get the medical care he needs to give him the opportunity to do all of those things.  Let's talk about Carmen and her three children. Carmen is a single parent. She serves Native American students as a teacher, a coach, dorm parent, and higher education administrator. The small nonprofit organization Carmen works for doesn't offer health insurance. For the past 4 years, Medicaid has helped pay for the healthcare for her two sons.  Her kids are healthy, but two have nut allergies and need EpiPens at school and at home. According to Carmen, ``When I renewed their EpiPen prescription for school this past fall, I was astounded that the price sky-rocketed to $741 to fill one prescription!''  Now Carmen is worried; she doesn't know whether her kids will lose Medicaid or how she will pay for prescriptions. She asked me: ``Please continue to fight for the Affordable Care Act because you are fighting for me and my family's well-being.''  It is cruel to threaten Rafe's chances for a healthier life, cruel that Carmen might not be able to pay for EpiPens for her kids. TrumpCare threatens these two families and millions more.  TrumpCare will hurt seniors, so it is not surprising that AARP strongly opposes it. AARP opposes the TrumpCare age tax that allows insurance companies to charge seniors up to five times more for their premiums. The age tax, combined with reducing tax credits for premiums, will price seniors out of health insurance needed to supplement their AARP is calling on every Senator to vote no on the Senate Republicans' bill.  Medicaid pays for an astounding 62 percent of all nursing home care. By cutting Medicaid, the Republicans threaten our mothers, our fathers, and our grandmothers and grandfathers in nursing homes. States can't bear the burden of these costs. Republicans want to shift them.  I know the State of New Mexico can't handle this. This cost-shift sets States up to cut reimbursement rates and reduce eligibility for services at nursing homes. Medicaid pays 64 percent of nursing home care in my New Mexico's 74 nursing homes will be impacted by these cuts.  Many of the folks in nursing homes are middle-class Americans who worked all their lives, paid taxes, and saved for retirement. They did everything right, but because skilled nursing care is so expensive, they have outlived their life savings, and now Medicaid pays the cost of care at the end of their lives, allowing them to live with dignity.  Senate Republicans may say that one improvement in their bill over the House bill is it protects people with preexisting conditions, but the American people shouldn't be fooled. People with preexisting conditions are not protected under the Senate bill the way they are now protected under the  The Senate Republican bill still allows States to waive the essential health benefits that all insurance companies must now provide under the These benefits include prescriptions, hospital stays, rehabilitative services, and laboratory services. If States waive these benefits, people with serious illnesses would have to pay out of pocket for these services or buy additional insurance, or if these services are covered but are not essential health benefits, insurance companies can put annual or lifetime limits on the services, and people with serious illnesses could end up with no coverage or be priced out of services.[[Page S3821]]  All this sends us back to the time when people faced not getting care or going bankrupt if they got sick. We passed the ACA because the American people agreed no one should go broke to pay for lifesaving care and that insurance companies shouldn't be able to place limits on the care someone could get in their lifetime. Why do Republicans want to take us back?  Finally, the steep cuts to Medicaid would devastate hospitals, especially rural hospitals. Make no mistake--rural hospitals are already struggling. Medicaid cuts will force some to close their doors if TrumpCare becomes law.  In New Mexico, our rural hospitals are often an economic anchor for the community. Hospital administrators in my State are very worried. Medicaid has helped the Guadalupe County Hospital cut its uninsured payer rate from 14 percent to 4 percent from 2014 to 2016. Its uncompensated care decreased 23 percent in the same period. The hospital's administrator, Christina Campos, fears what might happen if TrumpCare becomes law. She is urging me to protect access to care in rural areas.  I will fight hard to keep residents in our rural areas insured and to keep rural hospitals open in New Mexico and across the  The President and congressional Republicans want to take us back to the days when healthcare was a privilege for those who could afford it. The American people do not support the Republicans' cruel plans. Congress should listen to the pleas of our constituents. The American people reject the framework of They reject gutting Medicaid and the Medicaid expansion. They reject making seniors pay more for healthcare. They reject making healthcare inaccessible for those with fewer resources.  The Republicans need to go back to the drawing board and begin to work with I say to my colleagues across the aisle, do not take healthcare and the opportunity to lead a productive and happy life away from millions of Together, we can make affordable healthcare a reality for all.

6877,topic-id,3885,"Mr.President, thank you for your recognition.  Let me just say, at the beginning, I thank the Chair for the bipartisanship with which we both work on the Indian Affairs I very much appreciate that.  We are here with a few I rise with my colleagues from the Senate Committee on Indian I think Senator Heitkamp, Senator Franken, and, maybe, others will join us. I join them in reminding the Congress of its duty to Tribes and in its standing up for the healthcare of American Indians and Alaska Natives across Indian  Most of us are aware of the health disparities facing Native communities. We have seen the news about the failings of the Indian Health Service, and many of us have heard directly from Tribal leaders and Native constituents about the barriers to healthcare access on reservations, pueblos, and in villages, but the Members of the Senate on the Indian Affairs Committee are uniquely aware of the complex ways that the Tribal healthcare system works and how those systems will be catastrophically disrupted by TrumpCare and the repeal of the Affordable Care  The U.Government has a trust responsibility to provide American Indians and Alaska Natives with comprehensive, quality healthcare. The U.Constitution, treaties, and long-settled legal precedents are the basis for this responsibility. The Indian Health Service is the primary agency for fulfilling this obligation, but our trust responsibilities do not end there. The Medicaid and Medicare Program, Planned Parenthood, and other public health services all play key roles in the delivery of Native healthcare, and because the IHS is so consistently and severely underfunded, the ACA has made a huge difference.  Each fiscal year, the IHS receives a finite allocation of discretionary funding that it must stretch in order to meet the healthcare needs of 2.2 million Native That leaves the IHS with just over $3,500 per person--less than one-third of the national average--for healthcare spending. As a result, without additional resources, the IHS is forced to ration care, which limits Native families to hospitals and clinics that can only provide ``life and limb'' emergency medical services. Basic preventive care, like wellness visits, prenatal exams, and mammograms, have frequently been unavailable to most IHS patients.  ``Don't get sick after June,'' which is the unofficial motto given to the Indian Health Service on many Indian reservations, has, tragically, become[[Page S4042]]the epitaph of too many Tribal members whose cancers have grown undetected, whose diabetes have gone untreated, and whose high-risk pregnancies have gone unnoticed. In seeing this catastrophic need for healthcare dollars, Congress enacted a series of laws that supplement IHS's resources. The Affordable Care Act is the most recent and now is the most significant.  Nearly 287,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives from 492 Tribes--almost 90 percent--have benefited from the ACA's Medicaid expansion. Another 30,000 individual Native Americans have private insurance, thanks to the ACA's individual marketplace and the Native cost-sharing subsidies. In my home State of New Mexico alone, Medicaid expansion has insured an additional 45,600 Native Thanks to the Medicaid expansion and increased access to the individual insurance market, 63 percent of IHS patients have healthcare coverage that allows them to receive care above and beyond the level of life and limb. Because of the ACA, the IHS now receives almost $1 billion to supplement its healthcare delivery, and that is an increase of 21 percent.  We can see the results. Not only are people healthier, but they are more productive. Health insurance has allowed Native Americans to finish school, return to work, and lead productive lives instead of worrying that their next illnesses could lead to an IHS referral denial or ruin them financially.  It has also improved the economy in Indian The ACA has created new healthcare jobs, and it has led to the construction of new medical facilities. It has meant dialysis clinics on New Mexico pueblos, new hospitals for the Choctaw in Mississippi, and thousands of jobs for Montana's Blackfeet Indian These are just a few examples of a nationwide trend.  TrumpCare will undo this progress. It will undo the newly expanded access to care. It will shut down those new healthcare facilities. It will freeze the economic progress of those areas. These are not just numbers and statistics. We are talking about people's lives. Individuals will be harmed by TrumpCare and the evisceration of  Let me tell you about Rachel, Justin, and their two children--Adalie and They are one Native family whose lives have been changed for the better under the Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion. Rachel and Justin are from the Laguna Pueblo in New  Here is a photo of them right after Jude was born in August 2015.  Before the ACA and Medicaid expansion, Rachel received hit-or-miss care from the IHS, but when she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, she was able to qualify for Medicaid because of the expansion. This meant that when Rachel and Justin decided to start a family, Rachel had access to preventive services, including prenatal and maternity care. Rachel was able to get the care she needed when she became pregnant with Rachel's prenatal care became even more important when they decided to add to their family when Rachel was in graduate school at That pregnancy with Jude had serious complications. The doctors figured out that Rachel did not have enough amniotic fluid to support Jude, and she had to have a C-section.  Medicaid expansion allowed Rachel to complete her college education and to get a master's in public administration without her worrying about healthcare for her and her children. Medicaid expansion meant that Rachel was able to get the preventive care she needed to make sure that she and Jude were healthy.  Rachel recently got a job offer to work in her chosen field, but now that she is able to get off Medicaid, she is worried that the Republican healthcare proposals will make insurance coverage ineffective or unaffordable. Even though she lives near her Tribe's IHS facility in the Albuquerque area, she knows that she cannot depend on the IHS to guarantee critical care if insurance premiums become unaffordable. Once again, Rachel is worried about the future of her family's healthcare.  Rachel is one of thousands of Native Americans whose lives have been dramatically helped by the Affordable Care Act and who are scared that TrumpCare will leave them unable to get the healthcare that their families need in the future.  If this bill becomes law, Tribal communities will be forced back to a system of healthcare rationing. If the President and the Republican leadership eviscerate the Medicaid Program and Federal supports for public health programs, Native American lives will be lost. There is no doubt about it. Let me say this plain and simple: TrumpCare would devastate Indian Country, and it must be stopped.  Just this morning, as vice chair of the Indian Affairs Committee, I held a roundtable with Tribal leaders and Native health experts to hear more about how the Republicans' healthcare proposals would impact I thank the leaders who came in to talk with me and my colleagues on the committee. Senator Franken, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Tester, and Senator Cantwell were there.  All came to hear these Native leaders, and their insight into the damage this bill could do to Native communities was profound. The Turtle Mountain chairman from North Dakota reported that ``don't get sick after June'' is no longer true on his reservation because of the ACA and Medicaid expansion. Panelists warned that the rollback of Medicaid would be devastating to Tribal members, and a representative from the San Felipe Pueblo reminded us that Indian health is not an entitlement; it is an obligation.  Now the Republican leader and the President are moving in an even more dangerous direction. They are pushing to repeal the ACA without having any replacement, which would strip healthcare from over 30 million It would devastate anyone who is sick today, anyone who relies on insurance one gets through the Medicaid expansion or the Affordable Care Act, and it sets up a disaster for anyone who might get sick after its repeal because it would destabilize insurance markets and would throw our economy into turmoil, killing up to 50,000 jobs in New Mexico alone. As often happens with policies that hurt the most vulnerable, Indian Country would be hit the hardest.  Traditionally, the Senate has worked on a bipartisan basis to address Native American issues. That tradition must continue now. We must work together to find a sustainable solution so that Native Americans can get affordable, quality healthcare when they need it.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from the National Congress of American Indians, National Indian Health Board, National Council on Urban Indian Health, and the Self-Governance Communication and Education Tribal Consortium sent to Republican leadership on June 27, 2017, and shared with the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs be printed in the This is just one example of the many such letters sent to the Senate over the last few months, and I will submit those additional letters as part of the record at our next Indian Affairs Committee  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    June 27, 2017.     Re Tribal priorities in Senate healthcare reform legislation.     Mitch McConnell,     The Capitol,     Washington,       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the National Indian      Health Board (NIHB), the National Congress of American      Indians (NCAI), National Council on Urban Indian Health      (NCUIH), Self-Governance Communication and Education (SGCE),      and the Tribal Nations of the United States we serve, we      write to convey and explain our strong and united opposition      to the Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 (BCRA)      in its current form.       While the legislation mirrors several provisions of the      House bill that are of critical importance to Indian Country,      we have grave concerns about other aspects of the BCRA that      make it impossible for us to support the legislation in its      current form. Specifically, we cannot support legislation      that would gut the Medicaid program or eliminate cost-sharing      protections for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs).      Most importantly, we request that the legislation:       1) Maintain Medicaid funding based on need, rather than      capping it according to a complicated per capita allocation      formula or through capped block grants.       2) Continue Medicaid Expansion, and at the very least,      continue Medicaid Expansion for AI/ANs       3) Protect AVANs from barriers to care that are      inconsistent with the federal trust responsibility, such as      work requirements under Medicaid[[Page S4043]]       4) Retain cost-sharing protections at Section 1402 of the      Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA); and       5) Maintain funding for preventative services, including      the Prevention and Public Health Fund and women's health      services.       As you know, the federal government has a trust      responsibility, agreed to long ago and reaffirmed many times      by all three branches of government, to provide healthcare to      Tribes and their members. Both Medicaid and IHS funding are      part of the fulfillment of the trust responsibility.       However, the federal government has not done its part to      live up to the responsibility to provide adequate health      services to AI/IHS funding is discretionary and is      appropriated every year and distributed to IHS and Tribal      facilities across the country. But IHS appropriations have      been about 50% of need for decades, and Medicaid revenue is      essential to help fill the gap. When demand for services is      higher than the funds available, services must be prioritized      and rationed. As a result of this chronic underfunding,      historical trauma, and a federal-state centric public health      system, AI/ANs suffer from a wide array of health conditions      at levels shockingly higher than other Nationally,      AI/ANs live 4.5 years less than other Americans, but in some      states life expectancy is 20 years less. This is not      surprising given that in 2016, the IHS per capita      expenditures for patient health services were just $2,834,      compared to $9,990 per person for health care spending      nationally. The Senate should pass reform legislation only if      it does not reduce access to care for AI/ANs, or further      strain the already stretched resources of Indian Health      Service, Tribally-operated, and urban Indian health programs      (collectively called the ``I/T/U'').                                Medicaid       Cuts to the Medicaid program outlined in the BCRA are      especially troubling. Under a block grant per-capita system,      States will experience a dramatic reduction in federal      funding for their Medicaid programs. Most will have to either      reduce eligibility for the program or reduce or eliminate      benefits that are essential to many AI/Medicaid is a      crucial program for the federal government in honoring its      trust responsibility to provide healthcare to AI/Because      health care services are guaranteed for AI/ANs, cuts in      Medicaid only shift cost over to the IHS, which is already      drastically underfunded. Put simply, without supplemental      Medicaid resources, the Indian health system will not      survive.       AI/ANs are a uniquely vulnerable population and uniquely      situated in the Medicaid program. Unlike other Medicaid      enrollees, because of the federal trust responsibility, AI/     ANs have access to limited IHS services to fall back on at no      cost to them. As a result, Medicaid enrollment and      utilization incentives are completely different for AI/ANs in      Medicaid conditions of eligibility designed to      ensure that beneficiaries have ``personal investment'' do not      work when mandatory in Indian country. Instead of      participating in these programs, many AI/ANs will simply      choose not to enroll in Medicaid and fall back on the      underfunded IHS instead. This will deprive Tribal and urban      programs of vital Medicaid revenue and strain limited IHS      resources to the breaking point.       Medicaid is a crucial program for the federal government to      fulfill the trust responsibility. Over 40 years ago, Congress      permanently authorized the IHS and Tribal facilities to bill      Medicaid for services provided to Medicaid-eligible AI/ANs to      supplement inadequate IHS funding and as part of the federal      trust responsibility. At the same time, because Congress      recognized that ``. . . it would be unfair and inequitable to      burden a State Medicaid program with costs which normally      would have been borne by the Indian Health Service,'' it      ensured that States would not have to bear any such costs, by      providing that States would be reimbursed at 100 percent      Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for services      received through IHS and Tribal facilities.       The Senate Finance Committee, which has primary legislative      responsibility for the Medicare and Medicaid programs,      adopted a similar reimbursement provision as a part of H.     3153, the Social Security Amendments of 1973. In its report      on the legislation, the Finance Committee justified the 100      percent FMAP by noting:       `` . . . that with respect to matters relating to Indians,      the Federal Government has traditionally assumed major      responsibility. The Committee wishes to assure that a State's      election to participate in the Medicaid program will not      result in a lessening of Federal support of health care      services for this population group, or that the effect of      Medicaid coverage be to shift to States a financial burden      previously borne by the Federal Government.''       In light of this legislative history, Tribes are pleased to      see the 100 percent FMAP preserved in the As the Senate      considers this proposed legislation, please ensure that this      remains in place. In addition, because the federal trust      responsibility also follows AI/ANs off of reservations, 100      percent FMAP should also be extended to services provided      through urban Indian health programs (UHIPs).       With regard to Medicaid, we respectfully request that the      Senate:       1) Continue to Fund Medicaid Based on Need without Caps       Medicaid is an important tool through which the federal      government uses to fulfill its trust responsibility to      provide for Indian health care.       The cuts proposed by Sections 133 and 134 of the BCRA would      be devastating to Tribal and urban health programs. BCRA      would make cuts to Medicaid that are even higher than those      proposed by the House of BCRA's caps are      tied to a lower inflation factor beginning in 2025 that would      result in even higher cuts to State Medicaid plans.       We were encouraged to see that BCRA contains provisions      that would prevent the cost of care provided to AI/ANs from      counting against either a per capita cap or a block grant.      However, we request that urban Indian health programs be      included in the exemption as well. Faced with the cuts      proposed in Sections 133 and 134 of the bill, most States      will be forced to make cuts to eligibility and/or services in      future years. This will affect all providers and recipients,      including Tribal/urban providers and AI/AN patients. This      will lead to significant cuts in Medicaid revenues for I/T/     Us, and will threaten our ability to provide healthcare      services to our people. The Indian healthcare delivery system      will not succeed if faced with the cuts proposed in       To the extent that the Senate bill maintains such dramatic      caps, it should work with Tribes to develop a mechanism to      exempt reimbursements for services received through IHS/     Tribal/Urban facilities from any State-imposed limitations on      eligibility or services that may result from these caps. Such      reimbursements would be covered by 100 percent FMAP and      therefore will not affect State budgets.       We also request language be added to the bill that requires      States with one or more Indian Tribes or Tribal health      providers to engage in Tribal consultation on a regular and      ongoing basis, and prior to the submission of any Medicaid or      CHIP State Plan Amendment, waiver applications, demonstration      projects or extensions that may impact them as Medicaid      providers or their Tribal members as Medicaid recipients.       2) Preserve Medicaid Expansion       Medicaid Expansion has increased access to care and      provided critical third-party revenues to the Indian health      system. The uninsured rate for Native Americans has fallen      nationally from 24.2% to 15.7% since the enactment of the      Affordable Care Act, due in large part to Medicaid      This has resulted in health care services to AI/AN people who      might not have normally received care. It has also resulted      in saved revenues to the Medicaid program through preventing      more complex and chronic health conditions and saved the      Medicaid program money. Medicaid Expansion has increased      Medicaid revenues at IHS/Tribal/Urban health programs that      are being reinvested back into both the Indian and the larger      national health care system.       The BCRA would roll back federal funding Medicaid Expansion      by 2024. The Senate should preserve Medicaid Expansion as an      option for States on a permanent basis. While BCRA contains      important provisions designed to equalize funding between      Expansion and non-Expansion States, we are concerned that the      funding made available to non-Expansion States is      insufficient to match that which has been provided to      Expansion At the very least, Expansion should be      retained for the AI/AN population under a special Medicaid      optional eligibility category for State Plans in recognition      of the federal trust responsibility.       3) Exempt AI/ANs from Work Requirements       The BCRA would allow the States to impose mandatory work      requirements as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, and      incentivize States that impose such requirements with a 5      percent increase in FMAP to reimburse them for the      administrative costs of implementing such a requirement.       As noted above, mandatory work requirements will not work      in Indian country because the incentive structures are      completely different. Unlike other Medicaid beneficiaries,      AI/ANs have access to IHS services. If work requirements are      imposed as a condition of eligibility, many AI/ANs will elect      not to enroll in As a result, rather than      encouraging job seeking or saving program costs, mandatory      work requirements will discourage AI/ANs from enrolling in      Medicaid and place pressure on the already underfunded      Further, cash jobs are scarce or non-existent in much of      Indian country, making work requirements impossible to meet      and job training programs an exercise in futility.       Tribes fully support work programs and employment, but we      believe such programs should be voluntary so as not to      provide a barrier to access Medicaid for our members. Again,      this is consistent with over 40 years of Medicaid policy for      Indian To the extent it considers imposing work      requirements, the Senate should exempt AI/ANs from any work      requirements.                              Marketplace       We also ask that the Senate amend the BCRA to maintain cost      sharing protections for AI/These protections were      included for AI/ANs in fulfillment of Congress and the United      States federal trust responsibility to provide health care to      Section 208 of the BCRA would repeal the cost-     sharing subsidy program established by Section 1402 of the      However Section 1402(d) of the ACA also includes      important and critical cost sharing protections for AI/ANs      who have incomes at or below 300 percent of the federal[[Page S4044]]     poverty level, or who are referred for care through the IHS      Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) program. These cost-sharing      protections incentivize AI/ANs to sign up for health      insurance and also make it affordable. Eliminating them would      create a disincentive for AI/AN to sign up for insurance,      since they already have access to IHS services. This would      result in less third party reimbursements for the Indian      health system and have a destabilizing effect on the system's      ability to provide health care to AI/AN people. Dollar-for-     dollar, leveraging cost sharing protections for AI/ANs and      thereby encouraging insurance coverage is a very efficient      means of moving the needle forward in meeting the federal      trust responsibility for health care resources.                          Prevention Services       We are also deeply concerned by the proposed reduction of      prevention services in the legislation. The elimination of      the Prevention and Public Health Fund will cripple Tribes'      efforts to support public health initiatives. Many Tribal      health programs rely on PPHF directed funding to keep their      public health systems operational. Unlike states, Tribes must      piece together a patchwork of funds, some of which are      derived from the PPHF, to administer basic prevention      services. Additionally, the reduction in funding for women's      health services around the country will have major impacts on      Tribal members, especially those who do not have direct      access to services on or near their reservation. The Senate      should restore cuts to the preventative services in the      legislation.       Tribes support the inclusion of state funding to address      the opioid crisis. However, states do not often pass these      funds to Drug-related deaths among AI/ANs is almost      twice that of the general population. To address this      problem, Tribes should either receive direct federal funding      to address the opioid crisis, or states should be required to      engage in state-Tribal consultation on the use of funds      appropriated for the states.       In conclusion, the undersigned organizations must oppose      the BCRA in its current form. We could support the      legislation only if needs-based finding for Medicaid is      preserved, Medicaid Expansion is continued, and the other      changes outlined above are made to the bill before passage.      In fulfillment of the trust responsibility, current      exemptions for AI/ANs from health insurance premiums, co-     pays, and cost sharing must be preserved, and Medicaid-     eligible AI/ANs must be allowed access to the program without      further requirements attached to ensure additional burden is      not placed on very limited IHS appropriations. Tribes across      the country are eager to come to the table to discuss how      shortcomings in the current healthcare system can be      addressed, without wreaking immeasurable harm on our health      programs and the people we serve.

6882,topic-id,389,"Mr.President, I know Senator Durbin is on the floor so I am going to wrap up very quickly. I first want to thank Senator Franken, who came down here and advocated for his State and for Native Americans across the country. I thank Senator Heitkamp for her passionate speech about Native Americans and Native children. I have known her almost 30 years, as the State attorney general, when she was doing the same things, and she has made real progress.  You can see from this roundtable today--and I really appreciate Senator Heitkamp coming and helping me chair that. I had to slip out to Foreign Relations, but she spent a significant amount of time chairing that roundtable. I think it really made a difference to all of the Tribal leaders there.  I want to finish with what one of those Tribal leaders said to us.  Senator Heitkamp, you said something very similar.  This Tribal leader reminded us, he said: Decades ago, Tribes made a downpayment on the healthcare they receive. We are not asking for a handout. We made a downpayment.  What was he talking about?  We made a downpayment with our land, with our water, and with large areas of what were then either territories or the United States--that they considered their homelands. How sad it is to see that we are not fulfilling the promises of these sacred treaties they entered into.  With that, I would conclude--as Senator Franken did and I believe it was the same thrust of what Senator Heitkamp was saying--with this. We have hit a wall on healthcare. We have come up to the point where you don't know where to go. The best thing to do when you hit a wall is to get back to the regular order, work on a bipartisan basis, go into committee, let people put proposals forward, have amendments, open up the process.  That is where we need to go at this point. I would urge the Republican leadership to take a look at the regular order. That may help us find our way out to improve the healthcare situation for not only Native Americans but all Americans, which is what we face with this TrumpCare, which is taking us in the wrong direction.

6742,topic-id,356,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this is an important bill. It really is. This bill, H.3050, is a bipartisan bill introduced by myself and by my good friend and colleague across the aisle, Mr.It is bipartisan.  This bill reauthorizes the State Energy Program and it strengthens our[[Page H5939]]energy emergency planning and preparedness efforts in a big-time way. This bill builds upon the Energy and Commerce Committee's impressive record of hearings and legislation focused on energy security, emergency preparedness, job creation, and infrastructure protection and resilience.  Across the country, States have to respond to a variety of hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fuel supply disruptions, physical and, yes, cyber threats, too. This legislation provides States with tools in the toolbox so that they have flexibility that they need to address local energy challenges.  It ensures that State energy security planning efforts address fuel supply issues, assess State energy profiles, address potential hazards to each energy sector. It mitigates risk to enhance reliability and incorporate regional planning efforts.  Let's face it, the consumer at home, businesses trying to put out a product, they want to make sure that the electricity is on. They don't care what the excuse is. They want it on.  This bill makes significant strides to protect our Nation's fuel and electric infrastructure from physical and cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. It makes sure that we are thinking ahead not just about the actual threat, but, in fact, how our energy and electric systems might be vulnerable in a broader sense.  The bill also encourages mutual assistance, an essential part of responding and restoring in the event of an energy emergency. Teamwork: prioritizing and elevating energy security planning and emergency preparedness is, yes, an important step in the face of increased threats, vulnerabilities, and interdependencies of energy infrastructure and end-use systems.  This bill is important and is going to get to the President's desk in a bipartisan way. Again, I thank my good friend and colleague for his help in getting this bill through our committee and here to the House floor.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

6779,topic-id,790,"Mr.President, I urge my friend, the Senator from Delaware, to get to the train station.  First of all, I wish to thank Senator Heitkamp for bringing this group together. There has been a lot of talk about what ideas can fix the Affordable Care Act, and here we are hearing some of the ideas that we will offer.  Senator Kaine has had to hear this story before, but before I was in politics, I had a pretty long career in venture capital and invested in a lot of businesses. Some of those businesses managed to eke out a living, but the thing that was remarkable about the companies is that the companies that were the most successful weren't the ones that had the perfect business plan. They weren't the ones that had the newest ideas. The companies that were the most successful were the ones that were able to adapt and change. I never, ever invested in a business that ever met its business plan. Every one had to change in some way--alter.  The truth of the matter is, as to the Affordable Care Act, for all its good things, there were things we got wrong. I will be the first to acknowledge that. There have been a lot of us in this body who over the last couple of years--again, I thank the Senator from North Dakota, who has been a part of these efforts--have said that maybe we need to do a little less bureaucracy in the ACA in terms of reporting requirements. Maybe we ought to have a cheaper option. We have gold and silver and bronze. I remember working with the former Senator from Alaska on this. Maybe we ought to have a copper plan, as well, to try to get those young people invested in buying that first plan.  We said that maybe we ought to take an idea that came from the other side of the aisle, and, as long as we have appropriate consumer protections, go ahead and let insurance products get sold across State lines so there is more[[Page S3825]]competition. Then, we saw more problems arise. Unfortunately, problems arose with the ACA, as we have seen this administration and others try to knock out some of the building blocks that built up the ACA--risk corridors, cost sharing, or more recently the administration saying that we may just ignore part of the bill that says there is an individual mandate. Consequently, that means the insurance company had to charge a heck of a lot more money because they weren't sure whether the law was going to be in force.  We have had people like the Senator from New Hampshire say: Well, I had an idea on cost sharing that might fix it. My dear friends, the other Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Delaware said: Let's go out and do that reinsurance plan, so that if there are extraordinarily high-cost plans, maybe that will be a secondary backdrop so premiums will not have to be so high. I am proud to support and be a cosponsor on both of those pieces of legislation.  Then, as only the Senator from Missouri can do, she came up with the most obvious of, at least, a short-term solution that says: My gosh, if for some reason, because there have been efforts to sabotage the ACA, we don't have enough offerings for at least some stopgap period, we ought to allow all the folks in our States, if they don't have any coverage, to at least get the same kind of coverage we get. That is kind of Harry Truman basic common sense--Missouri common sense.  So I hope our colleagues, after they get out of one more secret meeting in one more basement or secret location, will come back and start talking about these solutions--solutions that don't start with the premise that we are going to give folks like me a tax cut or that we are going to take a meat ax to Medicaid or that we are going to come up with a proposal that will take 22 million Americans off of health insurance.  The ACA didn't get it entirely right. There is a lot of room for improvement. We have asked our friends on the other side to meet us halfway and to try to bring the kind of bipartisan spirit we all talk about on this issue that affects each and every American and one-sixth of our economy. We can do it. We can do it right, but it is going to take the kind of cooperation and the kinds of good ideas that are being offered by my colleagues on the floor.  I yield the floor.

6682,topic-id,275,"Mr.President, I do not think we should vote on a bill that would touch every single human being in this country when one party is locked out of the debate--not able to read the bill and not able to discuss it and help make suggestions and changes. I think that families all across this country should be able to see this bill and be able to evaluate the impact on themselves and on their families.

6699,topic-id,2688,"Mr.President, I get letters and emails every day from families begging me not to let Republicans in Congress tear up healthcare in this country. People aren't writing because they find themselves with a lot of extra time on their hands. They are not writing because they are professional activists or political organizers. They are not writing because they like writing letters and emails. They are writing because they are scared. They set aside all the other things they need to do in their day--the sink full of dishes, the load of laundry, the overflowing inbox--and they steal some time to write these letters.  They write these letters because they are terrified--terrified down to their bones that if they don't speak out, their family is going to lose their healthcare coverage, their children will be shut out from care, their elderly parents will lose the assistance they need to pay for nursing home care, their own insurance costs will be going up, and their financial security could be hanging by a thread.  A lot of people write letters and send emails, and a lot of people make calls too. Every week since the Republicans started their cruel effort to take away healthcare from tens of millions of people in this country, my office has been getting phone calls from worried constituents.  Last week, something changed. We went from our regular quota of calls about this terrible Republican healthcare bill to an avalanche of voice mails and phones ringing off the hook.  Since last week, I have gotten more than a thousand phone calls from people who are pleading with me to do whatever I can to stop Republicans who are going forward with their brutal plans. People are literally in tears on the phone. They are scared, and they are angry. They are calling because they know that 13 Senate Republicans--13 men--are locked away in a secret room, behind closed doors, writing a secret plan to trade their health insurance for tax cuts that will go to the wealthiest Americans in this country.  The bill the Republicans are negotiating behind closed doors isn't a healthcare bill. It is a tax cut for billionaires bill, and it is paid for by cutting healthcare for tens of millions of other  The Republican healthcare bill has $663 billion in tax cuts in it--$663 billion in tax cuts for the richest people in this country and for wealthy corporations, tax cuts that would blow a giant hole in the American budget.  The Republicans didn't let that slow them down. They kept their eye on the prize. For the Republicans, the most important thing about this healthcare bill is the tax cuts for the rich. They decided to cut Medicaid by $834 billion in the same bill so they can pay for their tax cuts.  This is a straight-up trade. The Senate Republicans say that Americans should cut health insurance for little babies or for seniors in nursing homes or for people getting treatment for opioid addiction--all so that millionaires and billionaires can get their tax cuts.  That is not a healthcare bill. That is a statement of values. And it says that tax cuts for a handful of millionaires and billionaires are more important than healthcare for millions of hard-working Americans and their families. There is only one word for what the Senate Republicans are doing with this bill--``shameful.'' It is shameful.  The Republicans negotiate in secret, behind closed doors. They refuse to let anyone see the bill. They will not tell anyone what is in it.  Senator McCaskill asked Chairman Hatch on the Finance Committee if he would hold a hearing on the bill, and he said no. Senator Murray asked Chairman Alexander on the HELP Committee if he would hold a hearing on the bill, and he said no, no plans to do so--no, no hearings, no reviews, no public look at what the Republicans are up to.  What is going on here? I will tell you what is going on. Senate Republicans don't dare let the people back home see this bill. They don't dare let voters see this bill. Instead, they have decided to try to ram this bill through with no hearings, no public discussion, and get it signed into law.  They hope, once that is done, people will not see much point in learning about the details and holding Republicans accountable. They hope that if they can do a quick vote, everyone else will just give up.  I have news for Senate That is not going to happen. Senate Republicans may not want to hear from families who are worried about losing their insurance coverage in the middle of a battle with breast cancer. They may not have time for stories about premature babies who need Medicaid so they can get lifesaving care. And maybe they don't want to hear about the grandparents with Alzheimer's who could get kicked out of nursing homes.  Senate Republicans may not want to hear from these people, but I have a message for these Senate We don't care how long we have to stand up here. We don't care how many times you try to dodge the question about what is in your secret healthcare bill. Democrats are here to keep demanding that you show us this bill, and we are going to keep insisting that you account for its shameful contents.  I know you would prefer to take the phone off the hook so you don't have to hear it ring, and I know you would like to pretend that there aren't families in your State who would be hurt by this bill, but I am going to take some time to read you a handful of the letters I have been receiving about exactly what is at stake in this debate about healthcare. These families deserve to be heard.[[Page S3592]]  A few months ago I received a letter from Jenny in Worthington, She wrote to me about how she and her husband got good healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act and how Medicaid was there when they needed it most, when Jenny was diagnosed with breast cancer.

I don't know if President Trump ever read that letter, but I am going to read it right now into the Congressional       Dear President Trump,       My name is Liam Barry, and I am ten years old.

Kristine from Cambridge also wrote to me about her fight against cancer. She wrote:       I ask that you and fellow Senators PLEASE fight for the      Affordable Care I am a cancer survivor. When I was 28      years old, I got the news no one ever wants to hear, ``You      have cancer.'' Luckily, for me, I had a job that had      wonderful insurance, and I was able to get medication,      surgeries, and treatment to win the fight--and to not go      broke doing so.       However, I know many young people and old people and      children who would not be here today if it was not for I      know people who are still fighting their battles with cancer.      They are frightened and losing hope, not because of cancer,      but because they don't know whether they will be able to      continue to get the treatments necessary to stay in the      fight.       I am now 30 years old, and have my whole life in front of      me. Because of what [President] Trump is proposing, I am now      afraid that if I lose my job or if I wish to change jobs, I      might not be able to get the necessary coverage, because I no      longer qualify.       I really didn't think this is what I would be worried about      two years ago after having been through 8 rounds of chemo, 20      rounds of radiation and surgery to clear me of this disease.

Thank you for speaking out about your own fight against cancer and for others who are currently battling cancer and worried about the future of their healthcare.  I also heard from Sarah, who lives in Shrewsbury, MA, and who wrote to me about her concerns that the Republican healthcare bill would endanger coverage of birth control and access to services at Planned Sarah wrote to me this past weekend, while I was out dancing in the Boston Pride parade.       As I type this you are at Boston Pride, which I would have      loved to be at to support my friends, but, due to my      endometriosis pain, here I sit.       I am extremely concerned about the GOP plan to reduce or      strip away insurance coverage for birth control. As a 21-     year-old woman suffering from endometriosis, a very common      disease among young women, I know firsthand that birth      control does more than just prevent pregnancy--in fact, for      many, it is the only treatment for them.       In 10 days I will be undergoing endometriosis surgery, and      for the past 6 months since I've been diagnosed until the      surgery, birth control was the only thing enabling me to      stand up straight most days. Even while taking oral      contraceptives, there were many days I was unable to get out      of bed (today being one).       I am so lucky to have access to an amazing endo specialist      at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and to have access to the      medication and surgery that I need. But every time I groan      about having to go to an appointment, I think about how many      women are suffering from the same debilitating pain, but      without the resources to overcome it. Many women rely on      Planned Parenthood not just for abortions, but to provide      them with the medicine that will enable them to stand up      straight in spite of the pain they deal with every day.      Endometriosis doesn't discriminate, and it cannot be cured,      only treated. Until endometriosis becomes a prominent focus      of medical research, which I feel it should be, we must      protect the right to be treated for it, which means      protecting insurance coverage of birth control, and      protecting Planned       I know that you are a warrior for women's rights, and you      are the patron saint of Planned I know these are      issues you fight for, and I cannot even begin to thank you      enough for all you have done thus far.

I actually grew up in a low-income family myself. My      parents immigrated to the U.My mother is brilliant but      only had a 7th grade education because my grandfather      couldn't afford to send her to school. My father is college-     educated, but struggled frequently with unemployment. My      older brother has multiple disabilities. He's blind and      brain-damaged from a stroke during childhood, epileptic,      intellectually disabled, and has a transplanted kidney. I am      fortunate enough to have been healthy my entire life.       For most of my life, my family was on Medicaid, as well as      other forms of public assistance. . . . My brother,      additionally, due to his kidney disease, got Medicare as      well, but Medicaid was always his secondary insurance. He      sees multiple different specialists and has done very well      over these years.       In spite of us having multiple financial struggles, we      never had to worry about his healthcare being paid for. His      transplant from childhood lasted 19 years, and then about 10      years ago he was transplanted again and has done well with      that.       My parents still live in the same house I grew up in, in      Right now, they're cared for by Medicare and      My brother lives with them, receives SSI, and his      health needs are met by Medicare and Although none      of his chronic medical conditions can be cured, they are all      well taken care of.       In the meantime, I grew up healthy, was able to attend      Georgetown through need-based financial aid, was able to get      into medical school at the University of Maryland and pay for      it using Federal student loans (which I'm repaying through      the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program), got into a      dual-specialty residency of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics      at Penn State, and am now working at Harvard and       My family's story goes to show that Medicaid is about      helping families that struggle, about helping children with      complex medical needs, and about how providing for the good      health of a family can achieve positive outcomes for the      long-term future.  Today, Sampat works at Harvard at He makes sure his patients on Medicaid get excellent care. He told me about one of his patients who came in to urgent care in This little girl wasn't even 2 years old yet and was wheezing and had a fever. Here is what the doctor said:       This child and her mother were on Medicaid through      [As] I asked questions, I found out more about      this mother. She was working two to three jobs in order to      make ends meet. Her daughter was in daycare during the day      and then [the] grandmother took care of [the little girl]      most evenings. This mom took care of her daughter on the rare      days she had off and clearly loved and cared for her      daughter.       This young girl's wheezing was probably some of the      earliest signs of what will become asthma. [Her] mom has      asthma, too, and it runs in their family. Asthma is a      completely controllable illness with medication, but it      requires monitoring by a doctor and access to medication.      Because the child has Medicaid, I feel much more confident      that, in spite of how much the mother is struggling      financially, the child has a good shot at growing up healthy.      Without Medicaid, this child could live a life in poor health      from a treatable condition.  These are some of the people the Senate Republicans want to kick to the curb so they can deliver a big tax cut for millionaires and billionaires--a 10-year-old kid with a sick mom, a cancer survivor, a woman with endometriosis, a boy kept healthy by Medicaid so he could grow up to become a doctor at one of the best hospitals in this country and help a little girl with asthma.  Senate Republicans are willing to tear away health insurance from these families to deliver tax cuts for their buddies, but we are not going to let that happen. We can't let that happen.

This bill is a commonsense piece of legislation that will reduce the risk of wildfires and improve the safety and reliability of our electrical grid.  How will this bill accomplish these objectives?  It is really quite simple. When we remove overgrown vegetation near our electric grid on Federal lands, we remove the fuel component of wildfires. By reducing the risk of wildfire, we reduce the risk of an interruption of our electrical grid.  Mr.Chairman, this is so much just plain common sense that it baffles me that we are having to debate it on the floor of the House of Representatives, but I think it is an example of how misguided some of our land management agencies have become, and the need for broader reforms.  This bill would streamline the Federal review process for removal of trees and vegetation that pose a risk to our power grid and promotes consistency among Federal agencies tasked with the decisions on removal.

That is a conversation that is important for doctors to have with those patients.  In the environment of the time, that became the death panel phony story. So I was there. I saw it happen. Thanks to Senator Franken's delay in getting here, Jack Reed and I were in the room.  Why does this matter? This matters because, like the story of Leanna and Henry, there are people on the other side of what is--apparently, for our Republican colleagues--a purely political piece of parliamentary chicanery.  I have a constituent, a woman named Pamela, who lives in Jamestown, She works with people and nonprofit organizations that advocate for people who have very rare diseases so, in her work, she has seen the before and after of the Affordable Care  ``Before the Affordable Care Act,'' she wrote to me, ``I saw many patients and families distraught by medical bankruptcy.''  Then it came even closer to home for Pamela when she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. If there were an annual or a lifetime limit on health benefits, she would be in deep trouble. If the protection for people with preexisting conditions were undone, that would imperil her ability to get insurance in the future.  She wrote to me:       As a patient myself, with a chronic, costly medical      condition, I am very worried that [these] protections will be      taken away, making my life-sustaining care unaffordable.  Pamela deserves to be heard, but nobody can speak up for her with a bill that nobody can see.  From Cumberland, Marilyn wrote to me. Marilyn is a family physician. She knows the healthcare system. She also has severe asthma. She has had asthma since she was a little child, and she manages her severe asthma with very expensive medication. Her husband is retired, and Marilyn purchased her health insurance through HealthSource RI--our ObamaCare health insurance marketplace--which, by the way, is working very well. There is no need to undo what is going on in Rhode It gives her peace of mind, and she wrote to me to say she was terrified by the possibility that the preexisting condition clause will be allowed back in.  She wrote:       I am not a specialist but a family medicine physician,      doing the best I can to pay my student loans and daily      expenses. I could not afford the lifesaving treatment I      require to function. . . . I do not know how I would survive      financially if the current legislation the House has approved      is allowed to become law.  Gina wrote to me from Lincoln, Gina's daughter, Sofia, is 6. Sofia has cerebral palsy. We think we have problems here. I tell you, whatever the political problems we have over the Affordable Care Act, have a 6-year-old with cerebral palsy, and then come back and tell me you have a problem not liking  Sofia needs round-the-clock care and she gets it because of Gina wrote to me: ``From her home nursing care to her wheelchair, we could not live without [Medicaid].''  Before Sofia came along, Gina and her husband never imagined they would need Medicaid; it never crossed their minds. But now, the welfare of their little daughter is entirely dependent on Depending on what we do here, Gina wrote:       Will there even be a Medicaid then? This administration is      stripping benefits from the most vulnerable in our society.      How will they survive?  The last story I will share is from Tony and his family, who live in North Kingstown, Tony has a son whose name is Michael, right after he was born, was diagnosed with something called mitochondrial disorder. It is a severely, catastrophically debilitating illness. It left Michael severely disabled. Michael is 10 years old now, but developmentally he is more like a 3-month-old. He can't walk, he can't talk, he can't feed himself, but he is happy, and he is sweet, and he is a source of joy for his parents and his four siblings.  Through Medicaid, Michael can receive up to 30 hours per week of care from a certified nursing assistant. It is[[Page S3598]]this program--it is Medicaid--supporting the certified nursing assistant those 30 hours per week that lets Michael live at home with his parents and those four siblings. Otherwise, he would have to be institutionalized. Somebody explain to me why a political victory shoved through this body after secret proceedings is worth explaining to Michael's parents that he is at risk of losing that coverage.  When President Trump said that the House bill was mean, he was not kidding around. It is mean, mean, mean--dirty, rotten mean. And if you think the one on the Senate side is going to be any better, there is one little phrase I would like to bring to your attention: ``We're not stupid.''  ``We're not stupid'' is what a Republican staffer said when he was asked, Why aren't you guys having a public process? Why are you trying to jam this through in secret? His answer: ``We're not stupid.''  Well, what can you logically deduce from that? What kind of bill would be stupid to show the American public? If this was a bill that was going to be greeted with great applause and joy and relief and satisfaction by the American public, would you hide it? If it were terrible, if it would threaten people all across this country, then you wouldn't want them to see it. That would be stupid.  So that is what they are up to. They know perfectly well that this bill is not good for That is why showing it to the American people would be, by their own words, stupid.  Let me switch to my geek point before I go, because this is something I talk about a lot, and it bothers the heck out of me. This is a graph that shows healthcare in most of the countries that compete with us--the OECD nations.  This chart shows life expectancy in years. At the bottom is 72, at the top is 86, so where you fall in this shows where your life expectancy is in the different countries, and life expectancy is a pretty good measure of how good the healthcare system is.  Here is the cost of healthcare per capita, averaged across the population. And as you will notice, most everybody is right up in here--Japan, Switzerland, Netherlands, United Most of our competitors, including France and Germany--they are up in here. Where are we? Out here. The most expensive other country in the world is Switzerland, which doesn't break $6,000 per person; we are over $8,000. The average in here, where Japan comes in, above where the United Kingdom comes in, is $4,000 per person; we are above $8,000. We are 100 percent more expensive than the average and more than 50 percent more expensive than the least efficient other country in the world.  So there is progress to be made at bringing costs down, if we would pay attention to this real problem instead of the imaginary problem of Americans having too much healthcare.  And over here--look at the life expectancy in years. Look where we come in. We match the Czech So there is progress to be made on cost and on outcomes in this country. And, believe it or not, we are actually starting to make a little progress. Let me take my colleagues through this graph, and then I will leave you be.  This top line was drawn by the Congressional Budget Office back in 2010. They project forward into the future where they think healthcare costs are going to go. These are all Federal healthcare costs; the whole Federal healthcare costs, all of them piled up--Medicare, Medicaid, veterans--all of it. So here is what they projected it would be, this top line, in 2010. Then, they got to 2016, and they did another projection because they realized that as of 2014, things were coming in below their expectations. After the Affordable Care Act, things started to change. So they did another projection in 2016, and they projected this line right here.  Those of us who serve on the Budget Committee know that we think in 10-year increments. So here is a 10-year increment from 2017 to 2027. And if you look just at the difference between what CBO predicted in 2010, before the Affordable Care Act, and what they predicted in 2016, after the Affordable Care Act: $3.3 trillion in savings--$3.3 trillion in savings. Think of what a difference that makes for our country if you can save $3.3 trillion in our healthcare costs.  Healthcare costs are what is driving most of our debt and our deficit, so $3.3 trillion in savings? I tell you what, I want to see this bill because I want to know what CBO thinks about what happens to that $3.3 trillion in savings. If the cost of this Republican parliamentary chicanery is going to be losing $3.3 trillion in savings, the American people ought to know about that.  So I call on my Republican colleagues to have a process. I don't know if the Presiding Officer has seen the bill yet. It is so close hold, I don't think all of the Republicans have even seen it. But for gosh sake, when you have these stories from Rhode Island and from all the other States around the country, when you have real fellow Americans counting on the healthcare that the Affordable Care Act made possible, the idea that you throw that out to score political points and to give super rich people a tax break is disgraceful. It is a disgrace.  I yield the floor.

6831,topic-id,1752,"Mr.President, Donald Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change. This is a decision that may prove to be one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our Nation's history.  There is no denying the mounting threat of climate change. We observe rising seas, warming global temperatures, and melting glaciers and ice sheets. Yet the President cast aside a historic global agreement forged through American leadership.  Americans now ask what to do next. For individual citizens, my answer is simple: Take action. Join an environmental group. Support science and scientists. Organize in your community.  Many Americans have been publicly pledging to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement through movements like the ``I am still in'' pledge. Every action, big and small, counts.  American corporations must also act. Unfortunately, they have been AWOL in the politics of climate change. This has been so frustrating because so many of them have great climate principles. They just abandon them when they come to That is why, for my 169th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I have a message for corporate America:  First, know that you are hugely influential in You command extraordinary attention in our political system. This gives you a unique power against the Breitbart fake-news spigot, the shameless fossil fuel industry, and the Koch brothers' climate denial operation, which were all behind the President's fateful decision.  President Trump's brain-dead withdrawal from the Paris accord may prove to be for the best if it creates heightened political interest in climate action from American business leaders. At the moment, corporate political interests in climate action, setting the fossil fuel industry aside entirely, still averages out below zero.  As a Senator, I see corporate America's lobbying efforts in Congress firsthand. Here are some highlights:  Silicon Valley lobbies through an organization called TechNet represents Goliaths, like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook, all of which have great climate policies. TechNet also represents clean energy companies, like Sunrun, Bloom Energy, and  TechNet came again this year to lobby Congress on its six priorities. Here is a page from the actual lobbying materials that TechNet brought to our meeting. The group's Federal policies are these: tax reform, high-skilled immigration reform, education and workforce development, entrepreneurship and job creation, smart infrastructure, and digital trade. Climate change did not make it onto TechNet's priorities list. Even clean energy failed to make it onto the list of the organization that includes Bloom Energy, SolarCity, and  This is not a matter of these giants being cowed by the Trump administration. TechNet came last year when Obama was President, and climate change was not on their agenda then, either. Indeed, the week TechNet came last year, I also had a visit from the timber and lumber industry. Despite what climate change is doing to America's forests, climate change was not on the lumber and timber industry agenda.  That very same week, the property casualty insurance industry came to meet me. These insurance companies write the big checks when climate change sends Mother Nature haywire. Climate change was not mentioned by this industry, either. That was quite a week.  Big business lobbying on climate change is actually worse than zero because the big business trade associations and lobbying groups are often run by the fossil fuel industry. Green energy manufacturers, represented in Washington, DC, by the National Association of Manufacturers, will find their own association lined up against them on climate change. The U.Chamber of Commerce is one of climate action's most implacable enemies, despite the good climate policies of so many companies on its board.  These lobby groups are the most persistent voices of America's business community here in They are the ones who are most active, and they are constant enemies on clean energy and climate action--despite the companies they represent--because, in truth, they answer to the fossil fuel industry, not the business community, when it comes to climate change.  Here is how this can play out. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are the two biggest beverage companies in Both have excellent climate policies. Pepsi even supports Ceres, a fledgling business lobbying group for climate action, but their trade association, the American Beverage Association, takes no lobbying interest in climate change. It knows how to lobby. We can see the lobbying expenditures run up in 2009 and 2010, when they were concerned about Congress's taxing sweetened drinks or corn syrup. It just takes no interest in climate issues.  Worse, Coke and Pepsi run money through the American Beverage Association to the U.Chamber of Add their lobbying all up, and Coke and Pepsi do virtually nothing themselves. A few ounces of credit go to Pepsi for supporting Their American Beverage Association trade group doesn't lift a finger to help, and the U.Chamber of Commerce is a brute force adversary.  The result is that the net lobbying presence of Coke and Pepsi in Congress on climate change is exactly opposed to the two companies' stated policies on climate change. They say one thing; their lobbying effort does the opposite.  On the other side of the fossil fuel divide, the heavy political hand of the fossil fuel industry is felt constantly around here, and that heavy hand is mercilessly opposed to any climate action and enforces its will with a parade of political weaponry akin to those old Soviet May Day parades of tanks, rockets, and artillery. Cross them, and they[[Page S3318]]come after you hard. Ask former Congressman Bob He urged his fellow Republicans to heed the climate science and was hammered for it.  Also, no one should buy the phony assertions by Big Oil CEOs that they recognize that climate change is real and support putting a price on carbon. They say that. ExxonMobil's CEO said that to his shareholders again just last week.  In the Senate, I am the Senate author of a carbon price bill. I know who is lobbying where on carbon prices, and I can tell you their statement is just not true. Every single element of that Soviet May Day parade of fossil fuel political weaponry is dead set against any such thing. What do we conclude from that? Either Big Oil's CEOs don't know what their own lobbying apparatus is doing, or they are just not telling the truth. You guess which.  The strategy of the fossil fuel industry has been to control the Republican You can jam things up by jamming up one party, and you can make it look like it is a partisan issue when it is just old-fashioned, self-interested lobbying. In order to accomplish that purpose, the worst of the political threats and blandishments of the fossil fuel industry are directed against  As long as legitimate corporate leaders in America sit idly by while fossil fuel terrorizes and corrupts the Republican Party, there will not be much progress. ``But, oh,'' some will say, ``there aren't Republicans who will respond. This is too partisan an issue. It will be a wasted effort.'' Not so. I came to the Senate in 2007, and for years there was bipartisan action on climate change--2007, 2008, 2009.  It only stopped when the fossil fuel industry secured from five Republican-appointed Justices on the Supreme Court the disgraceful Citizens United decision of 2010. In 2007, lots of bipartisan activity; 2008, lots of bipartisan activity; 2009, lots of bipartisan activity; 2010, Citizens United--dead stop. That Citizens United decision is what started the fossil fuel Soviet May Day parade of unprecedented political artillery. No special interest had that kind of political artillery before Citizens United opened it up, and much of the post-Citizens United effort has been using dark money to hide the fossil fuel industry's hand.  Since Citizens United, there has been no bipartisan climate action, but that doesn't mean there aren't still Republicans willing to work with us. I know this firsthand. There are Republicans willing to work with us. They just need to know somebody will give them safe passage through the political kill zone that Citizens United has let the fossil fuel industry create. Well, with the Trump administration now all the way over in the ``fossil fuel, Breitbart, Koch brothers climate denial corner,'' it now rests on the shoulders of the legitimate business community to come off the sidelines. They can't count on this administration. They now have to come off the sidelines themselves and do so in strength commensurate with the seriousness of the problem.  If, as a country, we pitch ourselves and the world into the present worst-case climate change scenarios, billions of people will suffer, and suffering people want answers and justice. It will become hard to defend to them our American system of democratic government against charges of corruption and our system of market capitalism against charges of indifference. Government has been corrupted by fossil fuel interests, and too many companies are indifferent. You can't make a case without the facts to back it up, and American companies, more than anyone else, benefit from a world order where liberal democracies prevail. So the stakes for the American business community are very real.  The political mischief of the fossil fuel industry and its front groups will leave a lasting stain on the democracy we all treasure. It is time, in the wake of the President's decision on Paris--isolating America with Syria as our companion in isolation--it is time that the decent and honorable business community played a meaningful role in setting this right. To them, I say: Trump has betrayed you so now is the time to align your industry's political engagement with your industry's position on climate. That is not asking much. We are only asking that American corporations align their political engagement on climate change with their actual position on climate change. If you take climate change seriously, great. Take it seriously when you come to The United States of America, where 1 day after D-day--a day when Americans stormed ashore to free the continent of Europe, fought their way through to knock down Nazi tyranny, and then rebuilt Europe under the Marshall Plan and came home--that country ought not to be a pariah nation with  We needn't be a banana republic for fossil fuel. We can lead the world into a brighter, cleaner, safer energy future, but it will take an effort. So, corporate America, let's make the effort.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

6825,topic-id,2457,"Mr.President, this is National Hemp History Week, a chance to recognize a product that has deep roots going way back in America but faces some of the most anti-farmer, anti-job, unjustifiable policies that are on the American legal books today. Because of its relation to marijuana, hemp can't legally be grown in American fields.  Now, hemp is harmless. Hemp grown for industrial use simply does not have marijuana psychoactive properties. You are going to get as high off hemp as you will off a bag of vegetables. But, still, farmers in Oregon and across the country can't legally grow it. So if America is serious about banning harmless products like hemp, just because they are related to drugs, then I have bad news for fans of poppy seed muffins.  This is the third year I have come to the floor during this time--National Hemp History Week--to talk about the importance of industrial hemp, its huge economic potential for hard-working farmers, and the indefensible ban that keeps so many American farmers from growing it. As was the case before, I am joined by Malcolm McGeary from Southern Oregon, where a lot of farmers have an interest in this, to showcase a variety of hemp products in these baskets on the floor because, despite the ban on growing hemp, you can legally import it for use in products sold in stores across the country.  What really changed my mind on this was when my wife was pregnant--we are older parents--with our third child, and we went into a Costco store. We went into a Costco store on a weekend at home in Oregon, and there were these big bags of hemp hearts, and it said: healthy, good for the blood pressure, fiber--everything that one would expect in Pennsylvania or I know the Presiding Officer is one of the most physically fit members of the body. I see him in the gym all the time so he obviously cares a lot about nutrition. So Nancy and I were walking through Costco, and it said this giant bag of hemp hearts could be purchased there. You say to yourself: Let me see if I get this straight. The hemp comes from Canada, so the farmers must just be laughing all the way to the bank because they are making money. I get what we do is we put it in bags, and it is sold in That led me to the really intellectual concept of saying that if you can sell it at a Costco in Oregon, why can't our farmers grow it? It is not much more complicated than that.  When you are shopping for hemp products, it is not just potato sacks and rough fabric by the yard. There is clothing, lotions and food, hemp milk, nutritional supplements--all these products Mr.McGeary has--used to make soaps, cleaners, and even deck stain. I understand Mr.McGeary may even be wearing a hemp tie. None of these products can be called 100 percent American because every bit of the hemp in these baskets had to be grown someplace else, which is essentially what I described as the Wydens toured Costco at home.  When it was imported, it wasn't an American farmer earning money off that sale. Despite the consumer demand for hemp products and the ingenuity of so many producers who find uses for it, American farmers are cut out of the hemp equation.  The ban on hemp is not anti-drug policy. I think that is what has been confusing with respect to this issue. The ban on hemp is not going to advance the cause of being against drugs. It is not anti-drug policy. It is anti-farmer policy, and it is anti-American jobs policy.  As I indicated, if you can buy it in a local supermarket, the American farmer ought to be able to grow it. Yet year after year, despite a lot of work from Members on both sides of the aisle in this body and in the House, hemp remains on the controlled substance list.  Hemp is not a drug. It is a big opportunity for our farmers. So it is long past time to end these statutory relics of history that cut American farmers out of a valuable market.  Despite the fact that hemp continues to be stigmatized by Federal laws, there is some good news and progress. The 2014 farm bill began to chip away at the Federal ban. It OK'd hemp research projects led by universities and agriculture departments in States like Oregon and Kentucky that take a smarter approach to hemp. These projects are showing significant success. Farmers are ready to grow hemp, and States' agriculture departments are ready to regulate.  The first steps, in my view, don't go far enough, and even some of these early projects remain tied up in redtape due to the Federal ban.  In my view, the only real solution is a legislative solution. So here we have a bipartisan coalition, the kind of coalition you see in the U.Senate when people really look into the facts and Members decide to make common cause. We have the good fortune of having the majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, as one of our principal sponsors; Senator Paul, his colleague; Senator Merkley; and I reintroducing the Hemp Farming We pursued this for a number of years. I introduced it every Congress since 2011.  Last year, our bipartisan bill had more than a dozen Senate cosponsors. This year, the goal is to again find common ground to remove hemp from the schedule I controlled substance list, give the go-ahead to farmers across the country who are ready to grow industrial hemp, and, once again, make it a true American crop.  I hope my colleagues will join in the effort to celebrate National Hemp History I hope they will use it to learn more about a very versatile crop, a safe crop, and one with really extraordinary potential to boost jobs in the economy, in our agricultural sector, and our domestic employment base.  This is commonsense legislation. Again, we have the good fortune to be led by the majority leader, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr.We will be introducing this commonsense legislation very shortly.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.Mr.President, I rise in support of Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017. For too long, a myopic focus on the Iran deal blinded the United States to Iran's persistent campaign to destabilize the Middle East and undermine America's national security interests. Iran has been given a free pass to detain U.sailors in clear violation of international law, conduct ballistic missile tests in violation of the United Nations resolutions, support terrorist groups across the region, and prop up the murderous Assad regime in  It is long past time for the United States and the international community to hold Iran accountable, not just for its commitments under the nuclear deal but for its destabilizing behavior across the Middle This legislation begins to do just that by imposing new sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program, applying terrorism sanctions to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, imposing sanctions on Iranians engaged in human rights abuses, and tightening enforcement on arms embargoes on the Iranian regime.  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senators Corker and Cardin, for ringing this bill to the floor. They recognize that the United States must not stand idly by when hostile regimes undermine and attack our interests and that of our allies. They recognize that regimes that aid and abet crimes against humanity must be held accountable. They recognize that weakness in the face of aggression is provocative.  These are the reasons we must pass this legislation, but these are also the very same reasons this legislation must be amended to strengthen and expand sanctions against Vladimir Putin's  In just the last 3 years under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, threatened NATO allies, and intervened militarily in Syria,[[Page S3315]]leaving a trail of death, destruction, and broken promises in its wake.  Last year, Russia attacked the foundations of American democracy with a cyber and information campaign to interfere in America's 2016 election. It has been 8 months now since the U.intelligence community publicly concluded that the Russian Government had attempted to interfere in our last Presidential election.  On October 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the ``U.intelligence community is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.persons and institutions, including from U.political organizations.'' The statement concluded that ``only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.''  On January 6, 2017, the U.intelligence community went even further, concluding:       Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence      campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential      election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in      the United States democratic process, denigrate Secretary      Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.  The intelligence community ``did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,'' but they did warn that ``Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the U.Presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against U.allies and their election processes.''  Since January, months of congressional hearings, testimony, and investigative work have reinforced these conclusions: that Russia deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyber attacks and a disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and undermine faith in our democracy and our values.  Vladimir Putin's brazen attack on our democracy is a flagrant demonstration of his disdain and disrespect for our This should not just outrage every American, it should compel us to action. But in the last 8 months, what price has Russia paid for attacking American democracy? Hardly any at all: modest sanctions against a few Russian individuals and entities, some Russian diplomats and spies sent home to Russia, two spy compounds have closed, at least for now--and all of this reversible and at the discretion of the  What has Russia's reaction been to America's tepid response and reaction to its aggressive behavior? More of the same. More aggression, more meddling. Russia attempted to overthrow the democratically elected Government of Montenegro and murder its Prime Russia attempted to interfere in France's election. We have already seen attempts to influence German public opinion ahead of the elections in September, and there is every expectation that Russia will do the same thing in the Czech Republic, Italy, and elsewhere in future elections.  Sooner or later, my friends, there will be another American election that captures Russian attention and interest. The victim may be a Republican or a To Putin, it won't matter because his targets are not Republicans or Democrats but Americans and all that we stand for as a people. He seeks to sow dissent amongst us and divide us from one another, to erode our resolve to resist his dark and dangerous view of the world, and to undermine our confidence in ourselves and our belief in our own values.  We must take our own side in this fight--not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as It is time to respond to Russia's attack on American democracy with strength and resolve, with common purpose, and with action. Together with Senator Graham and a number of other Senators, I am prepared to offer an amendment to this legislation that will begin to do just that. It incorporates some of the best ideas from different pieces of legislation already introduced in the Senate, ideas that have broad bipartisan support.  The amendment we are talking about would impose mandatory sanctions on transactions with the Russian defense or intelligence sectors, including the FSB and the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was primarily responsible for Russia's attack on our election.  The amendment would impose mandatory visa bans and asset freezes on any individual who undermines the cyber security of public or private infrastructure and democratic institutions. It would impose mandatory sanctions on those who assist or support such activities.  The amendment would codify existing sanctions on Russia by placing into law five Executive orders signed by President Obama in response to both Russian interference in the 2016 election and its illegal actions in Ukraine, and it would take new steps to tighten those sanctions. For example, Russia's ability to issue new sovereign debt essentially allows Russia to borrow money from global capital markets to offset pressure from existing U.and European sanctions. So this amendment would impose mandatory sanctions on U.and third-party investment in sales of Russian sovereign debt as well as in the privatization of Russian state-owned assets.  The amendment would target the Russian energy sector, which is controlled by Vladimir Putin's cronies, with sanctions on investments in Russian petroleum and natural gas development as well as Russian energy pipelines.  We also need to put additional pressure on the ability of Putin and his cronies to move money they have looted from the Russian state. So this amendment would mandate that the Secretary of the Treasury establish a high-level task force within the Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that would focus on tracing, mapping, and prosecuting illicit financial flows linked to Russia if such flows interact with the U.financial system. The task force would also work with liaison officers in key U.Embassies, especially in Europe, to work with local authorities to uncover and prosecute the networks responsible for the illicit Russian financial flows.  Finally, recognizing that Russia seeks to undermine not just American democracy but Western democracy altogether, this amendment would provide support to the State Department, the Global Engagement Center, and USAID to help build the resilience of democratic institutions in Europe against Russian aggression exerted through corruption, propaganda, and other forms of political interference.  We need a strong Russia sanctions amendment. We need it now. We need it on this piece of legislation. We need this amendment because we have no time to waste. The United States of America needs to send a strong message to Vladimir Putin and any other aggressor that we will not tolerate attacks on our democracy. There is no greater threat to our freedoms than attacks on our ability to choose our own leaders free from foreign interference. So we must act accordingly, and we must act now.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

6841,topic-id,482,"Mr.President, today I wish to propose a new day in U.relations with the country of With his recent imposition of new restrictions, the President presented one vision of that relationship--one that looks backwards and reverts to a failed policy of isolation that has done nothing to improve the lives of the Cuban people and has harmed the American economy. I would like to present an alternative vision--one that looks to the future and at fostering the exchange of ideas and commerce between the two countries.  It is often noted that Cuba is less than 100 miles away, but decades behind the United States, in no small part because of the U.embargo. Decades of the same, tired, failing economic policies left the Cuban Government in place and only hurt the Cuban people and American farmers and manufacturers.  As Cuban-American relations thawed under Presidents Bush and Obama, the Cuban Government decided to try something different. Private entrepreneurs are operating an increasing number of restaurants, taxis, and other tourist-related businesses. Cubans are opening up their homes for visitors to stay in and selling products directly to visiting In addition, the government's grip on information and communication is necessarily weakening as technology and the Internet inevitably permeate the country.  The U.has come a long way since the 1990s and hardly resembles the world of the 1960s. Our policies toward Cuba should reflect that change. The U.S.-Cuba Trade Act of 2017 would completely remove the architecture of sanctions against Cuba and establish normal trade relations with that country.  I want to be clear that this is not a free pass for the Cuban I continue to have grave concerns about its suppression of pro-democracy movements, but I reject the view that continuing to try and ostracize Cuba will bring positive change. The past five decades provide empirical evidence that it will not. I also reject the cynical argument that the U.must choose between engagement with Cuba and support for basic human rights and dignity. Indeed, if the past half century has shown us anything, it is that smart, principled engagement is the way to bring about greater economic and political freedom for the Cuban people.  Just as important as what the embargo means for the Cuban people is what it means for U.farmers and businesses. Even with the changes made by the Obama administration, it remains almost impossible to do business in Cuba is a natural customer of the United States, but restrictions on credit and travel, among others, have severely hampered the ability of U.exporters to do business in the Cuban market. The question is: What are we getting by surrendering a market that should be ours to the EU, China, Brazil, and others? I am afraid that the answer is nothing.  That is why I introduced the U.S.-Cuba Trade Act of 2017, to finally put an end to the ineffective embargo against Cuba.[[Page S4756]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4755-2.txt,1247,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017--MOTION TO,2017.0,2.0,May
6851,topic-id,897,"Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for organizing this very important Special This is something that she has been a champion on. This is my third term, and we have been talking about this for 4 years. Enough is enough. It is time to end this.  I rise today in support of Congress reclaiming its authority under Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the The United States must have a clear strategy with well-defined goals to counter nonstate actors like ISIS that threaten the United They threaten our national security interests. We must also develop clear legal authority for our military to take action against these groups. Ending the 2001 AUMF is a crucial part of that effort.  According to scholars at Brown University's Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs, our government, our taxpayers, have spent $4.8 trillion on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, paid for almost entirely by borrowing.  As of today, 6,925 American soldiers have given their lives serving our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Inherent Resolve, and Operation Freedom's Sentinel, according to the Department of But what about the costs to take care of these young men and women for the next 60, 70, and 80 years in our country?  While our brave men and women in uniform continue to fight in the sands of Iraq and Syria and the mountains of Afghanistan, we have gone through three Presidential administrations without a statement articulating what victory is, except that ``terrorism must be defeated.''  No one disagrees with that goal, but it is an uncertain way to order our Nation's military posture and to commit our young men and women in the military serving this Nation without a clear, defined goal. We have been at war in Afghanistan for 16 years, yet the Taliban controls or contests 40 percent of Afghan districts, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  The U.intelligence community's worldwide threat assessment states that ``the overall situation in Afghanistan will very likely continue to deteriorate, even if international support is sustained,'' and that ``endemic state weaknesses, the government's political fragility, deficiencies of the Afghan National Security Forces, Taliban persistence, and regional interference will remain key impediments to improvement.''  In addition to Afghanistan, the United States has also been involved in Iraq, on and off, since 2003.  James Zogby of the Arab American Institute conducted a poll of Iraqi public opinion in 2016, which found that 94 percent of Iraqis had an unfavorable attitude about the United Ninety-four percent of Iraqis polled say they do not think the U.contributes to peace and stability in the Arab world.  We need a much clearer strategy for our men and women in uniform than to tell them just to keep doing the same thing over and over again. We all know what the definition of insanity is, and we need to do better for them and for our partners around the world.  Our Nation has arrived at a historic and constitutional moment. Prior to President Trump's inauguration, President Obama released a framework outlining his administration's formal legal view on the use of military force against Islamic terror groups around the globe. That report relied heavily on the 2001 AUMF, which has been used to justify numerous American military operations against an ever-expanding number of terror groups, many of which have only slight links to the perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, attacks.  In reality, our loose interpretation of the 2001 AUMF to have a perpetual war against terror might as well be using the authorization that Thomas Jefferson used to go after the Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli the way this has been stretched over and over again. It is unconscionable.  I hope that President Trump's administration will not continue to rely[[Page H4353]]on that same legal framework but, rather, that he will formally ask Congress to pass a new authorization with a clear directive of what success is for the use of force that will not perpetually operate in constitutional gray areas.  Strikes against groups like al-Shabaab in Somalia take place in constitutional twilight zones where the Constitution's distribution of authority to use force is uncertain, as Justice Jackson wrote in Youngstown v.  To better preserve our Constitution's separation of powers structure, Congress must make it a priority to develop clear legal authority for American military action against Islamist terror organizations. Further, such authorization should be structured so it will not turn into the expanding grant of power like the 2001 AUMF has done.  If we fail to pass a new AUMF, it would do our servicemen and -women, as well as the American public, a fundamental disservice. It would prolong authorization of an endless war.  It is time to end the Middle East conflict. Let's end the authorization of the 2001 Right now, I fear that many of our military operations do not have congressional authorization and do not comply with the clear statement of Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution that gives Congress the power to declare war.  To show our servicemen and -women we support them, to uphold the Constitution, and for the good of our Nation, I hope we can work on the passage of a new AUMF with deliberate speed.  Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. Her commitment to this cause is commendable.  ",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgH4351.txt,2115,AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE,2017.0,18.0,July
