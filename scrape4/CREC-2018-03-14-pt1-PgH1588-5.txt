     NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM CHAMPS

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise with great pride to congratulate 
the North Carolina Central University men's basketball team for winning 
the 2018 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Basketball Tournament. NCCU, 
Mr. Speaker, is located in Durham, North Carolina. For the second 
successive year, the NCCU Eagles won the MEAC tournament, by defeating 
the Hampton University Pirates 71 to 63.
  As a proud alumnus of NCCU, I was delighted to cheer the entire team, 
the players, the coaches, and staff during their outstanding 
performance in one of the Nation's most popular college athletic 
tournaments.
  The basketball program has benefited from the exceptional leadership 
of Head Coach LeVelle Moton and Athletic Director Dr. Ingrid Wicker-
McCree.
  I want to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, how proud I am of the NCCU men's 
basketball team and the entire Eagle family on this historic win. The 
hard work of the team and the unwavering support of Eagle pride and 
Chancellor Dr. Johnson Akinleye, NCCU students, and the faculty and all 
of the staff have made this accomplishment possible.
  I wish this great team much success as they embark upon the NCAA 
tournament.
  Go Eagles.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names of the players, the 
coaches, and the staff.
