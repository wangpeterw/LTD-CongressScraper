                     RECOGNIZING MISS MOLLY MATNEY

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miss Molly Matney, 
an outstanding resident of Metcalfe County in the First Congressional 
District of Kentucky.
  Ms. Matney was crowned Miss Kentucky 2017 on July 1. She is an 
agriculture major at Western Kentucky University and hopes to pursue a 
career as an agricultural lending executive. Her talents and 
accomplishments distinguish her as a valuable asset to the Miss 
Kentucky organization, as well as the First District of Kentucky.
  The ``Farm Fit'' platform she has developed encourages consumption of 
products found in local farmers' markets to help individuals maintain a 
healthy lifestyle. This concept complements and reemphasizes 
fundamental aspects of the Kentucky Department of Agriculture's 
``Kentucky Proud'' campaign.
  Her yearlong travels will allow her to promote both of these 
initiatives throughout the Commonwealth. I am confident she will 
utilize her knowledge of Kentucky's agriculture industry for the 
betterment of her platform and will continue to be a deserving advocate 
for Kentucky farmers.
  I wish her the best of luck as she prepares to compete at the Miss 
America pageant in Atlanta City, New Jersey, on September 10, and I 
look forward to her continued contributions to the First District of 
Kentucky.
