                         MEDIA BIAS SETS RECORD

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the biased liberal media have 
forgotten their responsibility to our democracy: give the American 
people the facts, don't tell them what to think.
  A new report by the Media Research Center shows that coverage of 
President Trump by the broadcast networks has been 89 percent negative, 
higher than any other President.
  Is it any wonder that half of Americans disapprove of the job 
President Trump is doing?
  The real wonder is that it is not greater, given what the public 
hears and reads every day.
  According to a recent Gallup Poll, 55 percent of U.S. adults say that 
news organizations' stories are ``often inaccurate.'' Only 36 percent 
say the media get the facts straight.
  Commonsense, reasonable Americans would do well to discount the 
liberal media since they don't provide fair and objective information.
