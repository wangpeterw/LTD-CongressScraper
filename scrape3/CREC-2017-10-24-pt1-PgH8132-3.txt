                    FOCUS TAX RELIEF ON MIDDLE CLASS

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the President and 
congressional Republicans claim they want to, ``Put more money in the 
pockets of average Americans.'' Well, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center 
analyzed their plan, and they found out what it really does, put 
billionaires first. They found that 80 percent of the Republican tax 
cuts would go to the richest 1 percent.
  But that is not all. Also, under their plan, 50 million Americans 
will see a tax increase. Many of them happen to be constituents of 
mine, middle class families and working families in Pennsylvania.
  It is wrong to raise the taxes of my constituents to pay for tax cuts 
for billionaires. That is wrong, it is bad economics, and it will crush 
our economy. We need an economy that works for everyone. Let's focus 
tax relief where it counts, and that is on the middle class.
