                    WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY

  (Ms. ESHOO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon really with a very, 
very sad and heavy heart. I don't know anyone in our country who 
watched what took place across the country who wasn't dismayed, who 
wasn't heartbroken, who wasn't confused. And as my constituents said: 
What is happening in our country?
  Now, there are some that say this must be done. This executive order 
must be done in the name of national security.
  I am a veteran of the House Intelligence Committee, but it doesn't 
take a veteran of the House Intelligence Committee to understand that 
this harms our national security.
  We need to have more voices in the House. We need Republicans and 
Democrats standing up together, because historians will replace your 
surname, and those that don't raise their voices will be called coward 
because this is ripping at the fabric and the soul of our Nation. It is 
appalling. It is unlawful. I believe it is unconstitutional.
  If you stood up for history and what was done to others, it is taking 
place right now in our country.
