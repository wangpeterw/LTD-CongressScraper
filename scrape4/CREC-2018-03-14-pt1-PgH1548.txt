                    HONORING THE LIFE OF MIKE MABIN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a man 
who touched so many lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
  Mike Mabin, a lifelong resident of lower Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 
was a man who took immense pride in his community and selflessly gave 
back to it every chance he could. A successful businessman, Mike was 
the president and CEO of PennFab, Inc., in Bucks County. And as a 
member of the St. Mary Hospital Advisory Board and the vice chairman of 
the Bucks County Industrial Development Authority, Mike cared deeply 
about and worked tirelessly for all of his neighbors in our community.
  A proud veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard, Mike was proud to be an 
American and deeply valued service to country. His advocacy was 
instrumental in making sure that Congress passed the Fairness to 
Veterans Act, as he wanted to make sure that all those who courageously 
served our Nation were given opportunities here back home.
  I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in 
sending our deepest condolences to Mike's wife, Marion, along with his 
children: Heather, Michael, and Jillian. May they take comfort in 
knowing that Mike made a positive and significant difference in so many 
lives, and he will be remembered for his patriotism, his loyalty, and 
his friendship.
