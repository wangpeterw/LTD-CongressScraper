                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Gracious Father, our shield and defense, we look to You in these 
challenging times. Lord, the shooting at the congressional baseball 
practice reminds us of the importance of numbering our days. May we 
refuse to boast about tomorrow, for we know not what a day may bring.
  Lord, surround our lawmakers with the shields of your protection and 
favor. Fill them with Your Spirit, causing them to walk in Your 
statutes and keep Your judgments.
  Lord, You know better than we what lies ahead for our lives. So lead 
us like a gentle shepherd.
  We claim Your promise in Hebrews 13:5 that You will never leave or 
forsake us. Guide and inspire us all to follow Your plan for our lives.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
