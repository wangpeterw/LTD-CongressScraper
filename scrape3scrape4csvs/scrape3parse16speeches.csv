878,topic-id,506,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to recognize America's farmers on National Farmers  I call our American farmers the thin green line because food security is national security. We can never discount the importance of our Nation's ability to feed itself, and we can do so only by the hard work of the men and women in the agricultural community.  In honor of National Farmers Day, I wanted to recite a poem first delivered by a radio personality, Paul Harvey, to the FFA Convention in 1978. The poem is as follows:       And on the 8th day, God looked down on his planned paradise      and said, ``I need a caretaker,'' so God made a farmer. God      said, ``I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk      cows, work all day in the fields, milk cows again, eat      supper, then go to town and stay past midnight at a meeting      of the school board,'' so God made a farmer.       ``I need somebody with arms strong enough to rustle a calf      and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild; somebody      to call hogs, tame cantankerous machinery, come home hungry,      have to wait for lunch until his wife is done feeding visit      ladies, then tell the ladies to be sure and come back real      soon, and mean it,'' so God made a farmer.       God said, ``I need somebody willing to sit up all night      with a newborn colt, and watch it die, and then dry his eyes      and say, `Maybe next year.' I need somebody who can shape an      ax handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a hunk      of car tire, who can make a harness out of haywire, feed      sacks, and shoe straps; who, planting time comes and harvest      season, will finish his 40-hour week by Tuesday noon, and      then paining from tractor back, put in another 72 hours,'' so      God made a farmer.       God had to have somebody willing to ride the ruts at double      speed to get the hay in ahead of the rain clouds, and yet      stop in midfield and race to help when he sees the first      smoke from a neighbor's place, so God made a farmer.       God said, ``I need somebody strong enough to clear trees      and heave bales, yet gentle enough to tame lambs and wean      pigs and tend to the pink-combed pullets, who will stop his      mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadow      lark.''       It had to be somebody who would plow deep and straight and      not cut corners; somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and      rake and disc and plow and plant and tie the fleece and      strain the milk and replenish the self-feeder and finish a      hard week's work with a 5-mile drive to church; somebody who      would bale a family together with the soft strong bonds of      sharing, who would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply, with      smiling eyes, when his son says that he wants to spend his      life ``doing what dad does,'' so God made a farmer.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-12-pt1-PgH7986-2.txt,2244,1115,2017.0,12.0,October
746,topic-id,179,"Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the tremendous work of Elizabeth Dent, who has been an invaluable part of the staff of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture for the past 3 years. Elizabeth came to work with the subcommittee I chair after working several years with a former appropriator, Congressman Jack  Elizabeth has been a valuable member of the subcommittee team. She is diligent, dedicated, and keen to details, something that is very important to the appropriations work.  She is always eager to volunteer and lend a hand to accomplish whatever tasks may be needed in assisting in the agricultural community. She has become an integral part of the team, and she will be greatly missed on our subcommittee.  Elizabeth will be leaving the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture to work for the Senate Agriculture Appropriations I thank her for her outstanding work. The Senate Appropriations Committee is very fortunate to have her work on the staff. We wish her all the very best, and we look forward to working with her in her new capacity.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-12-pt1-PgH8016-2.txt,1460,HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF TOM PETTY,2017.0,12.0,October

140,topic-id,5819,"Mr.President, a week ago Saturday night, I was having dinner with my wife. It was about 8:30 in the evening, and the telephone rang, my cell phone, sitting in my pocket. I pulled it out, and it was the White House operator. The President was calling. So I walked out of the restaurant, sat on a curb outside in the dark, and had about a 15-minute conversation with the President of the United States while my dinner got cold.  President Trump said: I am calling about the cost-sharing reduction payments. I have cut them off as of October 1. The court says they are illegal. I don't want insurance companies to be bailed out. I think I can get block grants to replace ObamaCare, but I don't want people to suffer in the meantime.  So he said to me: I think I might want to get a bipartisan interim deal, a short-term deal. I have called Chuck Schumer and told him that.  The President put that out in a tweet that day.  So the President said to me: Why don't you negotiate with Senator Murray and try to get one; meaning a short-term, bipartisan deal.  I said: Well, what about the CSR payments?  He said: I can put them back, and you can use that as a negotiating tool to get a better deal with the  I responded that I was already working on an agreement with Senator  He said: Finish it, and let me know.  He called me again last We talked about it again, and we talked twice yesterday.  I reported to the President that we finished our negotiations and that we are here today to present to the Senate the agreement we recommend.  The bill has 22 sponsors, half Democratic and half Republican--very few bills come to the floor with that many cosponsors originally--and there are a number of others on the Republican side and I understand from Senator Murray a number on the Democratic side who support the idea.  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the cosponsors I am about to read be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the agreement that Senator Murray and I would like to present to the Senate for its consideration and the President's consideration and the consideration of the House of Representatives be printed in the Record following my remarks.  The Republican Senators who are cosponsoring the Alexander-Murray proposal, in addition to me, are Senator Rounds, Senator Graham, Senator McCain, Senator Cassidy, Senator Collins, Senator Ernst, Senator Murkowski, Senator Burr, and Senator I thank them all for doing that. Senator Murray will talk about the equal number of Democratic cosponsors that we have.  We hope Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, the President of the United States, and the House of Representatives will consider our proposal. This is a first step--improve it and pass it, sooner rather than later. Our purpose is to stabilize and then lower the cost of premiums in the individual insurance market for the years 2018 and 2019.  In plain English, most Americans get their insurance from the government or on the job. About 6 percent of insured Americans, or 18 million Americans, go into the individual market to buy it. They are the ones we are worried about. They are the ones we are seeking to help. There are 350,000 such people in Tennessee--songwriters, farmers, small business women--they are the ones who are terrified by the prospect of skyrocketing premiums and even the possibility that they might not be able to buy insurance at all.  Our agreement tries to help in two ways. 1, it permanently amends the Affordable Care Act to give new flexibility for States to create insurance policies that have a larger variety and lower costs. 2, it continues the cost-sharing reduction payments during 2018 and 2019.  Now, first, about cost-sharing. Cost-sharing reduction payments are subsidies that pay for co-pays and deductibles for low-income That is what they are. Every Democrat wants them to continue, so do many Republicans, including every Republican in the majority in the House who voted for their repeal-and-replace bill this year because it continued the cost-sharing payments for two years.  Let me say that again. Every Republican in the House of Representatives who voted to repeal and replace ObamaCare this year voted for a provision that continued the cost-sharing payments for 2 years. Our bill does the same thing. The only difference is, we eliminate any question about whether paying them is legal.  Now, why would so many Republicans and so many Democrats support these payments for 2 years and why would the President of the United States be interested in them? It is because the Congressional Budget Office has told us that if we don't do it--if we let them expire--premiums in 2018 will go up an average of 20 percent. They[[Page S6605]]are already set, in most cases. The Federal debt will increase by $194 billion because of the extra cost of subsidies to pay the higher premiums, and up to 16 million Americans may live in counties where they are not able to buy any insurance in the individual market.  So unless the cost-sharing payments, which the President says are illegal--and I agree with him. The Federal Court in Washington, DC, has told him they are illegal, not properly authorized by Unless they are replaced by something else temporarily, there will be chaos in this country, and millions of Americans will be hurt.  The President says there should be no bailout of insurance companies--no bailout of insurance companies. I agree 100 percent and so does Senator She can speak for herself. I have said to the President in our telephone calls--as I mentioned, 4 of them in the last 10 days--that if there is a way to improve the language in our bill, we would like to do that. We have a page and a half to make it clear that the benefits go to consumers, not insurance companies. That can always be improved.  Some conservatives object to the idea of paying them at all, but I would ask this: What is conservative about unaffordable premiums? What is conservative about $194 billion of new Federal debt? What is conservative about creating chaos so millions can't buy insurance or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created? What is conservative about a four-lane highway that would be the chaos that leads to a single-payer solution for insurance in this country? Do we really think that if 50 counties in Tennessee or Iowa or Kansas or any State are in a situation where no one can buy insurance on the individual market, that government-sponsored insurance is not far behind? Of course it is. That is why Senator Graham and Senator Cassidy have cosponsored our bill, because our bill would have been part of the Senate Republican repeal-and-replace bills if budget rules had allowed it.  Senator Graham and Senator Cassidy know that if we repeal and replace ObamaCare in 1 year or 2 years or 3 years, it takes 2 or 3 years for it to take effect. We still need the cost-sharing payments for the interim, and you can't pass those in the Senate with 51 votes. It takes 60. Democrats are for it. The Republican House majority has voted for it. The sponsor of the Senate repeal-and-replace bills are cosponsors of this agreement. It sounds like something that might actually become law before the end of the year.  Second, flexibility. The biggest difference between the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats with regard to health insurance and the individual market is whether Washington should write more of the rules or States should write more of the rules. Our position has been that States should write more of the rules. We have had about 50 votes--maybe more--and we have lost them all. We have made thousands of speeches, and we have lost them all. In the last 7 years, we haven't moved an inch toward our objectives of giving States more flexibility in creating insurance policies in the individual market. This agreement does.  It provides and authorizes States to offer an insurance policy called catastrophic insurance for people of all ages that would keep a medical catastrophe from turning into a financial catastrophe. It encourages interstate agreements among States in health insurance. It streamlines the innovation waiver--section 1332, we call it--for States that want to do what Alaska did, which is to create a fund to pay for the very sick and then reduce premiums for everybody else by 20 percent and use no new Federal dollars. Most important, it changes the law to make it easier for States like Iowa, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Alaska, and many others to use their creativity to write policies that offer more choices and lower costs.  Some have said: Well, that is not enough. Well, that is more than we have gotten for 8 years, and it is the first step.  I welcome anyone who wants to negotiate further with Senator Murray or Senator That is what the legislative process is about.  Now, because I forgot to do it when I listed the sponsors, I would like to add Senator Isakson and Senator Grassley to the sponsor list, which would be two additional Republican sponsors, I would say to Senator That gives us a total of 12. I thank Senator Grassley for his support.  The only thing I would say to those who want to negotiate further to get more flexibility is to keep in mind that with the cost-sharing payments, you can't get most of those changes without 60 votes in the  I thank Senator Murray for being an able and effective negotiating partner. We have worked on many pieces of legislation together. She is tough and respected in her caucus. She does what she says she will do, and she is interested in getting a result. I respect that and I thank her.  I thank President Trump for his encouragement. He called me 10 days ago, he called me last Saturday, and he called me again yesterday. I thank him for his encouragement--to encourage someone to come up with a bipartisan agreement to cover these 2 years so people wouldn't be harmed--and his willingness to consider what we are offering today.  I thank Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer because they have created an environment in which Senator Murray and I could make this proposal. I hope they and our other colleagues will seriously consider it.  The President was right to suggest that we need a short-term agreement so people will not be hurt. Now, some people are still objecting to the idea of continuing these temporary cost-sharing payments for 2 years and the other provisions that would have as the objective to keep premiums from going up in 2018 and for premiums to begin to go down in 2019.  They are listening to groups around Washington, I would suggest they listen to some other people. Listen to the waitress, listen to the songwriter, listen to the bricklayer, listen to the small businesswoman, and the people of America--and there are 350,000 in Tennessee--who may be terrified by the prospect of increasing premiums or even by the prospect of not being able to buy insurance at all. These are people who don't get insurance from the government. They don't get it on the job. They might never know when they are going to lose their job and they will be in this individual market.  We have a solution here. Senator Murray and I--24 total Senators--are offering it today. We are certain it can be improved. We look forward to working with those who would improve it, but I do not believe Congress would want to fail to deal with a problem that will hurt millions of Americans if we allow it to continue.  I predict this agreement that we 24 Senators are suggesting today will become law in some fashion before the end of the year. I think most Senators and most House Members will be looking around for a solution when they consider the consequences of a failure to act. When they look for a solution, I believe this solution supported by 24 Senators--half Democrats, half Republicans--will be the easiest solution to adopt. I believe all the Democrats want it. Almost all of the House Republicans have already voted for it this year, and the Senate Republican leaders who would prefer to repeal and replace ObamaCare would put it in their bill if they could get it in there, but they can't because the budget rules will not allow it.

What I responded is that I 100-percent agree.  I have already said this to the President, but I think it is important for our colleagues to know that probably the most heated debate Senator Murray and I had was not over whether we agreed with that but on how to actually do it in the most effective, strongest, toughest way possible.  So I wish to emphasize the point that these payments are designed to help low-income Americans pay their copays and deductibles. We have in our agreement about a page and a half of language that requires every State to make sure the benefits of those payments go to the consumers in 2018 and not to the insurance companies.  I wish to ask Senator Murray if she sees any disagreement at all between her and me, and most of our colleagues on that side of the aisle and over here, about whether we want to bail out insurance companies or whether we[[Page S6609]]would be willing to consider any effective language that would improve our own language.

382,topic-id,378,"Mr.President, I am very pleased to draw attention today to the 200th anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah, the founder of the Baha'i  The Baha'i Faith has over 5 million followers around the world, including over 2,000 in Baha'is come from virtually every racial, ethnic, national, tribal, and linguistic background on the planet.  On October 22, 2017, Baha'i communities across the United States and around the world will commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah--the founder of the Baha'i Faith--and celebrate his life and his teachings.  Baha'u'llah was born to a noble family in 1817 in Persia, modern-day As a young man, he was known for his charity and service to others and was called the father of the poor. In 1844, he founded the Baha'i Faith, a new and independent religion with its own scriptures, laws, teachings, and practices.  Baha'u'llah proclaimed a message of justice, unity, and peace. This message called for, among other things, the equality of women and men, an end to racial prejudice, universal education, interfaith harmony, and international cooperation. As a result of his teachings, Baha'u'llah was imprisoned and exiled for over 40 years by the Persian and Ottoman empires.  Despite the injustice and oppression he faced throughout his life, Baha'u'llah continued to promote a message of peace and unity based upon harmony within the human race. In every place to which he was banished, he touched the lives of all those around him. Even some of his opponents, after meeting him, became his friends and admirers.  Today Baha'is in Iran are still persecuted for their faith, and human rights experts have called their situation one of the clearest and most severe cases of religious persecution in the world.  The Baha'i Faith first arrived in the U.over 120 years ago. Baha'is now live in every State of the Union, including Tennessee, where the community has grown to over 2,000 members.  Wherever they live, Baha'is champion the principles that Baha'u'llah proclaimed. They strive to build a better world by being good citizens, serving their communities, and working side by side with others to promote the common good.  On this important occasion, I congratulate the Baha'i community of Tennessee and across the United States on the bicentennial of the birth of Baha'u'llah.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-19-pt1-PgS6638.txt,1695,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,19.0,October

806,topic-id,1291,"Mr.President, later this week, Senator Murray and I, with other Senators, will introduce bipartisan legislation to give States additional flexibility to create more choices of health insurance policies in the individual market and to extend cost-sharing reduction subsidies during 2018 and 2019. These subsidies pay for copays and deductibles for millions of low-income Americans who buy health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Our goal is to stabilize and then lower the cost of premiums and to enable all Americans to have access to health insurance.  Our legislation will be based on the four hearings and other meetings that the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee held last month. I am chairman of that committee, and Senator Murray is the ranking Democratic member. These hearings and meetings were bipartisan. They were lengthy. They were remarkable in this sense: They engaged nearly 60 Senators from both political parties in extensive discussions. We not only had the four hearings, which involved the 23 members of our HELP Committee, but we invited any other Senator who wished to come to a committee meeting ahead of time to meet the Governors and the State insurance commissioners and others who were testifying, and 37 did. So we have had extensive participation by 60 Members of the U.Senate through four hearings and a variety of committee meetings in the process that developed this legislative proposal that Senator Murray and I have agreed upon.  According to witnesses at our hearings, according to the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's Joint Tax Committee, without these cost-sharing payment reductions, premiums will rise, the Federal debt will increase to pay for the higher subsidies by $194 billion over 10 years, and up to 16 million Americans may find themselves living in counties where no company sells insurance in the individual market.  Imagine yourself as a 45-year-old songwriter in Tennessee who loses her job, has three kids, goes to the individual market, and finds that she can't buy health insurance; no company is offering it because we did not act. Those are the consequences we are talking about.  Witnesses also testified that one way to lower costs for consumers is to give States more flexibility than the Affordable Care Act now allows to design health insurance plans that give consumers more choices.  We have purposefully limited our proposal to two themes: first, 2 years of temporary cost-sharing payments and, second, amendments that would give States meaningful flexibility in using the section 1332 innovation waiver, which is already a part of the Affordable Care  The problem with the waiver is that while it was designed to give States the opportunity for innovation, it has been very restrictive. It limited the number of opportunities States could use. It would be like saying to someone: You can drive anywhere you want to in the United States as long as you end up in New York or in Nashville or in Birmingham, Our goal is still to protect patients but to give States more flexibility in offering more choices.  There are, of course, many other good and useful ideas that would improve Federal laws regulating health insurance. There are many on the Republican side, and there are many on the Democratic side. There are probably even ideas that both of us would agree on, but Congress has been stuck for 7 years in a partisan stalemate over the Affordable Care Most of that stalemate is about the individual insurance market.  Most people get their insurance from the government, Medicare, or Most of the rest of the people get their insurance from their employer on the job; that is 50 or 60 percent of Only 6 percent of Americans get their insurance in the so-called individual market. It is about 350,000 people in Every single one of them is very important, and every single one of them is terrified by the skyrocketing premiums in that market and by the possibility that they might not be able to buy insurance at all in that market if we don't act.  We concluded that the best course would be to take this limited, bipartisan first step, which would avoid the chaos that could occur during 2018 and 2019 if premiums continue to skyrocket and millions of Americans find themselves without a way to purchase health insurance. Once we complete this limited first step, then we can take the second and the third steps.  I want to undersell this proposal rather than oversell it. It has significant advantages in terms of cost-sharing reductions, which make it more likely that premiums will stabilize in 2018 and actually go down in 2019. It has significant advantages in changing the law so that States will have more flexibility in offering choices, which is another way to lower costs, but it is only a limited first step.  Senator Murray and I hope that by the end of the week we can present Senate leadership--Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer--with the support of a significant number of Republican and Democratic We then hope the Senate will pass the legislation, the House will agree to it, and the President will sign it.  During the last several days, I have had encouraging discussions with President Trump, who called me on two different occasions, encouraging me to work with Senator Murray to come to a bipartisan agreement. I am grateful to him for that encouragement, and I am grateful to her for her patience and for working on this so diligently for such a long period of time. I see she has just come to the floor.  I think one other thing Senator Murray and I can agree on is that we hope our next legislative assignment is easier than this one. I think we both also agree that the sooner we act, the better, so Americans will have the benefit of lower premium costs and the peace of mind of knowing that they will be able to buy insurance for themselves and their families.  I would like to say through the Chair to Senator Murray that I asked for 10 minutes to speak, and then I asked for 10 minutes for her to follow me.

807,topic-id,847,"Mr.President, I have said repeatedly over the last several weeks that while it is important that the two of us, as the chairman and the ranking member of the HELP Committee, come to an agreement, that is not nearly enough because our real job was and is to see if we can find, among a significant number of Republicans and a significant number of Democratic Senators, a consensus that will cause this to be enacted, will cause the Senate to pass it and the House to pass it and the President to sign it. In my opinion, we wouldn't have come to an agreement ourselves unless we thought that was likely.  I will not go into the specific provisions that are in this, except to briefly summarize them. The first group of them makes the section 1332 innovation waivers work by giving more flexibility. In New Hampshire, for example, the State would like to use Medicaid savings to help pay for the cost of its Affordable Care Act waiver, and this would allow that. In Maine, for example, the State has applied for a waiver. The waiver has been approved, but the use of the funding has not been approved. This would allow that. Alaska, Oklahoma, Iowa, for example, all have waivers in line that they would like to submit to give a greater variety of choices in their States and hopefully lower premium costs, but it is too restrictive under the current conditions.  About the only sort of waiver that the current Director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can approve is the Alaska-type waiver, which is a good idea. Alaska created a reinsurance fund, which helped the very sick Alaskans, immediately lowered premiums 20 percent for all other Alaskans, and then used the savings from the lower subsidies as a result of the lower premiums to pay for 85 percent of the cost of the fund. Minnesota has tried a similar thing. Maine did that on its own a few years ago. We have streamlined the approval process for those waivers, so that can be done more easily.  I would emphasize that a number of these, while they are limited proposals, could not be done in a budget reconciliation process. They had have to be done with 60 votes.  The proposal also includes what we call a new copper plan, catastrophic insurance for all ages. We still keep the patient protections; that is, preexisting conditions, et cetera. We still keep the essential health benefits, but we allow someone who is healthy and young, for example, to pay a higher deductible and a lower premium if that is what they choose to do. We direct the Department of Health and Human Services to go ahead and write regulations to encourage interstate health insurance compacts. We compromised on the outreach funding and agreed that we will spend about twice as much as or more than President Trump wanted to expend, but we will do most of that by grants to the And of course we agree on 2 years of funding for the cost payments.  Finally, I would say that if we do not do this, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Tax Committee, and CMS, premiums next year will increase 20 percent, there will be a $194 billion increase in the Federal debt over 10 years, and up to 16 million Americans might find themselves unable to buy insurance through the individual market. In my view, this agreement avoids chaos, and I don't know a Democrat or a Republican who benefits from chaos.  I thank President Trump for his encouragement to me and to Senator Murray to try to succeed on this. I thank Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, for creating an environment in which we could get to this point. I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell--despite his focus on tax reform--for allowing us to work together and try to do this. I especially thank Senator Murray, who, whenever she sets about to get a result, I have found, she usually gets one. I could not have a better partner to work with on difficult issues in the In fact, the one thing we probably most agree on, we found the most difficult to solve; that is, in 2018, we want to make sure that the cost-sharing payments go to the benefit of consumers, not the insurance companies. I want that. Senator Murray wants that. The President wants that. My Republican colleagues want that. And I know Democrats want it. We believe we have strong language in our proposed agreement to do that, but we are going to make sure that it is the strongest possible language.  I thank the Presiding I look forward to working with Senator Murray over the next few days to see if we can find a consensus among Republicans and Democrats to present to the Senate leadership. I hope that we can then pass it, the House will pass it, and the President will sign it.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

During his time in the United States Border Patrol, he served as a canine handler and was involved in 42 seizures of narcotics and 38 separate cases involving the apprehension of 238 illegal immigrants. He was a man of honor and duty, a man who loved his family, and a man who would give his life in service to his country.  On August 3, 2014, in Raymondville, Texas, Agent Vega took his wife, three children, and parents out for a day of fishing. While fishing with his family, two illegal immigrants attempted to rob them.  These illegal immigrants had been deported multiple times for various crimes. Law enforcement believed they had conducted a string of similar robberies at the behest of a Mexican cartel.  Agent Vega sprung into action to defend his family. While drawing his firearm, Agent Vega was shot in the chest.[[Page H7901]]His father was also shot and wounded. Though his family did everything possible to help, Agent Vega, tragically, passed away.  On September 20, 2016, Border Patrol determined that Agent Vega's actions were instinctive as a result of his law enforcement training.

648,topic-id,1088,"Madam President, last week, the Trump administration took a very important step, the step to end the war on coal and the war on American energy. The Environmental Protection Agency has said that it has begun the formal process to roll back the Obama administration's so-called Clean Power This plan was a cornerstone of the Democratic efforts to destroy the reliable forms of energy that the American public continues to use today.  My goal is to make energy as clean as we can as fast as we can without raising costs on American families. The Trump administration wants exactly the same thing. The steps it announced last week will help provide greater energy security, more jobs, and a stronger economy. This is exactly what President Trump promised he would do. It is exactly what the American people voted for last  Americans said that they were tired of Washington's out-of-control regulators. President Trump took action right away. He issued an Executive order in March, telling his administration to go back and review some of President Obama's worst energy regulations. One of those was the Clean Power Plan, which tried to regulate powerplants in a way that wasn't even allowed under the Clean Air  President Trump's Executive order was the first step in correcting this bureaucratic overreach. Last week's announcement by the Environmental Protection Agency was the next step. With this move, the Agency is saying that Washington will no longer trample on the law. It tells the rest of Washington that there are limits. So I applaud President Trump and Scott Pruitt, the Administrator of the  The Agency was created because America needed to do a better job of making sure we had clean air, clean land, and clean water. There is a right way to do this job. For a long time, the Agency did its job well. We can strike and need to strike the right balance. We need to do that again so we can protect our environment while allowing our economy to grow. We can have reasonable regulations that protect Americans while also respecting the law.  My home State of Wyoming is one of the most pristine, beautiful places in the world, and it is one of the most energy-rich places in the world. Wyoming has struck this balance successfully, and so have many other We are addressing threats to our environment through the cooperation of States, towns, Indian Tribes, and Washington.[[Page S6505]]  The Environmental Protection Agency did not get the balance right with its Clean Power It overstepped its bounds to fulfill a political agenda. In 2008, when Barack Obama was running for President, he said that under his policies, ``If somebody wants to build a coal-fired power plant, they can.'' But he went on to say, ``It's just that it will bankrupt them.''  Bankrupt them. Once he got into office, he did everything he could to keep that promise and to bankrupt as many coal companies as possible. The Obama administration pushed out unnecessary, unlawful regulations on coal producers, powerplants, and their customers.  Look at the difference between the two President Obama promised to bankrupt American energy producers, and then he misused his power in order to do it. President Trump promised to promote American energy security and economic growth, and he is following the law to do that.  The law never gave the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to write its Clean Power The Agency went ahead and did it anyway. That is why States sued the Federal Government to block this destructive bureaucratic overreach. States knew--people knew that the Environmental Protection Agency had written a dangerous regulation that would shut down American powerplants and would raise energy costs for American families. Their rule would have thrown thousands of people out of work in Wyoming and in other It would have led to as much as $33 billion in compliance costs in the year 2030. That is what the Agency estimated--$33 billion in compliance costs.  Last year, the Supreme Court decided that this rule could do so much damage that the Court stopped President Obama in his tracks. Last week, the Agency recognized that there is a better way. It is going through the process to set aside the old rule and take a fresh look at what it could or should do legally. It said that any regulation of these powerplants is going to be done the way every new regulation should be done. That means listening to the people who have the most at stake, like the States and communities affected by these regulations. It is especially true in places like Wyoming, where there are already partnerships in place that could accomplish many of the goals of the new rules. It means that Washington should consider the costs as well as the benefits of regulation, and it should use reasonable estimates about both the costs and the benefits.  In 2015, the Supreme Court criticized the Obama administration for another rule that made this same mistake. The Court said that it is not ``rational, never mind appropriate, to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits.''  If Washington is going to write regulations the way they should be done, this means acting rationally, and it means following the law.  The Clean Air Act didn't give the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to write its so-called Clean Power That should have stopped the regulators right there and then. It should not have been a sign for regulators to interpret the law in a brandnew way that Congress never intended. That is what the Obama administration did anyway.  If Washington does regulations right, that means doing them in a way that provides clarity, not confusion, not more questions. It means doing what is best for America, not just what is the preference of the people writing the regulations.  We are blessed in this country with enormous natural resources. Our goal should be to use these resources responsibly, in ways that protect our environment and help to make our economy grow. We need a strong economy. That is what the American people are looking for.  Over the 8 years of the Obama administration, the leaders of the EPA created broad and legally questionable new regulations. They declared a war on coal, and a war on American energy. Under the Trump administration, the war is over, and America is back on the right track.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

563,topic-id,166,"Mr.Speaker, it was great to participate in this morning's board of delegation meeting, during which we discussed the impact of recent hurricanes on our State and unmet needs to require further attention.  With the onslaught of natural disasters that have plagued our country in recent months, we must provide appropriate levels of Federal support to all who are suffering. However, we must also ensure that Florida's ongoing needs are not overlooked as we seek to fully recover.  Our two largest industries, tourism and agriculture, have sustained significant losses, which will have a long-term impact on our economy, unfortunately. We also learned valuable lessons during the hurricane as it relates to the care for our most vulnerable citizens, our seniors and the disabled. These lessons need to translate to action in order to prevent future tragedies.  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we evaluate the proposed natural disaster funding bill that will be voted on later this week and determine its impact on                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7928-2.txt,1838,TRIBUTE TO DAN KNUTSON,2017.0,11.0,October

478,topic-id,295,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of 585, the Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.  This bill addresses problems that were exposed in the tragic case of whistleblower retaliation at the Department of Veterans  Chris Kirkpatrick was a doctor employed on a probationary basis by[[Page H8000]]Veterans Affairs, who committed suicide hours after he was fired for questioning overmedication of the veterans he cared for.  This bill would, for the first time, create minimum disciplinary standards to require that managers who retaliate against whistleblowers are punished. First offenders would receive at least 3 days of suspension, and repeat offenders would face mandatory termination.  The Kirkpatrick Act also adds whistleblower protections to Federal employees hired on a probationary basis, like Agencies will be required to grant priority to requests for transfer from probationary period whistleblowers.  The bill would create a number of other whistleblower protections, many of which are overdue. For example, accessing the medical file of a whistleblower for the purpose of retaliation would be declared a prohibited personnel action. The Department of Veterans Affairs would also be required to devise a plan to prevent that sort of unauthorized medical file access.  The bill also requires apparent suicides by whistleblowers to be referred to the Office of Special Counsel for further investigation. Agencies would be required to initiate training programs for supervisors and information disclosures for employees regarding whistleblower protection.  The Senate passed this bill by voice vote earlier this year, and passage through the House would send the bill to the President's desk for signature and enactment.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to honor the memory of Chris Kirkpatrick and to protect future whistleblowers.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

496,topic-id,662,"Mr.Speaker, 3 years ago, the Obama administration took a very positive and important step towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions by initiating the Clean Power Plan, the first-ever national limit on carbon pollution from power plants. The plan was devised to give States the option to tailor how they would reduce carbon pollution, following benchmarks set by the Federal  For years, States, local governments, businesses, and universities have been making progress towards a low-carbon future, both in anticipation of full implementation of the Clean Power Plan and spurred on by a variety of other forces. Now, the Trump administration has vowed to unravel the Clean Power Plan, but the momentum will not stop because of this reckless act.  Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt cannot repeal engineering, science, or economics. Their attempts would only harm the economy and our citizens, miring us in the past to serve the interests of Big  The case for action in reducing carbon pollution is compelling. The Clean Power Plan encourages steps to reduce the dangerous extent of accelerating climate disruption and attendant extreme weather events.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria are only the latest example of those events. Now, millions of acres in the West are exploding in wildfires. More frequent, more intense, and more dangerous forest fires are the reality now, spurred by climate disruption.  Out-of-control wildfire has touched Oregon's beloved Columbia River Gorge, and the latest instances are in California wine country, taking lives, destroying property, and damaging crops.  Regardless of your view on climate change, the Clean Power Plan is a very important step for the United It stands on firm legal ground. The Supreme Court has ruled on three separate occasions that the EPA has the authority and the responsibility to protect our families from carbon pollution.  Cleaner energy and a cleaner environment under the Clean Power Plan would improve the lives of working By 2030, it would prevent 90,000 asthma attacks, 300,000 days missed from work and school, and 3,600 premature deaths every year.  Instead of protecting human health, particularly those in communities most impacted by carbon pollution, Trump and Pruitt are seeking to tilt the energy playing field back in favor of Big  Make no mistake: without subsidies and regulatory favoritism, most old, dirty, coal plants would have been shut down years ago if they had been required to meet carbon pollution and air quality standards, as they should have been.  Trump and Pruitt are making a big mistake when they assault the Clean Air Act and the Clean Power They are on weak legal ground, and they are on the wrong side of science, economics, the environment, and common sense.  The Clean Power Plan will not be easily unraveled. There is a process to unwind it, similar to what it took to put it in place. It will take a lot of hard work--and evidence that Pruitt doesn't have--to repeal it and prevent the EPA from regulating carbon emissions.  The plan has powerful allies. I am proud to stand with the environmental community, my fellow Democrats in Congress, many government and trade groups, citizens who care, and a number of businesses. Mars is the latest company to announce that they are going to follow through on their carbon reduction plan.  We will continue this fight for a low-carbon, healthier, more economical future. We will protect alternative energy and honor the commitments we have made to the wind and solar industries. We will continue to reduce emissions from our transportation sector by not rolling back fuel efficiency standards.  We will work with the agriculture sector, which makes up 9 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions. A strong farm bill can reduce emissions and enhance productivity through low-carbon protections.  Ultimately, Trump and Pruitt cannot repeal science, engineering, or economics. I am proud to be part of this effort to ensure that the United States moves forward to exercise leadership in a low-carbon future to fight climate change and global weather disruption.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7922.txt,99,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,11.0,October
571,topic-id,922,"Mr.Speaker, Dana Milbank had an interesting column in the morning Post about the feckless congressional response to the opioid crisis. Both the administration and Congress have been good at hyping the crisis, but when it comes time to actually taking action, almost nothing happens.  The failure to protect our citizens is appalling, especially since most of the opioid crisis is a result of failed public policies. We have spent over $1 trillion on a failed war on drugs that concentrates on prohibition and punishment instead of treatment, which would help people break the cycle of addiction.  The challenges that drove people to abuse opioids in the first place, like chronic pain, depression, and lax policies prescribing vast quantities of ever-more powerful opioids, should never have been allowed to happen in the first place. It was a public policy failure of government, the industry, and, sadly, some unscrupulous practitioners that allowed the addiction genie out of the bottle.  When denied access to opioids, people, understandably, turn to heroin and other damaging and addictive drugs because they were trapped by these powerful forces. Few people willingly damage their bodies and destroy their families and careers, if not for powerful forces beyond their control.  As appalling as this failure is, what is even worse is that we fail to take reasonable, commonsense steps to stop it. The easiest solution is to provide more access to medical marijuana, already available in 28 This availability, by the way, has been driven as a result of citizen action and not politicians, who have too often been afraid to touch it.  The evidence is powerful and overwhelming. Where there is access to medical marijuana to treat the problems that drove people on the path to addiction in the first place, there are fewer pills prescribed and overdose deaths drop.  It is clear that using medical marijuana is as effective, or perhaps even more effective, than opioids to treat pain. They cause less damage to people's health and are far less costly than pharmaceuticals. I provided the subcommittee taking testimony with the facts and citations that would justify digging deep into this potential solution.  Cannabis reduces overdose deaths, reduces opioid consumption, and it can prevent dose escalation and the development of opioid tolerance, which leads to that cycle, and too often, tragically, opioid deaths: 175 people a day.  As my friend, Greg Walden, pointed out in the subcommittee hearing yesterday, more people die in Oregon from opioid overdose than traffic accidents.  More benefits, fewer side effects, lower costs.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the evidence I gave to the Subcommittee on Health yesterday.         Physician Guide to Cannabis-Assisted Opioid Reduction                (Prepared by Adrianne Wilson-Poe, Ph.D.)       Cannabis reduces opioid overdose mortality.       In states with medicinal cannabis laws, opioid overdoses      drop by an average of 25%.[[Page H7978]]     This effect gets bigger the longer the law has been in place.      For instance, there is a 33% drop in mortality in California,      where compassionate use has been in place since 1996.       This finding was replicated by Columbia's school of public      health, using a completely different analysis strategy.       Cannabis reduces opioid consumption.       Cannabis is opioid-sparing in chronic pain patients. When      patients are given access to cannabis, they drop their opioid      use by roughly 50%. This finding has been replicated several      times from Ann Arbor to       This opioid sparing effect is accompanied by an enhancement      of cognitive function once patients begin cannabis therapy:      this effect is most likely due to the fact that patients      reduce their opioid use.       Cannabis use is associated with a reduction in not only      opioid consumption, but also many other drugs including      benzodiazepines, which also have a high incidence of fatal      overdose. In states with medicinal cannabis laws, the number      of prescriptions for analgesic and anxiolytic drugs (among      others) are substantially reduced. Medicare and Medicaid      prescription costs are substantially lower in states with      cannabis laws.       Cannabis can prevent dose escalation and the development of      opioid tolerance.       Cannabinoids and opioids have acute analgesic synergy. When      opioids and cannabinoids are coadministered, they produce      greater than additive analgesia. This suggests that analgesic      dose of opioids is substantially lower for patients using      cannabis therapy.       In chronic pain patients on opioid therapy, cannabis does      not affect pharmacokinetics of opioids, yet it still enhances      analgesia. This finding further supports a synergistic      mechanism of action.       Pre-clinical models indicate that cannabinoids attenuate      the development of opioid tolerance.       Cannabis, alone or in combination with opioids, could be a      viable first-line analgesic.       The CDC has updated its recommendations in the spring of      2016, stating that most cases of chronic pain should be      treated with non-opioids.       The National Academies of Science and Medicine recently      conducted an exhaustive review of 10,000+ human studies      published since 1999, definitively concluding that cannabis      itself (not a specific cannabinoid or cannabis-derived      molecule) is safe and effective for the treatment of chronic      pain.       When 3,000 chronic pain patients were surveyed, they      overwhelmingly preferred cannabis as an opioid alternative.       97% ``strongly agreed/agreed'' that they could decrease      their opioid use when using cannabis.       92% ``strongly agreed/agreed'' that they prefer cannabis to      treat their medical condition.       81% ``strongly agreed/ agreed'' that cannabis by itself was      more effective than taking opioids.       Cannabis may be a viable tool in medication-assisted      relapse prevention.       CBD is non-intoxicating, and is the 2nd most abundant      cannabinoid found in cannabis. CBD alleviates the anxiety      that leads to drug craving. In human pilot studies, CBD      administration is sufficient to prevent heroin craving for at      least 7 days.       Cannabis users are more likely to adhere to naltrexone      maintenance for opioid dependence.

572,topic-id,234,"There is a reason that up to 90 percent of the American public favors greater access to medical marijuana. Last year, voters in Florida approved their program by over 70 percent.  Mr.Speaker, the Federal Government continues to interfere, threatening medical marijuana programs, which requires Congress to step in to shield it, as we have done last year and for the previous 2 years. Unfortunately, the Rules Committee denied us a chance to vote on it.  Last Congress, both Houses approved measures for VA doctors to be able to consult with veterans who have a serious overdose problem. Despite passing both Chambers, it was stripped out and the Rules Committee failed to allow us to vote on this as well.  Most tragically, Congress continues to allow the Federal Government to have a stranglehold on research to be conducted to be able to definitely answer these questions.  I strongly urge my colleagues to join my friend, Andy Harris, and me on our research bill, H.3391. There is no reason that the Federal Government denies research to be able to definitively answer these questions.  I am tired of looking at the opioid damage in my State and around the country, and have Congress propose Band-aids when there is a simple, commonsense, widely accepted, and popular approach: allow people access to medical marijuana.

117,topic-id,1433,"Mr.President, let me first agree with the point that the Senator from South Carolina just made about the importance of passing a tax bill this year. He made the point--and if he didn't, I will make it--that if we don't pass a tax bill this year or at least get most of the way there--I hope we get done with this tax process this year. If we don't get that done, I think we won't have another opportunity to pass a tax bill in the next 4 years.  On the other hand, if we do pass a tax bill this year, we will have the incentive to take a second look in 2019, maybe 2020, but probably in 2019. The point I am making is, we don't have to do everything that could possibly be done to improve the Tax Code this year to take an important step. But if we don't take that important step, my belief is we are likely not going to have the kind of tax relief that working families need in the next 4 years. So not only is the pressure on the Republican Senate, the Republican House, and a White House that wants to work with us to get this done, but the pressure should be on everyone who cares about hard-working families. And the pressure should be on everyone who wants to see tax relief for those families happen. We need to understand that it needs to happen now.  Fights that can't be won in the next few weeks can be won in this Presidential term but only if we take this step successfully right now. As the Senator from South Carolina and others have pointed out, this is an important two-step process.  The first step is a budget that allows us to move forward so that we can do this under the budget rules and allow 51 Senators to pass a bill on tax reform. By the way, they don't have to be 51 I suspect that is what will happen, but once we get to 51 Republicans, I would love to see Democrats join us. I would love to see them join us before that.  This is the kind of help that hard-working families need--families who, for 9 years, were stuck in a situation where their buying power wasn't increasing, their job opportunities weren't increasing. They generally were not seeing that better job out there that was largely available to those very same hard-working families in the past because we aren't as competitive as we need to be.  There ought to be a couple of things we focus on. One is, how do you create tax relief for working families right now so that, as soon as possible, they begin to see a check that has more take-home pay? The other way to increase take-home pay is to increase starting pay, to make those jobs better. That is where we need to be looking on the other end of the spectrum.  On the end that creates jobs, what do we need to do to make ourselves more competitive? What do we need to do to constantly have the kind of pressure on the working job market that allows people who are working hard for a living to have better opportunities than they would have otherwise because we are more competitive than we would be otherwise?  I think the entire focus of this discussion should be, what do we do that improves the opportunities and improves the future for hard-working families? You can do that with a tax cut right now, which we should do. You can do that with policies that make more sense as we try to compete with the people we compete with around the world.  You can't have the highest corporate tax in the entire world and assume you are going to be the most competitive country in the entire world. You can't have a tax system that is uniquely different as it relates to products you sell overseas and expect to be more competitive than the countries who don't have that unique system, which penalizes rather than encourages American products to be sold in other places.  The Senate will vote later today on a budget resolution that reduces Federal spending by $5 trillion over 10 years, provides a stronger foundation for economic growth, and allows us to move forward in the first, necessary legislative step in the Senate so that we can then move immediately to tax policy. This is a budget that will allow us to reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, a budget that would put more money in the pockets of hard-working families, a budget that would add some opportunity to that struggle where, for almost a decade now, things haven't seemed to be getting better or easier. They seemed to be getting more difficult because we were less competitive and there was less pressure to find the workforce to do the jobs that need to be done. And then this is a tax code that will make it simpler and fairer and more uniformly impactful on everyone who pays taxes.  Most people don't mind paying taxes on the income they have until they find out that their neighbor next door with the same income has figured out how not to pay taxes. There is a reason American families and American businesses can't get through April without a bottle of aspirin. There is a reason this Tax Code creates headache after headache.  There is one estimate that individuals and businesses complying with the complicated tax system we have costs $267 billion a year. That is half of the defense budget. If people are spending half of the defense budget just to comply with the Tax Code, there has to be something wrong with that, and we can do better. I think the proposals we are talking about will do a better job.  Right now, the individual Tax Code has seven different brackets--seven rates--and you have to figure out how they apply to whatever income you have had. It has 100 different credits, deductions, exclusions, and other provisions that make it extremely difficult to know what you owe or when you are going to owe what you owe.  According to the American Action Forum, the IRS currently imposes 8.1 billion hours of paperwork on Americans, which amounts to about 54 hours per taxpayer who is paying taxes. It is more for some, less for some, but a week's worth of work--54 hours of work--for taxpayers who pay their taxes. Every taxpayer gives that week to the Federal  We are streamlining the Tax Code, increasing the basic deduction that families can have. If they don't want to go through the complicated Tax Code--here is how many of us there are who live at our house. Here is the basic deduction we get for each of those people living at our house. Here is how much we subtract from the money we make. Here is how much we need to pay.  There is no reason that one of the compliance options can't be a postcard or a piece of paper. In fact, when the current income tax was imposed on the American people, the entire set of instructions were on one page--the entire set of instructions for everyone who had to fill out the income tax form--with the assurance that only the richest people would ever pay any income tax, so most Americans would never have had to read that instruction sheet at all.  Now most Americans find it almost impossible to read the 100 pages of instructions that just get them to the Tax Code itself. Streamlining the Tax Code, helping families keep more of their money, figuring out a way we can be more competitive so there is opportunity for better jobs in the future, all should be important priorities for this  Passing a budget today will allow us to take the first step, which then allows us to take the next step in tax relief that matters and makes sense to the American people. We will take that step today. We should take that step today.  We should then follow up as quickly as possible to win the fights that can be won this year so Americans can start next year understanding that their Tax Code is simpler, the Tax Code is fairer, and their opportunities are[[Page S6602]]likely to be greater. But for hard-working families, their take-home pay will definitely be higher than it is today.  I yield the floor.

KCOM was founded by Andrew Taylor Still, whose novel methods of treating patients gave birth to the field of osteopathy. The school's first class included 21 students, five of whom were women. The school and medical practice quickly became a success, providing more than 30,000 osteopathic treatments in 1895.  According to the American Osteopathic Association, osteopathic medicine is one of the fastest growing specialties in U.healthcare. In fact, the number of doctors of osteopathic medicine has increased 276 percent since 1986. Importantly, more than half of all active doctors of osteopathic practice in primary care specialties, and many of these choose to practice in community-based settings. Students trained by KCOM are uniquely situated to impact communities lacking medical resources, whether they be rural or urban.  The focus of the KCOM administration and faculty on community outreach and underserved populations is to be commended. They partner with community health centers around the State to provide services to the most vulnerable individuals and instill a spirit of service in their students. Unique programs such as these that further education and support community health are of great benefit to the people of Missouri and serve as an example to others.  Today KCOM continues to make strides in whole person healthcare and works to be a leader in health professions education. I extend my sincere thanks for all they do. Congratulations to A.Still University president Craig Phelps, A.Still University-Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine dean Margaret Wilson, faculty, and all former and current students on this important occasion.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-17-pt1-PgS6448-2.txt,1464,1900,2017.0,17.0,October

It serves 1,000 youth each year in Sebastian, Crawford, Franklin, Logan, Scott, Polk, and Montgomery CJS is supported by and receives guidance from community leaders as it seeks to help children and youth who are susceptible to delinquency or have encountered legal problems and need positive influences to help get back on track toward a happy and successful adolescence.  CJS provides support to these children and their families in a variety of ways. It employs caseworkers to assess a youth's individual problems and develop case plans, provides aftercare to those in custody of the Department of Youth Services, offers one-on-one mentoring opportunities, operates an emergency shelter for at-risk youth, and features other programs including treatment for major behavioral problems, mental health assessments, and therapy and parenting classes.  The commitment that CJS has demonstrated for youth in western Arkansas is inspiring. The men and women of the agency put their hearts and souls into helping children and teens improve their situations and strive for better outcomes at home, at school, and in life generally. In one of many success stories, a former client named Sherry went through a difficult adoption where she experienced major conflict with her adopted family. Through the help of Community Juvenile Services, Sherry completed a program at the Girls Shelter of Fort Smith and is now a Department of Child and Family Services caseworker herself, advocating for children and helping to make a difference in their lives the same way that CJS did in hers.  I am so proud of the work that Comprehensive Juvenile Services has done over the past 40 years. They truly are changing lives, one child at a time. I want to congratulate everyone involved with CJS on a job well done, and I look forward to hearing many more success stories in the years to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-16-pt1-PgS6398.txt,1687,1900,2017.0,16.0,October

Unfortunately, my State, in some ways, leads the way. Four thousand Ohioans died from drug overdoses last year, more than any State in the United Four thousand families lost a mother, a father, a daughter, a son, a sister, or brother.  We need to treat this epidemic like the public health emergency it is. We asked the President to proclaim it a public health emergency. He talked about it but still hasn't done it.  That is the same reason I can't support Representative Tom Marino's nomination to head our country's drug control policy. First of all, fundamentally, I don't want an elected official, a politician, in that position. I want somebody from the treatment community. Congressman Marino is a nominee who, in his time in Congress, showed he was too cozy with the drug companies that helped create this epidemic.  Earlier today, President Trump responded to reports about Congressman Marino and said he is looking at those reports very closely. I hope he does. I hope he withdraws that nomination. Make no mistake, Congressman Marino does not want to take us in the right direction in this fight.

Thelonious Sphere Monk was the second of three children born to Thelonious, Sr., and Barbara Monk on October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, North Though Monk and his family left Rocky Mount for New York City when Thelonious was a child, scholars and fellow musicians say Monk's North Carolina roots had an important influence on the man and his music.  Writer Sam Stephenson credited Thelonious Monk's Carolina roots in the ``Oxford American,'' writing that Rocky Mount's flourishing tobacco culture and rail yard was one of the largest in all of the South the year Monk was born.

By the time he was 13 years old, he had won the weekly amateur competition at the Apollo Theater so many times that management banned him from reentering the contest there in  In 1941, Monk began working at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, where he joined the house band and helped develop the school of jazz known as bebop.  Alongside fellow jazz greats Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Eubie Blake, and Ruble Blakey, Monk honed his fast and often improvised style that would later become synonymous with modern jazz.  Thelonious Monk's first known recording was made in 1944, when he worked as a member of the Coleman Hawkins Monk did not record under his own name, however, until 1947, when he played as the leader of a sextet session for Blue  In 1947, he married Nellie Smith, his longtime sweetheart.

In 1956, Mr.Speaker, Monk released his third album, ``Brilliant Corners,'' which is considered by many to be his first true masterpiece.  In 1957, the Thelonious Monk Quartet, which included John Coltrane, began performing regularly, with tours across the United States and  By 1964, Monk was popular with the mainstream audience and became one of the four jazz musicians ever to grace the cover of Time magazine.  The years that followed included several overseas tours, but by the early 1970s, Monk was ready to give it up. He was ready to retire from the limelight. After battling illnesses for several years, Monk passed away from a stroke in 1982.  Finally, Thelonious Monk, Mr.Speaker, has since been inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame, added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry, awarded a Pulitzer Prize, and featured on a United States postage stamp.

704,topic-id,1370,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this evening to talk about amendment 1141, which would raise a point of order against any provision that would strike State and local tax deductions.  As we talk tonight about how our country moves forward economically and as we talk about what are the best ways to have tax fairness in America, I guarantee you, my constituents want to make sure they continue to be able to deduct their sales tax, their mortgage deductions, and there are important policies that other States have for tax deductions.  The State of Washington has been a leader--and I would match our State,[[Page S6531]]as it relates to our tax code and efficiency, with just about any other For a long time, Washington and Oregon have had the most unique tax codes in the United States of Yet our economies have grown faster than the national average every year since World War So we are doing something right. So the fact that we don't have an income tax in Washington State and the fact that Washingtonians, for many years, have been able to deduct our sales tax from our Federal tax obligations for income is something we are not interested in losing. What we are interested in is a fair debate about our Tax Code, an open process, and important discussion points of order if anybody tries to strip from us these very important tools.  State and local tax deductions have been an important way in which our taxpayers make sure they are treated fairly. For us in Washington, as I said, many of our citizens use these itemized deductions because of the fact that we don't have an income tax and we are able to deduct our sales tax from our Federal tax obligations. In fact, 30 percent of Washington resident taxpayers--1.1 million--itemize their taxes and claim an average State and local tax deduction of $7,402. These deductions put an average of $600 back into the pockets of Washingtonians each year. So any attempt by legislation to try to erode that--particularly at a time when we also get a deduction on our property taxes as well--is something critically important to our  If legislation continues to move forward that repeals these deductions--I know our colleagues think they are doing good work by trying to simplify the Tax In fact, they are saying: We are going to increase the standard deduction as a way to simplify the Tax But for my Washington residents--and, my guess is, for many other States that are in the same boat that don't have an income tax--you literally are going to penalize them and the efficiency of their tax code, which is so important.  For example, 40 percent of tax filers who make between $50,000 and $75,000 claim this deduction, and 53 percent of taxpayers who make between $75,000 and $100,000 claim this deduction. So when my colleagues talk about doubling the deduction from $6,000 to $12,000 or from $12,000 to $24,000 for families, I am sure they would like us to believe that somehow is going to make the residents of Washington State and our taxpayers whole. That is not the case. On average, Washingtonians in those brackets could actually end up paying more. Why? Well, first of all, we should realize that there are over 250,000 Washingtonians--that is the estimate--who make more, in a joint filing, than $150,000. So right there, these Washingtonians would be in a situation where, under this tax proposal, they would be paying more than they are currently paying because they are not allowed to itemize and they are not allowed to deduct. I don't want to raise taxes on In tight economic times, I don't want to see them continue to see these deductions eliminated and have their tax bills go up.  Washingtonians work very hard at trying to make and keep the efficiency. I know there are other States--such as Texas, Alaska, and Florida--that also don't have an income tax. I know those States are probably struggling with the same policies and want to make sure they are making the same kinds of efficiencies. What we don't want is the current Republican proposal to raise taxes on working families in Washington We want to make sure these families continue to see the deductions they have had in the past.  So how would this work exactly in Washington? Well, one of the things we are concerned about is the impact on the housing market. Without the deduction for property--we do not want to see an increase in the price of housing and fewer people being able to afford home ownership because they are no longer able to take this deduction. That would be something of grave concern to Washington residents.  Also, we want to make sure that we continue to have these deductions for both singles and families of four, who would be impacted by this.  For example, an average individual taxpayer making between $50,000 and $100,000 has an average total deduction of about $22,000. So this taxpayer would not benefit from increasing the standard deduction to $12,000. The difference is that they now get $22,000 in their itemized deductions, and under this proposal, they would only be able to deduct $12,000 of that. Take a family who is making over $100,000. As I said, we have 250,000 filers in our State who make between $150,000 and $200,000. This income bracket on average claims a deduction of $30,000 from various State, local, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and medical expenses. This family also would not benefit from increasing the standard deduction to $24,000. As I said, they are already deducting about $30,000.  Literally, we are raising taxes on thousands and I would say probably hundreds of thousands of Washington residents. That is why I am offering this amendment. I want us to have a point of order and true discussion about any policy that would raise taxes on my residents in Washington We have to have a tax discussion that is about a fair and open process, a continued dialogue about how to make sure that working families get a fair deal in a tax policy. But one policy that is jammed into a budget proposal and that then comes back to us for 51 votes, that literally eliminates our ability to itemize and deduct and gets rid of our sales deductions that we have fought so hard for, that we are so proud of as it relates to the individuality of how our State operates--we should not, with just 51 votes, cast a vote increasing the taxes on thousands and thousands of Washingtonians and, I would say, on many other States in our  I hope our colleagues will take a close look at this. I hope they will help us in trying to make a point. Let's not rush through a policy when we don't know what the impacts are. Let's get specific about what the impacts are and recognize that some of our States are the most ingenious as it relates to delivering great services at lower costs.  I know some of my colleagues would like to say: There are these big States in the East, and here is how they operate. Here is what they do in collecting various forms of revenue. Well, this Western State operates with a great deal of efficiency. Our residents have come to expect these sales tax deductions and these mortgage deductions, and they want to keep them. They do not want to hear that there is a sleight of hand at the eleventh hour, not by a broad debate but a tactic that would jam them into a reconciliation bill because of instructions and thereby have these thousands of dollars of tax increases foisted on them.  I hope my colleagues will join me in this very important point of order that we will be offering in this amendment. Let's have this discussion in broad daylight and not penalize innovative States that have different tax codes but have grown faster than the national average and continue to do so. Let's make sure that we have tax fairness for all residents of our country.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

816,topic-id,1339,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to speak against the budget resolution's containment of language that might direct our colleagues in the future to open up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his leadership on this issue and for being on the Senate floor tonight to talk about how important it is that we continue to maintain this Wildlife Refuge as it exists.  Our public lands have been under assault from this administration. It comes in all forms. It certainly comes in the form of trying to use the Antiquities Act in reverse and, basically, to say: You can open up public lands for drilling.  This really caused a controversy in Utah with the Bears Ears National There are Tribes, sportsmen, fishermen, and hunters who value the public lands in this national monument and who don't want to see it turned over to companies or individuals who want to mine or drill for oil and gas to the detriment of the monument resources. Now the budget resolution will allow for a ``for sale'' sign on[[Page S6445]]some of our public lands to give a tax break to millionaires.  It is not that this is the only issue. As I said, there is the notion that the administration is taking our public lands and trying to turn them over to be developed, the notion that they are giving land to coal companies so they can harvest coal off of Federal lands and then not charging them a royalty rate which is compensatory and fair to the American public. We tried to fix that. Obviously, this Secretary of the Interior is trying to roll that back and give coal companies a sweetheart deal.  Now we have an EPA Administrator who, basically, has had a mining company CEO walk into his office and say: By the way, we want to develop a mine at the headwaters of Bristol Bay in Alaska, home of the largest salmon run and probably responsible for 50 percent of sockeye salmon around the world. Immediately after the mining executive left the EPA Administrator's office, the EPA Administrator sent out a letter saying: Let's toss aside Clean Water Act safeguards to protect Bristol Bay, move forward on this idea of allowing the mine application to proceed.  So much for due process, so much for preserving what has taken the American public more than a hundred years to put together so that the public can recreate on public lands--so, yes, hunting, fishing, Native American, and recreational communities are all upset.  What is the latest play? Let's stick in the budget resolution language providing for the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development--something that has been so precious to the United States of America--basically a Serengeti for wildlife, an intact arctic ecosystem that doesn't exist in other places in the United Yet people are trying what I call a sneak attack, just like they did 12 years ago, just as people tried to open up the Arctic refuge for development before and on its own merits couldn't get it enacted into law. They put it in the Defense appropriation bill, thinking that there is no way people could vote against money for the troops--that is how we can get the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge open for mineral development.  But it didn't work then, and it is not going to work now. The American people are not for legislative sneak attacks, backdoor ways to move legislation that could never pass on its own merits. I know the President wants to get a big budget package together, get healthcare in there, throw in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling, hope that people can't vote no, and move forward. I would say, if this is such a wonderful idea, let it stand on its own merits.  This area, as we can see, is a very pristine part of the United And now some people are saying: Oh, well, we could do some sort of drilling. Why do you want to have drilling in a pristine wildlife refuge? When people say: Oh, well, there are refuges that have had drilling--if that was prior to it being declared a refuge, yes, but this is a pristine area that we decided to set aside. Why? Because, as I mentioned, it is a Serengeti, it is an arctic Serengeti of caribou and other wildlife, over 200 different species of birds that come to the area, to say nothing about the population of polar bears in the region. Why do we want to destroy this? It is not that we are somehow thinking that we are going to get oil reserves out of it for our In fact, the issue is really, with the price of oil and the oil export market that has now been created, oil produced here is going on to the larger world market. So why is it that we think this is going to help us in the United States?  People are trying to use a budget process to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion to pay for tax cuts for wealthy people. They are willing to degrade the environment as a way to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. I don't agree to it. I don't think the American people agree to it. They know that this iconic wildlife refuge has been attacked many times. They know that every time, someone has had to come up with some backdoor way of trying to get the refuge opened. I think my colleagues should understand and take note that these have all failed. They failed in the past because this idea is not the brightest, most brilliant idea in It is not the thing that is going to turn the U.economy around. It is not the thing that is going to help us get tax reform. It is not an idea that is even going to help us with the bipartisan effort to move forward on an energy package. If you think about it, we passed an energy bill out of here last Congress with 85 votes. If this was something that could be done in that package, it would have been done in that package.  I know that we are going to have more oil and gas exploration in I know there is going to be more exploration in many parts of the There is going to be a rush of Arctic nations to look at oil drilling off of our coast and in the Arctic The United States should get ready and participate in those discussions. I am first in line to say that we need a fleet of icebreakers to be prepared and be ready for the advent and the change in the There will be many discussions about where responsible drilling should take place. I guarantee you, even if you opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it would not stop this debate about more drilling in  Let's remember that we set aside this pristine area for a very specific purpose: to keep the uniqueness that has existed in this part of the world--just a very small piece of it. Continue to have the debate in other parts of Alaska and in the Arctic about what the development of oil resources are going to be.  I encourage my colleagues not to fall prey to another backdoor attempt at trying to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Don't fall for a cynical bill where somehow somebody is going to try to cram everything in it and say: You can't vote against it because it has too many things for your Let's do the work that it takes to do bipartisan work--work together, agree on the things that we can agree on, and move forward.

662,topic-id,1297,"Mr.President, I am very pleased to be here on the floor of the U.Senate with my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, who just talked a lot about some of the details but also some of the results of the tax reform that we are talking about. Also, I was very inspired to hear Senator Scott from South Carolina talk about how he believes--and I believe--that tax reform for someone like his mother, who was a nursing assistant raising two boys as a single mom, will have great impact on her. We all have a story to tell, and that is why I think this tax reform bill that we are talking about will be, can be, and should be very impactful for everyone across this great land.  My colleagues and I have talked a lot about this over the last several weeks because it really presents an incredible opportunity for us to make a difference for every American family, every American business, and individuals from all walks of life.  Just last week, when I was home in West Virginia, I had a small business roundtable. I hosted about seven or eight owners of small businesses, and we sat down to talk about tax reform and what kinds of impacts this would have on them, their businesses, and the people they employ. It didn't take long[[Page S6518]]because the first question I asked, right off the bat, was: What does tax reform mean to you? Well, they didn't say ``Tax breaks for the wealthy'' because that is not what they believe and that is not what I believe.  We had a woman who has a family-owned business. She employs six people as a highly technical, small manufacturer. She said that what tax relief means to her and her small business is that after she trains people--it takes a year and a half to train--a lot of them will leave and go to a bigger company because they are searching for a higher wage. She said: What I am going to be able to do is reward the good workers in my business and raise their wages so they will stay.  I almost closed my book and left. I said: Well, do I need to hear anything more? These are the impacts, I think, tax reform will have on small businesses.  I had another person there who employs 36 people in a communications company. What does tax reform mean to you? She said: Well, I have two locations. I have 36 people evenly split between the two locations. But in communications you really have to modernize your IT for graphics and be able to do the best communications and advertising you can do. That is expensive. It is really expensive. She said: What tax reform means to me is, I am going to be able to modernize my infrastructure, my IT, my software, and still keep the 36 people who work for me. And she said: I am looking next year to hire another six, and this gives me the certainty to be able to do that.  Well, I almost closed my book up and left then. What does that mean? That means more investments. Somebody is selling that software. Somebody is creating that software--hopefully, in this country--and somebody is going to be the beneficiary of that increased investment in a small business.  I heard about raising wages. I heard about what economic growth will do to a small business in a small I heard Senator Hoeven say 96 percent of business in North Dakota is small business, and 95 percent of business in West Virginia is small business.  So these efforts will be about transforming our economy. For too long, we have been living with a stagnant economy, with too few opportunities, and with people feeling like they just can't get ahead. Rural America has really felt this, and many of the communities in my State and around the country have felt these effects of this stagnation, this lack of confidence, this feeling that you can't get ahead. You are not ready to spend the money.  1, you don't have it because you are paying too high taxes. 2, you don't want to spend it because you don't have the confidence that the economy is going to move. That is what this is about today. We have a chance to transform this and create opportunities, reform our Tax Code, and deliver pro-growth legislative solutions. We haven't done this for decades. It is way past time to make a real difference and make a system that is more transparent, a system that is simple.  Something I don't think we talk about enough is tax simplification. How welcome that would be to probably everybody seated in the Gallery here today, and millions across the country, when they look at the time and effort and money they spend to prepare a complicated tax return, when tax simplification would free them from a lot of that burden.  Most of all, we want a system that is fair and the kind of system that rewards hard-working families and puts more money in the pockets of those who earn it. You think, what would you do with it. I think everybody could come up with something they could do. They might want to save for retirement. They might want to go on vacation. They might need to do repairs for their home. They might want to buy a new pair of shoes for their child or a new car. There are all kinds of ways that people are holding back because they don't have the confidence. If they have that money in their pocket, then the confidence will be there in the future, and they are going to invest. They will invest in their lives, their families, their homes, their businesses.  Before we can move forward, we must pass this budget. This budget resolution before us today reins in Federal spending and provides new prospects for our businesses and our families. It paves the way for a tax code overhaul and creates a pathway to greater prosperity. I heard the Senator from Texas saying we would love to have a bipartisan tax reform measure in front of us. When we all see what the results of this are going to be, we should be able to join together, but we need this budget resolution to make sure that what we have talked about for more than several months and a year is going to come to fruition.  A vote for this budget is a vote to provide tax relief for hard-working, middle-income It is a vote to lower taxes on families with children. It is a vote to incentivize companies to invest domestically and create jobs in this country. That is what they tell us they want to do. I believe they know an investment in this country with their capital and their people is a much more solid investment for their company's future than any investment outside of this country.  It is very hard to think that any of my Senate colleagues, Republican or Democratic, would not want to support these goals. So passing this resolution creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our Tax Code in a way that will move our economy forward. Our country will move forward.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the budget and to begin the process of delivering tax reform that will help so many people in my State of West Virginia and across this country. We cannot let this opportunity slip by. I am going to do my best to make sure it doesn't. Thank you.  I yield back.

This ship could not have a better namesake than Woody Woody's life is the embodiment of what it means to serve this country, both in his military service during World War II, and his service to veterans and Gold Star families in his civilian life. Corporal Williams' actions on Iwo Jima are the definition of heroism. He went forward alone, facing deadly machinegun fire from entrenched Japanese positions and fought bravely for 4 hours, taking out enemy positions one by one. His actions were crucial to his regiment's success on Iwo Jima, wiping out a heavily defended Japanese position.  In addition to Woody's wartime heroism, for which he received the Congressional Medal of Honor, he also has devoted his life to servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Through the Hershel Woody Williams Medal of Honor Foundation, he honors Gold Star families who have lost loved ones that bravely sacrificed their lives in defense of our freedom by seeking to establish Gold Star Families Memorial Monuments in all 50 His foundation also offers scholarships to Gold Star children and sponsors outreach programs that educate communities about Gold Star families and the sacrifice that they have made.

649,topic-id,2344,"Madam President, we are now debating the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018. The main reason this budget resolution is before us is to allow for floor consideration of tax reform. So I want to talk a little bit about what I hope will be our guiding principles on the way we would proceed on tax reform, because tax reform is needed in this country.  Our Tax Code is overly complex. There are significant problems, particularly as we harmonize with the international community. There are things we need to do in our Tax Code to make it a fairer tax code, to make it a simpler tax code, to raise the revenues we need to make sure we don't have deficits.  There are things we need to do. I hope that we will have three guiding principles, and I will talk about these three and how the budget resolution that came out of committee would violate each of these principles and why I cannot support it as it has been presented by the committee.  First, we should have an open process on tax reform. The last time we did comprehensive tax reform, in 1986, it took well over a year for us to be able to complete the work. We had numerous committee hearings. We had a lot of public input because, when you change the Tax Code, it has lots of different effects, some of which are not apparent. There are a lot of tradeoffs, and we need to do this in an open manner.  It is also important that we have a bipartisan product because we want the Tax Code to remain intact so people can plan. We don't want to see a Tax Code pass in one Congress only to be radically changed in the next That only happens when you have a bipartisan agreement where Democrats and Republicans are working together in order to bring about a consensus change in our Tax It doesn't work if it becomes a partisan process.  The budget resolution that has been presented on the floor by the Budget Committee fails on this first guiding principle. It is not a process that will lead to a bipartisan result. It is one that is a partisan process. Reconciliation, by definition, becomes a partisan process when a budget resolution is passed along party-line votes.  Secondly, under reconciliation and the rules of the Senate, you cannot enact permanent tax changes because it would create deficits outside of the budget window. For that reason, if we want permanency in our Tax Code, let's use regular order, where we bring the bills up in our committees, we bring them to the floor, we offer amendments without restriction, and, at the end of the day, we can pass permanent changes to our Tax Code that are in the best interest of the taxpayers of this country. Once again, on the first principle of an open, fair process, the budget resolution presented by the committee fails.  The second principle, which I would argue that all of us should agree upon, is that we don't want to finance the tax changes through debt, that it would be wrong for us to do debt financing of tax relief because that only adds to our national debt and deficit. It affects our economic growth. It really presents, I think, a moral issue: Do we really want our children and grandchildren to pay for what we spend today? The budget resolution presented by the committee fails on this second guiding principle.  By its own instructions, it allows for a $1.5 trillion increase in the national debt by the tax changes that are presented. There is no pretense here. It says that we will allow for a $1.5 trillion increase in the deficit.  To make matters worse, there is a provision that was put in the budget resolution that allows the budget chairman to bring the bill to the floor without getting the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Taxation Committee score. In other words, we will be allowed to vote on a bill that may increase the deficit well beyond $1.5 trillion without having the objective scoring by those who are responsible to let us know what impact it has on the deficit. Instead, we will get a partisan evaluation by the chairman of the committee rather than one that is produced by the professionals who are charged with reviewing what we do.  Now, to make matters even more problematic on the deficit, the guiding principle we have here on what the committees are looking at is what was[[Page S6506]]presented by the so-called Big 6; that is, the Republican fiscal leadership of the Senate, the Republican fiscal leadership of the House, along with the fiscal advisers to the They have come in with an outline that doesn't add up to $1.5 trillion. It adds up to a much greater deficit number than $1.5 trillion. So we are starting with deficits well in excess of $1.5 trillion with a process where we may be asked to vote without knowing the impact on the deficit, but we do know it will add to the deficit. That fails the test that we all felt that we shouldn't be taking action on the floor on tax reform to increase the deficit.  The third guiding principle should be that we want to be fair. We want to be fair to the taxpayers of this country. The truth is that middle-income taxpayers are already overburdened. We know that. We know that it is tough. It is tough to make ends meet. So we certainly don't want to pass a tax bill that will increase the burdens to middle-income taxpayers. I would think that we all would agree on that particular point. When you look at the budget resolution that has been presented by the committee, it fails on that test.  It eliminates the estate tax--hundreds of billions of dollars of costs financed by middle-income taxpayers to the 0.2 percent of the wealthiest individuals in this country. It fails in eliminating the alternative minimum tax, which is a way that we, at least, capture a minimum tax from very, very high-income taxpayers. That is eliminated both on the individual side and on the corporate side. There are tax cuts, breaks, and reduction of rates for the wealthiest taxpayers in this country. How is that all offset? Well, some of it is not offset, but to the extent that we know that it is offset, the budget resolution would allow for cuts in Medicare and Let me repeat that. We are going to cut Medicare by almost $500 billion in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country and we call that a fair tax bill? We are going to cut the Medicaid Program by a trillion dollars? We just went through that debate on the floor of the Senate on the changes in the healthcare system where we had significant cuts to the Medicaid system, and we saw the public reaction and rightly so because, when you cut Medicaid, you are cutting the lifeline from many families in this country--hard-working families who may have a child who was born with a difficult medical condition but they know they at least have the protection under our system. Those are the families who are at risk. Why are we doing it? To give tax cuts to 0.2 percent of Americans by eliminating the estate tax? The budget resolution that has come out of the Budget Committee fails on the third test of fairness. So whether it is failing on process or increasing the deficit or not being fair to middle-income families, this budget resolution should be rejected.  Now, I saw where, as to the Big 6--I referred to them before--we have their outline. It is a broad outline. I acknowledge that. It is heavy on promises on tax cuts, and it is very light on how they are going to finance it. So some of us can start filling in the blanks as to who are going to be targets for losing important provisions in our Tax Code, but in a couple of cases, we don't have to guess because the outline specifically calls for it. One is the loss of deduction on the State and local taxes that we pay. To me, this is a direct attack on federalism. It is the same taxpayer who pays State and local taxes who pays Federal taxes, and now we are going to tell those taxpayers that they are going to have to pay taxes on taxes. That makes absolutely no sense. It is a direct attack on federalism. The work that our States and local governments do to provide services to taxpayers in this country should have the exact same respect as what we do at the Federal level of government.  We can only surmise that this might not be the last attack on federalism, that there could well be an attack on the way State and local governments finance their capital programs because that has been on lists before and there are big gaps as to how they are going to even reach a $1.5 trillion deficit target. That would concern us because State and local governments have already been hit by restrictions at the national level as to how they can borrow money.  Another area that we don't really have to guess about is the impact it is going to have on the real estate market. We know that the trigger to the 2009 recession started in the housing markets. Yet in this proposal that is likely to be done, if you eliminate State and local taxes, you are eliminating the deductibility of the property taxes. If you eliminate the deductibility of property taxes, you are affecting the value of homes here in The largest, single asset for many families could be very well jeopardized.  Then there is talk--the outline says we are going to take a look at all of the standard deductions; it doesn't give a lot of protection out there--of whether we will be looking at mortgage interest deductions and compromising that. Will these deductions be as valuable as they are under the current Tax Code? That is one of the reasons I said a process is important because, if you reduce the value of a deduction, you reduce its worth and you reduce the value of real estate.  I have been working for many years to improve retirement security. I am very proud to have worked with Senator Portman on these issues. We have done a lot of good things to make it easier for people to save for their retirement. Yet we don't know exactly how the proposal under this budget resolution will affect retirement security, but we do know that there have been discussions about the ``Rothization'' of a 401(k). What does that mean? It means that today if you contribute to a 401(k) plan, you don't have to pay current taxes on your contributions. You pay the taxes when you take your money out after retirement. If ``Rothization'' is mandated, it would mean that you would no longer have the ability to defer taxes on the contributions you make, as you can today on a 401(k). If that is mandated, it will affect people's ability to save for their retirement and very much affect retirement security in this country. Here is the rub. It doesn't raise any revenue. It is just the timing of revenue. By collecting the revenue today, we lose it tomorrow. It actually builds in a larger deficit in the out years. It is actually contrary to good budgeting from the point of view of preserving us from going further into debt.  We don't know if that is going to come out of the committee, but it certainly could come out of the committee in order to meet the instructions that have been recommended by the Budget  I could use the same arguments about how we could jeopardize the new market tax credits, which are very important for economic development; the historic tax credits, on which I have worked with many Members here and which affect economic growth; the work opportunity tax credit, which affects hiring people who have challenges in the workforce; and the low-income housing tax credit, which gives us affordable housing. All of those tax credits could lose value or could be eliminated under the outline we have before us.  So I hope we adopt some amendments. I hope we take a different course, but there will be amendments, I hope, that will be offered to eliminate the use of reconciliation for a tax plan so we can truly have a bipartisan tax bill that can stand the test of time--that we demand that we have the scoring before we vote on it so we know what we are doing, that we will not deficit-finance tax changes, and that we don't jeopardize the State and local tax deduction or the mortgage interest deduction or the retirement security savings that we have today or the various tax credits. I hope we will all clarify that together. I hope that we can get some of that done during the amendment process.  Let me make this clear. There is a better way. There is a better way. Let's give up use of this partisan process and start from the beginning on a bipartisan process that recognizes that we need tax reform, we need to do this, but let's do this in a bipartisan manner, let's know what we are doing, let's be fair to middle-income taxpayers, and let's do it in a way that will not increase the size of the deficit and will stand the test of time and where we can give permanent reform to our Tax That is what we should be doing, and I regret that we are heading down a path that will make that impossible.[[Page S6507]]  I yield the floor.

165,topic-id,811,"Mr.President, last week, people across this country celebrated National Wildlife Refuge Week--and rightfully so. National Wildlife Refuges are one of the crown jewels of our Federal public lands network. These refuges provide essential habitat for some of our most imperiled species, including many impacted by climate change. Millions of refuge visitors also fuel local and regional economies by generating billions of dollars in sales.  This week, the Senate is considering a budget resolution that would open one of our refuges, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to oil and gas drilling. Despite tremendous public support for our refuge system and the economic benefits that the refuges bring to our local economies, efforts to develop these special wild areas are ongoing and have been championed by the current administration. The budget resolution is another such effort to promote development in a refuge, an effort that should be rejected. In some cases, refuges are compatible with development and increased human activity. In others, development decisions, such as the siting of oil and gas drilling, could negatively impact the future of both human and animal inhabitants.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of the largest remaining intact ecosystems in the world, is an example of the latter. The Refuge has been home to the Gwich'in people for more than 20,000 years. These Native people subsist primarily on caribou. Research shows that oil and gas development in the Refuge, even with a small footprint, could significantly alter Porcupine Caribou migration patterns and calving behavior. These changes would threaten the Gwich'in people's way of life. The U.30-year-old treaty with Canada to conserve the Porcupine Caribou Herd could also be at risk.  According to the U.Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arctic Refuge is the only national conservation area where polar bears regularly den. It is the most consistently used polar bear land denning area in These iconic bears are increasingly vulnerable due to climate change, so the undisturbed Refuge land denning area is especially critical for their survival. The Refuge also hosts nearly 200 species of migratory birds, musk oxen, and wolves.  As the Senate contemplates the future of this spectacular natural area, I want to remind my colleagues that this body has said no to opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge dozens of times. With oil prices significantly lower than they were earlier this decade and oil supplies at historic highs, it is hard to understand why we would change course now. The risks far outweigh any benefits, and the American public has consistently opposed drilling in the Arctic  I also want to express my strong concerns with possible pending administrative action in the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, another national treasure. This Refuge is located on the U.S.-Mexico border, along the southernmost stretch of the Rio Grande River at the confluence of the Central and Mississippi flyways. It is home to more than 400 bird species, more than 300 species of butterflies, and more than 450 varieties of plants.  The Santa Ana Refuge supports rare wildlife species, some found only deep in south The Refuge also provides habitat for at least eight species protected under the Endangered Species Act, including the ocelot. There are less than 50 ocelots left in the United States, so this Refuge is essential to the species' recovery.  The Santa Ana Refuge is also a popular destination for birders and hosts more than 165,000 visitors each year. The booming ecotourism industry in the area is critical for local economies, which is another key reason why we need to ensure this Refuge and its inhabitants can thrive.  U.S Customs and Border Protection and U.Army Corps of Engineers planning actions earlier this year suggest that the Trump administration may shift existing Federal Homeland Security funds to construct a segment of-border wall through the Santa Ana  As I have said before, we already have 650 miles of fencing along our southern border with Mexico in the areas where it is most effective. I am not unequivocally opposed to physical barriers where they are needed and where they can be shown to be the most effective method of border security, but the Santa Ana Refuge is not a known problem area for border crossing. Furthermore, a wall through the Refuge would permanently damage critical habitat, block wildlife migration routes, and would likely trap wildlife during floods.  Again, a wall through the refuge would not yield intended outcomes and would harm both wildlife and communities. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to question and oppose construction of this wall segment.  From Alaska to Texas to Delaware, our National Wildlife Refuge System is well worth protecting and preserving for future generations. I look forward to continued work with my colleagues and constituents to this end.  Thank you.

1178,topic-id,472,"Mr.President, in celebration of National Wildlife Refuge Week, Senator Barrasso and I introduced legislation just prior to the recent recess to reauthorize the National Wildlife Refuge System's volunteer and partnerships program. I want to share with our colleagues some information about 1940, the Keep America's Refuges Operational Act, and ask for their support.  The Keep America's Refuges Operational Act reauthorizes the volunteer and partnerships program, with no increase, at $2 million per year. The U.Fish and Wildlife Service will use this authorization of Federal funding to provide volunteer uniforms, training, equipment, and necessary travel. The bill also allows volunteer groups to use this modest funding for administrative expenses directly related to the program.  For example, these groups will now be able to use funding to complete administrative requirements of cooperative agreements with the U.Fish and Wildlife Cooperative agreements enable volunteers to assist the agency in technical activities, such as bird banding, other wildlife tagging, and research.  Our National Wildlife Refuge System is an exceptional network of public lands and waters dedicated to fish and wildlife conservation. More than 40 million people visit our refuges each year to explore, fish, hunt, and view and study wildlife. This ecotourism industry strongly supports local economies.  Volunteers are critical to refuge operations, making up 20 percent of the refuge system's workforce. Volunteers assist with fish and wildlife surveys, restoring habitat, and supporting refuge office functions. Without volunteers and partner groups, refuges may have to cut back on public programs and reduce hours of operation.  In my home State of Delaware, we have two beautiful refuges: the Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge and the Bombay Hook National Wildlife The two refuges employ only 10 full time staff, and both refuges are highly dependent upon volunteers.  Each year, people come to our refuges to observe the federally threatened Red Knot shorebird, which stops along the Delaware Bay to refuel on horseshoe crab eggs along its migration journey. Volunteers make sure these visitors have memorable experiences.  When people can see these pristine habitats and the many species that call them home, they are inspired to be good stewards of our planet for the enjoyment and benefit of future generations.  I want to ensure that these opportunities abound, in Delaware and around the country. A small annual investment in the refuge system volunteer and partnerships program goes a long way. Every $1 appropriated to coordinate these volunteers translates to $10 worth of volunteer services.  These appropriations also help cut government costs. In fiscal year 2016, 40,000 volunteers donated 1.4 million hours, with donated time equaling that of 649 full-time employees.  I want to thank Senator Barrasso for cosponsoring this commonsense legislation.

In 1899, he moved the company to the historical area of Germantown Avenue, Chester worked tirelessly to perfect his candies and chocolates and was constantly searching for innovative ways to please his customers.  Following World War II, Chester's four sons took over the business, and they subsequently passed the company on to their sons in their retirement.

658,topic-id,1730,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for his leadership on this amendment and his words today. I will have more to say about the amendment in a moment.  Mr.President, as Senator Sanders mentioned, his amendment that we are working together on, amendment 1119, will do the following, and it is right in the text of the purpose section of the amendment, to provide additional resources to restore the $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid paid for by reducing the Republican tax breaks for the wealthy. That is the quick summary of what we are working on.  I think it is also important to put this amendment in the context of discussions we are having in the Senate and, I am sure, throughout the country; that is, the tax proposal put forth by the administration as well as the Republican leadership, the so-called unified tax proposal. This is a Republican proposal that comes before the country. I think it is essential to read both the tax proposal along with the budget we are debating on the floor together.  There are a lot of ways to describe what the tax proposal is all about. I will describe it very bluntly, in my own words. This tax proposal is, for sure, a giveaway to the wealthy. The superrich do quite well. Big corporations do very well. The middle class does not do well at all at the end of the day.  Why do I say that? Because there have been a number of analyses done of the proposal. Even the proposal, as it stands now, will have more analyses done when the bill is actually introduced, but in terms of what is on paper now, you have, for example, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities stating that by the year 2027--at the end of the 10 years--80 percent of the tax cut goes to the top 1 percent.  There is another analysis that is even more pointed in terms of the year. You don't have to wait until 2027 to figure out what is happening to the top 1 percent. Here is what the Tax Policy Center says with regard to the tax benefit that accrues to the top 1 percent and also what would accrue to the top 0.1 percent. The top 1 percent is roughly those making above $730,000. The top 0.1 percent, of course, is even higher. Here is what the Tax Policy Center said in September based upon the proposals so far. Table 2 in the report says the following: Starting in 2018--the assumption here is that the tax proposal as currently crafted would happen this year. If it were to pass this year, in 2018--the 2018 tax year--the top 1 percent would get a tax cut of $146,470. That is the first year of the tax cut for the top 1 percent, $146,000. How about the top 0.1 percent, a very small number of extraordinarily wealthy Americans? They get $747,580--roughly, $747,000 in a tax cut. That is just in year one. We could provide more examples year after year, but you get the picture that a lot of the tax cuts, if there are any, will be shifted to the top 1 percent and the 0.1 percent.  When they do that, when they have a proposal that points in that direction[[Page S6514]]in terms of the tax bill, what happens in the budget bill that is related to that?  It is very simple. The budget bill will cut Medicaid, as Senator Sanders referred to, by over $1 trillion. The exact number is $1.056 trillion over 10 years. Let's call it a $1 trillion cut to Medicaid over 10 years. That is, basically, what it is. With regard to Medicare, the cut is $473 billion in the budget. Now, the difference between the two bills--or the two proposals, really--is that the budget proposal is a bill. So we know the exact details there. The tax proposal has some specificity, and some areas are not as specific, but the benefits to the wealthy are rather specific.  The Republican plan is to use the proposed $1.5 trillion in cuts to those two programs--when you add the $1 trillion cut to Medicaid to the $473 billion cut to Medicare--to pay for the $1.5 trillion tax cut to corporations. I think it is obscene to cut those programs and then use those dollars for a corporate tax cut. Notice that nothing about that is connected to the middle class and that nothing about that is focused on folks who are trying to get into the middle class. It is really a corporate tax cut that is paid for by cuts to Medicare and  I will limit my remarks today to Medicaid because that is what this amendment is about. This amendment seeks to restore at least the Medicaid cut of $1 trillion. So that is what we are focused on.  What is Medicaid? There are a lot of ways to describe it, but Medicaid covers 40 percent of all of the children in the country. If you are in Medicaid and you have the opportunity to take your child to the doctor and get checkups and all of the benefits that you get from Medicaid, you get to benefit from what is called early periodic screening, diagnosis, and testing. So a child who might be from a low-income family--and is, in the case of Medicaid--not only gets coverage but benefits from the early screening, early diagnosis, and early testing. All of those benefits go to that child, and 40 percent of the Nation's children are covered by  The other number to know, which is rather startling, is that 60 percent of all of the children in the country who have disabilities are covered by Of course, that is not limited to children from families who have lower incomes. You could have a family who has a rather high income--a middle-class income or much higher than that--who might have healthcare through the family's employer, but if the child has a disability, especially a profound disability, the family relies on So that is the program that we are talking about.  We know, as well, that Medicaid covers half of all of the births in the country. There are millions of births every year that are covered by  How about nursing homes? Medicaid pays for nursing home care for our parents, our grandparents, and our family members. If that were not the case, on average, you would see something on the order of $75,000 in terms of annual expenses, which would force countless middle-class families out of their homes and deplete their hard-earned savings. That would be a big expense if it were not for the benefit of having Medicaid in the context of one's long-term care in a nursing home.  In addition to paying for 45 percent of all of the births, the other 45 percent is that of school districts in the country that use Medicaid funds to pay for medical and therapy services for kids in school who are receiving special education. We could go on and on.  Let me make one other point.  I mentioned that 60 percent of children with disabilities are covered. The Medicaid Program also makes it possible for millions of people with disabilities, including adults, to live in their own homes--to have the dignity, even having a disability, of staying in their own homes. Medicaid also makes it possible for those with disabilities to get to work and to be an active part of the workforce. The program also helps to fund schools to be able to provide the physical, occupational, and speech therapy services to students with disabilities. For all of these reasons and more, what we seek to do with this amendment is to restore the more than $1 trillion cut to  We all have the opportunity in the Senate to receive letters from constituents--sometimes handwritten, sometimes typewritten, sometimes by way of email, or otherwise--who communicate to us about the issues of the day. One of the most compelling letters that I have ever received in the context of healthcare and, particularly, in the context of Medicaid is from Pam She is from Southeastern Pam wrote to me and described in rather specific detail about the challenges her son, Rowan, faces as a child with autism spectrum disorder and what his life was like before Medicaid and what his life was like after I will not dwell on the ``before.'' I will focus on how his life has changed with  Pam tells me that in late January of 2016 she applied for medical assistance for her son She goes on to write about the wraparound services that came from Medicaid after her son Rowan was enrolled, which included a behavioral specialist consultant and a therapeutic staff support worker to help her son It reads that the behavioral specialist evaluated Rowan while he was at daycare and ``put a treatment plan together to help guide the therapeutic support, who was then able to provide support to Rowan while he was at daycare. The wrap-around services have been a Godsend.'' That is what we were told in the letter from Pam  I will conclude because I know that we are short on time.  Pam Simpson described the before and after. Then, in the letter, she was pleading with me to make sure that I do not take any steps that will cut She wrote about the adverse impact on her family and, obviously, the adverse impact on her son Rowan, who is the recipient of  In addition to reminding me about his circumstances and hers, she concluded the letter in this way:       Please think of my 9 month old daughter, Luna, who smiles      and laughs at her brother daily; she will have to care for      Rowan later in her life after we are gone. Overall, we are      desperately in need of Rowan's Medicaid assistance and would      be devastated if we lost these benefits.  She is one mother from one family who is talking about the adverse impact of there being cuts to I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment to make sure that the $1 trillion that has been taken away from the Medicaid Program is restored in this budget bill that we are debating today.

830,topic-id,410,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this bipartisan legislation introduced by Chairman Knight and Ranking Member Murphy of the Committee on Small Business' Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce aims to modernize and improve the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer, or SBIR and STTR, programs.  The SBIR and STTR programs have helped thousands of small businesses create new technologies, commercialize their ideas, and generate new jobs. While creating these benefits in the private sector, the programs offer, in a cost-effective manner, ways for Federal agencies to solve operational problems. H.2763 strengthens these two programs in quite a few ways.  First, the bill emphasizes agency accountability by creating several firm reporting deadlines for covered agencies and for the SBA to provide future Congresses with improved information that will lead to a better understanding of the programs' strengths and weaknesses.  Second, the legislation clarifies the congressional intent of the 2011 reauthorization to ensure that taxpayers reap the benefits of the SBIR and STTR programs by binding the technologies developed in the programs to long-term projects at the Department of  Third, the legislation extends a popular pilot program included in the 2011 reauthorization that would allow all participating Federal agencies to award a phase II contract immediately if the agency finds that the small business concern has already completed work typically done during phase  Fourth, it makes permanent the option for all participating agencies to[[Page H7943]]establish commercialization readiness programs, or As a pilot program from the 2011 reauthorization, these CRPs have been shown to provide much-needed support to small companies nearing the completion of the process and have helped advance technology to the commercialization phase.  Fifth, it extends, through 2022, the provision that allows participating agencies to utilize 3 percent of their allocation for administrative functions, conduct outreach in an effort to bring more companies into the SBIR and STTR programs, and increase deterrents to waste, fraud, and abuse.  I want to thank Congressman Knight and Congresswoman Murphy for the bipartisan work on this important legislation. I would also like to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, as well as Chairwoman Comstock and Ranking Member Lipinski of the Subcommittee on Research and Technology, for working together with us to produce this bipartisan bill that we have before us this afternoon.

President Trump will have an opportunity to deliver on his promise last year to get a better deal for American workers. I hope he does.

That is more than half of the manufacturing jobs in my The folks who kept their jobs have seen their paychecks get smaller.  Rhode Islanders know, most importantly, that we need a trade deal that is fair; but they know that trade deals that we have now help powerful corporations, but they are killing American jobs, helping corporations outsource jobs at the expense of working people.  This week I am asking President Trump to demand a new NAFTA agreement that has strong labor and environmental protections, that end foreign tribunals that allow corporations to sue the U.Government and force taxpayers to pay the bill, that has better Buy American requirements, that has strict protections against currency manipulation, that has strong rules of origin on manufactured goods, and that has provisions that bring down the cost of prescription drugs.

Historic achievements.  If not extended by Congress soon, many States will no longer be able to fund the program and will begin limiting coverage, some as early as the end of this year.  In fact, the Kaiser Family Foundation recently concluded that, without an extension of CHIP, ``States would face budget pressures, children would lose coverage, and implementation of program changes could result in increased costs and administrative burden for States as well as confusion for families.''

577,topic-id,647,"Mr.President, I am pleased to commend Norman Joseph of Jackson, a leader in Mississippi athletics, on his induction into the Belhaven University Sports Hall of Fame this month. Coach Joseph is a Vicksburg native who played quarterback and defensive back at Mississippi State As a coach in the nearly four decades since, he has delivered a tradition of excellence, success, and Christian character to student-athletes in Mississippi and across the country.  Norman Joseph has coached on every level of 4-year college football. Starting and rebuilding teams became a hallmark of his career. He built the Belhaven University football program from the ground up and served as its inaugural head coach. Coach Joseph launched Belhaven's recruiting program, designed its uniforms, and consulted on the creation of practice facilities and a new athletic complex. Under his leadership, the football program experienced immediate success and achieved a Top 25 ranking for 6 consecutive weeks during its second season.  Coach Joseph has coached at three Jackson-area colleges. In addition to Belhaven, he served as quarterbacks coach at Millsaps College and head coach at Mississippi College in Clinton for nine seasons.  At Mississippi College, Coach Joseph took a program in decline and established a winning culture. Under his guidance, the team had an eight-win season in only 3 years. Within 5 years, the team won the conference championship and went to the second round of the Division III playoffs. Coach Joseph took his team to NCAA Top 25 National Rankings in scoring offense, total offense, passing offense, rushing[[Page S6639]]offense, first downs, and fewest interceptions. In 2009, he coached Mississippi College to the American Southwest Conference cochampions and was named the 2009 American Football Coaches Association Regional Coach of the Year and the 2009 American Southwest Conference Coach of the  Coach Joseph began his coaching career at the University of Louisiana at Monroe as a position coach working for John David Crow, who was Bear Bryant's only Heisman Trophy winner. He later returned to Louisiana Monroe as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, delivering record offense, four consecutive winning seasons, and three NCAA Division 1AA championship berths ranked at number four or higher.  He took over the Louisiana College football program 3 years after that program was reinstated and compiled the school's best record in more than 40 years.  He has also assisted programs at the University of Southern Mississippi, San Jose State University, Vanderbilt University, Louisiana Tech University, Northwestern State University, and Midwestern State  Coach Joseph has set offensive records at every school he has coached, including an NCAA Division I record for combined total yards in a game, a record set in 2001 that remained intact until last year.  Coach Joseph's career has been focused on more than gridiron wins and records. As a coach, his attention to the development of players as individuals has resulted in academic and professional success for many young men. Under his guidance, scores of players have earned Academic All-Conference, All-American, All-Conference, and MVP honors. He has the distinction of coaching three quarterbacks with Super Bowl rings, and one of his former players is currently the head football coach of the Philadelphia  Coach Joseph has been active in the Fellowship of Christian In 2016, he was appointed by Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant to the Governor's Commission on Physical Fitness and  I am proud to recognize Norman Joseph as an outstanding He and his wife, the former Jane Bird of Vicksburg, have three daughters, Elizabeth, Grace Anne, and Sara Elizabeth serves on my staff.

670,topic-id,470,"Mr.President, there has been a great deal of discussion about what the appropriate tax rate should be for large corporations. That is important because we want them to create jobs right here in America and not overseas.  Let us not forget the true engine of our economy, and that is our small businesses. We need to provide true tax relief to our small businesses, the job creators in our economy.  I rise to discuss my amendment, which is 1151, which would create a deficit neutral reserve fund to support small business tax relief while preventing wealthy taxpayers from sheltering income from taxation at the appropriate rate.  It would send the message that through tax reform, we can help our small businesses thrive and be the engine of job creation and economic growth in communities all across our great country.  Small businesses make an out-sized contribution to our economy. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses employ nearly half of all workers and generate two out of three net new jobs each year. Nationwide, they generate nearly half of our private, nonfarm GDP and one-third of our Nation's export value.  The State of Maine is truly a small business State, with nearly 300,000 of our residents employed by our more than 141,000 small businesses. That is nearly 60 percent of our workforce.  Most small businesses are organized as so-called passthrough entities, which means that their profits are passed on to their owners and reported on individual income tax returns.  Under current law, this income is taxed at individual rates, which can reach nearly 40 percent at the Federal level and can be significantly higher than the corporate tax rates that larger firms face.  Given the administrative costs and these high tax rates, small businesses are forced to devote more resources to compliance and tax payments and fewer resources to creating good jobs and investing in their local communities.  It is no wonder that a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business found that concerns about Federal taxes on small businesses ranked third on the list of the top 10 concerns.  With tax reform, we have the opportunity to fix this problem. Of course, we should aim to do so in a way that prevents people from abusing rates intended for small business passthrough income.  My amendment would allow for changes to Federal tax laws and to provide relief to small businesses, while not allowing wealthy individuals to shelter their income from taxation at the appropriate rate.  I urge my colleagues to support it.  The PRESIDING All time has expired.

With the recent events with Equifax, WannaCry, and OPM breaches, it is clear that our cybersecurity infrastructure needs to be strengthened.  In December 2016, the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity specifically recommended that the administration should ``develop concrete efforts to support and strengthen the cybersecurity of small- and medium-sized businesses.''  With small businesses accounting for most of the U.economy's jobs and sales, it is imperative that we provide guidance to help them identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risks. By making these resources readily available to small businesses across the country, this commonsense legislation will help them protect their sensitive data and business from cyber threats so they can grow our economy and provide more jobs instead.

19,topic-id,450,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Darrell Issa, the cosponsor of this bill and the cosponsor of the original FITARA; and my good friend from Oklahoma (Mr.Russell) for his able management today.  The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, or FITARA, was enacted 3 years ago. It represented the first major reform of the laws governing the procurement and management of Federal IT since the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  FITARA is the framework for IT procurement and ensures the Federal Government is making smart and effective investments to modernize its IT, which is badly needed.  It has seven pillars:  First, it enhances CIO authorities, responsibilities, and accountability.  Second, it enhances transparency and improves risk management by requiring detailed information on investments to be published on the IT dashboard.  Third, we increased the frequency of portfolio reviews from annual to quarterly and included key decisionmakers from the agency and OMB to not only look for ways to increase efficiency, but to eliminate duplication.  Fourth, we built on the Federal data center consolidation effort to push agencies to realize big savings from this low-hanging fruit.  Fifth, people. Recognizing that Federal IT success is only as good as the people behind it, FITARA calls for expanding the training and use of IT professionals.  Sixth, FITARA seeks to maximize new tools like the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative, taking a page from the private sector to reduce duplicative spending on common purchases and off-the-shelf items.  Finally, FITARA advances a government software purchasing program to allow for purchasing licensing agreements that can be made available for use by all Federal agencies.  FITARA is a rubric for IT procurement that, hopefully, someday enables initiatives like the Modernizing Government Technology Act to build on our success of improving how the government acquires and modernizes  When the stakeholders met on Federal IT from government agencies and industry, both Mr.Issa and I constantly were reminded of why previous major IT reform efforts had fallen short of their potential: the lack of robust implementation plan and congressional oversight.  As Mr.Russell indicated quite clearly, in that latter regard, we have robust oversight, and it will continue.  One of the things we had in FITARA were some sunset provisions, in the hope and expectation that, by having that, we would encourage cooperation and implementation. That cooperation and implementation is uneven throughout the Federal  The GAO, or Government Accountability Office, recommended that we have this bill to extend those sunset provisions to buy a little bit more time to get with the program for those Federal agencies.  So that is what this bill does, but it builds on FITARA, which is the framework for IT procurement and modernization.  Mr.Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.

147,topic-id,689,"Mr.President, I join my colleague from the State of Virginia, Senator Warner, in offering an amendment that will prevent tax reform from ballooning our deficits.  The Republican budget, which we are currently considering, includes a troubling provision that would exempt a $1.5 trillion tax reform bill from the important requirement that legislation that adds costs to the U.Government must be paid for rather than merely added to our deficit. This rule, well known to our colleagues, is one by which I am troubled to see a number of my longtime friends choose to ignore this time around--a rule long known in the Senate as the pay-as-you-go rule, or pay-go. It is an important rule that forces Congress to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. It forces Congress to find ways to actually pay for new programs or find offsets for reductions in revenue rather than to add to our national debt. It is the right policy, and it has been in place for years. So it is, frankly, jarring that this budget document would include a provision that explicitly exempts a $1.5 trillion tax reform bill from the pay-go rule.  Look, I agree that we need to work together toward a bipartisan tax reform bill, one that reduces taxes on the middle class and simplifies our overly complicated Tax Code, but we cannot simply pass a budget that allows Congress to put $1.5 trillion more on the government's credit card, on our credit card.  I thank Senator Warner for his long leadership on the need for fiscally responsible governing. Senator Warner is a former Governor and a successful business leader, and he understands the importance of sound fiscal management and the danger that our national debt poses to our long-term economic prosperity. I am proud to work with him and to remind our colleagues of the Senate's longstanding support of pay-go. I encourage all Members, especially my Republican colleagues, to support this amendment.  Now, with the forbearance of my colleague, I will speak to one other amendment for a moment.  There is an amendment that I have introduced that I know may well not get a vote but that I wanted to speak to. It would ensure that, as we consider tax reform, we do not forget those who are the most in need of our assistance right now and in the future.  The United States was hit very hard by three hurricanes and many wildfires this year. In particular, Puerto Rico, a U.territory of 3.4 million people, was devastated by Hurricane Maria, which was wider than the entire island. It caused massive damage and is now resulting in a humanitarian crisis. Puerto Rico's 3.4 million people is several times more than live in my State of It is about the size of  Once we get past this initial crisis and restore power, provide clean drinking water, get hospitals functioning, and ensure people have housing, then Puerto Rico, the U.Virgin Islands, the areas of Houston, TX, and Miami, FL, as well as areas affected by wildfires in all of these other parts of our country will have significant rebuilding needs.  We have representatives of the Governor of Puerto Rico and the Governor himself here on the Hill this week to clarify just how much more will be needed for the Marshall Plan-style investment to rebuild Puerto I am going to be advocating that we provide further support for folks from the Corporation for National and Community Service, AmeriCorps volunteers, and NCCC volunteers. Thousands of them have served in response to these emergencies. We are going to need investments in CDBGs for parks and for infrastructure.  Before I hand it over to my colleague from Virginia, I want to reference a second amendment that would prevent us from moving forward with tax reform until we first provide for the needs of Americans who have been affected by these disasters and emergencies.

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System (THAAD)      Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) System contains classified      CONFIDENTIAL/SECRET components and critical/sensitive      technology. The THAAD Fire Unit is a ground-based, forward      deployable terminal missile defense system that represents      significant technological advances. The THAAD system      continues to hold a technology lead over other terminal      ballistic missile systems. THAAD is the first weapon system      with both endo- and exo- atmospheric capability developed      specifically to defend against ballistic missiles. The higher      altitude and theater-wide protection offered by THAAD      provides more protection of larger areas than lower-tier      systems alone. THAAD is designed to defend against short,      medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles. The THAAD      system consists of four major components: Fire Control/     Communications, Radar, Launchers, and Interceptor       2. The THAAD BMD System contains sensitive/critical      technology, primarily in the area of defense and production      know-how and primarily inherent in the design, development      and/or manufacturing data related to certain critical      components. Information on operational effectiveness with      respect to countermeasures and counter-countermeasures, low      observable technologies, select software documentation and      test data are classified up to and including       3. The THAAD BMD System contains Controlled Cryptographic      Items (CCI) that are used for both system internal links and      for external communications. These items consist of key      loading devices, network encryptors, secure telephones, voice      radios, tactical data radios, and mission data radios.      Specific CCI used for the Saudi Arabia case will be      determined through the COMSEC Release Request (CRR) process,      initiated through USCENTCOM once an interoperability      requirement has been established. NSA will identify      releasable items, in parallel with staffing and validation of      the CRR by the Joint The Committee for National      Security Systems (CNSS) reviews and provides final approval      of the items and quantities.       4. AN/VCR-90, AN/VCR-91, AN/VCR-92 are different      configurations of the Single Channel Ground and Airborne      Radio System (SINCGARS) family. SINCGARS is a tactical radio      providing secure jam-resistant voice and data communications      of command, control, targeting, and technical information for      the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system. The      spread-spectrum frequency hopping Electronic Counter-Counter      Measures (ECCM) technology resident in the radio is sensitive      but While sensitive, the frequency-hopping      algorithms used to generate the ECCM waveform are unique to      the country of ownership and cannot be manipulated by      potential adversaries for use or interference with other      countries possessing SINCGARS technology. Should a potential      adversary come into possession of one of these radios, they      would have the potential to intercept operational command,      control, and targeting information. This potential problem is      mitigated by the fact that the customer can secure      information passed over the radio network using a commercial      grade security capability equivalent to an Advanced      Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption system whose      keys are controlled by the customer country.       5. As with the SINCGARS family of radios, the AN/PRC-117 is      a tactical radio providing ECCM jam-resistant secure      communications for exchange of command, control, and      targeting information within the THAAD system tactical radio      network. ECCM capabilities are sensitive but UNCLASSIFIED and      algorithms for these jam-resistant waveforms are unique to      the customer country. Unlike the SINCGARS radios, the AN/PRC-     117 uses Type 1 encryption. When loaded with U.crypto      keys, the system is then CLASSIFIED up to Should a      potential adversary come into possession of one of these      radios, the customer country can quickly remotely rekey      remaining radios, preventing potential adversaries from      understanding received command, control, and targeting      information.       6. The Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)      Receiver (DAGR) is a handheld GPS location device with map      background displaying the user's location. Unlike commercial      grade GPS receivers capable of receiving Standard Positioning      Signals (SPS) from GPS satellites, the DAGR is capable of      receiving Precise Positioning Signals (PPS). PPS satellite      signals provide significantly more accurate location data      than do SPS signals. This capability within DAGRs is possible      due to the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module      (SAASM). The SAASM is an encrypted device permitting both      receipt of PPS signals and the benefit of preventing      potential adversaries from spoofing the system to display      incorrect location information. The SAASM capability within      the DAGR is sensitive but The SAASM      capabilities are sensitive due to the system's ability to      access restricted PPS GPS satellite signals and to prevent      spoofing. While sensitive, the ability of potential      adversaries to exploit the system is limited.       7. The same SAASM capabilities resident in the DAGR are      also resident in the THAAD GPS timing system. The THAAD      system requires highly precise timing hacks in order      accurately track and engage targets. The PPS signals      generated by GPS satellites provide this precise timing      information. The SAASM device resident in the timing system      permits receipt of this precise PPS timing data. The SAASM is      an encrypted device permitting both receipt of PPS signals      and the benefit of preventing potential adversaries from      spoofing the system to display incorrect data. The SAASM      capability within the timing system is sensitive but            8. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of specific hardware, the information could be used      to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapons system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       9. A determination has been made that Saudi Arabia can      provide substantially the same degree of protection for      sensitive technology being released as the U.     This proposed sustainment program is necessary to the      furtherance of the U.foreign policy and national security      objectives outlined in the policy justification.[[Page S6396]]         10.

460,topic-id,1949,"Madam President, today I want to talk to you about time and how little of it we have to accomplish two incredibly important legislative priorities, one that is national in scope and potentially historic in impact. The first of those priorities is tax reform. We have a target date on the calendar, and now the clock is ticking. We have to get to work.  The budget resolution that we will consider this week sets November 13 as our deadline for the Finance Committee to report a bill, and of course the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, is on the floor, and that is a commitment I know he takes very seriously.  This bill, I hope, will broadly cut taxes on individuals and businesses alike and put more money in the pockets of working families across the country. What I like most about the plan I have seen so far is that it is bold. We are not trimming a little here and a tiny bit there. We are slashing rates, consolidating brackets, and eliminating pet credits and deductions. This is not JV tax reform. This is tax reform that is serious and based upon our commitment to get the economy growing again.  Two weeks ago, the House approved its version of the resolution, and the Senate Budget Committee reported out its version. Now the Senate will consider the committee's resolution in the coming days. Why do we need that budget resolution? How is this all going to work?  Well, these resolutions from each Chamber are the first step in passing pro-growth tax reform. They authorize the use of a tool called budget reconciliation. That means when the tax reform legislation is considered, it can't be stopped by less than a majority of the Of course, this isn't our first choice.  I wish our colleagues across the aisle, our Democratic friends, would join us in bipartisan tax reform, but passing a budget resolution in the Senate is a must because this is something we can hold in reserve if our friends across the aisle simply refuse to participate in the process of pro-growth tax reform. It is a key procedural step because we have to fundamentally change the Tax Code before the end of the year.  How well our economy does next year, how many jobs are created, and how much investment occurs here in the United States will depend largely upon our success in passing pro-growth tax reform this year. The clock is ticking, and we have to act with dispatch and with determination.[[Page S6386]]  As the President said last week in Pennsylvania, ``we want lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for . . . American workers.'' He is absolutely right. Lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs are the things we all ought to want, and they are worth the fight.  Under this administration we are already seeing results. The economy is bouncing back. Unemployment is at a 16-year low. Wages are rising and the stock market is soaring. The slumbering giant, which is the U.economy, is now slowly awakening. Our economy reached more than 3.1 percent growth last quarter. Confidence, as the President stressed in Pennsylvania, is back when it comes to our economy and our future, but that confidence will not last long if we let this opportunity pass.  We have to find ways to get companies to stay in America, to expand, and to hire in We have to find ways to take the money out of Washington's pocket and put it back into the pockets of those who earned the money in the first place--American families.  We have to find ways to simplify the Tax Code, which, let's remember, hits families multiple times each year by taking their earnings, by stealing their time through compliance, and by trying their patience with complexity. Each tax return feels like three.  I find it appalling that a majority of taxpayers are forced to pay someone else to do their taxes for them because they simply don't have the time or expertise to do it themselves.  The unified framework released a few weeks ago will help. It calls for collapsing seven separate tax brackets down to three. That is what I call simplification. It expands the zero bracket so that if you are a married couple earning less than $24,000 a year, you will pay zero income taxes. It enhances the child tax credit. It repeals the death tax and special interest tax breaks, and it reduces the uncompetitive corporate tax rate to 20 percent and cuts tax rates for small businesses to the lowest level in more than 80 years. So let's make this happen before time runs out.                       Hurricane Recovery Effort  Madam President, the other item I can't stop thinking about is one that has taken a great toll on my State and our region of the country, and that is Hurricane Harvey, the most extreme rain event in the history of the United Literally 50 inches of rain fell in 5 days in the Houston area.  Last week, I saw images of the Texas World Speedway, a racecar track at College Station that is being used as a processing lot. Here is a picture of that.  At its peak, tens of thousands of cars were parked there, awaiting damage assessments by insurance companies. A sea of them had filled the entire speedway, as can be seen on this chart, and it was starting to spill into surrounding areas, too--cars in all directions, as far as the eye could see.  How could Hurricane Harvey damage so many cars? Well, cars these days--the newer ones--are basically computers on wheels, and when they get wet in an extreme flooding event like this, they essentially become a total loss, like these cars at the Texas World It is an amazing picture. All the cars there, mind you, represent only a tiny percentage of all the vehicles damaged in the storm. Some of the estimates I have heard are that as high as one-half million personal vehicles were damaged and even totaled.  The speedway is just one of the images that continue to keep me up at night. How are my constituents, these Texans, going to get to work? How are they going to take their kids to school? When will their car and their house be ready so they can live in their home? When will their highways and driveways be fixed? What is being done to ensure that history doesn't repeat itself when, year after year, many parts of the Harris County-Houston area are flooded because many of the important Corps of Engineer projects have not been started, much less completed, which would have diverted the rain and saved many of these homes and many of these cars.  Last Thursday, the House passed a $36.5 billion hurricane and wildfire relief bill. The vote sends the measure over to the Senate, and I look forward to debating the supplemental appropriation in the days ahead.  The House's emergency measure is intended to replenish the Federal Emergency Management Agency's nearly depleted coffers with $18.7 billion to the Disaster Relief If we don't act soon, I am told, FEMA could run out of money as early as October 23.  The House bill will also address the National Flood Insurance Program by forgiving $16 billion of its debt and allowing it to pay more claims for property owners in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin  Nevertheless, I must say I am more than a little bit disappointed by this piece of legislation. I share the frustrations of Greg Abbott and Members of the Houston area congressional delegation, who have pointed out that this bill doesn't come close to fulfilling the very reasonable requests that have been made to rebuild and recover from Hurricane Texas needs more, and the State deserves it, too, after all it has gone through. We are not going to throw up our hands and relent. We are going to keep on pushing.  I appreciate the assurances from Speaker Paul Ryan and the administration that Texas will get what it needs to rebuild the homes and businesses lost in the hurricane and the funding that it needs to expand bayous and develop critical flood mitigation projects.  Governor Abbott told me the Speaker told him Congress will take up the State's recent request as soon as I am grateful to him for that promise, but we don't need any more general statements of support. We are not asking for any more expressions of sympathy. We need specifics and a specific commitment to follow through on Texas's demonstrated need for assistance.  I predict that the House bill will not move through the Senate until the bill provides the sort of specific commitment we could take to the bank. This isn't about Hurricane Harvey either. This is about Hurricane Irma and Hurricane  We cannot afford to wait much longer. The Texas families who have been out of their homes since Hurricane Harvey hit can't afford to wait much longer. The people who have lost their mode of transportation as a result of this flood and this hurricane can't afford to wait much longer. The small businesses that have been simply wiped out and who have been denied access to the funds they need in order to restart and rebuild their lives cannot afford to wait much longer.  The clock is ticking, and I will continue to work with the Governor and the rest of the Texas delegation, as well as our friends from Florida and others who were hit by other natural disasters, to make sure that collectively we present our case to the Appropriations Committees and to the We are not asking to be treated any better than anybody else after a natural disaster like this, but we sure will not accept being treated worse. We are going to work together, on a bipartisan basis, to make sure that is the case.  Let me just close with a few words from my good friend and colleague from Laredo, TX, Representative Henry Now, Henry is what they call a Blue Dog Democrat, somebody I have worked with a lot on border issues in particular. He is on the House Appropriations Committee, and he was asked whether the House's most recent bill was going to be the final appropriation to address the losses as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, or ``No,'' he said emphatically, ``we are going to do more,'' and he is absolutely right.  I am here to say that speaking as one Senator, I intend to make sure the U.Government keeps its commitments to the people in Texas, to the people in Florida, to the people in Puerto Rico, and to the people in the Virgin Islands when it comes to assisting them to recover from this terrible natural disaster.  We are not going to continue to take the promises of the Office of Management and Budget or the administration or our friends in the leadership in the House, for that matter, that we are going to get to this later. There is an expression in my part of the country that when somebody asks you when are you going to do something, the response is manana--tomorrow. To every question of when, it is manana.[[Page S6387]]  We demand that this problem be dealt with on a timely basis, and we are going to keep the feet to the fire of the administration and our friends in the House to make sure they follow up on their commitments to deal with the victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  I yield the floor.

659,topic-id,1961,"Mr.President, I assure our colleague from Pennsylvania that nothing in this budget resolution will deprive any person of the benefits they receive under Medicaid--no one. This budget resolution will not do that to anyone in the country. I can promise him that.  It is ironic, though, to hear my colleagues talk about cuts in Medicaid when no one is proposing cuts in Medicaid--no one. All we are talking about is reducing the rate of increase in the growth of a very important and necessary entitlement program. Someday, when they grow up, these same children are going to have to pay back the money that we have borrowed in order to sustain these programs today. So we need to look at the whole picture here and learn and figure out how we can meet our current needs but also be responsible enough not to spend money today that our children and grandchildren are going to have to pay back tomorrow.  Mr.President, I have come to the floor to talk primarily about tax reform because that is going to be the task that we undertake following the passage of the budget resolution.  The President of the United States invited the members of the Senate Finance Committee over to the White House, and I have just returned from that meeting. It was a bipartisan meeting of the tax-writing committee in the That is what the Senate Finance Committee is. We heard during the discussions that the President's preference would be for this to be done on a bipartisan basis, and there was no one there present who said: We insist that this be done on a partisan basis. In other words, everybody there agreed with the President that it would be better for the country and that we would be able to come up with a better product--it would be durable, and it would be sustainable--if, in fact, we[[Page S6515]]were able to do so on a bipartisan basis.  In taking that to heart, Chairman Hatch, who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has previously stated his intention to have an open amendment process in the Senate Finance Typically, what happens is that there is some base bill--sometimes referred to as the chairman's mark--that is the starting place for legislation in our committees. What we do is to come up with what we think represents the closest thing to a consensus of those who are interested, actually, in pro-growth tax reform and what that would look like, and then open it up to Democrats and Republicans alike to offer their amendments to change it. If they have a majority vote in the committee, it will pass and change the bill. If they have a vote and it loses, then the bill will stay as it is.  I am, frankly, a little bit surprised to hear from some of our colleagues that they actually want us to avoid the committee process and want us to come out here on the floor and come up with a bill that all 100 Senators can agree to. That is a terrible way to operate. It is, basically, a recipe for failure.  What we need to do is to return to what we call regular order around here. All that means is this: Let's go through the traditional process of legislating, moving bills through the committee, and letting everybody participate. Then the majority leader can bring a bill to the floor with there being the same opportunity to offer amendments and to have votes. If you get a majority vote, you win, and your amendment is adopted. If you lose the vote, then it is not, and it does not change the content of the bill.  I really wonder whether we ought to go back to that old cartoon that talks about how a bill becomes a law. I remember when I was growing up ``I am just a bill on Capitol Hill'' or however the lingo goes. Some people have seen that on the internet. Even some of the pages here, who are much younger than I am, are shaking their heads, indicating they recall that. That is how a bill becomes a law. Our colleagues across the aisle act like this is a revelation, that this is somehow unprecedented and is a terrible way to do business.  Consistent with what the President has requested and what we would like on a bipartisan basis, let's give that a try. That is what we talked about over at the White House, and I think we owe it to the American people. Honestly, I think that if we were able to come up with a bipartisan tax reform bill, the country would be astonished--it would be shocked--that we were actually working together in the best interest of the American people, rather than relying on the same old, tired talking points and being sort of ensconced in our own bunkers, lobbing shots across some demilitarized zone at each other, politically. I think the American people are tired of that. Frankly, some of us who have been here a while are frustrated by the lack of productivity and by resorting to those same old tired talking points, living in these bunkers and not getting as much done as we need to for the American people.  There is a good reason why large-scale changes in our Tax Code haven't been made since 1986, and that is because it is hard. It is hard to get a consensus on a bipartisan basis, but it is long overdue, and the American people are demanding it.  The first step in the process of passing pro-growth tax reform that will leave you with more of what you earn in your pocket and will actually raise the living standards of hard-working families is for us to pass a budget resolution this week to give the Congress the tools we need to get the job done. Now, it may very well be--well, I can hope, anyway--that we won't need to resort to the technical tools we get from a budget resolution, the reconciliation instructions, and that we can actually do this on a bipartisan basis, but if we can't, then this budget resolution will provide a roadmap for tax reform and provide a pathway to get our Federal spending under control, not by cutting but by reducing the rate of growth in some of our programs.  I don't know anybody who believes that the current Tax Code is working. One of the flaws in our Tax Code is that it favors production overseas as opposed to buying and building in It keeps overseas trillions of dollars that could be brought back here and used productively growing businesses, creating jobs, and increasing wages. Keeping your corporate headquarters in Dallas or Denton instead of Delhi or Dubai shouldn't be a disadvantage, although that is what happens under our current Tax  Of course, we know that for every provision in the Tax Code, there is some lobbyist, some entrenched special interest that is going to fight like the dickens to keep that provision in the Tax We have already heard some of the lazy arguments and the scare-mongering that are always based on unjustifiable assumptions. In this case, there are some people who say: Well, if we let people actually keep more of what they earn, it won't change their behavior at all. They say: If we let businesses keep more of what a business earns, they won't invest it in their own business and create new jobs. I think that defies common sense, and it defies experience. That is why we see, on the business side, countries like Ireland, which used to have one of the highest tax rates in the world, or the United Kingdom, cutting their business tax rate--because they realize that brings businesses to their country, it creates jobs, and it helps grow the economy and make a lot of other important things possible.  Two recent studies illustrate why the naysayers are off base. One is by the White House Council of Economic Advisers and shows a clear linkage between corporate tax rates and real wages. It shows that reducing the corporate rate--this may not seem obvious on its face, but this study says that reducing the business rate for corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent will translate into a minimum of a $4,000 increase in income for the average household. The second study comes from another expert at Boston University and concludes that lowering the corporate rate from 35 to 20 percent will mean a rise in income of $3,500 per household.  This used to be a bipartisan acknowledgment. I remember that in 2011 President Obama gave a speech to a joint session of Congress where he acknowledged that we needed to cut our business rates to bring that money back here onshore and to keep our businesses from moving to other countries.  I mentioned several times on the floor recently that I was shocked when I read an article a couple weekends ago that said that IBM--one of the largest corporations in the world--has more employees in India than it does in the United I am sure that is caused by a number of factors--access to a workforce, a well-trained workforce, the cost of doing business--but it has to be influenced by our highest tax rate in the world.  These authors say the new plan that has been proposed by Republicans will raise the growth of the economy between 3 percent and 5 percent and real wages between 4 percent and 7 percent. If you cut corporate rates from the highest in the world to 20 percent, it will raise the wages of workers from 4 percent to 7 percent. Both of these studies suggest that tax reform will benefit working  I have to tell you that the President made this point over and over again at the meeting we had this morning. He said: I am not interested in giving tax breaks to the wealthy. I want more middle-class, hard-working families to see the benefit of tax reform. He said: People who are wealthy are doing just fine. They don't need any help in the Tax  But the people who do need help are hard-working families who are seeing stagnant wages or seeing their standard of living decrease because of their high tax rates. So who in good faith could stand in the way of this happening? Who would stop us from giving workers a raise?  Well, we are ready to hear all the preaching. I know it is coming, but that shouldn't deter us from doing our designated task. We shouldn't allow petty ignorance to go unchallenged, and the sort of deliberate class warfare that pits different taxpayers against each other--we should not tolerate that.  Let me conclude because I know other colleagues want to speak. The American people are anxious, and they are frustrated. They are upset with what they see happening in Washington--or I should say not happening[[Page S6516]]in The reason is because they want us to realize the two points I just mentioned. They are waiting for us to get it and to base our fiscal policy on what is honest and true.  We can't ignore this issue any longer, and we will not--first by passing the budget resolution this week and then moving on a bipartisan basis through the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, to come up, hopefully, with a consensus tax reform plan that will get our economy growing again and allow hard-working American workers to keep more of what they earn and, in the process, help improve their standard of living.

802,topic-id,2289,"Mr.President, the first step to achieving our goal of overhauling our antiquated and uncompetitive Tax Code is passing a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, and we have made the first step in that journey earlier today. No one should be confused about this. A vote for the budget is a vote for tax reform. In converse, a vote against the budget is a vote against tax reform.  I don't know anybody in America who thinks that our Tax Code is a paragon of simplicity, efficiency, and virtue. To the contrary, I think most Americans realize that our Tax Code is simply too complex and that our Tax Code punishes taxpayers here at home by keeping overseas money earned overseas, rather than being brought back home and being invested in jobs and wages in  The budget resolution will steer our Nation into a safer and sounder fiscal course through a combination of restraining spending, reducing tax burdens, and strengthening our economy. Strengthening our economy really needs to be the focus, like a laser, that we have on what we are all about here--trying to get the economy to grow again faster.  We know that since the great recession of 2008, our economy has experienced anemic economic growth. Last quarter we saw that our economy, instead of growing at the annual rate of about 1.8 percent, grew at 3.1 percent. Why is that important? Well, when the economy grows faster, that means that people are finding more work to do and they are paying their taxes to the That eases the financial burdens of the U.Government while allowing people to keep more of what they earn in their pockets.  Here are some of the goals that we are attempting to accomplish by the 10-year budget resolution. First of all, we want to try to restrain Federal spending, parts of which go up at the rate of 5.5 percent or more a year and is about 70 percent of what the government spends. I know most people focus on the 30 percent that Congress appropriates, but, really, that is not the biggest part of the problem. That 30 percent includes about $600-plus billion for defense spending alone. But the 70 percent of the money that is spent on auto pilot through mandatory spending programs grows at the rate of about 5.5 percent per year. That is the reason why we are seeing huge annual deficits and unsustainable debt. So restraining spending is an important goal of our budget.  Reducing nondefense discretionary spending is also important. Part of having a budget is establishing our priorities. That is what we do in our household budgets. That is what we do in our individual budget. That is what countries need to do in their budgets. We need to determine what our 1 priority is.  Well, I happen to believe that the safety and security of the American people is our 1 priority. That is why I believe defense spending is so important. While there are other things we would like to do, just like there are other things we would like to be able to buy as an individual or as a household, sometimes you simply can't afford it, recognizing the priorities that are important to you and to your family. Defense spending is the 1 priority of the Federal Nobody else can do that. We can't do it as individuals. We can't do it as That is why it needs to be our national priority.  This budget also provides for the maximum level of defense funding allowed under the law, while allowing for an adjustment if an agreement on revised funding levels is reached. It provides a glidepath to an on-budget surplus, leaving aside Social Security entirely.  Most importantly, the budget will provide Congress with the roadmap forward in the goal of being able to pass tax reform and ultimately allowing middle-class Americans to keep more of their hard-earned pay.  Helping working families is one of the most important benefits of tax reform, but it is not the only benefit. Equally important is enhancing our Nation's competitiveness in a global economy and achieving growth for our job creators.  We have a self-inflicted wound caused by our Tax Code when competing with other countries around the world. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Why is that important? Why should we care what corporations pay in taxes? Because that influences how much money is paid to shareholders. It influences how much money can be paid in wages to people employed by[[Page S6431]]businesses. What we have seen frankly is a negative incentive for companies to move their businesses overseas.  About a week or so ago I remember reading an article--I think it was in the Wall Street Journal--that said IBM now has more employees in India than it has in the United I am sure that is caused by a number of circumstances--perhaps access to the workforce, perhaps the markets that are available to the company--but I have to believe that at least some of that is caused by our Tax It is cheaper, more efficient, and more cost effective to develop those jobs and that business overseas than it is here at home. Why in the world would we want to sustain that status quo? That is one of the things we are trying to do in our tax reform--enhancing our competitiveness and achieving growth for our job creators right here in  It used to be that reducing the business tax was a bipartisan effort. In 2011, when President Obama was President of the United States, he gave a speech to a joint session of Congress where he called it a national priority, recognizing that having the highest corporate rate in the world moved business overseas and it hurt workers here in  The Democratic leader, our friend and colleague from New York, has previously advocated reducing that corporate tax rate because he recognizes the benefits to workers and working families right here in So, occasionally, we have to remind them, when they come out and say harsh and frankly untrue things about what we are trying to do, that they used to be for the very same things that we are now advocating for today.  There are other significant pieces, too, such as those that affect the people in my State and those who work in the energy sector. It is no secret that Texas leads the Nation in energy production. I know people think that it is only about oil and gas, but we are actually the 1 electricity producer from wind energy in the country. So we believe, literally, in an ``all of the above'' policy when it comes to energy.  We know that some parts of the energy sector, particularly those refiners in the oil and gas sector, spent the past month and a half trying to recover from Hurricane Harvey, and at least 25 refineries were closed temporarily because of the storm. Why should you or I care about refineries that were closed because of the storm? Because all you had to do after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas was to look at the price you pay for gasoline. It has skyrocketed because of the closed refineries. It actually benefits the entire Nation and consumers when energy prices are low.  Operations have now resumed in some areas and, thankfully, some of those higher prices at the pump have dropped, but the hurricane underscored the need to ensure our energy sector's ongoing dynamism and vitality. That is where tax reform can help as well.  One component of our proposal is a territorial tax system. Companies such as Apple, IBM, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil all have headquarters in the United States, and they have earned money overseas. One has to wonder: Why in the world wouldn't they want to bring that back to the United States and invest it in businesses and paychecks here in America? That is because under our current tax structure, they have to pay taxes on the money they earn overseas, but if they want to bring it back to the United States, they have to pay taxes again up to a 35-percent corporate tax rate on the same money. So they make the rational decision and keep the money overseas. They build their businesses there and hire more workers abroad and not here at home. Why in the world would we want to maintain that sort of self-destructive status quo?  A new territorial tax system is going to be an important part of tax reform, and it is not to help big businesses. It is to help workers who are looking for work or people who are working who have had stagnant wages and are looking for a little extra in their paycheck each month. That is why it is so important.  In addition, we plan to help decrease the cost of investing in things like new plants and equipment in Things like expensing rather than depreciating over many years investment in new equipment and new businesses are really important to encourage those businesses to modernize their plants and, again, to hire more workers.  Tax reform represents an opportunity to cement America's position as the world's largest energy producer, as well, rather than one of those regulatory exercises that, unfortunately, happens far too often and ends up increasing the cost of creating jobs in the energy sector. I will continue to be an advocate for the countless number of Texans whose livelihoods depend on this sector of our economy while it continues to face challenges on a multitude of fronts.  Getting back to my point about the price of gasoline, if we drive a car, we are all paying for gasoline. It just makes sense to do what we can to help that price get lower, and we all benefit. One of those ways we can do that is through regulatory reform and the second is through tax reform.                                 NAFTA  Mr.President, I mentioned Hurricane Harvey earlier, but that is not the only challenge. Another potential challenge, I should mention, is This is the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is a 20-year-old trade agreement that includes Canada, Mexico, and the United This is a topic I will have a chance to speak about further at the Hoover Institution this afternoon.  As most of us know, the NAFTA negotiations are ongoing. President Trump has said--at least his administration, Ambassador Lighthizer, and the Commerce Secretary have said that their attitude toward renegotiating NAFTA is first to do no harm. I really appreciate that because NAFTA has been an important part of our trading relationships with Mexico and Canada, and it supports about 14 million jobs in commerce between our 3 countries in North  Since the administration announced its intent to revisit NAFTA, I think it is important to revisit the critical role that NAFTA has played in all North American energy markets, including electricity, renewables, oil, and natural gas. As I wrote in a letter to Ambassador Lighthizer this summer, each market is highly integrated with and remains dependent on vital energy infrastructure and trade crossings that border the United States, Canada, and  Free trade and the free-trade agreements, such as NAFTA, allow the United States to maximize the benefits of being the world's largest energy producer. If you have been paying attention, you know that our energy industry has undergone dramatic changes over the past two decades. I remember when we were worried about having to import liquefied natural gas from places around the world to our own shores before the natural gas revolution took place here in America, thanks to improvements in technology and drilling techniques.  Now we have such cheap and plentiful natural gas that we can export that gas around the world. It is just not an economic boom. It is a way for us to provide alternative energy resources to some of our friends and allies around the world, particularly in Europe, where Mr.Putin uses energy as a weapon, threatening to shut off energy supplies if countries in his neighborhood don't cooperate.  So opening Mexico's energy market has positioned U.companies to meet Mexico's needs for technical expertise and capital. As my friends south of the border reminded me, they said the Eagle Ford shale, which is one of the most plentiful sources of natural gas in the world, doesn't stop at the Rio So as we provide additional technical expertise and capital to Mexico, we can expect for them to experience the sort of energy renaissance we ourselves have experienced in the United  During the NAFTA negotiations, we should seek to promote North American energy security by maintaining and protecting rules that reduce or eliminate barriers to U.investment in Mexico and Opportunities like this are why NAFTA could benefit from an update rather than a repeal.  Former Secretary of State George Shultz reminded us yesterday in the New York Times that NAFTA has helped a wide range of U.manufacturing industries like auto, electronics, and aerospace become more competitive relative to their foreign competitors. Secretary Shultz also pointed out[[Page S6432]]how that increased competitiveness is fostered. It has resulted mainly from the development throughout the last 24 years of strong vertical supply chains that take advantage of economies of scale. Thanks to NAFTA, economic production can take place wherever in North America it is most efficient.  Let's remember all of this as negotiations continue. Let's seek to preserve all of the good we have inherited from NAFTA and update all that is outdated in  I yield the floor.

This might well be the best and most well-run budget consideration process during my time in the Certainly, for the fact that Senator Enzi has gotten us to this point at this time of night, when typically this ends in the wee hours of the morning, I think he is to be commended.  The resolution has gone through regular order from the start, working its way through the Budget Committee where amendments were considered and adopted from both sides. Chairman Enzi has been a very effective floor manager as we have been considering the budget resolution, obtaining consensus from both sides of the aisle to ensure that the Senate has considered a number of amendments in a timely fashion. That is something that is not always so common around here.  I want to take a moment to note the great job the chairman has done in getting us to this point.

565,topic-id,331,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about the significance of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding Iran, more commonly referred to as the Iran nuclear agreement.  I have always been a vocal advocate for tough sanctions on While I was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in 2010, I was a member of the conference committee which drafted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment These sanctions, in 2010 and subsequently, did make a difference.  Unfortunately, Iran continues to support terrorist organizations, and its record on human rights is well known. But we should not withhold certification of the Iran nuclear agreement without credible evidence that Iran is not complying. Let's remember, this agreement has always been about Iran, not obtaining nuclear weapons.  Doing so would strip the United States of our credibility in future international agreements not just with Iran, but with our allies as well.  In addition to Iran, we negotiated the Iran nuclear agreement with the United Kingdom, Germany, European Union, China, and Russia, and we must keep our word. In other words, to remain credible, the United States cannot change positions on international agreements from one administration to another without serious justification and without the consent in working with our allies.  Especially now, as we are facing an increasing threat with North Korea, we must work with our allies and, together, make a safer world through a comprehensive strategy that involves diplomacy, sanctions, and, yes, deterrence, if we must use such force. We have methods for addressing Iran's nonnuclear behavior besides refusing to recertify the agreement, and I will continue to advocate for the use of these tools to take a strong stance against Iran for their support of terrorist state activities and their abuse of human rights.  But refusing to recertify the Iran nuclear agreement, without clear evidence that Iran has breached the agreement, will deeply damage our relationships with our allies, and it will weaken our credibility worldwide.

566,topic-id,296,"Mr.Speaker, today, I rise to commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, which is from September 15 to October 15 every year.  This month we honor and celebrate the history, culture, achievements, and contributions of Hispanic leaders in communities throughout our great country. From serving in our Armed Forces, to starting businesses that further develop our economy and provide employment for Americans, Hispanics have contributed great advancements in science, medicine, literature, and education. The Hispanic community and its people have been critical in shaping our Nation and the valley that I have the honor to represent.  For example, in my home State of California alone, there are over 815,000 Hispanic- or Latino-owned companies, which, together, generate over $98.9 billion in general receipts in our economy. In Fresno, Merced, and Madera counties, which I represent, there are nearly 27,000 Hispanic- or Latino-owned companies, which, together, generated, last year, over $2 billion, $700 million in our economy.  The story of our Hispanic friends, neighbors, and loved ones is the story of the American Dream, as they have the same hope and aspiration that all Americans have: to make a better life for themselves and their families through hard work, access to a better education, and equal treatment under the law.  Let us remember, after all, we are a nation of immigrants past and present.  For over 250 years, since the formation of the United States, immigrants have come from all over the world to America to have a better life for themselves and, in turn, have made us the greatest country in the world.  During Hispanic Heritage Month, I am honored to celebrate the community whose determination and achievements are an integral part of not only our Nation, but the San Joaquin Valley that I have the honor to represent.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7925.txt,1774,ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR DISASTER RELIEF REQUIREMENTS,2017.0,11.0,October
60,topic-id,820,"Mr.Speaker, going back to the days of Teddy Roosevelt, it has been a bipartisan principle that protecting the public health in America's environment is the sacred obligation of all of us who have the honor to serve this Nation in elective or appointed office. Unfortunately, the Administrator of the EPA, Mr.Scott Pruitt, didn't get that memo.  Yesterday, Mr.Pruitt announced that he is precipitously going to strike down the Clean Power Plan rule sometime later today, which will turn the clock back in this country in terms of trying to get our arms around the issue of rising carbon emissions that scientists from across all sectors have universally recognized are causing rising sea temperature, rising sea levels, affecting climate, and clearly are linked to manmade carbon emissions that have been tracked for decades going back in time.  Mr.Pruitt's argument is based on the discredited view that carbon pollution does not fall under the Clean Air Act, which is what the last administration was proceeding on when they actually designed the Clean Power Plan rule.  The facts are these:  In 1963, this Congress passed the Clean Air It was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson and has been amended a number of times on a bipartisan basis to strengthen and enhance the protections that were built into that law when it was, again, enacted many years ago. In fact, in 1990, George Herbert Walker Bush signed the last update and upgrade to the Clean Air Act, which is exactly what the prior administration was proceeding under when they designed the rule.  The Supreme Court has weighed in on this question about whether or not greenhouse gases are covered under the Clean Air In 2007, in Massachusetts v. EPA, a Republican-majority Court ruled in favor of the fact that greenhouse gases are in fact covered under the statutory umbrella of the Clean Air This is what the Court said:       Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air      Act's capacious definition of ``air pollutant,'' we hold that      EPA has the statutory authority to regulate the emission of      such gases.  In 2014, the Court reenforced that ruling in a decision written by Antonin Scalia, the godfather of conservative lawyers all across this country, which reiterated the fact that greenhouse gases emitted from power plants are, in fact, subject to the scope and authority of the Clean Air  Unfortunately, today, the EPA Administrator is completely striking down that important advance in terms of protecting the public health of this country and putting nothing in place. There is no alternative that Mr.Pruitt is putting out there in terms of trying to get this country to move forward on clean power.  It is unfortunate because, as the International Energy Agency announced this morning, for the first time ever, solar energy production now surpasses any other form of power production in the world. The same thing is happening here in the U.because of the renewable energy tax credits.  In my State of Connecticut, renewable energy solar panel jobs far exceed any other power production job in the We are seeing an incredible proliferation of people installing panels on their homes and businesses.  The U.Navy in Groton, Connecticut, now has solar panels on all Navy housing as well as a solar field to power the Nation's oldest submarine base, which is there.  The decision by Mr.Pruitt is not a pro-growth, pro-economic decision. It is simply responding, unfortunately, to political forces that drove this administration to power from the fossil fuel industry.  The only saving grace of Mr.Pruitt's order is that he allows a large and long public comment period for the people of this country who do care about clean air and who do care about our environment to weigh in on this reckless decision that turns the clock back for public health and safety and for our economy. That is where the growth is going to be, in renewables, and not power production of the past.[[Page H7894]]  It is not a war on coal. Coal production is not singled out in the Clean Power Plan regulations. But what it does say is that any plant, whether it is coal, natural gas, or solar panels, you have got to address the question of carbon emissions. You don't get to produce that power and then leave a mess behind you. That is a very simple principle that I think every American can understand.  Unfortunately, it is about to be torpedoed by the EPA Administrator, who, by the way, was in the courtroom trying to argue against this in the courts back in 2014 and came out on the losing decision. I guess he got his revenge not just on the Court but, unfortunately, all of us who have to live with this terrible rule.  Mr.Speaker, again, let's reverse that decision. Let's move toward the future with a type of power that will protect the environment and grow jobs.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-10-pt1-PgH7893-4.txt,1836,ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR DISASTER RELIEF REQUIREMENTS,2017.0,10.0,October
35,topic-id,392,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.3031, the TSP Modernization Act of 2017.  I thank the Government Operations Subcommittee chairman, Mr.Meadows, for working with me in a bipartisan manner on this commonsense, good government bill. I also thank the Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman, Mr.Gowdy, for his support of this legislation.  Congressman Meadows and I introduced this legislation to make the Federal Government's Thrift Savings Plan more closely align with private sector best practices by allowing TSP participants more flexible withdrawal options.  In 2013, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board found that employees who separated from Federal service transferred $9 billion out of their TSP accounts to other financial institutions. TSP participants do this because private sector 401(k) plans provide more flexibility, and they wanted more options for withdrawing money in case they needed it.  A 2014 survey of TSP participants who withdrew funds showed that more than 50 percent reported that they wanted more flexibility to withdraw funds to address life events.  Current law limits participants to only one withdrawal from their TSP accounts while in Federal service after reaching age 59\1/2\, and participants who make this type of age-based withdrawal cannot take another partial withdrawal once they separate from service. Similarly, participants who are separated from Federal service and who have not made a prior age-based withdrawal are restricted to making only one partial separation withdrawal.  H.3031 would eliminate these restrictions and allow participants to make multiple age-based and post-separation withdrawals from TSP accounts. The bill also would allow participants to elect to combine partial withdrawals with an annuity. It also would eliminate automatic annuities as a default option in the absence of an election by participants.  By providing greater withdrawal flexibility, studies show that participants would be more likely to keep their assets in their TSP accounts. For example, a study issued by Vanguard in 2013 found that 50 percent more participants and assets remain in retirement plans when partial disbursements are allowed.  Providing more withdrawal options for Federal employees and retirees in the TSP may help their financial security since administrative fees for the TSP are much lower than fees charged by other financial institutions.  This legislation is supported by the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the National Treasury Employees  ",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7954.txt,256,ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR DISASTER RELIEF REQUIREMENTS,2017.0,11.0,October

I introduced the All Circuit Review Act, Mr.Speaker, to send a clear message to all Federal employees who blow the whistle on wrongdoing that we here in Congress have their backs.

Representative Farenthold has been a steadfast supporter of this basic due process right for Federal employees.  The bill we are considering today makes permanent a pilot provision that was included in the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, which was signed into law in 2012. That pilot provision will expire in November if we do not send this bill to the President before then.  Without this bill, whistleblowers could appeal a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board only to the U.Court of Appeals for the Federal The Federal circuit has historically been overly restrictive of whistleblower rights.  According to the Merit Systems Protection Board, 29 cases have been appealed to courts other than the Federal circuit since 2012. The Project On Government Oversight sent a letter to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on May 2, 2017, in strong support of this bill. Executive Director Danielle Brian wrote as follows: ``The pilot program has been a success. It has not resulted in a flood of whistleblower appeals as opponents of the program asserted it would do, and it allows for potential circuit splits, which encourage sister circuits to review the laws and allows for possible Supreme Court review. It is working exactly as intended and should be made permanent before it expires in November 2017.''  The bill was approved by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee without opposition in Two years ago, Congress approved an extension of the All Circuit Review Extension Act pilot program in 2014 without a single negative vote.

479,topic-id,1087,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, as the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the committee with oversight jurisdiction over Federal workers and agencies, I am one of the staunchest supporters of whistleblower protections in the I strongly support enhancing protections for the brave men and women who put their careers on the line to speak out against waste, fraud, and abuse.  I fully support the intent of 585 to protect whistleblowers who face investigations in retaliation for their disclosures. But I am disappointed that the Republican leadership chose not to consider this measure under regular order.  House Republicans rushed this legislation directly to the floor, bypassing any consideration by the Oversight Committee or the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which have jurisdiction over the bill. It is especially disappointing that my committee was not given the opportunity to address constitutional and privacy concerns raised by the Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management about the bill. That is what I said: the Trump administration's concerns about it.  It is even more disheartening that the Rules Committee issued a closed rule for this bill. They blocked all three germane amendments that I submitted, including an amendment to fix the problems identified by the  The measure before us today would change the procedures for disciplining Federal supervisors who retaliate against employees who blow the whistle. It would require agency heads to impose suspensions of at least 3 days for a first offense, and termination for a second offense whenever an agency head, administrative law judge, the Merit Systems Protection Board, a Federal judge, or an inspector general finds that a supervisor retaliated against an employee who blew the whistle.  It also would reduce the length of the notice requirement for proposed disciplinary action from 30 days to 14 days. It would eliminate the option to hold a hearing if a supervisor contests a proposed disciplinary action. It would change the current burden of proof for demonstrating retaliation from a preponderance of the evidence to require agency heads to impose disciplinary action in any case in which a supervisor does not furnish evidence or if the head of the agency determines that such evidence is not sufficient to reverse the proposed action.  The bill also would require an agency head, when an employee may have committed suicide, to refer any information to the Office of Special Counsel indicating that the employee had blown the whistle and that the agency took personnel action against the employee.  The OPM has questioned whether some of the provisions in the bill would withstand constitutional scrutiny if challenged in court, and I agree with the OPM on that issue.  For example, the OPM explained that the bill's requirement to propose minimum penalties of 3 days' suspension for the first offense and termination for second offenses could violate due process protections. These protections require agencies to notify employees of factors they will consider regarding proposed penalties for findings of wrongdoing and to provide employees with meaningful opportunities to respond. The United States Supreme Court and Federal Circuit Courts have ruled that Federal employees are entitled to these protections. After all, they are  But according to the OPM, the bill would eliminate agency consideration of many of the 12 factors that were set force by the Merit Systems Protection Board in Douglas v. Veterans Administration in 1981. The Board uses these so-called Douglas factors to assess the reasonableness of penalties, and agency officials who propose or decide adverse actions against employees must concurrently consider these factors.  Concerns have also been raised that by reducing the current requirement for 30 days' notice of adverse action to 14 days, lowering the existing burden of proof, and eliminating the option for hearings, the bill could be challenged on the basis that it does not give supervisors sufficiently meaningful opportunities to respond to accusations of retaliation.  In addition, although the intent of the bill is to enhance protections for whistleblowers, there is some concern that it would be misused to harm whistleblowers. For example, an agency head could utilize the bill's abbreviated disciplinary processes in bad faith to retaliate against supervisors who blow the whistle on high-level waste, fraud, or abuse.  Lastly, the provision requiring agency heads to refer information to the Office of Special Counsel regarding employees who may have committed suicide raises important privacy questions. The bill does not include any provision requiring agencies to obtain permission from family members before sharing information about an employee's death. It is unfortunate that the House has failed to take the opportunity to fix these flaws in this measure.  The second amendment that I presented would have protected the privacy interests of employees who commit suicide by requiring written permission from their next of kin before agency heads disclose the details about the death.  And another amendment that I submitted would have made corrections in the underlying bill to ensure that managers who violate whistleblower rights will be held accountable, while safeguarding due process rights.  Finally, the third amendment was the text of my bipartisan bill, H.702, the Federal Employee Anti-Discrimination Act of 2017, which passed the House by a voice vote under suspension of the rules earlier in this Congress, and also passed the House by a vote of 403-0 in the last  This amendment would have expanded the protections for employees who suffer retaliation and discrimination. It also would have prohibited the use of nondisclosure agreements to prevent employees from disclosing waste, fraud, or abuse to Congress, to the Office of Special Counsel, and inspector generals.  I expect the bill, as it now stands, to engender substantial litigation that may have to be addressed by the courts. It would, indeed, be unfortunate if that litigation resulted in overturning disciplinary action against an employee who retaliated against a whistleblower, when we could have acted today to address the constitutional concerns.  As I said before the Rules Committee, sometimes I think we can get so caught up in our partisan battles, that even when we come with good suggestions as to how to make a piece of legislation better and more effective and certainly come within the bounds[[Page H8001]]of the Constitution, we are blinded by what we see; and that is this battle between Republicans and Democrats, Mr.Speaker, and we don't come up, sometimes with the very best product.  But even with all that, because I am so concerned about whistleblowers, I plan to vote for the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

484,topic-id,1401,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.DeFazio), the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and one who has been a staunch supporter of whistleblowers.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I would agree with many of the gentleman's concerns and comments regarding the lack of a real legislative process here. The bill could be better. But nonetheless, like the ranking member, I will be supporting the legislation despite those concerns because it is absolutely urgent.  I have a totally dysfunctional management at the VA hospital in Roseburg, A number of years ago, a whistleblower came to me and said that substandard care was being provided. We asked the Office of Inspector General to look into it. They whitewashed it, and then it came out in the Senate testimony that the Office of Special Counsel had found that this doctor had been penalized as a whistleblower because he was pointing to substandard care.  I asked for another investigation and ultimately found, yes, indeed, substandard care was being provided by the head surgeon. He was suspended from his duties but is still the head surgeon. Now he has run another very accomplished doctor, under very dubious circumstances, out of my Eugene clinic. This is a surgeon who served 29 years, honorably, in the military, 10 years at my regional hospital with rave reviews, and, after 30 days at my new VA clinic in Eugene, was dismissed in the most unusual way with no allegations put forward.  Mr.Speaker, again, it seems that we are having issues here when the quality is substandard that this one person is able to basically just get rid of the folks who are raising concerns about the care of veterans. Again, this shouldn't happen.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the record two letters regarding the dismissed doctor.                                                 October 17, 2017.       Dear Mr.DeFazio: I am a contracted physician in the      emergency department at the Roseburg I have been working      at this facility since 2010. During that time I have truly      enjoyed providing care for the veterans. However, I have      significant concerns regarding the administration and      inefficiencies in healthcare, in the VA system.      Unfortunately, it seems that advancement of careers and the      fluffing of numbers supersede patient care.       Despite the build up of these concerns over the years, I      have recently became aware of an action that compels me to go      beyond the normal chain of command. One of the surgeons      working at the Eugene campus--still under the Roseburg      administration--was fired recently under very concerning      circumstances.       Scott Russi was working at the Eugene VA for less than      1 month when he was pushed out and fired. I know Russi      from the private sector. In addition to working at the      Roseburg VA, I have worked for the last ten years at Sacred      Heart RiverBend--a trauma, stroke, and cardiac center--and      one of the largest hospitals in the state. I worked alongside      Russi for many years at RiverBend and I found him to be      not only extremely competent and hardworking, but always very      professional. I was sad to see him leave RiverBend, but I was      encouraged that he would be working in the VA system as I      felt he would significantly improve the quality of care for      the veterans.       I find it very disheartening that a group of administrative      physicians, who rarely practice medicine, are able to strike      down such a promising figure simply because they seem to have      felt threatened by him. I know there are many people who are      upset by this firing and who have concerns about this system      in general. I have tried many times to discuss my concerns      with people in the administration and have been met with, at      best, excuses and, at worst, threats. It is clear to me as      somewhat of an outsider and observer (as I am not actually a      VA employee) that physicians who are dedicated to patient      care and most skilled are threatening to the administration.      These physicians are often ostracized and pushed out--and      when they can't be pushed out, false rumors are spread about      them. I have considered stepping away from the VA system due      to these continuing frustrations. It is disheartening to see      these veterans treated with such carelessness. However, I      feel that someone has to stay and actually care for them,      but, if I stay, I also want to try to make the system a      better place for them. For many, this is their only health      care.       I wish this was as exaggerated as it may sound, but      unfortunately this is only a small piece of a huge problem.      If you are interested in more details, I am more than happy      to discuss this further. In general, I keep my head down and      do what I think is best, but this presents itself as a moment      when speaking out is necessary and right.           Thank you,     Charlotte Ransom,                                  ____       Congressman DeFazio: I am writing to ask for your help. I      am a surgeon and a veteran having attended the Usafa and      graduating in 1984, completing medical school on Hpsp      scholarship and spending the next 29 years on active duty. I      deployed four times as a combat surgeon and once as a      hospital commander, my last deployment in 2012 was as the      Dccs of Craig Joint Theater Hospital, Bagram Ab,      I retired in October of 2013 and settled in Oregon as a      trauma surgeon eventually becoming the Trauma Medical      Director at I was the on-call surgeon the tragic      day Ucc suffered the active shooter event. I recently left my      civilian practice to serve our Veterans, for reasons I think      you would understand; I have seen the care my comrades have      been given and found it wanting, and serving my Vets is      therapeutic for my Ptsd and the sorrow I carry for not being      able to save more soldiers. I am the new surgeon at the Va      Eugene Hcc and have been working there part-time since      January of this year and full time since 23 Today I was      handed a summary suspension of clinical privileges as a      surgeon by the parent Va, Roseburg and Dinesh Ranjan the      chief of surgery. I have been denied the opportunity to      defend my reputation, denied the opportunity to stand before      my peers, and denied any opportunity to see the allegations.      And tonight, I have spoken with two Va physicians (Lisa      Brandenburger and Philo Calhoun) whose lives were      dedicated to serving Veterans but were irreparably damaged by      I am now being targeted by Ranjan because he      recruited me with the promise of a salary of $385,000, I      signed a contract for that[[Page H8002]]     amount but I am being paid $280,000. Because I expressed to      the Eugene Hcc administrator I felt I was misled about the      salary, Ranjan has gone after my clinical privileges, had      them summarily dismissed and placed me at risk of being      reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (Npdb). I      have been suspended from patient contact for 30 days for an      investigation. If the investigation finds me deficient, I      will be reported to the If the investigation extends      beyond 30 days, I will be reported to the If I am fired      or quit my job, I will be reported to the If I am      reported to the Npdb I will never work again as a surgeon.       I know it all sounds unbelievable, I think it is      unbelievable as I try and wrap my head around the events of      these last few days. I ask you not to send a congressional      inquiry to Mr.Paxton, as that would make my life worse. What      I thought would be my dream job, now has become a nightmare.           Respectfully,                                                      Scott  Mr.Mr.Speaker, since this has come out, I have had dozens of calls from nurses and doctors and other workers in the VA system in my region--in Eugene, Springfield, and southern Oregon, down to Roseburg, at those two facilities--because of this mismanagement. They say that the care is not up to standards, just like this particular physician was not providing modern care when he did colonoscopies.  We need--vitally need--this legislation and the strongest protection for whistleblowers. This isn't about protecting bad managers. It is about promoting qualified and keeping qualified employees, which we are having a hard time doing in my area. It is about providing the best care to our veterans, and that isn't going to happen if people can be intimidated or just shown the door when they raise concerns.

488,topic-id,490,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As I close, I take the opportunity to reiterate that I strongly support the objectives of 585. If there is anything that we agree on in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, it is that we must protect whistleblowers.  Many of the investigations that we have conducted have been as a result of somebody who saw something and said something. Like Kirkpatrick, I am sure, in most of those instances, it was very difficult for them because they, on the one hand, wanted to improve a situation or address a problem, but at the same time, they knew that it was possible that they, themselves, might be harmed and their families might be harmed. So they make a very, very difficult choice, a very difficult choice.  I am horrified that Kirkpatrick was so agonized by the treatment he endured at the Veterans Administration that he saw no options for himself. In other words, Mr.Speaker, he saw no way out. I worry that there are civil servants today who are enduring that same agony.  But we say to them that we will protect you with all we have got, and that is why I appreciate Senator Johnson's work on 585, and I share his commitment to protecting whistleblowers. For that reason, as I said earlier, I will vote in favor of this legislation.  That said, I wish that the Republican leadership had taken the opportunities that my amendments provided to improve this bill. These issues of equal protection are nothing to play with because we begin to chip away and chip away and chip away at employees' rights, and the next you know, those rights begin to disappear. Those are the kind of rights that are a part and the fabric of this thing we call a democracy. I think we have to be very, very, very careful. It is going to be interesting to see what the courts have to say about this legislation.  My amendments would have addressed the constitutional concerns raised by OPM--and I emphasize This was not the Obama This was the Trump  My amendments would also have protected the privacy of employees who take their own lives.

As some of you may know, Chris Kirkpatrick was a clinical psychologist at the VA in Tomah, He was a veteran, a graduate of Northwestern University, and a caring individual who dedicated his career to providing innovative treatments for veterans suffering from Most notably, he created a yoga program to help vets at the VA in He was known to be very well-liked by the patients he served.  In 2009, Kirkpatrick expressed concerns that his patients were being heavily overmedicated. It became so bad, he said, that he was unable to properly do his job. He wanted to do what was right for veterans, and as a veteran himself, he couldn't stand to see how careless some of the VA staff were being with high levels of dangerous medications.  Unfortunately, instead of looking into Kirkpatrick's claims, the facility's chief of staff told him to mind his own business, and to instead focus on his own work. Shortly thereafter, Kirkpatrick was called to a disciplinary meeting and given a written reprimand.  This type of retaliation went on for months.  Then, in July, Kirkpatrick complained again that a dangerous veteran had not been properly discharged, despite recommendations from a treatment team. A week after making the complaint, Kirkpatrick was fired from the  He was devastated. He begged for an opportunity to stay, and expressed concerns that he had been given too many complex cases, and that the emotional toll was too high. Again, his concerns were ignored.  That night, Kirkpatrick wrote a note to his girlfriend in Chicago, another to the kennel he wanted to take care of his dog, and one final note for the mailman. It read: ``Please call 911--tell them to go to red barn building.''  He had taken his own life. He was 38 years old.  Kirkpatrick's death was the product of a broken system--a system that encourages retaliation against whistleblowers, while ignoring the underlying causes of their concerns.  If Kirkpatrick's death wasn't tragic enough, a subsequent investigation at the VA found that a patient had died from ``mixed drug toxicity'', and that Kirkpatrick's concerns were completely warranted.  Not only did whistleblower retaliation cost Kirkpatrick his life, it cost the life of a patient as well.  That's why I urge you all to vote yes on the Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection  A yes vote means that VA personnel will no longer be able to access a whistleblower's medical records as means of discrediting them, which a separate investigation found happens far too often.  A yes vote means that federal agencies have to notify the Office of Special Counsel when a suicide takes place.  A yes means clear disciplinary actions for supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers, training for supervisors on how to properly respond, and a requirement that employees are made aware of the mental health services at their disposal.  A yes vote also means keeping upholding normal burdens of proof to strengthen protections for employees. This legislation calls for the Inspector General, Office of Special Counsel, or a Merit Systems Protection Board Administrative Judge to ``determine'' that a supervisor has committed a prohibited personnel action, meaning through the normal preponderance of the evidence for any other disciplinary action under Chapter 75 of title 5. This does not mean some arbitrary process for some bureaucrat to create later on.  I want to be clear: this legislation strengthens protections for patriots--for those who are trying to do the right thing. For those who care about veterans and their safety.

The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning business.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.Mr.President, I came to the floor today in support of the budget resolution for one reason. It is because it provides the Senate a path forward on tax reform. I strongly support this effort to fix America's burdensome tax system. It is my hope that reform will lead to simplifying the Tax Code, strengthening the middle class, and ultimately boosting our economy.  Unfortunately, I cannot offer my support without reservation, so I have come to the floor today to explain my concerns and remind my colleagues of the important work ahead of us. Even as we support this resolution as a means to achieve meaningful tax reform, we must acknowledge the fact that the underlying budget contains an insufficient level of funding for national defense. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, my highest priority is to ensure that our men and women serving in uniform have the training, equipment, and resources they need to keep our Nation safe.  The Senate budget resolution will set fiscal year 2018 defense spending at the levels dictated by the Budget Control Act cap. This budget is $54 billion less than the President's request and $86 billion less than this body authorized just last month in the National Defense Authorization We passed the National Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 89 to 9, a demonstration of the overwhelming bipartisan belief that the Budget Control Act level of defense spending is inadequate and unacceptable.  Let be me clear. There is no BCA-level defense budget that would be sufficient to provide our military with what they need to fulfill current missions and prepare for future threats.  For those of us who have been paying attention, we heard the warnings of the steady decline of our military. Time and again our senior military and civilian defense leaders have sounded the alarm about the dangers of the Budget[[Page S6613]]Control Act spending caps. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our highest uniformed military officer, General Dunford, has warned that if we continue on the current path, he assesses that ``within 5 years, we will lose our ability to project power; the basis of how we defend the homeland, and advance U.interests, and meet our alliance commitments.''  Make no mistake about what that means. America's military advantage is degrading. Without the ability to project power, the United States will no longer be a global power. That means that we put at risk not only our ability to secure our interests and protect our Nation but also the unprecedented era of security and prosperity that American global leadership has provided the world.  I might add for the benefit of my colleagues that former President George Bush today gave a very strong statement emphasizing this problem and the challenge we face. This is the strategic reality we are facing in the next 5 years. It should not be a surprise. We have seen the steady degradation of the military. The strain of constant operational tempo, combined with inadequate and unstable funding has, over the past 16 years, worn down the greatest military in the world.  Just this week, Secretary of Defense Mattis sent a letter to the Armed Services Committee expressing his concerns with regard to the National Defense Authorization Act that we are currently negotiating with the The very first thing he said before addressing any of the policy changes and reforms in the bill is that his primary concern is the Budget Control Act, and we know why--because the defense spending caps are doing such immense harms to our military. Secretary Mattis wrote:       As I have testified before your committee, no enemy has      done more to harm the warfighting readiness of our military      than sequestration.  I will repeat that for the benefit of my colleagues.       . . . no enemy has done more to harm the warfighting      readiness of our military than sequestration. Current caps      continue to unnecessarily defer critical maintenance, limit      aviation availability, delay modernization, and strain our      men and women in uniform.  We have seen the evidence of this harm. Over the last few months there have been a rash of training accidents, collisions, and crashes. We are seeing the tragic accidents in the news far too often.  Seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a containership off the coast of  A Marine KC-130 crash in Mississippi killed all 16 troops on board.  An Osprey helicopter crashed off the coast of Australia and that resulted in the deaths of three marines.  An Army helicopter crashed off the coast of Hawaii, with five soldiers presumed dead.  Ten sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a tanker near  An Army Black Hawk helicopter went down during a training mission off the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died.  One soldier died during helicopter training at Fort  An amphibious vehicle explosion at Camp Pendleton injured 15  A demolition accident in Fort Bragg killed one soldier and injured seven others.  Two Navy pilots died in a T-45 crash in  My friends, we are now losing more of our men and women in uniform in totally avoidable training accidents than we are in combat. There is plenty of blame to go around for all of these incidents, but we cannot ignore the fact that Congress's inability to provide adequate, stable, and predictable budgeting has contributed to the troubling state of affairs. While increased funding is not the only answer, there is no scenario where our military can get healthy and ready to meet the challenges of an increasingly unstable world without additional resources. There is broad, bipartisan agreement about that from Members of the House of Representatives, here in the Senate, and the Yet we are about to vote for a budget resolution that severely underfunds the military because the reality is that we all know that it would not impact the actual appropriations. To solve these problems and to fulfill our duty to the men and women in uniform we must negotiate a bipartisan budget agreement that will lift the caps on defense spending. Only then can we rebuild the military, reverse the disturbing readiness crisis, and retain our ability to project power and secure our interests around the world.  I remind my colleagues that the fiscal year started 3 weeks ago and that the Defense Department is currently operating under a continuing resolution. We know the harmful effects it will have on the military. That is why getting to work on a budget deal is so urgent. We must delay no longer.  The budget resolution is not meant to provide that broader budget agreement. This budget resolution is simply a means to get us to tax reform. However, this budget resolution does represent something extremely troubling. The Republican Party used to be unified in its support for a strong national defense. If our leaders in Congress and the White House don't immediately get to work negotiating a deal to lift the defense caps and fund the military at a higher level than in this budget resolution, I am not sure we will be able to claim that mantle any longer.  I just want to sum up by saying that we have a problem in the military today, and that is, whenever there are cuts in defense spending, the first thing that goes are the easy ones--the training, readiness, the spare parts, the flying hours. Those are the ones that get cut first because they are the easiest. Cutting a major weapons system or program is extremely difficult.  So now we have this list, as I just read off, of men and women serving in the military and we are responsible, at least partially, for their death and injury. Why? Because they are not able to be trained. They are not able to be equipped. They are not able to be maintained, and 60 percent of the F-18s are not able to fly. We have sailors and airmen who are working 100-hour workweeks. We have gigantic problems with the ability to simply operate.  Meanwhile, our adversaries are stepping up their capabilities. Obviously, every time we turn around there is another crisis of some kind. Look at the world 8 years ago and look at the world today. You will find an incredible deterioration of America's position and influence in the world. The front page of the Economist magazine this week has a picture of the dictator of China and the title is ``The world's most powerful man,'' and it is true.  So here we are with a budget resolution that basically has cut our military--that is basically not funding what we need. My friends, I do not mean to get emotional, but why should we send these young men and women in uniform in harm's way without all they need in order to fight and defend this Nation? Right now, they are not ready. Right now, their planes can't fly. Right now, they are not able to operate and train. They are not ready, and that is not just McCain's word. That is our military leaders' words and those of some of the most respected people in America and in the world. General Mattis, General McMaster, and General Kelly will all tell you the same thing.  We are sending our young men and women into hazardous situations without their being completely equipped and capable of defending themselves. That is wrong. What greater responsibility do we have than to the men and women who are serving us in uniform today? Four just died in How many of the 100 Members of this body knew that we even had an operation in Niger? I will not go into the details, in deference to the family, but this is wrong, what we are doing. We saw it in the 1970s, and now we are seeing it again. It was Mark Twain who said: ``History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.'' It is beginning to rhyme, and if we don't, with this resolution that we are going through, increase our spending to the level as authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act, then we will bear some responsibility for what happens.

705,topic-id,746,"Mr.President, for more than 30 years, we have seen political battles over the Arctic Refuge--with some wanting to open the area for oil and gas leasing and many others believing that this pristine and ecologically important area should be given the highest protections available under the law. This week the fate of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge is again being taken up by the Senate, this time as part of the budget process.  There is no question that this is a divisive issue, one that deserves to be debated in the Senate, not taken up as part of the budget process with little to no debate, but Republicans are insisting on ramming an attempt to open the Arctic Refuge to drilling through using a partisan process because they know they lack the bipartisan support needed to properly debate the issue.  The President's budget estimated that leasing in the Arctic Refuge will generate $3.6 billion in revenues, but the President's budget estimates just don't add up. In order to meet that number, oil companies would need to bid an average of $2,400 per acre on every single acre of the 1.5 million acre coastal plain, more than 10 times the average lease sale bid on Alaska's North  We know this number is significantly inflated. If we look at other lease sales between 2010 and 2015, the industry bid[[Page S6532]]on less than 5 percent of the leases in Alaska's National Petroleum On top of that, oil supplies are currently at historic highs, so high that we lifted a 40-year ban on oil exports last year, and gas prices remained at long-term lows.  Today the United States is the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. We are importing less oil than we have at any point in almost three decades. In addition to the high oil supplies, industry has shown little interest in drilling in the Arctic In September 2015, after spending approximately $7 billion to drill and explore the region, Shell gave up on drilling in the Arctic region's Chukchi Sea due to the poor results and the high costs. Energy analysts predict very little interest in drilling in the Refuge for the foreseeable future.  So before we move ahead with leasing this area for oil and mineral exploration, we need to take a careful look at what we would be losing. The Arctic Refuge is one of America's last pristine, untouched wilderness places, and I think we should preserve it for future generations.  The Refuge is home to more than 200 wildlife species, including polar bears, musk ox, and caribou. The porcupine caribou herd travels to the coastal plain each summer to give birth to their young. The Refuge is the most important land denning site for a significant population of polar bears. Birds from all 50 States and 6 continents migrate to the Refuge for nesting and staging. Alaskan Native people still rely on the wildlife for basic sustenance and as a basis of their cultures.  In 2003, I had the opportunity to travel to the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and see firsthand the pristine wilderness. While I was there, I also had an opportunity to view areas that had been drilled for oil and gas. As you looked to the west, you could see a stark difference in the State lands that had been drilled for oil and gas and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that had not been drilled. It was easy to tell the two apart because the scars that were left on that State land that had been drilled were still there many years later. They didn't gingerly step in and drill and leave. They cut scars across that land that will be there forever.  There is no question that the impact drilling would have on the Arctic would be devastating and irreversible, and although oil and gas resources can be develop safely, we all know that leaks and spills happen. The resulting environmental damage can change the landscape forever.  The Arctic Refuge represents our Nation's finest example of intact, naturally functioning Arctic and subarctic ecosystems. Nowhere else in North America do we see such a broad spectrum of diverse habitats occurring within one area. We must protect it for future generations. We have a responsibility to protect this area for our children and grandchildren. Any attempt to move forward a budget reconciliation containing leases in the Arctic is a move in the wrong direction.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue).

I am proud to say that during my career, I have not shied away from tackling big issues.[[Page S6428]]  Maybe one of the toughest assignments I have ever had was in 2010, when President Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and It was known as the Simpson-Bowles I was one of 18 Republicans and Democrats given the responsibility of trying to find a way to balance America's budget and reform our country's largest spending programs and our Tax  This was no small task, but it was an important one. We spent month after month in bipartisan meetings working at it. Nearly a year after the Commission was created, we were asked to vote on the final report.  Simpson-Bowles was not a perfect plan, but I decided to vote in favor of the report, and I knew it would be controversial, but I believed then, as I do now, that there is only one honest way to reduce debt: cut spending, raise revenues, do not ignore the Tax Bowles-Simpson did just that. It raised revenue by eliminating a lot of the exclusions and deductions and efforts of the Tax Code to reward certain companies and special interests, and it cut spending for both defense and nondefense. To say nothing of the months-long bipartisan process--a far cry from the current reconciliation that we have been going through this year on the healthcare issue--there simply is no comparison between the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan and what the Republicans want to bring to the floor of the U.Senate and House this year in the name of tax reform.  Simpson-Bowles was about balancing our budget responsibly. It raised nearly $88 billion in revenue over the first decade, and unlike the Republican tax plan, it boosted the standard deduction and still retained the personal exemptions families claim on their taxes. It protected middle-income families from backdoor cuts, and--and I underline this--it ensured that the wealthy in America paid their fair share of taxes.  If there is one thing I can never understand, it is why the Republicans, in the name of budget deficits or in the name of tax reform, always end up in the same place--always cutting taxes on the wealthiest people in Where in the world is that coming from? I have met a lot of wealthy people in the course of my life; not one of them, with a straight face, has said to me: Senator, I desperately need a tax cut. They don't. Yet that is the fallback default position on every Republican plan.  Importantly, the Simpson-Bowles plan provided details of the hard choices necessary to reach our goal. There is simply no comparison between that comprehensive, bipartisan plan to balance the budget and the highly fiscally irresponsible Republican tax reform plan before us now that will literally add $2.4 trillion to the national debt.  How many times have Members on the Republican side of the aisle come to the floor to pose for holy pictures and to preach to us about the deficit? Now that they are in the majority and they have a President of their party, what is the first thing they do? They propose adding $2.4 trillion to the national debt.  Where are my colleagues across the aisle who have been the first to speak out and admonish the Democrats about their failure to recognize the Federal debt? Where is my colleague the majority leader of the Senate who was so quick to rail on the ``alarming level'' of our national debt during the Obama years? He is silent now.  Even the most stalwart of self-proclaimed fiscal hawks on the right are falling in line behind this phony plan, which would allow for $1.5 trillion in unpaid-for tax cuts--clinging on to economic growth projections no responsible economist would dream of using. They used to call this economic theory of cutting taxes on the rich and economic growth the Laffer curve. I have never heard a better named description of an economic theory. It is a laugher. And this Laffer curve inspired the Governor of Kansas to bring that State to near fiscal ruin, trying to apply that great theory and watching his State crumble in the process.  History has proven that tax cuts simply do not yield economic growth. The economic growth promises of the Bush tax cuts turned out to be completely false. Those tax cuts for the wealthy ballooned our deficits and our debt and contributed to a scandalous rise in income inequality in the United States of  Tax cuts don't pay for themselves, and I know my Republican colleagues know that.  When Republicans' rosy estimates of economic growth do, in fact, fail and the deficit is sky-rocketing, the Republican budget spells out exactly how they plan to pay for the tax cuts on the backs of hard-working Listen to this. To pay for the tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, the Republican tax reform plan--now, get this--uses $1 trillion in cuts from Medicaid and more than $470 billion in cuts from  Think about it. Health insurance for the elderly in America will take a $470 billion cut under the Republican tax reform plan--for what? To give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country--go figure--and then $1 trillion in cuts in  What is Medicaid for? Isn't it just health insurance for the poor? Well, in some respects, that is a good general description, but it is so much more. The Medicaid Program, which the Republicans return to time and time again to cut, is critically important for parts of Half of the children born in the State of Illinois are taken care of by Their mothers are taken care of before the baby is delivered and after. Plus, it is the 1 source of health insurance for the disabled across They want to cut $1 trillion out of it. I haven't even gotten close to the most expensive part of Two-thirds of seniors in America in nursing homes count on Medicaid to pay for their medical bills.  The Republicans want to cut $1 trillion out of Medicaid to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in What is going to happen to those folks in nursing homes? What is going to happen to the disabled who count on Medicaid? What is going to happen to those mothers and their babies? That is a legitimate question to ask.  Make no mistake, the real answer for who pays for these cuts doesn't involve fake economics; it involves real families across  Let's look at the plan for what it is. While claiming to fix our broken Tax Code, this Republican tax reform plan would instead provide nothing short of a windfall for the wealthiest in our country and stick hard-working families in Illinois and across the country with the bill.  Under the Republican plan, no less than 80 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of wealthiest Eighty percent of the benefits go to the wealthiest people in this country. That is more than three-quarters of all tax breaks going to people who make more than $730,000 a year. Is that why Members of the Senate were elected--to take care of people making more than $730,000 a year? Not in my  What about the middle-income Americans this plan is supposed to help? The Republican plan would raise taxes on nearly one-third of Americans who make between $50,000 and $150,000 a year. One-third of them will pay higher taxes. That is not tax relief for working families. In fact, the Republican plan would eliminate the State and local tax deduction--a deduction used by one-third of all taxpayers to reduce their tax bill. That has been part of our Tax Code from the beginning, and here is the theory: We believe, in the current Federal Tax Code, you shouldn't pay a tax on a tax. It is basic. If you are paying $1,000 in property taxes where you live right now, should you be taxed on that $1,000? Under the current Tax Code, no. You are able to deduct State and local taxes. The Republicans eliminate that deduction. If they have their way, families with homes, families who pay sales taxes will pay a Federal tax on the State and local taxes they pay. This deduction currently allows families who pay State and local income or sales taxes to deduct those taxes from their Federal income tax. In other words, this deduction prevents families from double taxation--once by the Federal Government and again by the Yet the Republicans eliminate this deduction.  In Illinois, we rank fifth in the Nation for people who are helped by the State and local tax deduction. The taxpayers I represent will be hit especially hard. Nearly 2 million Illinoisans--roughly a third of the taxpayers of my State--claimed more than $24 billion in[[Page S6429]]State and local tax deductions in 2015. If Republicans have their way, almost 2 million people in Illinois would be double-taxed on an average $12,500 of earnings. That is just plain wrong.  Republicans would have you believe that State and local tax deduction only helps the wealthy, but most people who take this deduction make less than $200,000 a year.  Even families who do not claim the State and local deduction will see their taxes increase under the Republicans' so-called tax reform plan. The Republican plan eliminates the personal exemption worth $4,050 a person. A family of four making $50,000 a year in my State will pay $887 more under this part of the Republican tax reform plan. Getting hit by losing the State and local tax deduction and then turning around and losing a personal exemption, a family of four in Illinois making $50,000 will pay $887 more a year, just on that provision, in Federal taxes.  What are the Republicans raising taxes on my middle class for? They are raising taxes on middle-income families to provide massive tax cuts for corporations to the tune of $2.6 trillion over the first 10 years, and--",CREC-2017-10-17-pt1-PgS6427-2.txt,326,REMEMBERING ROBERT BRADSHAW,2017.0,17.0,October

1083,topic-id,701,"Mr.President, Wade Nelson was a friend who began his professional life as a journalist and served at many levels in public service.  He was regarded as an honest professional in all of his life's work, a father and husband truly dedicated to his family, and a joy to count as a friend.  His colleague and friend, Bob Secter, wrote a remembrance, which I include with this statement. It was given to those of us in attendance at Wade's memorial service at the Unity Temple in Oak Park, IL, on October 7, 2017. The speakers at the service included his wife, Ellen Warren, a respected journalist in her own right, and his sons, Ted and They each shared touching stories of Wade as a husband and father. Rick Kogan emceed the celebration with his own signature style and Wade's friends Bern Colleran, Terry Kelleher, Hanke Gratteau, and musician Jon Webber each added great memories to the service.  As Bob Secter wrote:       Back in the rambunctious days of Chicago newspapers, Wade      Nelson worked for the legendary columnist Mike Royko who sent      his ``legman'' to check out a tip that Cook County judges      were issued cushier toilet paper than that stocked in public      restrooms.       The easy part for Nelson was grabbing samples from public      toilets in the Loop courthouse, now known as the Daley      Obtaining tissue from a judge's inner sanctum was      trickier.       So, Nelson made up a pretense to interview Chief Judge John      Boyle, then excused himself mid-talk to use the toilet      attached to the judge's chambers. He emerged to confront the      startled judge with the incriminating evidence, and a great      column was born.       Charmin-gate was hardly the highlight of Nelson's days as a      reporter. Yet it demonstrated the resourcefulness, spunk, and      droll whimsy that propelled him on a rich career path      involving being press secretary for the late U.Senator      Alan Dixon of Illinois, communications director for the      federal military base closure commission, political      consultant, and chief speech writer for former Chicago Mayor      Richard       That resume hardly defines the sum of Nelson, however.      Friends remember him as someone with boundless curiosity and      a walking encyclopedia of knowledge about interests as varied      as Midwestern architecture, jazz, the Cubs, anything Chicago      related, the minutia of the small Southern Michigan town of      Sturgis where his ancestors were early settlers in the 1800s,      and the secret to the perfect martini.       Edward Wade Nelson grew up in west suburban River      Forest, attended Fenwick High School in Oak Park and the      University of Missouri where he graduated with a degree in      journalism.       As a young adult and beyond, his greatest devotion was      reserved for performers at Chicago's varied night club,      cabaret and piano bar scene where men and women who played      and sang there came to embrace Nelson as an honored guest and      friend. He became an audience fixture at venues, most now      long gone, like The Acorn on Oak, Toulouse, The London House,      the Green Mill, and Nelson even came to name his      family pets after 20th Century jazz legends.       As Nelson climbed the rungs of journalism jobs, from City      News to the suburban Wilmette Life and then the Chicago Daily      News, his career tracked closely with another young reporter,      Ellen Warren, who later became a White House correspondent      for the old Knight-Ridder news service and then a columnist      for the Chicago They eventually married and had two      sons.       Nelson moved back to River Forest, but he rejoined Dixon in      the mid-1990s when the former senator chaired a politically      sensitive federal commission charged with recommending the      closure of surplus military bases across the country.       In subsequent years, Nelson served as a spokesman for then-     Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Aurelia Pucinski, now an      appellate court judge, and the Illinois State Board of      Education and became a program officer and grant manager at      the W.Kellogg Foundation, a Michigan-based non-profit      specializing in education grants. Wedged in between these      jobs was a multiyear stint as the chief speechwriter for      Richard Daley, a difficult task making Chicago's notoriously      ineloquent mayor sound eloquent.  Wade is survived by his wife and sons, Ted--and his wife, Sarah--and Emmett of Chicago; a sister, Karen Nelson of Chicago; and a brother, Ted--and his wife, Terry--of Spicewood,                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-19-pt1-PgS6635-2.txt,326,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018--Continued",2017.0,19.0,October

Elaine's legacy in Illinois will always be visible as people travel on high-speed rail from Chicago to Louis and throughout the As the chair of the Illinois House Railroad Industry Committee, Elaine was a leader in advocating for high-speed rail before it was popular.  During her service in the State House, Elaine championed women's[[Page S6636]]rights, the environment, and criminal justice reform as well. Because of Elaine's efforts, kids who have had run-ins with the law have a better shot at staying out of adult courts and avoiding getting caught in an endless criminal cycle.  Elaine was always willing to listen to colleagues and friends on both sides of the aisle, even when partnership was challenging. She helped craft bold legislation to rescue Illinois from its dire economic circumstances. As house assistant majority leader, she was a leader in working to reform pensions in our Fiscal responsibility was always her core value.  The people of the 57th District were lucky to have such a strong advocate. Her energy, creativity, and thoughtfulness will be missed.  I thank her for her service to Illinois and her friendship.

177,topic-id,186,"Mr.President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which would create an uneven playing field for the upcoming congressional reconciliation. If adopted, this amendment would reinstate a point of order from the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution, which Congress repealed 2 years ago. It was repealed to ensure equal treatment of all reconciliation bills by restoring the level playing field that had existed prior to the adoption of the point of order in 2008. That was used under the Byrd rule.  The Byrd rule specifically does not require such budget neutrality inside the budget window. Why?

637,topic-id,1299,"Mr.President, this week the Senate is debating a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution focused on growing America's economy through tax policies that put more money in the hands of hard-working Tax reform is long overdue and is needed to jump start our Nation's economic growth. It is crucial that Congress approve this fiscal framework in order to eliminate the dated and stifling tax policies that are holding back not only investment and productivity but American families. It is time for more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks.  The tax reform framework recently announced by the President and congressional leaders represents the beginning of a process aimed at boosting America's economic growth and putting more money in the pockets of everyday That tax framework has to be defined by the Finance This sets up a process so that can be done as easily as possible.  It is crucial that we allow U.companies--large and small, especially small--to better compete both at home and overseas, which will make the United States more attractive for investment and to do business. This will improve our competitiveness, it will help keep good paying jobs here at home, and it will bring back jobs that have been lost.  Lowering taxes on small businesses will also help unleash the ingenuity of America's job creators. We are the most ingenious and most inventive in the world.  Unfortunately, as many hard-working families personally understand, our economy has experienced 8 years of stagnant growth. This economic downturn and slow growth has resulted in a lost decade that has cost the Nation millions of jobs.  Family income is not rising as fast as it should, which has real consequences for our future. When family incomes fail to grow, it becomes difficult for parents to pay for their children's education and for their own needs. Sluggish family income growth also means less money for retirement or healthcare and makes it harder to save for a downpayment on a house.  It is no surprise that incomes are stuck, given America's overall economic stagnation over the past decade. Without wage growth, American families find it difficult to improve their standard of living. We must do better for these hard-working American families, and this budget resolution will help put our Nation on a better fiscal track with a combination of restrained spending, reduced tax burdens, and a growing economy.  The budget puts in motion a process to cut taxes for American families and job creators by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. In addition to keeping more money in the pockets of hard-working families, tax reform done right will spur investment and reinvigorate productivity here at home.  America's tax system is incredibly complicated. This budget will provide Congress with the opportunity to make more Tax Code simplifications and make it fairer for all We especially want to make sure families, small businesses, and workers are not penalized for their success.  Simplifying the Tax Code is an important part of tax reform efforts. America's current code is made up of more than 4 million words. That is seven times the length of Leo Tolstoy's ``War and Peace,'' and it is more than two times the combined length of the complete works of William Shakespeare and the King James  The National Taxpayers Union recently released some figures that calculate the burden of tax compliance for families and small businesses. The National Taxpayers Union learned that the total annual time burden of tax compliance is more than 6 billion hours. Let me repeat that. The total time burden for tax compliance is more than 6 billion hours. That is a lot of family time. That costs families and small businesses nearly $34 billion a year on tax software and other out-of-pocket expenses, as well as--this is the important part--$229 billion in time and labor to comply with the Tax The Tax Code's combined burden of $263 billion is more than the gross domestic product of 154 nations.  To understand just how complex and outdated the U.Tax Code has become, it is important to put it in the historical context of how it has grown over the years. In 1913, the 1040 Income Tax Form consisted of three pages, with one page of instructions. More than 100 years later, that same form now consists of 2 pages, with 106 pages of basic instructions and, depending on taxpayer circumstances, 13 separate schedules, each with numerous pages of instructions. In fact, there are more than 70,000 pages of instructions in total. This is why, every tax season, Americans are forced to wade through an ever-changing labyrinth of forms and regulations when they file their returns.  Each year, hard-working families navigate a minefield of tax definitions and tax tests in order to fully reap the benefits of tax credits. Is it any wonder that many who are eligible may not even claim these credits because of this[[Page S6493]]complex web of tax forms? For example, there are many definitions of ``child'' in the Tax Code, meaning a family with children may qualify for some child benefits but not others and may fail to receive the full benefits they deserve.  To promote fair treatment, our budget is focused on providing the tools needed to simplify the Tax Let me repeat that. These are the tools that are needed to simplify the Tax The Finance Committee still has to plug in details and eliminations and a final version, and that would allow Americans to keep more of what they earn. That is another part of the process, but this part of the process is necessary in order to make sure we get to that part of the process. Hard-working families deserve an economy that provides higher wages and more and better jobs. Pro-growth tax reform can boost small businesses, and it can free Americans to make their own decisions about how to spend their hard-earned money.  I want to repeat some of those numbers. I am an accountant. Usually, numbers put people to sleep, but I think these are ones people will understand.  The National Taxpayers Union did some figuring on the burden of tax compliance by families and small businesses. This National Taxpayers Union learned that the total annual time burden of tax compliance is more than 6 billion hours, which costs families and small businesses nearly $34 billion a year on tax software and other out-of-pocket expenses as well as--and this is the important part--$229 billion in time and labor to comply with the Tax The Tax Code's combined burden of $263 billion is more than the gross domestic product of 154 countries.  We need to take action. We need to pass this budget so the process can be simplified and expedited, and we can get to that yet this year so people, when they are filing their taxes next year, can take advantage of what is being done here. I think we will have bipartisan support in making these important changes. The process is set up so there can be that bipartisan support since it goes through the Finance Committee, and we have been promised there will be a markup, which will allow everybody to make amendments to the Tax Code and the tax bill. Then it will come to the floor, where everybody will have a chance to make amendments to the bill.  This sets the budget and sets up the opportunity to have some tax reform this year so people can take advantage of it next year. I ask my colleagues to support this budget and work with us on getting tax reform that will make a difference for all hard-working  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

This budget does not cut Medicare, and it does not provide tax breaks for the wealthy. It does not protect special interest tax loopholes. Also, anything that we do here has to be completed in other committees in order to ever happen.  This budget does slow Medicare's projected annual rate of growth by approximately 1 percent in comparison to the CBO's baseline. The CBO estimates that Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will become exhausted prior to the end of the budget window of 2025, at which point it will no longer be able to pay full benefits to seniors.

We should not prejudge the Finance Committee's consideration of tax reform but allow the bill to go through regular order, where it will be open to amendment.  This amendment is corrosive to the budget resolution privilege. It falls outside the scope of what is appropriate for inclusion.  Adoption of corrosive amendments could be fatal to the resolution's privilege, and loss of privilege could compromise our ability to pass tax reform and enforce the budget spending limits.

980,topic-id,1131,"Mr.President, earlier this month, the Senate Budget Committee took an important first step toward tax reform by approving a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution focused on growing America's economy through tax policies that put more money in the hands of hard-working  This week, we take the next step as the Senate begins debating the budget blueprint to pursue long-overdue tax relief for families and job creators that will jump-start economic growth. It is[[Page S6425]]crucial that Congress approve this fiscal framework in order to eliminate the dated and stifling tax policies that are holding back American investment and productivity.  As Budget Committee chairman, I am proud that Congress and the President are tackling these important issues. After 8 years of stagnant growth, it is clear our Nation needs a simpler, fairer, and more transparent tax system that will leave more dollars in the pockets of hard-working families.  The last time Congress was able to accomplish large-scale tax reform was in 1986. Just think how much has changed in the country and world in those 31 years, including our Tax America's tax laws are incredibly complicated and work to slow our economy and hurt American families. Incredibly, our current tax system actually benefits foreign-based companies while harming U.S.-headquartered companies and employers. We continually ask why jobs are leaving this country. A big reason is the hostile tax landscape.  The Senate budget aims to help reverse this trend by setting the stage for pro-growth tax reform that will lower taxes on American families and on job creators by a net $1.5 trillion over 10 years. By keeping more money in the pockets of hard-working taxpayers, these reforms--if done right--will boost investment, wages, and productivity here at home.  Pro-growth tax reform should reward hard work, savings, and encourage investment. It should broaden the tax base while lowering the marginal tax rates, streamline our tax laws, and limit government distortion of market-based decisions. Our tax policy should provide for a globally competitive corporate tax rate and an international tax system that does not penalize U.companies.  It is no secret that tax policies influence the everyday dollars-and-cents decisions of individuals and small businesses. They help drive such decisions as to whether to work an additional hour or invest in an additional unit of capital. This is why economic experts note that potential economic growth should always be considered when talking about tax cuts. In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation states ``tax policy can directly influence the level of labor supply, physical capital, human capital, and technology in an economy by changing the after-tax returns to certain economic activities or changing the cost of pursuing such activities.''  Pro-growth reform that removes government distortions of the marketplace would also allow for resources to be reallocated from what produces the best tax outcome to what is the best economic use. This efficiency will lead to increased investment, growth of businesses, and higher economic output or gross domestic product, In fact, increasing GDP from private sector growth can provide additional dollars to the Let me repeat that. Better tax policy will boost the value of everything we produce, and this will mean more revenue for the Federal  According to the Congressional Budget Office, an increase in productivity of one-tenth of 1 percentage point could increase revenue into the Treasury by $273 billion over a 10-year period. A return to our historic average growth would decrease projected spending deficits by over $2 trillion in the 10-year window--more than enough to pay for the decrease in revenues assumed under static scoring conventions that don't account for economic growth. That is what we have to operate under.  In addition to the Senate Budget's key role in reforming the Tax Code, it is also a serious fiscal plan. If Congress and the administration can adhere to this blueprint, we will be taking steps to get our fiscal house in order with a combination of restrained spending, reduced tax burdens, and a growing economy.  The Senate Budget Committee has put together a responsible budget that provides a path to creating a more effective, efficient, and accountable government for hard-working taxpayers. To accomplish this goal, the budget proposes $5.1 trillion in savings over the next 10 years, while investing in a strong national defense, providing for the care of our most vulnerable citizens, and not touching Social  From the start, this budget was focused on achieving on-budget balance by the end of the 10-year budget window. By 2026, the resolution--with ensuing economic growth from tax reform and an improved regulatory landscape--will generate a $79 billion on-budget surplus. This surplus would rise to $197 billion by 2027.  In addition to the fiscal reforms proposed by this resolution, it also continues efforts to respond to concerns about the broken budget process. This budget promotes curtailing budget gimmicks, increasing honesty and accuracy by government scorekeepers, and ending the ``spend now, pay later'' mentality of  It is also important to note the thorough and robust committee process that produced this Senate budget resolution. More than 150 amendments from both sides were filed, and 29 were voted on during our daylong markup process. This budget reflects bipartisan input and includes five amendments that were accepted from Democratic members of the committee.  The next step for tax reform will build on the Budget Committee's open and transparent committee process. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch have promised that tax reform legislation will also move through the committee process. In other words, any speculation people have heard about where the tax is, is not right because it has a process to go through. This will provide Finance Committee members the opportunity to offer amendments before the full Senate considers the legislation. So we will consider it in committee and then on the floor. Once the bill moves to the Senate floor, every Member will be able to offer amendments before voting on the measure.  This budget serves as a framework to expand economic opportunity for each and every It reflects our belief in the American entrepreneurial spirit and that by allowing American families and small businesses to keep more of their hard-earned dollars, they will innovate and invest money in ways that will grow our economy. We believe our Nation's best days--and those of its citizens--are ahead of us.  The time to act is now. If we don't change course, our Nation will continue to experience the sluggish economic growth of the last decade. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support America's hard-working families and employers and help put our Nation on a better course. Approving this budget focused on pro-growth tax reform does just that.  Mr.President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.

1099,topic-id,3011,"Mr.President, I am going to contain my remarks to the budget and its process.  For several days--in fact, for several weeks--I have been listening to the same rhetoric of what this budget will do. This budget is a special process. It[[Page S6632]]does outline a plan for what we can do over 10 years. That is a long time. I don't know that we ever make it past the first year. In fact, some budgets do not last more than 40 days before we waive the budget, but we need to have a blueprint. This is a blueprint that covers 10 years in spite of some of the rhetoric that this bill will not do any of the things that have been claimed. The reason that it will not do any of the things that have been claimed is that everything in the budget requires action by another committee before it can be done. Maybe they will take what we have in the budget and do that. Usually, they do not. If they were to, we could balance it, in this case, over a 10-year period. That is too long. Interest is going to eat us alive before that time. We are going to have to do something else.  I remember, when President Obama came into office, he had an idea. He said that the economy was too sluggish, so he was going to do a stimulus bill. Here, they are complaining about this $1.5 trillion that, perhaps, might be part of the flexibility for doing tax reform. We did more than that in the stimulus, and it did not work and went into the hands of a few people. Some of it never did get used. Some of it went to very few people. It was supposed to go to shovel-ready projects. Some of those projects have not been done yet, so that did not work.  We have had a slow economy. In fact, it seemed to have been slowing down, not speeding up, until last Last November, people showed a sign of hope, and the economy started going the other way. It is reflected in the stock market and some of the commodity prices because they felt that those could be produced again.  We decided that we had to try a different approach, and the different approach was to try to put the money in the hands of hard-working That is the middle class that some of the people talk about, and it is the poor that some of the people talk about. It is everybody. When we do tax reform, it will affect everybody. In fact, there are even some studies that show that when you do the corporate tax, it increases money for individuals who are working because there will be more competition for people, and that will drive up wages. Some economists have pointed that out. Yet, rather than argue with the Congressional Budget Office about how much the change is going to be, we said: Go ahead. Do your static one just as though no change had been made at all. We are willing to bet that there will be a very slight increase that will cover what we are talking about as a possible deficit and that that deficit will not develop if we increase just a very small amount in productivity.  Just about every economist asked: How come you are picking such a low number? Well, we try to be conservative and hope that the number goes 4 or 5 or 6 points higher than that. If it does, we will have money to start paying back some of the debt. If it just stays at my estimated, conservative amount, at the end of 10 years, we will have a surplus of $197 billion.  We have a chance to put America on a different route, one that will increase jobs, one that will get the money into the hands of the people, realizing that they probably know better what to do for themselves and their families than we do.  I do hear a lot when I go home about different government programs that are not working. In my studies, I have found that we not only have programs that are not working but that we have programs that nobody ever takes a look at. We have programs that have a lot of duplication. We have 160 housing programs. There are really only 5 things that those 160 programs do, so shouldn't we have just 5 of them and maybe have them specifically and all under one agency and set some goals and see if they meet those goals?  I was visiting with a lady from Africa who happens to be in charge of finance in her country. She said: You know, we have performance contracts in our country, and a performance contract means that everybody, including the towns, does a list of what they are going to get done during the year.  Because they are smaller than the United States, once a year they get everybody together who has a performance contract, and everybody reviews his performance contract. If you do not meet your performance contract, there is a little bit of public embarrassment; whereas we do not even check to see if they did anything. We do not even check to see if they have plans. We have to change that, and some of the things in this budget will allow that to happen.  I appreciate the way that we finished up in committee. I allowed the other side to see the budget early. Normally, they get to see it after opening statements are done. Imagine that--do the opening statement about what you think is going to be in the budget. Although some of the speakers I have heard around here act like they are still thinking that something might be in the budget that is not, they got to see it 5 days early in exchange for submitting their amendments, which is what every other committee does. Submit the amendments early, and then we can look through them and see how much duplication there is and some that can be accepted from both sides. As a result, we started with over 150 amendments, and we voted on 25. We took five from the other side, making it a bipartisan budget.  Nevertheless, after the committee process, we brought it to the floor, and we had an open amendment process today. In fact, as for the way the rules are on this, after we voted on the last amendment--of course, before we voted on final passage--somebody could have said: Wait a minute, I have one more, and he could have gone on all night. Again, we had to think of a civil process today that would result in our being able to finish at what would be considered an extremely early hour.  There was a little different tone to the amendments than what I had seen before--I think people will agree with that--which was that they were focused on the actual items in the budget, not on ``gotcha'' amendments. Usually, they say: Well, that person is up, and he has this little soft spot, so if I throw in this amendment, he will be on record, probably, having to vote against it, or he will vote for it, and that can be used against him. Either way, they would be able to use it. I didn't see those amendments this time, and I appreciate that.  I appreciate my colleagues for their consideration, their cooperation, and a lot of patience that has gotten us to this point.  I thank Leader Mitch McConnell for allowing the Senators to do their jobs, to do them in committee, and to do them here on the Senate floor. This commitment to an open, honest, and transparent legislative process is crucial to helping Congress restore the trust of the American people.  I also owe thanks to the outstanding members of the Senate Budget Committee, who fought so hard and so tenaciously to outline a plan that could balance the budget over the next 10 years while providing the tools needed to reform our Tax Code and boost the economy. The Presiding Officer was a part of that committee, and the Senator who just finished presiding was a part of that committee. I appreciate the careful and calculated way they looked at it, provided suggestions, then asked good questions at hearings and helped to come up with that budget.  Thanks are due, as well, to the many Members on this side who came and spoke on the budget's behalf, who offered amendments to make it better--well, almost always to make it better--and who worked with each of us and each other to move through the resolution's debate and the vote process together.  I would also like to focus for a moment on some of the staff who helped to lead us here. I want to thank the Republican staff of the Senate Budget That is Betsy McDonnell, my staff director, who is relatively new to the position, but you would never know that in the way she took ahold with her knowledge and friendship among people, again, on both sides of the aisle. She has been able to work some wonders to where we had the least votes in a vote-arama that, I think, we have ever had. That came from her being able to combine some of them but also in helping them redraft so that they were covering a different area than somebody else might be covering, which eliminated some of the repetition.  I want to thank my deputy staff director, Matt Giroux, and Paul Vinovich, Becky Cole, Thomas Fuller,[[Page S6633]]Elizabeth Keys, Joe Brenckle, Jim Neill, Steve Robinson, Greg D'Angelo, Tom Borck, Richard Berger, Jeremy Dalrymple, David Ditch, Susan Eckerly, Alison McGuire, Will Morris, Steve Townsend, Kelsie Wendelberger, and our interns Catherine Konieczny, Jake Whitaker, and Matt They are quite a team that has been doing a lot of work, both daytime and night and while the Senate has been out of session.  So I would also like to offer a special thank-you to Eric Ueland, who previously served as my staff director. He has been nominated for a post within the administration, and he is still waiting for his vote here, which is being delayed a lot--not just on his but apparently on all of them.  Eric has played an important role on this committee and throughout his time in the Two years ago, Eric was instrumental in helping Congress approve its first balanced 10-year budget since 2001, which represented an important step toward putting our country on not just another course but a better course. He is careful, precise, and dogged in his work. He has a tremendous knowledge of the history of the Senate and particularly the budget process. I especially appreciate his understanding of the complex Senate rules and precedents, along with the Budget I wish him Godspeed in his next position in service to our great  As well, thanks are due to my personal office staff who have to carry a load because I am not there when I am working on the budget stuff, but they keep me well informed so we are progressing on some of the State stuff at the same time. I particularly have to thank my chief of staff, Tara Shaw, who, because a new administration came in and liked the employees I had working for me, hired many of them away and we had to find replacements and she did an outstanding job with that. She has helped to kind of hold me together during this whole process and gives me outstanding advice so that I know not only what I am doing but why I am doing it, and, again, she has a tremendous history of what I have done before, which helps me as a good reminder. She is an outstanding chief of staff.  I also want to include my legislative director, Landon When you are the budget chairman and you are worried about some of the numbers, you can give the legislative director a heart attack because as budget director you have to vote against some things that have some unusual numbers to it, but it might be something people in Wyoming are interested in. We were able to resolve some of those conflicts. I always support Wyoming, as I mentioned. For anything that happens in the budget process, there is another process that will actually require some votes to finish up anything that is in there, and we will see that everything in there comes out in Wyoming's favor as well as for the rest of the I am not trying to do anything partial just to our part of the country, although a lot of things I work on have to do with very rural places. We are the least populated State in the Nation, but we are also the biggest State in the Nation so we have a lot of open space to invite people to.  I also want to thank Bart Massey, Liz Schwartz, Natalia Riggin, Aniela Butler, Charlie Carroll, Shawna Newsome, Garnett Decosimo, Chris Lydon, Aron Wehr, and Dylan I want to thank my Communications Director, Coy Knobel, our press team, Max D'Onofrio and Rachel Vliem, and the rest of the Wyoming team.  I have a bunch of people in Wyoming who primarily work on casework and do an outstanding job doing that.  I also want to thank the Budget Committee's bipartisan staff: Kim Proctor, Katie Smith, George Woodall, Grace Bruno, and Kevin Walsh, as well as Celina Inman, who has been on loan to us from the Government Publishing You can tell around here it takes a lot of government printing.  We have also been supported by the great work of our leadership, the floor and cloak room staff. I thank them for their continued good work and dedication to this institution and the country as a whole.  In particular, I want to thank Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Jane Lee, and Brendan Dunn in the leader's office; Monica Popp, John Chapuis, and Emily Kirlin in the whip's office; and very especially Laura Dove, who really runs this place. She has a history from when her dad was the Parliamentarian, and I am sure there was dinner table talk that has led her to know a lot of the precedents. I have seen when somebody disagreed with her, she was able to just go over and pull out a manual and turn almost instantly to the page and say: Here it is. She does an outstanding job of helping us stay on the right track. I also thank Robert Duncan, Chris Tuck, Megan Mercer, Tony Hanagan, Mike Smith, Katherine Kilroy, and Chloe Barz in the cloakroom.  I would really be remiss if I didn't thank the Senate Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, and her team, along with our bill and amendment clerks who kept us on the straight and narrow, but I particularly want to point out our Senate Parliamentarian who has to go through the technical details of every sentence of everything we do. When you talk about a filing cabinet of ideas all contained in one place, she does it. She knows precedent. She has been working at it for a long time. To be Parliamentarian, you have to be somebody who really likes detail work and pressure because when somebody comes in, they don't say: Take a look at this, and maybe I will see what you think next week. No, they want to know right now what you think, and fortunately she is able to, with a very great personality, say: Not yet, and then she does her research and comes up with some great explanations--not ones we always agree with--but great explanations for any decision she makes, and we really appreciate that.  So you can see that it takes a whole lot of people, and I haven't had a chance to get the list of the people from the other side of the aisle who have been working on, in some cases countering what we are doing and keeping their people informed, but that is the Senate; that is, there are all these people behind the scenes who are helping to make it work and to do it right. That is important. We want to do it right.  Now, I think we could work together a lot better if we were able to work in smaller bites. I get a little upset when we do comprehensive stuff around here. I have watched so many times when we take a comprehensive bill and soundly defeat it or maybe narrowly defeat it, but we defeat it. I figured out, when we do something that ought to be in separate bites, that this piece loses 5 votes and this piece loses 10 votes and this piece loses 12 votes, and pretty quickly you don't have a majority anymore, but if you do it in smaller bites, you may lose 5 votes, lose 12 votes, and it isn't a big deal. Getting it done would be the big deal. So if people would settle for working one issue and sticking to that issue and not say: No, I have this amendment that I know nobody will like, but this is such an important bill, if I could get it in there, it will make it through and hardly anybody will know--that is not legislating, and we shouldn't be operating that way. We should be doing an item at a time, in bite sizes, so the American people can understand it, and we get it done.  I think a lot of people have done a great job here, including the pages. It is late, so rather than go on--I made it to after 10 p.m. so you don't have to have class tomorrow morning. With that, I will close.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue).

I recently traveled to Ottawa, Canada, with congressional colleagues to learn firsthand how Canada's private air navigation service provider has been efficiently and safely moving 12 million aircraft each year since 1996.  This model consistently upgrades and improves air traffic control technology and isn't subject, as it is in the United States, to onerous government procurement rules. It is clear that this system works far better than its U.counterpart.  These reforms would also benefit the environment, as the updated technology allows for more direct routes. For instance, in Canada, over the last 20 years, this has resulted in 1.4 billion fewer gallons of fuel that have been used just in the last 10 years, and twice that amount in the last 20 years.

1029,topic-id,440,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to share the story of my constituent, Matt Bellina, of Holland,  On April 9, 2014, at the age of 30, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, otherwise known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS attacks the nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord, causing those with ALS to lose control of their muscles.  Matt graduated from Virginia Tech in May 2005 and received his commission into the U.Navy as a naval aviator. Following the onset of his symptoms, which include cramping hands, twitching arms, stiffness in his legs, Matt was grounded from flying. He continued to serve in the Navy in an administrative capacity until he medically retired in 2014, with the rank of lieutenant commander.  He eventually moved back home to Bucks County with his wife, Caitlin, and his young children to be surrounded by family and friends.[[Page H7984]]  Although this disease stopped Matt's career in its tracks, he persisted and actively involved himself in the ALS community and became a strong advocate for right-to-try legislation.  Mr.Speaker, each year Americans like Matt Bellina receive the devastating news of a terminal diagnosis. Even with the amazing work done in American medical research, for too many families, access to these potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at all.  Thousands of terminally ill patients suffer needlessly while awaiting final approval for drugs, therapies, and other medical technologies. While the Food and Drug Administration carries out its three-phase approval process, which can take years and cost billions of dollars, many patients simply want the chance to try treatments that are already demonstrated to be safe. A bill that was unanimously passed by the Senate will offer them a chance to extend their lives.  The Right to Try Act would ensure that terminally ill patients, together with their physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers, can administer investigational treatments where no alternative exists. In fact, this bipartisan idea is already the law in 37  A Federal right-to-try law would prevent the government from blocking access to potentially lifesaving medications. It would require patients to first try all other available treatments and be unable to participate in clinical trials.  For those patients caught between the traditional drug approval delays, the clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and limited time, the right to try simply establishes the freedom for patients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far outweigh the risks. It gives them an option of trying to save their life.  Mr.Speaker, whether it is a father courageously battling ALS or a brave child living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, they deserve the right to try.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-12-pt1-PgH7983-2.txt,1797,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,12.0,October

It has been more than 30 years since we have reformed the Tax Code in any significant way. We have more preferences and loopholes and deductions out there than we know what to do with. In fact, if we total all of them together, there are more expenditures in the Tax Code, or money avoiding coming to Washington--tax avoidance--than we spend on our entire discretionary budget. It is about $1.26 trillion annually.  So we have to have a code where we lower the rates and broaden the base. Broadening the base means going after some of these popular loopholes and deductions and preferences that make the Tax Code a lot bigger and scarier and more complicated than it should be.

289,topic-id,861,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on the much needed topic of tax reform. The high rates and complicated nature of the current Tax Code are burdening individual taxpayers and making businesses less competitive in the global market. That simply has to change. It has been more than 30 years since we have passed major tax reform, and we are well past time.  Unfortunately, I recently learned of a serious threat to reforming the Tax Code called alpacas. Now, what do these cute, mild-mannered pets have to do with Federal tax policy? Earlier this year, I issued an oversight report entitled ``Tax Rackets: Outlandish Loopholes to Lower Tax Liabilities.'' That report demonstrated how clever accounting allows nearly anything imaginable to become a writeoff, including alpacas.  To illustrate the point, the report outlined how local and Federal tax bills can be sheared by claiming exotic pets--these exotic pets--as livestock and turning backyards into barnyards. That is when the fur really started to fly.  Alpaca owners associations that once brazenly touted this tax fleece as a key selling point for the animals now feigned outrage at the suggestion. The association tried to pull the wool over the eyes of taxpayers by retaining a professional PR consultant. They launched a media campaign, inundating my office and others with phone calls, social media messages, and letters with photos of alpacas.  Through slick reporting and aggressive lobbying, tax-subsidized alpaca ownership was somehow presented as a bulwark of small business and a flourishing middle class. If this mere mention of a tax break costing $10 million annually and enjoyed by relatively few taxpayers elicited such an outmeasured and aggressive response, imagine the backlash we will face when we are attempting to actually eliminate tax preferences benefiting powerful corporations and special interests to the tune of billions of dollars.  There are over 200 loopholes buried throughout the Tax Code that collectively cost $123 trillion annually. Again, there are over 200 loopholes buried throughout the Tax Code that collectively cost $1.23 trillion annually. This exceeds the total amount spent annually by the Federal Government for all discretionary programs, which includes defense, education, transportation, foreign aid, and protecting the environment.  These exemptions increase the bill for the average taxpayer. They also make the Tax Code so complicated that most individuals have to hire a tax professional or buy software to help complete their tax returns.  At more than 74,000 pages in length, no one--not even those in Washington who write the laws or enforce them--truly understands Federal tax law. Special interests are taking advantage of this confusion by hiring armies of accountants and Washington lobbyists to dodge taxes and cash in on the complexity of the code. For example, developers are claiming--these are a lot of homebuilders are claiming $8 billion in tax credits every year supposedly to construct low-income housing, but with fewer homes being built and no basic accountability requirements, it is nearly impossible to track how this money is being spent.  The Government Accountability Office, the GAO, which is investigating, said the ``IRS and no one else in the federal government really has an idea of what is going on.''  The same is true with hundreds of other tax loopholes. A luxury yacht can qualify as a second home and can be eligible for a mortgage interest deduction. Alaskan ship captains can expense costs for whaling as charitable contributions, even though no money goes to charity and whaling is typically illegal otherwise. High rollers can itemize the cost of gambling trips, including entertainment. Even the cost of losing lottery tickets can be deducted, a kind of scratch-off writeoff.  Only the IRS knows who is taking advantage of these loopholes, and the agency often cannot verify whether those claiming the tax giveaways are eligible. In order to achieve meaningful tax reform that makes the code simpler and fairer, we have to be able to first evaluate who is benefiting from these loopholes, for what purpose, and for what price.  That is why I am introducing the Tax Expenditures Accountability Act, which will publicly disclose the names of the corporate and special interests receiving tax credits and the costs of these tax credits. This bill requires the Department of Treasury to disclose the special interest receiving tax credits just as all other Federal expenditures are currently disclosed on the public website USAspending.gov. Sunlight is obviously the best disinfectant, and I look forward to exposing many of these loopholes, eliminating them, and returning the savings to individual taxpayers in the form of lower taxes.  As the alpaca lobby demonstrated, riding herd on tax breaks will cause every special interest benefiting from the code's complexity and unfairness to cry foul. Washington's powerful special interests will mobilize and threaten to derail tax reform. Many would rather protect these loopholes than allow taxpayers to keep more of their own paycheck.[[Page S6465]]  Coming up short on reform is not an option. We have to do it this year. Individuals and businesses are suffering under a broken, antiquated tax code that is in dire need of fixing. We can't be deterred in efforts to achieve real reform that reduces the tax bill for everyone.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-10-17-pt1-PgS6464.txt,1633,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,17.0,October

Let's face it: whether we are a family or a business, we have to manage our money in the private sector; and the Federal Government, for far too long, has been guilty of spending waste, fraud, and abuse. There have been so many problems, and the American people know it.  When we go home and we talk with our constituents, they want us to be very good stewards of their money, and they deserve that. That is exactly what this bill does, and it does it in a way that does a lot of different things that I think is great.  First of all, as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have said, it incentivizes Federal employees to detect waste. We all know that government has a tendency, when they have a pool of money, to spend it, whether they need it or not. So if a Federal employee can go in there, find this problem out, tell the agency head, he or she now can get up to $20,000 of incentive pay. So we have incentivized fiscal responsibility in the Federal That is great, and that is just good government.  In addition to that, Mr.Speaker, we look at the United States Constitution, and that is a document that our Founding Fathers gave us and is so important. Why is that so important with this bill? Because when that agency head goes to the President of the United States with this recommendation, the President of the United States has to come where? Back to the Congress, where he should have to come.  When Congress looks at that recommendation from the President, Congress then can make the final determination. So we have fiscal responsibility, we have constitutional sanctity, and we have good government.  Most of all, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We have Republicans and Democrats working together, the way the American people want us to do, to be fiscally responsible.

344,topic-id,542,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to present 569, making additional supplemental appropriations for disaster relief requirements for the current fiscal year to help respond to recent devastating natural disasters.  Over the past 2 months, millions of Americans have had their lives forever altered by destructive hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and by raging and deadly wildfires in the  We all support those who are victimized, particularly those who lost their lives or lost loved ones, and we will continue to be with them every step of the way with the Federal support they need as they recover and rebuild.  Our thanks go to the first responders, volunteers, and States who saved countless lives, protected communities, and demonstrated the best of humanity; that includes FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and many other Federal agencies for getting the first installment of relief to those in need.  However, with such massive, unprecedented damage, more help is clearly needed to continue to respond to these recovery efforts, to rebuild communities with dollars, with resources, with manpower, and with our support.  This emergency funding legislation, the second installment, addresses urgent short-term immediate priorities: replenishing FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, supporting ongoing Federal wildfire suppression efforts, providing debt relief for the Federal Flood Insurance Program, and other assistance that will help our fellow Americans in their time of greatest need.  To summarize the $36.5 billion in emergency funding provided in this bill, in total, $18.7 billion is provided for the Disaster Relief This includes $13.77 billion for the most immediate response needs: lifesaving missions, emergency protection, the repair and restoration of public infrastructure like communications, power, transportation, and, yes, shelter, and financial assistance to individuals and families affected as they rebuild their lives.  This package also includes $4.9 billion for community disaster loans, which will ensure local governments are able to provide basic municipal services such as police and fire protection and public education throughout this trying time.[[Page H7993]]  In addition to the Disaster Relief Fund, this bill provides a one-time payment of $1.27 billion to allow Puerto Rico and our fellow citizens to receive the same access to emergency disaster and nutrition program benefits that other States receive.  The bill also ensures that the National Flood Insurance Program is able to meet its existing claim obligations as Americans cope with the tremendous flood damage to their homes and communities.  For wildlife suppression, the bill contains $576.5 million. As we have seen, the situation out West has grown even more desperate and deadly. We must ensure that those heroic firefighters can continue to save lives and protect property.  As we know, the needs of each disaster area are ever changing. Consequently, our Appropriations Committee and all of our Members continue to monitor the progress of recovery efforts as well as anticipate emerging needs.  This will be a long process, Mr.Speaker, and the second package or installment of the Federal support will certainly not be all that is needed over the long term.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of this bill. It is important for the Nation, for the communities affected, and I reserve the balance of my time.

354,topic-id,902,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), whose leadership in this time of crisis we all salute.  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Mr.Speaker, first, I thank the Speaker of the House and the whole leadership, Chairman Frelinghuysen, and all of the members from the Appropriations Committee for allowing the Federal Government to help Puerto Rico in this dire situation.  On behalf of the 3.4 million American citizens that live in Puerto Rico and the nearly 5.5 million Puerto Ricans that live on the mainland, I rise today in strong support of this disaster supplemental appropriations bill. They have been focused on Puerto Rico since before the arrival of Hurricane Irma, and then during Hurricane  I also thank all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have reached out during these past 3 weeks to express their encouragement and offer their assistance during this process. For that, my constituents and I will always be grateful to all of the Members of this  As you may know by now, Puerto Rico was hit by two major hurricanes. First, Hurricane Irma, which caused significant damage on the eastern part of the island. That was on September 6. Then, on September 20, a few days later, we got hit by Hurricane Maria, which caused unprecedented destruction throughout the whole island and which many people consider that hurricane to be the most catastrophic natural disaster ever on U.soil.  Today, 22 days after the storm hit, nearly 85 percent of our population remains without power, 44 percent without running water, and almost 58 percent without access to telecommunications. To this date, we still have towns like Las Marias, Maricao, Utuado, and many others in the central part of the island, that remain uncommunicated and can only be accessed by air since most of the roads and bridges were washed away. We are talking about more than 18 major roads and bridges that were just washed away. The death toll has reached 48 fatalities, and, unfortunately, certainly that number is going to increase in the coming days and weeks.  This unprecedented humanitarian crisis in our own Nation has begun what is likely to evolve into a mass exodus of Puerto Ricans to the U.mainland, further jeopardizing the island's long-term recovery.  Mr.Speaker, I stand here today telling you that the American citizens that live in Puerto Rico still are suffering in different ways. This is not the time to focus on how and when resources will be withdrawn from Puerto Rico, or how slowly we are going to rebuild the island. Today, 85 percent of our island is without electricity, yet 3.4 million American citizens living there just got less than 15,000 people working to recover the power grid. I just want to remind you that Florida got more than 61,000 people helping to recover their power grid in just 4 days. That is not acceptable in our case, and we are still American citizens.  I know a lot of problems persist. It is too difficult to address the issue when you are not part of the mainland, you are not part of the power grid. It is different when you get access and resources to Texas, Louisiana, or Florida, because you can drive or you can have helicopters. In our case, everything is by ship or air. That means it is more difficult for the Federal Government to assist directly. That is the reason we got more than 15,000 personnel from the Coast Guard, National Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, Navy, and the assistance of all national guards--Virginia, Florida, and New York, just to name a few.  The Puerto Rican communities in the States and on the island are showing the way, along with private companies, NGOs, and countless volunteers throughout the whole But there is still a lot that needs to be done as we begin the reconstruction. That is the reason this supplemental is so important for us.  Allowing the people of Puerto Rico to access problems that we never have before, like SNAP, which will provide $1.3 billion to receive the same emergency disaster and nutrition assistance benefits as the States, this is the first time this Congress has allowed this to happen to Puerto  I thank the Members and leadership of the House for allowing this money.  This is the bill that provides for $18.7 billion to FEMA to have the disaster relief fund to help in lifesaving missions across the island for emergency protection and removal of debris--we continue to have a lot of debris on the island--and the repair and restoration of our infrastructure. That is going to be a matter of discussion on another day because we can't rebuild or redo the infrastructure we did before from the fifties or the sixties. We need to redo a lot of things on our power grid.  It will provide also--and this is a very important area--$7.4 billion to have liquidity to the local government of Puerto Rico just to match Federal funds that are needed to these recovery actions. This is the second step this House has taken in terms of helping the people of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, people that are American citizens. This is the second step. The first one was the first supplemental that was approved.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

Ultimately, the goal of this deal was to prevent Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon and averting all-out war. This is exactly what it has done.  Now, President Trump is threatening to pull out from the deal and break our commitments to Iran and our allies, with no evidence to prove that Iran has not complied. In fact, the IAEA and our U.military and intelligence sources unanimously agree that Iran has remained compliant to the agreement.  Walking away from the Iran nuclear agreement that, so far, is working will likely cause Iran to restart its nuclear weapons program, eliminate the possibility of diplomatic negotiations to denuclearize North Korea, kick off a nuclear arms race, and greatly increase the chances of nuclear war.  If President Trump breaks our commitment to the Iran deal, the American people have everything to lose and nothing to gain.

In my home State of Hawaii, 575 domestic violence survivors reach out to local organizations seeking help every single day.

Just as our veterans have earned world-class care, their allies such as Chris deserve full protection should they bravely decide to document VA wrongdoing or abuse. By increasing these protections today, we are honoring Chris' memory, serving as a fitting memorial to a life that was tragically cut short.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-12-pt1-PgH7989-3.txt,99999999999999,1315,2017.0,12.0,October
1032,topic-id,2709,"Mr.Speaker, there are so many things that we need to talk about. Important events are spilling upon Americans, just cascading upon us. We could spend hours and, indeed, should spend hours talking about North We should and will spend hours talking about tax reform, or tax reductions, or serious benefits for the superwealthy in America, and we will talk about that. We will debate that.  But what is on my mind right now are the disasters that have befallen our American people. We think about what has happened over the last 11 months--floods on the East Coast, people forced out of their homes as the rivers rose in the  We think about California, and the massive floods, and the 200,000 people who were evacuated from their homes in my district.  We think about the recent hurricanes as they slammed into Houston, Florida, the Keys; and Hurricane Maria, as that hurricane devastated Puerto Rico and the Virgin These traumatic disasters are now in our memory, but they are also our reality.  In California today, in my district, and in my colleague Mike Thompson's district, thousands of homes have been burned to the ground and people have died.  These disasters are not new to America, and, over the years, we have set up a mechanism to deal with them. That mechanism is the firefighters across this Nation who respond, the emergency plans that have been put in place.  I know during my period as insurance commissioner in California, I would often arrive at these disasters, some of which go back more than 30 or 40 years, and console people who will have lost their home and attempt to deal with their insurance issues. And I would always remind those who were in the path of these flames, or hurricanes, or tornadoes, to be prepared; that Boy Scout motto: Be  And now, in California, the same message goes out by the first responders and, indeed, by myself here on the floor of the House of Representatives: Be prepared. Be prepared to evacuate. Think about what it is you need to take ahead of time, those important papers, those scrapbooks, those photo albums, the dog, the cat; and when the time to go arrives, when that message arrives on your cell phone, or on the loud speaker from the police car out in front, obey it. Get out. Get out because you have already prepared.  Yes, you should have had that insurance policy that you forgot, that flood insurance program. Yes, you should have had it. And all too often, we have to rely upon the generosity of charities, and, thankfully, they are there. And we also rely upon the Federal, State and county governments.  Today, here in the House of Representatives, and in the Senate, as well as in the administration, we are beginning to gear up for yet another emergency appropriation to pay for the relief efforts that are underway. It is not going to be enough. It may take care of part of what occurred in Houston, or in Florida, or in the It is certainly not going to be enough to take care of the devastation in Puerto  And I know, as the fires continue to rage in California, the appropriations that are being discussed, the emergency money for FEMA, will not be enough.  While we are looking at these disasters and the billions upon billions of dollars that will be needed to rebuild the infrastructure, to rebuild the schools and hospitals, to pay the bills for the emergency work that is going on, this House of Representatives, this week, is in the process of trying to figure out how to pass a massive tax cut that will take trillions of dollars of revenue away from the Federal  It is estimated anywhere from $2 trillion to $5 trillion, depending upon the details, over the next decade, will not be available for the next disaster.  Will it be added to the deficit?  Will those revenue reductions be balanced by cuts to Medicare? It is already being discussed. It is in the Republican budget.  Will those $2 trillion to $5 trillion reductions in revenue be added to the deficit, or will we cut Medicare? They tried to do it in the Affordable Care Act, now they are coming back with a budget bill that would cause it to happen again--more than $1.5 trillion pulled out of the Medicaid program. And so there will be another disaster, a slow-building disaster of millions of Americans who will not be able to get healthcare.  So, added on top of the burden of rebuilding America, the emergency appropriations to pay for the ongoing and past disasters, we need to be aware of the inconsistency of thought that is going on here.  We are looking at an appropriation bill to pass something in the range of $15 billion, in addition to the previous $12 billion, which we know will not be sufficient to deal with the existing disasters; to say nothing of the billions of dollars that are owed to the counties and States for disasters going back, at least in California, 10 years, where the Federal Government has yet to reimburse the counties and State for the obligations that the Federal Government accepted, in some cases, a decade ago.[[Page H7906]]                                {time}  1930  In the face of all of that, we are going to reduce revenues to the Federal  Who gets the tax breaks?  Well, here is a fact that the Vice President--excuse me, Mr.Speaker, if I might--has suggested in California: that it is the poor that will get the tax break.  Not so. They will get a little, to be sure. The middle class is likely to get a tax increase.  But the real tax break, the top 1 percent get 80 percent of those revenue reductions. Eighty percent will flow to the top 1 percent of America's wealthy. So if you are concerned about income inequality, you better be paying attention.  One must wonder: What is the logic of what is happening here? What is the logic?  In the face of disasters that have occurred, historically, but more recently within the last year--floods in California, floods in the Carolinas, hurricanes, fires, tornados in the Midwest--in the face of all of that, we are going to massively reduce the ability of the Federal Government to respond. It doesn't make much sense to me, particularly when the beneficiaries of those tax reductions are the superwealthy.  I think it is 2,500 families in America that would benefit from the elimination of the estate tax--2,000-plus families. It is some $6 billion to $9 billion of revenue lost every year so that 2,000 superwealthy families don't have to pay an estate tax.  What is going on here?  600,000 low-income housing vouchers gone so that they can pass on their wealth to the next generation. Income inequality.  In the face of the disasters, we need to stop for a moment as we begin the appropriations process for the FEMA emergency appropriations. We need to stop for a moment and consider the way these two things work together.  I was in my district, Davis, California, for an event on Sunday, and I had several students--some of whom are my interns--come to me and say: What are you going to do about the student loans? There is a lot of happy talk around here that we are going to make higher education free. It is a great idea.  It used to be that way when we were building the economy, when we knew, if we educated people, we would have a strong, growing economy. But tell me, in the face of a $2 trillion to $5 trillion reduction in the revenues to the Federal Government so that the wealthy can get wealthier, how are we going to ever reduce the cost of education to Americans?  I don't know. Maybe somebody has the answer here. It doesn't seem clear to me that that could be happening.  I am going to introduce a bill again this week--one that I introduced in the last session--that is kind of based upon the fact that Americans across this Nation are able to refinance their homes at a lower interest rate. It is a great idea. I have done it. I suspect many of the people who are listening, and certainly many of the Members of Congress, have refinanced their home to get a lower interest rate.  But if you have a student loan that may have been from 5 or 8 years ago, or you are about to sign a document this fall for a Federally financed student loan, you cannot refinance that.  Why?  The Federal Government--there is $1.3 trillion of student loans out there. Nearly $900 billion of that $1.3 trillion is owed to the Federal  Why don't we refinance those loans? What if we were to do that? What would it mean to the students out there who are paying 5, 6, 7, 8 percent interest to the Federal Government that is able to go out and borrow money for 10 years at 2 percent?  That is a pretty good margin.  Even the fat cats on Wall Street can't have a margin that big, but the Federal Government does. So these students are paying these high interest rates so that the Federal Government can literally profit on their backs. That is a fact. Let's allow those students to refinance those student loans. Let's just see what happens.  The Federal Government can borrow money at less than right around 2 percent--maybe a little less right now; add a percent for management fees, 3 percent; reduce all of the student loans, $800 billion, $900 billion of student loans. The government would go out and borrow it at 2 percent for 10 years and tell the students and those who are no longer in school: We are going to allow you to refinance. Take an interest rate that may be half of what you are getting now.  By the way, why are we charging a fee to these students so that they could borrow money? Don't we want them to get an education? Don't we want them to be able to improve themselves?  Yet we require a fee. So let's eliminate the origination fees.  It is as though the Federal Government were some sharks out there dealing with home mortgages. We are dealing with students and their lives. If we can do this, maybe it is a couple of thousand dollars over the life of that loan that that student can then invest in their life and in their family.  These are things that are possible. These are things that we ought to be doing. There is just a lot of happy talk around here: Oh, we are going to make education free.  It would be good if we could. We could if we don't cut the Federal revenues by $2 trillion to $5 trillion over the next decade. Eliminate origination fees. Save low-income borrowing. It is all possible. The art of the possible ought to be what we are doing, not the art of enhancing those who are so wealthy already.  I am going to paraphrase a fellow that is pretty important in American history. FDR said something like this: The measure of our success is not that we do more for those who have much, but, rather, that we do for those who have little.  So what of this tax cut that we are going to spend this week and next week, this next month, and, according to our Treasury Secretary, we will be done by the end of the year? So what does it mean?  It means maybe a small tax break for the working men and women of It means a huge tax benefit for those who are already wealthy; the elimination of the estate tax.  It has been estimated by The New York Times that based upon our President's tax returns of a decade ago--by the way, he won't show us his present tax returns--that he could benefit to the tune of $1 billion with his proposed tax program.  Not bad if you can have it. But is that good public policy?  I don't think so. I don't think so; not in the face of the needs of We have enormous defense needs. We have been fighting wars in the Middle East for almost three decades now. There are other needs that we have for our military.  You only need to listen to the Secretary of Defense and others as they talk about the need to rebuild much of the American military. The admiral responsible for the Pacific Theater says that he needs something rather important: munitions.   Yes, we have needs. We have students who are paying interest rates far higher than is necessary, unable to refinance their Federal student loans because the law doesn't allow it. But it is possible. In fact, it would make a lot of economic sense. These young men and women might actually start a family; might actually be able to buy a home or a car, start a new business, start a small business. There are a lot of possibilities.  But the superwealthy need another tax break?  I don't think so. I don't think so at all. And I don't quite understand the happy talk by our leaders of this administration who like to say: Not to worry. You are going to get to deduct the first $25,000.  Well, yes. And then what?  Oh, by the way, there is this 20 percent increase in the bottom tax rate, from 10 percent to 12 percent. That is a 20 percent increase. At the top tax rate, it goes from 35, unless you are able to maneuver into their little scheme where you can actually reduce your tax rate to 15 percent by being an LLC--a limited liability corporation--or a subchapter S corporation.  Well, if you have the money to hire a good accountant and a lawyer, there are a lot of ways you can scheme and scam. And if you are a corporation, some of our largest corporations are able to hire the lawyers and the accountants and duck their taxes entirely.[[Page H7907]]  The list is long. The list is actually rather maddening. Apple, GE, AT&T, and others, the big ones, their tax rates are down in the zero or in the less than 10 percent range, and they want more.  So Puerto Rico is devastated. My counties in California are facing rampaging fires, and perhaps as many as 2,000 homes have already burned. There will be another tornado and another hurricane.  The question for us is: Will there be the money for the Federal Government to provide the support that we should do to help Americans rebuild?  That is a fundamental question.  I know that there is a better way. I know that in the proposal that our Republicans have put forth there will be less money for infrastructure. I know that if you want good-paying jobs, the construction industry has good-paying jobs. I know that for every dollar we spend on infrastructure, the economy will grow by $2 or more and have a foundation for future economic growth.  I know that when we rebuild the infrastructure of our communities that have been devastated by hurricanes, tornados, floods, and fires, that the communities can come back strong and the economies for those communities can flourish. I know that it takes a strong American Government to make that happen.  Mr.Speaker, as we enter this week, my heart and thoughts go out to those millions of Americans who have been devastated by the hurricanes, floods, and fires; those people in my district who have lost their homes, and those who have lost their lives.  I come here to the floor to say: Let us think seriously about what our obligation is to Americans, to those who have little, to those who have lost everything. What is our obligation to them?  FDR was correct: The measure of our success is not that we do more for those who have much, but, rather, that we do for those who have little.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-10-pt1-PgH7905-3.txt,1973,ALL CIRCUIT REVIEW ACT,2017.0,10.0,October

We haven't changed it since 1974, the year I was born--maybe a few years after that. We ought to change this process so it works for the American people. We ought to do something to make this process more effective.  We have heard people come and talk about Medicare and These are very critically important social safety nets for this country. People in my community, my parents, our families, and people we have lived with and known for our entire lives rely on Medicaid and Medicare, but there is this big myth out there that Washington has this ability to increase funds but yet rename it as a cut. You have a group of people in Washington, DC, who are trying that Washington, DC, Kabuki dance, where they say a decrease in the rate of increase is a cut. That is like saying that my son, who is 6 years old, is supposed to grow 4 inches next year, and the doctor says: Your son is going to grow 4 inches next year, based on the charts. If my son grows only 2 inches that year, did he shrink? He still grew. But in Washington, DC, they would say: No, he is shorter than he was. This is absurd.  Let's be honest with the American people. Medicare increases in funding. We are trying to be more responsible with the dollars we have because the United States is in debt, and the way we are going to fix that is to be responsible with the dollars we have and to grow our economy.  A couple of weeks ago, I saw a map of the United It showed distressed communities in this country. It showed that the haves have more and the have-nots have less. It is time we do something about that in this country. It is time we fix the fact there are counties in our country that are suffering. There are communities in our country that haven't seen a new net job for nearly two decades. We can do better than that.  It has been 30 years since Congress last passed major tax reform. It was 1986. I was 12 years old. For those who are wondering what the 1 movie was the last time we passed tax reform, it was ``Top Gun.'' The one thing I wanted that same year, the last time we did tax reform, was an Atari 7800. That is what I wanted the last time this body passed tax reform.  Fast forward to today, 30 years later. The last time we did tax reform was 30 years ago. We now live in a world of Wi-Fi, self-driving cars, and Smartphones, but we still have an Atari-era tax code. It is clunky. It is outdated. It is bloated to more pages than any of us would care to read. I wish I had come up with this, but I didn't. I will repeat it: The Tax Code is longer than the Bible, and unlike the Bible, there is no good news in it. It feeds the suspicion that you can game the Tax Code if you are wealthy. If you are average, you will be stuck with the bill.  We can do better. That is the opportunity we have now. We must seize it in a way that helps hard-working American families and businesses to create jobs on Main Street, to change this unfair system that we have.  When I go across the State of Colorado, throughout the four corners of our great State, there are people I meet who have been very successful. If you go to Denver, CO, right now, you will think the new State bird is the construction crane. Dozens of construction cranes are on the horizon, showing the success we have had in that If you go to Southeastern Colorado, Western Colorado, Northeastern Colorado, there are pockets of poverty that remain as strong as ever because we haven't been able to find the tools necessary to grow the economy the way we should. That is what this debate allows us to do--to grow this economy, to get this Nation firing on all cylinders again. It is the opportunity we have. We should seize it right now, passing this budget leading to tax reform, to make sure that we can grow American opportunity and innovation because too many people haven't had a meaningful pay increase for far too long. They know they spend too much time working through a tangled mess of rules just to file their taxes that are too high to begin with.  As a country, we spend 6 billion hours and $263 billion each year just to jump through all the hoops and tangles and check the boxes of our Atari-era Tax That is $263 billion we are spending on a 1986-era tax code, just to check the boxes, to fill the forms, to pay the accountants, and to find the lawyers. That is the entire GDP of the nation of New That $263 billion is more than the GDP of New We spend as much money preparing and filing our taxes in this country as the entire economic output of the nation of New  American people need relief. It starts by reducing the number of brackets, simplifying the Tax Code, and reducing our rates. For many American families, this will leave them with more money in their pockets at the end of the day. It also would cut that 6 billion hours that are spent working, trying to file taxes, and leave families with more time to do things that matter to them--not trying to fill out a tax form, but letting them be with their family, be at work, and invest the way they want to with their time and their money. It is just a start.  The end of the unfair death tax will bring relief to regular Let's start with the death tax. I have heard people criticize the death tax. It is unfair and at times cruel. That should be reason enough for this Congress to repeal it. We have a tax that causes families to have to confront breaking up businesses that have been in the family for generations or selling off the family farm just to keep what they have built and what they have already paid taxes on because somebody died. The government seems to think death is a taxable event.  When I visit with Colorado's farmers and ranchers, one of their biggest concerns--in fact, I met with a group of farmers this past week in Colorado who said that the repeal of the estate tax is more important to them than passing a new farm bill because it is affecting their way of life. These aren't billionaires whom we hear so many complaints about on the Senate floor and in the political op-eds and by the pundits on These are families and ranchers whose families have been working for generations. They have dirt under their fingernails. These are people who have sacrificed for generations to build up land and capital, not liquid assets. That apparently makes them into billionaires, and it is bad enough that they ought to be penalized when they die.  If you are fortunate enough to have some incredible land in Colorado underneath your farm or ranch--maybe a homestead around Vail or Are you going to be forced to break up that estate, forced to sell that land, that 36-acre parcel, so you can pay the estate tax when it was open space and we are able to conserve that open space and enjoy that great beauty? Washington, DC, is driving local development decisions, all because of the estate tax. It is suffocating our way of life in rural America, and it must end.  Reforming business taxes will bring tax relief to American families, hard-working families. The corporate tax rate is the highest in the world, and employees are paying the price for uncompetitive corporate tax rates. We[[Page S6508]]have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. President Obama said that in his 2011 State of the Union  If you just look at what we can do by decreasing tax burdens on American businesses, we can actually increase the average American household income by between $4,000 and $9,000 a year. This is an average increase to American households across the country. This isn't to the millionaires or billionaires. This is to hard-working American families who are just trying to get ahead in life. So this puts $4,000, at a minimum, in their pockets as a result of lower tax rates. That is not just a one-time increase either. We are not talking about a one-time hit. It is not just for the top earners. The Tax Foundation says that workers across the income distribution will feel the effects year after year.  Go home and ask your constituents whether they would like to have more money in their own pockets or whether they would like to have that in the hands of Washington or Wall Do you know what? I am pretty sure they are going to say: I can spend it better than any bureaucrat or Member of Congress ever could. If I keep it, I will make smart choices for my family. That is what we have to focus on.  The Council of Economic Advisers put out a report explaining how reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent would result in the average American household income going up by $4,000 to $9,000. It is worth walking through what they said. Before 1990, when corporate profits went up by 1 percent, worker wages actually went up by more than 1 percent. Before 1990, profits went up by 1 percent and workers' wages went up by more than 1 percent. Since 1990, that relationship between corporate profits and workers has changed. Over the last 8 years, from 2008 to 2016, a 1-percent increase in corporate profits increased workers' wages only by 0.3 percent, a 0.7-percent decrease. Part of the reason for that is our uncompetitive corporate tax rates.  We will go to our numbers to illustrate what has happened. During the same time, from 1990 until this decade, foreign countries, foreign nations figured out that lowering the corporate tax rate leads to more money in their workers' pockets. While our tax rate has stayed stubbornly high, the high tax rates in other countries have plummeted. The United States has decided that we are going to keep the highest tax rates while other economically developed countries are dropping theirs, resulting in higher wages for their workers. Today, U.corporate tax rates are far higher than those of any other country I have talked about today.  Look at this. If you look at where the United States is right now, we are right here, top of the chart, 35 percent. That is the U.Federal tax rate, the 2017 average statutory corporate tax rate. Look at OECD countries: 10 percent lower than our statutory rate. Asia is at 20 percent, which is 15 percent lower than our statutory rate. Europe is at 18 percent, and some countries in Europe are going lower because they have realized that when they lower their taxes, they have done a better job of attracting businesses, growing their economy, and creating more work.  It would be tempting for some to assume that taxing corporations skims some of the cream off the top. You will hear plenty of rhetoric about lowering corporate tax rates being a giveaway. Here is the sad truth. I hope the people take the time to learn this lesson. It is the employees that bear the burden of corporate taxes. Studies show that workers pay between 45 percent and 75 percent of corporate taxes in the form of lower wages. How do you fix that? Lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent will alleviate that burden and result in higher income to that average American family, allowing them to keep as much as $9,000--a kind of wage increase of $9,000, an effective increase of $9,000, as much as that each and every year. It is an average increase, according to the Council of Economic Once those effects are fully felt, those effects are going to continue year after year across all income distributions.  We are going to another chart here. The family will be able to spend that $4,000 to $9,000 the way they want to. It could be the difference between having a rainy day fund and living paycheck to paycheck. It could be the downpayment on a new home or a route to a better education or a way they can do what they want to with their free time, if they have some or are able to get some because of innovations we are able to create and the jobs we are able to make better and wages people are able to see increased. It is about them putting more money into their families instead of their government.  None of that is going to happen, though, with this current Atari Tax None of that is going to happen unless we can give families and businesses the relief they need. That is what we have the opportunity to do here today.  This week, when we approve the budget, we set the stage for the budget reform, the budget bill, to move forward on tax reform and tax relief, allowing the American people to keep more money in their own pockets. We can provide meaningful relief with a simpler code, less hassle, less squandering of money to avoid the unfair death tax, and more businesses hiring more workers and paying higher wages. That is why this budget is so important. That is why I hope it is approved this week and we set the stage for a brighter future in the coming months and years, as we fight for every chance for the American people to keep the dollars they work so hard to get.

41,topic-id,1848,"Mr.Speaker, we had some interesting days here, but, over the weekend, being back in Texas, I am hearing the cries from people all over east There is a small number that say: Hey, I am not making much, and I am getting a subsidy from the government, so I am okay on my healthcare, I am young, I have no health problems, and that is fine.  But over and over, there is a cry going out around America that says: We elected Republicans in the majority in the House and the majority in the Senate to help us with our healthcare--with really health insurance. Everybody can get healthcare. You can just go to the emergency room, whether you have money or not.  This is really more about health insurance. Some of us have not wanted health insurance to make our major decisions for us on our own healthcare. We haven't wanted the government to make major decisions on our healthcare, but both are making those decisions for people across the country today.  Unfortunately, there are people telling me they are paying $8,000, $10,000, $12,000. I heard one for $20,000 yesterday from Texas, $20,000 for the family's insurance, and they have a $12,000 deductible, and they can't afford either one. They expected help.  President Trump is not the He has pushed, shoved, cajoled, done everything he could to try to get Congress moving in the House after a back and forth, wailing, gnashing of teeth. We got a bill. It wasn't perfect by any stretch. But at least it would have given people relief from high premiums, most Hopefully, Republicans won't misrepresent the truth, as some did.  Actually, we know some people just flat lied about People who said, ``If you like your insurance, you can keep it,'' they knew it was a lie. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. They knew that was a lie.  And now the people are suffering the consequences of trusting people in government who lied to them. They were deceived. But even with all the deception, most of the time it appeared that a clear majority of Americans did not want what was fraudulently called the Affordable Care There was nothing affordable about it, unless you didn't have any healthcare problems at all.  People who are carrying the weight of the taxes in this country have needed help. They counted on us to provide legislative changes, repeal of ObamaCare, let's put a system in place where people can make their own healthcare decisions, and we sent the bill to the Senate, and I still believe we should have been demanding more of the Senate every day.  I know there are a lot of people who say: Well, Republicans can't lose the majority in the Senate because there are a bunch more Democrats whose seats are up this time instead of Yes, we can lose the majority, even when there are more Democratic seats up for election.  That is what happens when people are sorely disappointed. Many stay home, and the wrong people will get elected when too many people stay home.  But the adage is, still true, democracy ensures people are governed no better than they deserve. So whether anybody liked or disliked President Obama as our President--and, by the way, for those who like to throw out the term ``hater,'' I don't hate anybody, but I can certainly disapprove of conduct.  For 8 years, America deserved Barack Hussein Before that, whether you like him or not, I like him, America deserved George Before that, America deserved 8 years of William Clinton--I forget his middle name. Before that, 4 years of George Before that, 8 years of Ronald And I am very pleased that America deserved Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton last  It is interesting, though, being in hearings today and hear people clambering that they demand action from this department, that department, it is taking too long, while, at that very moment, Democratic Senators at the other end of this building are doing everything they can to prevent confirmation of President Trump's appointees[[Page H7969]]to those departments so they can start getting things done.  It is amazing when one party like that can hold the ability, because of the filibuster rule, because of the requirement for 60 votes, apparently, they are able to hold up these appointees. To me, that is all the reason to go ahead and say: Do you know what, you are demanding action from people who you have not confirmed yet, so we are not going to let you play that game anymore. You have people saying, ``Oh, my goodness, these departments aren't getting decisions made, aren't getting their work done,'' and all the while you are holding them back from being able to do it by not confirming the people who need to be doing that work.  The Senate ought to just say: We are not playing that game, we are not letting you play that game, we are going to call the game off, we are going to get serious about America's problems, and we are going to confirm President Trump's nominees with 51 votes, not just judges, we are going to confirm his nominees with 51 votes. We cannot tolerate people--really it is fraudulent activity to hold back the nominees from being confirmed and then vilify the administration for not getting the work done that those nominees who hadn't been confirmed will have to do.  The Senate needs to respond. The Senate did not respond to the bill we sent to them. That was quite interesting. In my 12 years here, I have never seen a situation like that, Mr.Speaker, where some of us got calls from people in the Senate who don't normally get calls, and that included people from the Tuesday Group, the Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, and the Republican leadership. They all were asking the same question: Okay, would you please promise us that if we pass this healthcare bill in the Senate that you will not take it up and pass it in the House? Because it is only if you guys promise us, the Republicans promise us, you won't pass the bill that we have down here--apparently, it was so bad--that we will let it go to committee, or you will amend it, but you just promise us you won't pass the bill if we pass it.  Well, as far as I know, everybody I talked to gave reassurance to the Senators who called them and said: No, we promise, we won't pass your bill, it is terrible, we won't, we can assure you.  Even with those assurances, just the effort to get something passed so that we can come together in a conference between House conferees and Senate conferees, just to come together for the chance--this bill that the Senate was taking up to have some skinny repeal, they called it, of ObamaCare, and at least some measure of change to the suffering that people are enduring right now, and they still couldn't get 51 votes, which is all they needed under the reconciliation process.  Even when they were assured: We promise you, we won't pass this bill, you will get another chance to vote, just help the process, let's get it to conference, so we can get some relief to the American people who are suffering, suffering so much that they would go so far as to give us the majority in the Senate after they have given us the majority in the House, and give us the White House as a Republican Party--incredible.  But the American people are still suffering. And the budget apparently does not provide for ObamaCare to be repealed and replaced under reconciliation for the next 12 months. So unless the Senate feels enough heat from the American people--the Republicans that is--they are not going to do anything about ObamaCare that they promise to repeal and replace.                              {time}  1845  Apparently, it is going to have to get pretty hot in the kitchen down in the Senate to get people down there worked up enough to finally give the American people the relief that the Senate Republicans promised.  Now, I don't like talking about this, despite what some may think. It is much nicer to get along and go along, but people are suffering because we haven't kept our promise. The Senate couldn't pass anything that would get the American people some relief from all the suffering from  For those who are not aware, yes, there were bailouts for the monopoly insurance companies. Some made record profits, and yet they are still, under ObamaCare, the way it was written, supposed to get bailouts.  So it appears pretty clear the design of ObamaCare was to make it fail. Apparently, people at the top of some of these insurance companies have not been smart enough to figure out that they signed their own death warrants when they embraced ObamaCare, but it appears it was designed to make people angry at the greedy, allegedly corrupt health insurance companies.  I don't think they are corrupt, but there sure was a lot of greed there between some of the pharmaceutical companies and the health insurance companies signing on. Some of them tried to say: Well, oh, but we needed to be at the table.  We are going: Not if you are on the menu you didn't want to be at the table.  I am sure the executives that have their golden parachutes leave the health insurance companies after 5, 6, 7 years with their incomes.  The design was the health insurance companies make a fortune, people's premiums kept going through the roof, deductibles kept going through the roof, bailouts were provided to insurance companies that had record profits, and then the design ultimately would be the American people getting so angry that they would lash out and say: Enough already. I never thought I would say this, but anything has got to be better than these insurance companies, the handful that are left, so let's just let the government take care of everything.  Then we get a system that is twice as bad as the VA for all Americans, so all Americans can suffer fairly, equally, instead of getting what used to be some of the best healthcare ever in the history of the world.  We have another issue I want to touch on. Our Taxed Enough Already Caucus had a meeting yesterday and heard from Luke Rosiak, who has done more investigation on the IT scandal here on Capitol Hill, apparently done more investigation than anybody at the We keep hearing rumors that the FBI is reporting there is nothing to this, kind of like the Clinton scandal, the money that the Clinton Foundation got from the stockholders of Uranium One--she approves the sale of 20, 25 percent of America's uranium production; it ends up going to the Russians--the email scandal, that obviously there were efforts to destroy and obfuscate evidence that was being sought, and Comey went out of his way to protect ",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7968.txt,1801,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,11.0,October
1229,topic-id,5046,"Madam Speaker, it has been an interesting number of days here this week. We continue to have hearings and fight for good legislation, and we continue to hear from people back home that we simply must at least work on our promises to repeal ObamaCare and bring their health insurance into a realm that is affordable.  They realize they were lied to. They will never get the insurance they liked back. They would like to try to get their doctors back.  One of the interesting things about the design of the devious architect of ObamaCare is the guy who bragged later: Yeah, we knew you couldn't keep your insurance, you couldn't keep your doctor, but we had to say that to sell it.  They actually incentivized the handful of remaining insurance companies not to put the best cancer healthcare providers in their network. ObamaCare actually incentivizes insurance companies not putting the best heart healthcare providers or, in fact, any chronic, expensive disease that the insurance companies, because of the design of ObamaCare--and I think it was intentional--basically were penalized if they put the very best cancer treaters, heart treaters in their network. So there actually are indications that insurance companies, they could see what the administration was encouraging them to do.  For example, I had read that MD Anderson was not in those networks as a cancer provider. Some would argue it is the best cancer treatment facility. That certainly can be debated. I think it still comes down to the effort to get to the point where government is completely in charge of every American's healthcare.  ObamaCare was a good start, but obviously if you design a system so that the insurance companies, they just get down to a handful of monopolies and they are having record years, and that same bill even allows those insurance companies to get what are called bailouts after they have had record profits, well, most people are going to end up hating the insurance companies. And we have seen that.  What would happen, of course, is eventually people get so outraged with premiums going up, whether it is 10 percent or 70 percent--I have heard of it being doubled, being tripled since the last 7 years. I have heard all kinds of horror stories from people in east Around other places I have visited, it is the same thing happening. They can't afford their policy, yet they can't afford to pay an extra tax for not having a policy that the government says they have to have; and yet if they pay for their policy, the deductible is so high, they are still not going to get any benefit out of it.  So it is easy to see, when you start looking at the way in which ObamaCare was created, the rules in place for it, the day would come when people got so outraged at how expensive their health insurance was that they would scream: Look, I just can't stand it anymore. I never wanted the government to be in charge of my personal life, but anything's got to be better than the current system. Just let the government take it over.  Then, there you are, government controlling everybody's body, everybody's personal life.  Of course, we have got this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau out there created during the Obama years by the We were not helpful in that. We thought, sure, we want to help people who are being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lenders, but we don't need a Bureau to monitor everybody's debit and credit card transactions. There were those who argued: Yeah, but this way, they can monitor and they can tell if somebody's being taken advantage of.  There was a time, as a felony judge in Texas, that, if someone wanted your bank records, under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, we are supposed to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures, and that includes anyone's bank records. So people would come to me as a judge, they would have affidavits, and they hoped that would prove under oath probable cause that a crime had been committed and that this person committed it, and if so, I could sign the warrant that allowed them to go get bank records.  We used to care about the Fourth I know my friends across the aisle, our Democratic friends, they cared greatly, because I have heard over and over in Judiciary Committee arguments about the protections against unreasonable searches, and yet they set up a Bureau that violates that, says: Just give us all your information.  Well, sure, if somebody is being taken advantage of by an unscrupulous lender, then the remedy is they go complain to the appropriate government law enforcement or the SEC, whoever it is, and then they come to a judge like I was, get the warrant, get the records, and then make the determination if there is probable cause. We just lost so much of our privacy.  Several years ago, we said, well, since ObamaCare is going to allow the mass gathering of people's medical records and our Democratic friends set up this consumer protection racket here in Washington, we could conceivably have a day--and if we don't do something about ObamaCare and the CFPB, then it is closer than I imagined--when you get your mail, Madam Speaker, and you see: Oh, I have got a letter from the government here. And you open it, and it says: We noticed, when you were at Brookshire's grocery store the other day, that you bought a pound of bacon; and we also noticed, from your healthcare records, that your cholesterol rate is at this certain level, and so, therefore, since we control your healthcare now and we monitor your debit and credit purchases, here is the deal: you are either going to join a health club and start working out once a week and stop buying bacon, or we are going to have to raise the amount you pay in each month.  I mean, this is where it goes when you have the Orwellian Big Brother that was advanced more through ObamaCare than anything that has ever occurred in U.history. It has got to be repealed.  I want to applaud and thank President Trump for taking steps today through executive order. He shouldn't have had to do that. I am very, very grateful he did. God bless him for doing it. But we should have already taken care of that stuff. That is our job.  What do we do here in the House? It was contentious. The first bill was a disaster, but we got it to where it actually was going to bring premiums down for the middle class in It was going to make their premiums cheaper. It was going to make their deductibles lower. Then we had people in the Senate who got elected on the promise of repealing ObamaCare that voted ``no.'' We still have to do something.  I loved seeing the President's interview with our good friend, Sean Hannity, last night. I love this about President I think it is why he got elected. When Sean asked him about, basically, is this over, he gets this smile and says: We are not giving up, not giving up.  The truth is we cannot give up. People are counting on us. They don't know what to do.  There are small-business employers like the one in Tyler who told me that a few years ago he was paying $50,000 for his employees' health insurance. He has the same number of employees, and this year it is $153,000, and he is going to have to start letting people go or drop their insurance. It just cannot continue. People are already taking losses. It can't continue.  Well, with the proper President in place, and here in Congress we have taken some steps to ameliorate some of the damage to jobs in America, things seem to be turning around some. But we actually have to keep our promise, and I think we do that by putting a lot more heat on the Senate as the House body, House We have got to put pressure on the Like the President said, this fight cannot be over.  Normally, I have been told since my freshman term, you can't do big things in an election year. But I am beginning to wonder, if America makes it clear to the Republicans in the Senate that you either will keep your promise on ObamaCare, you will keep your promise on tax reform or you will not be back in the Senate, then I think we could buck tradition in this place.  The idea was that we were told back in 2006, in January: Well, we didn't keep any of our promises last[[Page H8021]]year as the Republican majority, but now, you veterans know we are into an even-numbered year. That means it is an election year, so we can't do any of those big things, because everybody knows you just can't do big things in an election year or you might lose.  Well, it would have been a lot better if we had already done those things, if we had repealed ObamaCare and put a system in place that was affordable, that gave people the healthcare they needed and with actual insurance and encouraged, instead of spending $700, $800, $900, sending it to the insurance company, how about putting $700, $800 in your own medical health savings account you control, debit-card coded where it can only be spent on healthcare, whether it is crutches, medicine, doctor visits, hospital stays, whatever, and you could have a high deductible. We could have a day where $700 goes to your account, $200 goes for catastrophic coverage. That is the kind of thing that we should have been pushing for and gone to, but, instead, we are pouring that money into health insurance companies.  Just in case, Madam Speaker, there are those who are already wondering, ``Maybe we should just let the government take over everything; that has got to be better,'' I heard on the news again today another horror story. Just when you thought the VA was being cleaned up, here comes another horror story.  Some doctor at the VA was allowed to do 80-some-odd surgeries that were unnecessary, inappropriate, or terribly done, even surgeries not even needed at all, on the wrong person, but it had been covered up for some time. Well, when the government is in charge of your healthcare, you can't expect any more than the lowest common denominator in the government.  I am very, very grateful we do have some good doctors, some good nurses in the VA, but I have also talked to good doctors and nurses in the VA who are so frustrated with such an albatross of a system.                              {time}  1700  Why not just let people--if you want to go to the VA clinic, here is your card, you go.  We thought we were doing a good thing, and I think it was a step in the right direction when we were going to allow veterans to go to a civilian clinic, hospital, healthcare provider if there was not one within a minimum number of miles. I believe it was 40, but I have heard horror stories about how people have been jerked around and not been allowed to utilize the program as it was designed. Here, again, we come back to what you get when the government is in charge. We have got to do that.  Stuart Varney was asking today again about tax reform. We promised it. We have got to deliver on that. These rumors I hear emanating from people at the Senate side of this building that: Yeah, well, the House can do the reform. They did their ObamaCare repeal and we didn't pass that, so maybe we won't do their tax reform package like we are working on.  It takes a lot of work to pass a major reform like we did on It takes even more work, perhaps, to do a significant tax reform package where it becomes simplified, people pay less tax, the economy explodes. You would think it would be a no-brainer, but apparently there are too many people up here with no brains and it is not getting done. We do have to do that. We promised we would. We have got to do it for the sake of the economy that will make people's lives so much better.  But in the meantime, if we are going to be an effective Congress, we have got to make sure that we maintain proper systems in place that we can do our business without inappropriate outside influence, whether it is coming from Russia or Wherever it is coming from, we need to know and we need to protect ourselves.  That is why this Taxed Enough Already Caucus meeting we had, we invited people in the tradition of my friend Tim Huelskamp, the former chair of that caucus from Just a great guy, a great It was great to talk to him recently. Tim started with this caucus having representatives of outside groups with important information we should share coming in and having Members of Congress come in and share information, figure out how we can help get the Nation's business done.  We have been concerned about articles we continue to read, especially by Luke Rosiak of The Daily No one has done more investigation on the issue of the Awan family cohorts that were working here on Capitol Hill for House They happened to be Democratic House I think the same thing could happen where one Republican could say, ``Oh, these folks are great,'' and before you know it, you have dozens of people having the same IT computer workers working part time. People are allowed to do that, hire somebody part time so it doesn't overwhelm your budget. Others can hire them part time, but under no circumstances can anybody working on the Hill make more than around $160,000.  We found out this week from the lead investigator, oh, not law enforcement, oh, no. FBI, apparently they are not getting anything done, and I will explain why in a moment. But as he has gone around and investigated and asked witnesses questions that have direct information about what is going on, Luke Rosiak would also ask: Has anyone from the FBI talked to you, or has any law enforcement talked to you?  He said 80 percent of the time the answer is no. No one from the FBI has talked to me. No one from any law enforcement has talked to me.  I hear rumors that there are people from the FBI telling the Department of Justice: Yeah, we have looked into it. There is nothing there.  Yeah, just the way the FBI looked into the notice from Russia that the Tsarnaev older brother had been radicalized.  What do they do?  I know because I have asked Director Mueller after he had run off thousands of years of our best experienced FBI agents, done more damage to the FBI than anybody since He has got plenty of young aggressive people without enough experience to call him out when he was making mistakes, as he made many.  They send out an FBI agent to talk to the older Tsarnaev after the second notice from Russian agents that this guy has been radicalized. He is going to be a threat. But because Director Mueller--now Special Counsel Mueller, who is hiring lawyers and investigators right and left--built up a beautiful, comfortable nest for himself, that same Mueller, as Director of the FBI, had the FBI training materials on radical Islamists purged of anything that might offend radical  Yes, he was more concerned about the little lunches and dinners he had with CAIR--or the Council of American-Islamic Relations--than he was about people being killed in Boston, because if he had, he would have made sure that the Tsarnaev brothers were properly investigated after they got two heads-up.  If they had bothered to look, they would have seen where the older Tsarnaev went and would have known he went to a hotbed of radicalism. They would have known to investigate: What has he been reading? What scriptures from the Koran has he been reading? What has he talked about? Is he doing more memorization? What is his appearance looking like now? Who is he hanging out with?  But no. Because he was too concerned about what he called the outreach program to Islamic Americans, he didn't want to offend anybody. He was more worried about offending somebody than saving the lives and limbs of  He created a massive problem at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and now we are turning special counsel over to this man?  We heard from Mr.Comey himself that he talked to Mueller even before his testimony before We heard from he himself that he leaked information that was clearly FBI information that should not have been leaked.  So there is a question of did he commit a crime, or did he just commit a breach of FBI ethics? What action should be taken?  Oh, no. We have got FBI Director Mueller on the case, and if you go back and look at the Washingtonian back in 2013, they did a big expose on how wonderful Mr.Comey was; and they point[[Page H8022]]out in there that, gee, basically if the whole world were on fire, Comey knew there would be one person that would still be standing with him there to protect him, Mr.Mueller; the same guy that is protecting him instead of investigating the leaks that have come from the FBI that appear to have gone through the exact same person through whom he leaked what he admitted. But, no, we have got Mueller, the same man who is going to be there through thick and thin to protect Comey; he is the one investigating.  If Jeff Sessions as Attorney General cannot investigate Mr.Comey and his violations, potential breaches of the law, then we need another special counsel, and it sure ain't going to come from Mr.Rosenstein, that is for sure.  We need a special counsel. I think the Attorney General could do it, but I am not sure the extent to which he has recused himself. But this has to be investigated. Unfortunately, because of the damage done to the FBI, I still have questions arise on things they investigate because I know the damage that Mueller did to their training materials, to their ability. As one of our intelligence agents explained, we have blinded ourselves of the ability to see our enemies.  But don't worry, the guy that was the biggest blinder is now the special counsel growing his little bureaucracy. And I am sure, knowing how vengeful he is, when he hears what I have had to say, then he probably will open an investigation on me. That is just how vengeful this man has been.  But the truth is the truth. He damaged the FBI, running off thousands of years of experienced people. He purged the training materials that would have--and Michele Bachmann and I went through these, and another Congressman from Georgia went through some, and there were some things, sure; cartoon stuff, sure; take them out, fine. But there were some things in there very clearly that every FBI agent needs to know to help them spot a radical Islamist, and Mueller blinded them of the opportunity to do that.  I will never forget, at one of our hearings, after it was so clear that he was more concerned about offending CAIR than he was of protecting Boston, and he was so defensive, I said: You didn't even go to the mosque where Tsarnaev went to see if he had been radicalized.  After fumbling around, I finally got him to tell me how he thought that was wrong, and he said: We did go to the mosque.  And I didn't hear it at first. Unfortunately, I didn't hear it until I had it played on the video.  He said: We did go to that mosque in our outreach program.  Oh, the outreach program. Yeah, you didn't go to investigate Tsarnaev to find out if he had been radicalized by asking questions in the mosque where he worshipped to find out if he was now acting like a radical. And there are clear indications. That is why we don't have to worry about most Muslims, but you sure need to know what you are looking for.  For those that want to call people like me an Islamophobe, well, it is another lie. But there are plenty of lies around I have got enough Muslim friends in the Middle East and Afghanistan and other countries. They know they don't want radicals. I am so proud of the President of Egypt, el-Sisi, a man who would stand before imams and tell them: We have got to get our religion back from the radicals.  That is a courageous great man. We owe him a lot of help.  So what do we have here on Capitol Hill?  We had guys that apparently never had a background search. And as we found out from the investigator for The Daily Caller, there were actually three or more months of the year when Imran Awan would be in Pakistan doing his job, supposedly making sure Capitol Hill computers were secured. We find out that there was suspicion when they saw this Imran Awan clan. His wife got involved. As we heard, when they would get up to the maximum amount one person could make on Capitol Hill, they would add another family member, and then they would get up to $160,000; add another family member, get them up; add another family member. And apparently all of these people didn't work.                              {time}  1715  The people that had a lot of experience working at McDonalds probably didn't have that much experience on computers, but he was still making $160,000 or so a year and, we find out--I had no idea, just this week found out--they were able to gain $6 million to $7 million from the House of Representatives' budget.  And we find out, gee, one of them, had gotten $100,000 from an individual with known ties to Hezbollah, and we don't know for what reason, but clearly never came to Capitol He was put on the payroll of the U.House of Representatives, the guy that was owed $100,000 with ties to Hezbollah, and made over $200,000 or so before he was taken off the payroll.  That is a good way to pay back a loan, isn't it?  So we had Imran Awan; Hina Alvi, his wife; Abid Awan; Jamal Awan; Rao Abbas; and possibly a couple of others we found out--just incredible that this kind of thing could happen.  But the suspicion grew when he was supposed to be working on the computer system of Congressman, now attorney general in California, No indication Becerra knew anything was wrong, but people here on the Hill watching this saw there have been 5,700 accesses to his computer system and 5,400, at least, were not from people who should have been getting into his computer system.  Then we find out, actually, he downloaded other Members of Congress' servers completely onto Becerra's server, and, actually, he had 2 terabytes of information that he said was for their child's homework--a little child's homework taking 2 terabytes.  But we also know, apparently, from what came out this week, he was downloading dozens of Members' computers onto one server so that anybody he wanted to could access any of that information.  Now, there is no indication that classified information was revealed through the access to all these computer systems by people who were not hired by that Member of But we also know--I mean, General Petraeus, I read somewhere that it was actually a calendar that he gave to the lady who was to do a book, that he was having an affair with, that had some stuff that was considered classified.  Well, on every Member's computer system, you get their calendar, you get all their email, you get all their appointments, things that are going on in the office, you get reactions to people who come in over different bills, you get reaction to different things that have been learned in the intelligence community. There are all kinds of things that people would pay a lot of money for.  Then we find out, you had a bankruptcy in the Awan history, you had domestic violence in the history, and now we find out this week, newly reported, that his wife is now upset. We can maybe get some answers now that she is upset because, now, she has found out that not only was he being corrupt to the banks here in the United States and on Capitol Hill, but he also, without his wife's knowledge, married another lady. So that may help bring his first wife around to giving us more information about just how bad things got.  But the report was, this week, investigators with the IG's office here on Capitol Hill have been quietly tracking the five IT workers--that is, the Awan group--their digital footprints for months. They were alarmed by what they saw.  The employees, the Awans, appeared to be accessing congressional servers without authorization, an indication that they ``could be reading and/or removing information,'' according to the documents distributed at the previously unreported private briefings.  So I know that there are people who have reported here on Capitol Hill, well, it is being looked into, but there is no evidence of crime. Really?  Because we have also learned that there may have been hundreds of vouchers filed falsely for, say, an $800 iBut if you say that it is under $500, then it doesn't go in the inventory, and it is easier to steal and sell, for example, hypothetically, in Pakistan, where there are reports that he sent technological systems and sold them to make extra money.  We know that he was not truthful and honest in his financial disclosures.[[Page H8023]]That can be a crime. But just one voucher where you claim something only cost $490 and the server system cost $310 when you know that item actually cost $800 and should go into the inventory, that could be a crime. It appears that happened countless times, but we need to be trying to count anyway.  We know that there were many pieces of computer equipment found at his home after FBI agents said his wife appeared to be fleeing, to not come back, even though she had a trip back. We don't know what representations have been made to get her to come back, but we know that the tenants who leased the house where they fled from had been threatened by Imran Awan's lawyer for allowing law enforcement to have access to that computer equipment that was there at his house. Hard drives appeared to be destroyed so they could not be properly investigated.  We got a report that one of the group appeared to be home most of the time and was not here in Washington, D.But what a great gig, when you can make $160,000 a year for servicing computer equipment. And it appears all of these five, six, seven people in this group didn't have competence to do computer or IT work, yet they were sure making a good living doing it.  But for those who continue to say ``we just don't think there is much there,'' all that should tell you is the report by Luke Rosiak, of all the witnesses to this whole sordid matter, only about 20 percent of them have ever been interviewed by FBI or law enforcement. It tells you somebody around here in this town, this Hill, somebody does not want to get to the bottom of this. If law enforcement wants to get to the bottom of this, they will get to the bottom of it.  Kind of like Benghazi, if we really wanted to get to the bottom of it, we would do like Judicial Watch and be relentless till we got to the bottom of it. We haven't gotten there yet  So, Mr.Speaker, there is a lot that needs to be investigated, a lot that needs to be done. We need--somebody, sounds like, needs to be investigating Mr.Mueller, but certainly needs to be investigating the various leaks that appear to have come from Mr.Comey through the same sources as the one he admitted. That has got to be investigated. And Mueller can't do it and, apparently, the current Attorney General can't. We have got to have somebody appointed to get to the bottom of what was happening at the DOJ during last year when an election was going on.  We need to have an investigation to thoroughly get into this matter of having a U.N.--our representative to the U.is unmasking American information. We were assured that kind of thing would not happen if we would just reauthorize that program: Oh, no, no.

757,topic-id,903,"Mr.Speaker, I very much appreciate the gentleman organizing this hour of Special Order remarks, and your leadership on these three important issues.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to discuss the importance of bolstering enforcement of existing immigration law and securing the border. The interior enforcement and border security are vital to enhancing public safety, keeping the door open to law-abiding immigrants, protecting our borders, and restoring the rule of law.  Under President Obama, interior enforcement deteriorated dramatically as his administration refused to enforce immigration laws, rewrote the law through executive action, and implemented policies that enabled millions of unlawful and criminal aliens to remain in the United States free from any possibility of removal.  The Obama administration's policies had--and continue to have--disturbing consequences. The rule of law was undermined as hundreds of thousands of Central American unaccompanied minors and families arrived at the southwest border during the Obama years and were released into the U.Too many Americans were killed or seriously harmed at the hands of aliens who joined gangs or committed crimes.  Fortunately, the Trump administration has begun to reverse the Obama administration's disastrous policies and is enforcing the law as written by President Trump has issued executive orders to strengthen interior enforcement and implement strong border security measures. The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security are already executing these executive orders, and there have been quick results.  Illegal border crossings at the Southwest border dropped dramatically at the beginning of the Trump administration due, in large part, to consistent enforcement of the law and the strong message that the U.no longer tolerates illegal immigration.  However, illegal border crossings are rising again despite the best efforts of the Trump administration, demonstrating that the President should be granted additional, long-needed legislative tools. The House Judiciary Committee has been hard at work to improve our Nation's immigration laws and has already approved bills that are crucial to enable our country to gain control of our immigration system.  The Davis-Oliver Act is the keystone of our interior enforcement efforts and is named after Placer County Detective Michael Davis, Jr., and Sacramento County Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two California law enforcement officers who were murdered by an unlawful immigrant in October 2014.  The bill improves the enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws to enhance public safety. Specifically, the Davis-Oliver Act provides tools to crack down on dangerous sanctuary city policies and contains much-needed changes to protect American communities from unlawful immigrants who commit crimes in the United States, or are gang members.  The Davis-Oliver Act also enhances national security by improving our Nation's first line of defense, the visa issuance process. It provides thorough screening of foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States in order to prevent terrorists from entering our country. The bill also ensures the rule of law and removes the ability of any President to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement by granting States and localities the authority to voluntarily assist in the enforcement of Federal immigration law and to enforce their own immigration laws consistent with Federal practices.  The House Judiciary Committee has also approved several bills to reform the asylum and refugee programs to curtail rampant fraud, while ensuring that our Nation continues to be a safe haven for those persecuted around the world. The surge of Central American unaccompanied alien minors and family units seeking to enter the U.illegally at our southern border put a strain on manpower and resources. It also exposed loopholes in our Nation's immigration laws that are being exploited by smugglers and others seeking to game the system.  The Asylum Reform and Border Patrol Act makes a number of improvements to our Nation's laws to prevent fraud and abuse in the system and assure that asylum is reserved for those truly fleeing persecution in their home country.  Further, the Protection of Children Act makes sure that unaccompanied alien minors who make the dangerous journey to the United States are swiftly and safely returned home. For those who stay with a sponsor in the United States while awaiting their immigration hearing, the bill provides for greater transparency and safety to these minors to ensure that they are not inadvertently delivered into the hands of criminals or abusers.  The Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act reforms the refugee program by curbing fraud and strengthening public safety and national security. It also provides State and local governments the power to decide if refugees are to be resettled within their communities and gives Congress, not the President, the authority to set the overall refugee ceiling for each year.  The House Judiciary Committee also plans to bring up a bill that protects jobs for citizens and legal workers, the Legal Workforce This bill requires all U.employers to check the work eligibility of all future hires through the tried and tested E-Verify system. E-Verify quickly confirms 99 percent of work-eligible employees and takes less than 2 minutes to use.  Over 740,000 American employers currently use E-Verify, and 83 percent of America's employers support a mandatory electronic verification system. While many aspects of our Nation's immigration system need to be improved, including our guest worker program for American agriculture, we must strengthen the enforcement of our immigration laws. Immigration enforcement is crucial to maintain our sovereignty, to protect national security, and to restore the rule of law.  Mr.Speaker, I call on Congress to take up the House Judiciary Committee's immigration enforcement bills soon.  ",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7961-2.txt,446,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,11.0,October

116,topic-id,1557,"Mr.President, I wish to take a few minutes to support the effort to pass the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. I am on the Budget Committee, and I am pretty familiar with the document. It provides a pathway to balance. It actually has a $197 billion surplus in 2027, and it allows for tax cuts.  To Republicans--and Democrats too; you are welcome to join--the only way we are ever going to meaningfully get a tax cut is to pass a budget reconciliation instruction. This budget allows us to cut taxes. I hope some Democrats will join us, but if they choose not to, we can do it with a simple majority. If we don't pass this budget, we can't cut taxes unless we get 60 votes. With our friends on the other side--I think it is going to be hard to get any Democrats for a meaningful tax cut. They are not bad people; they just see things differently. When they spend money, they think that is good. They don't worry about the deficit. When we cut taxes, the deficit is the most important thing. My belief is that not only will we not have a deficit, we will actually have a surplus because this budget does two things: It restrains spending by $5.1 trillion over the next decade, and it actually creates a system for tax cuts to spur economic growth.  If we could grow the GDP number by just 1 percent, that would be trillions of dollars of revenue. To those who are interested in this, we have been growing at about 1.9 percent GDP per year over the last 8 years--right around 2, sometimes under, sometimes a bit over. The historical average since World War II has been 3.2. If we could get back to 3.2 percent GDP growth, there would be trillions of dollars coming in to the Treasury, and I believe we can.  President Trump is trying to deregulate America after 8 years of heavy regulation, but he can only do so much through Executive order.  Senator Sullivan, the Presiding Officer, talked about the opportunities in I have learned a lot about There are 750,000 people living in a State twice the size of It is beautiful as it can be. Environmentally, you are very sensitive. That is one of the qualities of Alaska you want to preserve. God has blessed Alaska with a lot of natural resources, and it would be good for the people of Alaska and the United States as a whole.  Every liter of gas and barrel of oil we can extract from Alaska in an environmentally sound way is less to buy from people who hate our guts. We are going to be using oil and gas for a long time to come. I want to move to a lower carbon economy. I think that would be good for the environment and good for our economy. Alaska has been blessed with natural resources, and I think Senator Sullivan explained how sensitive they are in the extraction process. But it would be insane to take Alaska oil and gas off the table for America because in that area, Russia is all over the place, and, trust me, they don't care about the environment.  One thing this budget doesn't do is it doesn't change the Budget Control Act caps. There is one member of our caucus who claims that this budget is somehow fiscally irresponsible. It is not. It actually leads to a surplus.  There is nothing in this budget that allows for more defense spending. The overseas contingency operations account is money set aside for our military and State Department to deal with the wars we are fighting that are not part of the Budget Control We have been doing that for years. So for anybody to suggest that this authorizes an explosion of spending on the defense side--you literally don't know what you are talking about. If you looked at the details of the budget, you would find that it cuts spending by $5.1 trillion and actually has a $197 billion surplus 10 years from now.  But I want to let the body know--and the Presiding Officer will be right in that fight--that I, along with Senator McCain, President Trump, General Mattis, Senator Sullivan, Senator Blunt, and many others, am going to do everything I can to give the military more resources to fight wars we can't afford to lose.  I look forward to this debate with some of my colleagues on the other side and a few on this side.  Really, is it smart to have the smallest Navy since 1950? Is it really smart to have an Army 1940s-size given what is going on in the world, having fighter squadrons grounded not because the enemy shot us down but because the Congress shot us down?  We are spending about 3.2 percent of GDP on defense. Historically, since World War II, it has been about 5. Tell me how you justify spending that much less today given the world we have to deal with. Where is the peace dividend?  Since 2011, when sequestration was passed, the world has deteriorated. President Trump is promising to rebuild the military, give them the capability they need to keep the enemies at bay and not fight wars with one hand tied behind their back. So I will be working with Senator McCain and many others to make sure that our military is replenished; that we do have a 350-ship Navy, not 278; that we have an Army consistent with the threats--about 520,000 versus 420,000.  The 1 job of the Congress and the Federal Government is to defend the That is a different debate. That is not part of the budget. The budget resolution doesn't change defense spending caps. Hopefully, we can do that later, working with our Democratic friends.  This is the last best chance we will have to cut taxes. If this budget resolution fails, the ability to cut taxes on President Trump's watch goes away.  To those of you on the Republican side who have been claiming that we need tax cuts and a simpler tax code, this is your chance. If we don't succeed now, we are going to fail for the entire term of President That will be the end of us as a party, because if you are a Republican and you don't want to simplify the Tax Code and cut taxes, what good are you to anybody?  Our friends on the other side have really invested in ``the government.'' Somebody needs to be involved in American politics who would actually like to send more money to you and less money to the government in a responsible way.  So I hope we are going to cut the corporate tax rate to make us competitive. We are going to double the standard exemptions so working people will have more money in their pockets. We are going to clean up some of the deductions and exemptions for the few at the expense of the many. But we can only do that if we pass a budget resolution.  A final thought. From the Republican Party point of view, we have the House, the Senate, and the We have nobody to blame in this exercise but ourselves. If you are a Republican and you are frustrated with the lack of progress, count me in. The President is a willing partner to help us repeal and replace ObamaCare and to get a healthy tax cut to grow an economy that is dying to grow. But we have to help ourselves.  If we can't muster the votes necessary to pass this budget resolution to cut your taxes, then everybody who supported us for all these years should feel let down, and we will have let you down. I hope that doesn't happen. I am confident it won't. But to those Republicans who believe that a ``no'' vote is good for the future of conservatism and the future of the economic well-being of the country, I could not disagree with you more. You will never balance the budget by dealing with discretionary spending alone. We are at 2008 levels of discretionary spending. What balances the budget is entitlement reform. If you want to balance the budget, vote for Graham-Cassidy because it finally puts Medicaid on a sustainable path.  We have to deal with our entitlement problem, but that is not in this budget reconciliation instruction. This instruction allows us to cut taxes with a[[Page S6601]]majority-only vote and gets to balance or a surplus in 2027.  From a Republican point of view, this is the most important vote we are going to cast in 2017. If we fail, that is the end of this party's ability to grow. All of those who worked hard to get us here are going to be disappointed, and they should be.  We are not going to disappoint you. We are going to pass this budget resolution. We are going to cut your taxes, and we are eventually going to rebuild and replace ObamaCare, which is failing, with a block grant that gets the money and power closer to where you live, in the hands of the people you can vote for. We are going to succeed.  With that, I yield the floor.

814,topic-id,2799,"Mr.President, before I read from my remarks, I would like to make the point that I get the impression that what some Members of the other political party--but more often editorials and think tanks--believe and want the public to believe is that there is actually a tax bill produced by the tax-writing committees of the Congress, something that is very definitive in what it does to the tax policy. I want to make clear that there is no such document. All we have so far is what is called a framework agreed to by the leaders of the two tax-writing committees and the Treasury Department and the leaders of the House and the You cannot draw conclusions about who is going to pay what taxes just from the framework.  I will get into real detail on this, but the other thing I would like to make clear is the fact that there are a lot of people drawing conclusions about who is going to get tax benefits and who is going to be hurt as a result of all this information that is out there, from which no one can draw conclusions because there isn't any bill before the Congress at this point. There will be in a matter of weeks.  The budget that we are debating this week paves the way for fundamental tax reform. For more than a decade, both sides of the aisle have talked about the need for tax reform that provides tax simplification, tax fairness, and gives us the ability to increase our economic competitiveness so that we can grow the economy.  Under President George Bush, we had a bipartisan tax reform panel. Under President Obama, we had the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles We have had individual Members also authoring tax plans, including a bipartisan bill authored by Finance Committee Ranking Member Wyden, the Senator from Oregon, and former Senator Coats, then representing the State of  In addition to these high-profile plans that have been out there over the years, the Senate Finance Committee has also had countless tax reform hearings over this extended period. The[[Page S6442]]committee also held a series of bipartisan options papers discussions under then-Chairman Additionally, under Chairman Hatch, we had bipartisan tax reform working groups. All of this work over the years has laid the foundation and informed the unified framework released by the Big 6. That is the framework I previously referred to.  The influence of these prior discussions and proposals on the Big 6 framework is evident. In other words, all of that work that has gone on over the years in different environs is bearing fruit now in getting a consensus of what we ought to do in a broad way of moving forward on tax simplification, tax reform, and tax cuts.  The framework is nothing but a framework and will be filled in with details by the tax-writing committees. It is at that point that any think tank, any Member of the other political party, any Member of our political party, any college professors, any economists anyplace can make some sound judgments as to the extent to which certain people benefit or don't benefit from the legislation before us.  I think they ought to take into consideration that you have to think about the country as a whole, which hasn't grown by more than 1.6 percent in each of the 8 years of the previous administration. If you are going to have jobs created, you have to grow at about twice that amount, at 3 percent or more. That is some of the thinking behind this budget that is before the Senate right now and the thinking behind the tax reform measures that will follow our adoption of the budget.  I will be repeating myself to some extent here, but for illustration, I have a chart here comparing the Big 6 framework, the Wyden-Coats bill, and the Simpson-Bowles plan to which I have already referred. You can see here the main point about putting these three plans together is to show similarity. All proposals would consolidate the current tax brackets down to three. That is one point the chart makes.  Two plans provide for a top rate of 35 percent, while one provides for a top rate of 28 percent. Yet the Big 6 framework, the framework that will evolve into a piece of legislation called tax simplification, tax reform, and tax cuts, is being criticized for having a 35-percent top rate that somehow is a giveaway to the wealthy, whereas you can see from this chart that plans that have been bipartisan in the past have had the 35-percent top rate or less. Of course, the 35-percent tax rate that is said to be a giveaway to the wealthy is not even the one that proposes a lower 28-percent rate. The 28-percent rate is reserved for the Simpson-Bowles plan. That Simpson-Bowles group was put together by none other than a Democratic  Let me ask: Were Democratic members of the Simpson-Bowles Commission, which voted for that plan, voting to give huge tax cuts to the wealthy? Do our Democratic colleagues expect us to believe that a 35-percent top rate is a sensible bipartisan compromise when offered by Democrats but a giveaway to the rich once it is associated with this administration or with Republican Members of Congress?  Well, another thing is the same: All three plans would repeal the alternative minimum tax. This is very surprising. From listening to my Democratic colleagues, I thought repealing the alternative minimum tax was some nefarious plot to benefit President Trump, but that just doesn't square with the reality and what has gone on in the Congress over the last decade and a half with regard to tax reform. Repealing the alternative minimum tax has had strong bipartisan support.  While serving as either chairman or the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus and I introduced bipartisan, stand-alone legislation to repeal the alternative minimum tax. We did that across several Of course, we were not successful. I hope this Congress will be successful in doing that.  Our legislation eliminating the alternative minimum tax garnered bipartisan support from across the political spectrum. The current ranking member of the Finance Committee and the current minority leader of the entire U.Senate even joined Senator Baucus and me at that time in these efforts as cosponsors of that legislation.  At the time, a few years ago, the current ranking member even went so far as to say that ``the alternative minimum tax should be Congress' number-one priority for tax reform.'' I agree with what the current ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee said a few years ago, which I just quoted. The alternative minimum tax repeal should be a top priority, and it seems as though it is going to be a top priority this year because the alternative minimum tax adds needless complexity to the Tax Code and often hits middle-income taxpayers rather than the wealthy, as originally intended.  Let me give a history of the alternative minimum tax. I think it was passed in 1969. Studies of wealthy people showed that about 150 people who were very wealthy paid no income tax, and there was a feeling that everyone ought to pay some tax. The alternative minimum tax was set up to hit those 150 and some other people, but it wasn't ever indexed. Now it hits millions of middle-income taxpayers. To help those middle-income taxpayers who should have never been hit by the alternative minimum tax--that is the rationale for doing away with it.  We even have the Internal Revenue Service's Taxpayer Advocate Service repeatedly calling for the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, noting that it ``does not achieve its original goal'' and ``stealthily increases marginal rates for middle-income taxpayers.''  I want to move now to the corporate tax part of the framework. I am back at the chart now. Similarity between these plans exists for reform of corporate taxes. For instance, each one of these three plans seeks to significantly lower our corporate tax rate.  The Wyden-Coats bill calls for an 11-percent reduction in the corporate rate, bringing that rate down from 35 to 24 percent. The Big 6 framework aims for 20 percent as the highest corporate tax rate. Yet, according to the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, the corporate rate reduction in the Big 6 framework is ``a massive corporate tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits shareholders.''  The last time I checked, the distribution of the benefit from a corporate rate reduction is the same no matter what party or what President proposed it. This chart shows that similarity between the bipartisan plans and the Big 6 framework. I don't think the Senate Finance Committee ranking member proposed a 24-percent corporate rate when that Wyden-Coats plan was developed because he wanted to provide a massive benefit to the shareholders he now talks about. I also know for certain that isn't why the Big 6 framework aims for 20 percent.  The truth is, there has been a really big, growing, bipartisan consensus that our corporate tax rate is out of step with other major trading partners. Now, at 35 percent--and it has been at 35 percent for decades--our corporate tax rate is the highest among developed countries. While we have been at 35 percent, our major trading partners have been lowering their rates. On average, their rates are more than 10 percent lower than ours, so averaging maybe about 24 percent.  Now, that obviously has a great impact on jobs in America because it puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage globally, costing American jobs. It has also strained our corporate tax system to its breaking point as we have battled corporate inversions and foreign takeovers. Now, how much in the last several years have we heard Members of this body complaining about foreign takeovers and inversions to skip the country, to save taxes? Well, that is one of the reasons for reducing the corporate tax rate so that doesn't happen.  Moreover, a growing body of economic literature is showing that a significant portion of the corporate tax does indeed fall on workers in the form of lower wages. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation as well as the Congressional Budget Office assumes 25 percent of corporate tax falls on workers. So if you reduce the corporate tax rate, according to congressional researchers here who work for us, one would assume that workers are going to get 25 percent of that benefit to their wages. We even have other studies--many--finding that workers could bear more than 70 percent of the burden of a high corporate tax rate.  While the exact burden borne by workers may be debated, the economic[[Page S6443]]research is very clear. A corporate rate reduction means a significant wage increase for workers. In fact, the Council of Economic Advisers very conservatively estimates that workers could see their wages increase by more than $4,000 due to lowering the corporate rate to 20 percent.  In reality, there is very little in this tax framework that has not had bipartisan support in the past or is not well within the mainstream of bipartisan proposals before us. Once again, that statement I just made is the purpose of this chart, to show that this bipartisan agreement and what we have before the Congress coming up--the Big 6 framework--have so many likenesses in it that there is absolutely no rationale for the partisanship we are having in the news media and on the Senate floor talking about this framework. This is why the accusations that the Big 6 tax framework is nothing more than a giveaway to the rich--why that statement we hear so often is so dumbfounding.  I want to move on to another issue about whether these are tax cuts for the rich, and I want to show how one of the proposals before the Congress will help the rich. More perplexing is that those who are screaming ``tax cuts for the rich'' and saying it the loudest have also been the most ardent supporters of maintaining one of the largest loopholes for the wealthy; namely, the State and local tax deduction.  I know the minority leader was on the floor last week, I think, citing IRS statistics to claim that the deduction was really a middle-class benefit, but the minority leader told only part of that story. I would like to look at some estimates by the liberal Tax Policy Center that my Democratic colleagues like to cite so often. According to the Tax Policy Center, 90 percent of the tax increase from eliminating the deduction would fall on taxpayers with incomes exceeding $100,000, and 40 percent of the total would be paid just by taxpayers with incomes exceeding $500,000 a year.  Think of it this way. Those with incomes exceeding $500,000 make up less than 1 percent of all tax filers, yet receive 40 percent of the deduction benefit of claiming the State and local tax deduction.  I would like to illustrate it a better way. I have a chart based on IRS data that looks at the benefit of the deduction by adjusted gross income. Prior to going to the chart, I think it is important to point out that only about 30 percent of the taxpayers even itemize and have the State and local tax deduction available to them because you have to itemize to get that. This chart is going to focus on that 30 percent.  The first group I have highlighted on this chart are taxpayers with incomes below $50,000. As we can see on the chart, only about 12 percent of the tax filers in this group claim the deduction. In other words, 88 percent of the taxpayers in this category receive no benefit from the State and local tax deduction. That 12 percent does get a fairly nice benefit from it. They are deducting an average of a little over $3,000 in State taxes for a State benefit of just under $500, assuming they are in today's 15 percent bracket.  From further down the chart, we can see that the benefits afforded to low- to middle-income taxpayers are very much dwarfed by the benefits afforded to the wealthy or, as some of my Democratic colleagues might have become accustomed to referring to them, the millionaires and billionaires. Where only 12 percent of taxpayers with incomes under $50,000 have any benefit from the State and local tax deduction, over 90 percent of filers with incomes exceeding $500,000 claim the deduction. Tax filers in the $500,000 to $1 million range are, on average, deducting more in State and local taxes--$53,000--than the incomes of the taxpayers in the first group.  If we assume taxpayers in this second group are, under the current law, in the 39.6-percent tax bracket, that translates into a tax benefit of nearly $21,000. For those with incomes exceeding $1 million, there is an average tax benefit of about $100,000.  So if you are truly interested in eliminating tax loopholes for the rich, look no further than the elimination of the State and local tax deduction. This elimination provides an opportunity to better target more tax relief where we want to target it--to the middle class--making up for any benefit the middle class may lose from deductions and then some. In other words, the income tax would remain much more progressive.  The Big 6 framework provides the tools to do a middle-income tax reduction, including nearly doubling the standard deduction, reducing the current 15-percent rate to 12 percent, and significantly increasing the child tax credit. The framework also grants significant leeway to the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee to explore additional options to ensuring middle-income tax relief.  In addition to being a benefit that overwhelmingly goes to the wealthy, the State and local tax deduction also has the effect of disproportionately benefiting States with high State and local taxes. Essentially, the deduction allows wealthy individuals in high-tax States to then offload some of their State and local tax burdens onto taxpayers in other  This new chart lists the top 10 States that benefit the most from the State and local tax deduction. The States are listed, and we can see the extent to which they benefit from it. We see we have New York at the top, a little lower is California, and a little bit below that is It would seem to me that our Democratic colleagues like to talk a big game about eliminating loopholes for the wealthy, but when it comes down to actually doing it, they are more interested in holding on to a tax subsidy that favors the tax-and-spend policies of overwhelmingly blue  I yield the floor.

505,topic-id,860,"Mr.Speaker, it has been 3 weeks since the eye of Hurricane Maria crossed over Puerto It has been 3 weeks, and there are still parts of the island that have not had contact with FEMA yet--3 weeks. For most people, that has meant no power, and most still don't have running water.  Hospitals and clinics were hit hard, as The New York Times reports. The daughter of one man who died because he couldn't receive oxygen treatment told the paper: ``Because of the electricity situation, a lot of people died and are still dying.''  Forty percent of the island still lacks running water because of the blackout, which still affects 85 percent of the island. As a result, many people are bathing in streams and receiving water from huge tanks, which is never a good idea.  This is after 3 weeks in the most powerful nation on This is unacceptable.  Our response to Hurricane Maria and the people of Puerto Rico is a national and international embarrassment and a tragedy. They are our own citizens in our own Caribbean colonies of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and we have not helped them all that we can.  I spoke to Chicago firefighters yesterday who have been in Puerto Rico for about a week, and they tell me it is worse than we are being told.                              {time}  1015  They told me yesterday that they are still making contact in towns where people come up to them and say, ``Thank God, it is FEMA; you are finally here,'' only to be told, ``No, we are not FEMA; we are from Chicago; we are firefighters,'' and they embrace and cry with gratitude.  Last week, a group of my colleagues and I got together. We represent large Puerto Rican communities here on the mainland in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, and All of us have been contacted by our constituents who are in desperate need to get their loved ones back and out of Puerto  After 3 weeks, they have run out of patience and are not interested in excuses in our congressional district. They want their parents, they want their Tia with cancer, and they want their cousins on dialysis off the island, period, now. They want a plane ticket to get the hell out.  Our communities are ready. Lorain, Ohio; Hartford; Boston; Orlando; New York; Chicago; we are all ready, but the problem is transportation. If you have money, connections, or internet access, then you probably can find a flight out.  I know this because I was in Puerto Rico 2 weeks ago, and I saw the Land Rovers, the Jaguars, parked at the private airports in San Juan, because if you have the money, you have already put your loved ones on a flight out of  The individuals from FEMA have been doing a great job, given the constraints, but I think now FEMA and the military resources should focus on the task of evacuating the elderly, the sick, and the vulnerable from the island.  Look, this is the way FEMA works. They say: Well, we only take on tasks that the Governor asks us to take on, and the Governor is not likely to go to FEMA to ask them to get thousands and thousands of his constituents off the island.  Number one, it is a difficult request for any local official to make. Captains of industry and leaders on the island want to make sure that there are Puerto Rican workers there to rebuild, and of course, to continue to buy their products. I get that. But at the same time, those same captains of industry and political leaders, guess what, I bet you most of them have already got their loved ones off the island.  Number two, we know the Governor has to be extremely careful how he asks for anything because we all know the President doesn't take criticism very well or even a hint of criticism. The Governor doesn't want to get blackballed by the President who might go off on a Twitter rant at any moment unless he is praised and stroked every step of the way.  But our Puerto Rican constituents don't vote for the Governor of Puerto They vote for us, for DeLauro, for Crowley, for McGovern, for Espaillat, for Marcy Kaptur, and they want us to help them get their families out of danger's way. They are demanding help getting their family members out, and I think FEMA and the U.military can do the job. They just need the orders from the people in charge.  Let's be clear: if anyone wants to leave Puerto Rico, they should have our help in doing so. For thousands, it is a question of life and death and survival. That is what is needed to help Puerto We don't need the President tossing paper towels to storm victims like he was tossing a ball to a dog or maybe tossing peanuts to squirrels in the park. We need airplanes, ships, and helicopters to get the people the hell out; otherwise, it will be worse than let them eat cake; it is let them die.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7923.txt,478,CLEAN POWER PLAN,2017.0,11.0,October

So they called me, their Congressman, and I called the State Department to see what could be done.  Within 36 hours of my call, our U.citizens--nearly 150 of them--were evacuated from an island, in the ocean, surrounded by water.  Do you know where they were taken to for safety?  Puerto Yes, Puerto Rico, where it has now been 3 weeks since Hurricane Maria and most people do not have power or clean drinking water, and where the deterioration of the healthcare system is leaving people without critical treatments and causing the death toll to go up.

We did it in Houston, in Jacksonville, and New  No, the Governor has not asked for help in evacuating people, they told me.  I asked: How many bridges, even temporary ones, have been constructed in Puerto Rico to replace those destroyed by the hurricane to allow for the transportation of supplies and the evacuation of people?  They said: None, We have not erected any bridges. Again, because the Governor of Puerto Rico hasn't asked us to.  When I was there, I flew over the town of Maricao in the mountains, well known for coffee. There are six ways in and out of the town, and five of those bridges are gone.  Three weeks after D-day in 1944, the allies liberated the deepwater port of Cherbourg, one of the most important objectives in It took 20 days and we built bridges and communication lines along the way.  We made better progress in the 3 weeks after D-day than we are making on Puerto And in Puerto Rico, to the best of my knowledge, there are no Germans shooting at us.  Now, when I asked the officials about evacuating people from the island, they had no real answer. But if I remember correctly, FEMA and the military come to us to fund their budget every year. They are accountable to this  We are accountable to our constituents. Constituents are coming to me, as they did in Maarten, and are saying: Help us get our families out of danger's way.  Mr.Speaker, when will we be able to give these constituents an answer as to why their family members and loved ones aren't being allowed to leave the island and evacuated from danger?  This weekend, Members of Congress are going to Puerto I spoke with a few of them and said: Hey, at night, you should go to this place where it is really bad.  One stopped me, cut me off, and said: Congressman, we are not staying overnight.  So, on an island where 95 percent of the power is out, our Members of Congress are only going to see things during the day, not during the pitch-black darkness, which is what Puerto Ricans are living with every single night for the last 3 weeks.  Regardless of what my colleagues see during the day or what the President tweets in the morning, my friends stand in line for hours for food, if they can find it; my constituents are worried about their family members; and 5 million Puerto Ricans in the diaspora have run out of patience.

462,topic-id,1162,"Madam President, over the weekend, the Washington Post ran an article about a piece of legislation I helped negotiate last It was entitled the ``Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act'' and was intended to encourage greater collaboration between DEA and the regulated community in the fight against opioid abuse. The Post article was sharply critical of this legislation, suggesting that it effectively gutted DEA's ability to do its job. It also suggested the pharmaceutical industry put one over on I rise to set the record straight on these allegations and to provide a fuller account of how this legislation passed the Senate and became law.  First, some background. The Controlled Substances Act requires drug distributors to obtain a ``registration'' from DEA in order to distribute controlled substances, including prescription drugs. The act further authorizes DEA to suspend a distributor's registration in certain circumstances, such as where a distributor has been convicted of a crime involving controlled substances or had a State license suspended. Before suspending a registration, DEA must issue a show cause order directing the distributor to explain why its registration should not be suspended. A court then decides whether DEA has met its burden to suspend the registration.  The Controlled Substances Act empowers DEA to bypass this standard suspension process in cases where DEA determines there is ``an imminent danger to the public health or safety.'' In such cases, DEA can issue an immediate suspension order that immediately and without court process terminates the distributor's ability to distribute prescription drugs. Prior to last Congress, the Controlled Substances Act did not define what constitutes an imminent danger to the public health or safety. This left DEA's ability to immediately suspend a party's ability to distribute prescription drugs essentially unfettered. Such unfettered discretion concerned the patient advocacy and drug manufacturing community because an immediate suspension order cuts off all drugs from a distributor, including those intended for legitimate users. A balance is needed to ensure that individuals who need prescription drugs for treatment receive them but that such drugs are not diverted for improper purposes.  So the bill I helped negotiate last Congress, for the first time, defined what constitutes an imminent danger to the public health or safety. In doing so, it created a standard for when DEA may suspend a party's registration to distribute prescription drugs without any prior court process, and that standard is that there must be a ``substantial likelihood of an immediate threat'' that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur in the absence of an immediate suspension.  In both committee and floor statements, I made clear that this standard is intended to cover situations where evidence of diversion indicates there is a substantial likelihood that abuse of a controlled substance or of any controlled substances will occur.  The Washington Post article glosses over much of this background. It does not explain that the immediate suspension order is intended to be an extraordinary measure. It does not explain that prior to the bill, DEA had basically carte blanche authority to impose this measure. It does not explain the DEA has other enforcement tools available, including show cause orders which are supposed to be the agency's standard operating procedure. Equally problematic, the article barely even mentions the patient advocacy concerns that motivated the bill to begin with.  I want to quote from a letter that a coalition of patient and health advocacy groups sent to Congress in support of the legislation:       Federal agencies, law enforcement, pharmaceutical industry      participants and prescribers each play a role in working      diligently to prevent drug abuse and diversion. However, it      is also imperative that legitimate patients are able to      obtain their prescriptions without disruption. Your      legislation addresses both goals by fostering greater      collaboration, communication and transparency between      industry stakeholders and regulators, leading to more      effective efforts to combat abuse while protecting patients.

We      appreciate your leadership and commitment to combating the      inappropriate use of prescription medicines. Your legislation      will help improve the balance between effective enforcement      against prescription drug diversion and abuse, while ensuring      patients who are appropriately prescribed medications      continue to have access to their treatments.       As patient advocacy and health professional organizations,      we are committed to combating illegal use of prescription      drugs. Millions of Americans depend on prescription drugs to      treat and cure illness, alleviate pain, and improve quality      of life, yet prescription drug abuse remains a persistent      problem that requires collaboration from all those with a      stake in improving patient care and protecting against abuse.      In considering the burden on patients, it is important to      remember that the vast majority of patients who use      prescription drugs do so legitimately to address a variety of      health issues. Efforts to prevent drug abuse should also      consider legitimate users so that actions do not impede      patient access or lessen the effectiveness of patient care.       Federal agencies, law enforcement, pharmaceutical industry      participants and prescribers each play a role in working      diligently to prevent drug abuse and diversion.

463,topic-id,1171,"Madam President, the Washington Post article discusses virtually none of this. Rather, it baldly asserts that Congress cut out DEA's legs from underneath it through a sinister conspiracy of deep-pocketed drug companies and their cunning allies in Nothing could be further from the truth.[[Page S6388]]  To begin with, I have spent 40 years of my life in the Senate fighting the scourge of drug abuse. I stood side by side with Ronald Reagan in the War on In 2000, I coauthored the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, or DATA 2000, one of the first efforts in Congress to address the opioid epidemic. Last year, I led conference negotiations on the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, a landmark piece of legislation that is making a real difference in the fight against opioid and heroin abuse. Currently, I am working on legislation to address opioid addiction in the veteran community. I am no patsy when it comes to drug abuse--prescription or otherwise--and neither are my colleagues.  Indeed, forget me for a moment. Let's take Senator Whitehouse, who helped me negotiate the bill with DEA and Are we to believe that Senator Whitehouse, a former Rhode Island attorney general and a former U.attorney, a crusader against corporate interests, is somehow in the pocket of the drug companies? Of course not. The charge is laughable on its face.  How about the fact that this bill passed both Houses of Congress by unanimous consent? Did the entire U.Congress decide to shield its eyes to the true sinister intent of this legislation? Did the Senate Judiciary Committee, which approved the bill by voice vote, decide to look the other way? This is a committee that includes former prosecutors, state attorneys general, and U.attorneys who, at the time, included both the current Attorney General of the United States and the current Senate minority leader.  Are we seriously to believe that Jeff Sessions, the toughest foe of illegal drugs I have ever known in my entire life, sat on his hands while Congress eviscerated the DEA's enforcement authority? No, of course not.  To merely state these allegations is to make clear how utterly ridiculous they really are. Not one Senator or Member of the House opposed this bill. Do you know why? Because DEA, the very agency the bill impacts, the very agency that supposedly can no longer do its job because of this legislation, agreed to let it go forward.  Let me be clear. The DEA could have stopped this bill. They could have stopped it at any time. In fact, they did stop a previous version in 2014 that had different language. I spent months negotiating with DEA and with DOJ until they were at a point they were comfortable allowing the bill to proceed. If they had asked me to hold the bill or to continue negotiations, I would have done so.  I brought the bill to markup only after DEA and DOJ agreed with me on a path forward. Anyone who claims that I or anyone else steamrolled DEA and DOJ on this bill is either ignorant or woefully misinformed.  That brings me to another point that was largely lost in all the insinuations in the Washington Post article. The language that purportedly eviscerated DEA's enforcement power--that is, the requirement that the DEA show a substantial likelihood of immediate threat before issuing an immediate suspension order--was written by DEA and DOJ lawyers and provided to Hill staff as a proposed compromise.  So let's get this straight. Congress took language that DEA and DOJ wrote, inserted it into the bill, and now Congress is the bad guy? I should note that other aspects of DEA and DOJ's proposed language changed, but that key phrase ``substantial likelihood of an immediate threat''--the phrase that critics now point to as gutting DEA's enforcement authority--came from DEA and And lest we forget, President Obama signed the bill into law on the advice of his own DEA  I think we need to be candid about what is going on here. Opponents of the current administration are trying to derail the President's nominee to be head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Representative Tom Marino, by mischaracterizing and trying to rewrite the history of a bill that he championed. They are being aided in their efforts by a group of former DEA employees who took an extremely hard line against drug companies when they were at the Agency and who are upset that the DEA chose to pursue a more collaborative approach after they left. I don't fault these individuals for their passion, but I do reject the notion that there was some sort of sinister conspiracy at play. And I find it unconscionable that critics of the bill and of Representative Marino would flat-out ignore the very real patient concerns that motivated this bill and motivated my personal involvement with it. You think this bill was a sop to the drug industry? Tell that to the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Tell that to the American Academy of Pain Tell that to the Drug Free America  If we are going to make this bill a political football and try to use it to sink Representative Marino's nomination, let's tell the full story. Let's be fair. Let's at least be honest. Let's not gin up a one-sided narrative based entirely on the statements of former Agency officials who disagreed with the change of leadership.

Rather, let's be clear that Members of this body negotiated this bill in good faith with the DEA and the Department of Let's be clear--the DEA and DOJ themselves generated the language that critics now claim is so problematic. Let's remember that this bill passed by unanimous consent and that every single Member of this body and the House of Representatives agreed to it. Let's remember, too, that the DEA and DOJ could have stopped this bill at any time if they had wanted to but instead chose to allow it to proceed. After all, they stopped an earlier version in 2014 that had different language. They could have stopped it again. And even after the bill passed Congress, they could have advised President Obama not to sign on. Don't forget that the bill bears his signature. Let's not pretend that DEA, both Houses of Congress, and the Obama White House all somehow wilted under Representative Marino's nefarious influences.  Provocative headlines and clever framing may drive page hits, but this body's decisions should be based on the full story. It should be based on all the facts. A single news article that tells only one side of the story should not derail a nominee who has a long history of fighting illegal drug use and of helping individuals with chronic conditions obtain treatment.

667,topic-id,813,"Mr.President, I rise to speak in support of my amendment 1144. This legislation is designed to do two things. It is important for us to consider this. First, it would protect Medicaid for our Nation's most vulnerable citizens, namely, low-income children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with disabilities. Those are important vulnerable citizens, as far as I am concerned. In addition, it would strengthen Medicare in order to help protect health benefits for current and future beneficiaries. Make no mistake. Our Nation faces a growing entitlement crisis, and Medicare and Medicaid are at the heart of it.  Under ObamaCare, Medicaid enrollment has increased by about 28 percent due to the expansion of the program in 32  Between 2014 and 2015 alone, expansion States received about $79 billion in Federal funds. The problem is that even before ObamaCare, Medicaid was plagued by quality issues, and States' hands were tied whenever they tried to advance innovative solutions to improve patient care.  Of course, even before ObamaCare, Medicaid spending on both the Federal and State levels was growing at an astronomical rate. Contrary to popular myth, ObamaCare did not fix this. It made things worse.  As chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over Medicaid, I have been working with a number of my Republican colleagues as well as State officials, stakeholders, and the American public to find solutions that will improve the quality and ensure the longevity of the Medicaid That work will continue into the future.  Medicare is a separate problem entirely. Everyone knows that when it comes to Medicare, we are on a collision course with fiscal economic catastrophe facing us.  Over the long term, Medicaid faces more than $33 trillion--that is with a ``t''--in unfunded liabilities according to the independent actuaries at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  In the nearer term, the Medicare trustees project that Medicare Part A, which deals with inpatient hospital payments, will be officially bankrupt in 2029, resulting in steep benefit cuts for seniors relying on the program.  Even a number of prominent Democrats who recently served as Medicare trustees have recommended swift legislative action to ``minimize the impact on beneficiaries, providers, and taxpayers.''  To put it simply, we need to address the fiscal challenges facing these programs if we are going to preserve them for future generations.  Despite the claims of a number of my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we can't even make a dent in these problems by focusing solely on the tax side of the equation.  I know many like to claim that every wrong would be righted and every problem would be solved if we simply raised taxes on rich people. Anyone who has spent more than 5 minutes looking at the fiscal condition of our Federal health programs will tell you that is preposterous. The money just simply isn't there. The Republican budget acknowledges this reality.  My colleagues have argued that the budget would cut Medicare spending, but that isn't true. In fact, under the budget, Medicare spending would increase every year, though at a slightly slower rate, in order to introduce some level of fiscal sanity into the process.  All told, the budget would slow Medicare's rate of growth by about 1 percent compared to the CBO baseline.  Furthermore, the budget resolution does not propose any specific programmatic changes to either Medicare or Medicaid, even though my friends on the other side of the aisle like to argue otherwise.  Let me be clear on another point. Despite a number of claims to the contrary, the budget resolution does not rely on savings from Medicaid in order to provide tax relief.  My colleagues, the ranking member of the Budget Committee and the senior Senator from Florida, have proposed amendments to dramatically increase taxes to the tune of about $1 trillion for Medicaid and half a trillion dollars for Medicare over the next decade in order to double and triple down on this particular set of problems, the failed policies that have made these programs unsustainable in the first place.  These are not serious proposals. They are poison pills designed only to give the other side a round of partisan talking points that are really ridiculous.  A vote for my amendment is a vote for a stronger, more fiscally sound[[Page S6522]]safety net that preserves Medicaid for our most vulnerable citizens, keeps our promises to Medicare's current beneficiaries, and strengthens the program for those who will need it in the future.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment. It is a good amendment. It is the right thing to do. It makes us better prepared for the future. It seems to me that every one of us would be proud to vote for it and to solve these problems that the amendment will solve.  I yield the floor.

800,topic-id,1039,"Mr.President, this week, the Senate will vote on a budget resolution for fiscal year 2018. While there are many elements to this particular resolution, most of this Chamber's and the public's attention are on the reconciliation instructions related to tax reform.  Before I go too far, I first want to thank Chairman Enzi and all of our colleagues on the Budget Committee for their work on this resolution. Chairman Enzi has been a critical player in the ongoing effort to reform our broken Tax Code, and his work to craft this budget resolution and move it out of committee has been critical to this effort.  For the next step, he is going to need help passing the resolution here on the floor. I think we will get there.  Specifically, this budget resolution contains a $1.5 trillion reconciliation instruction for tax reform. That is a good number, putting meaningful tax reform within reach.  As the debate over the budget and the instruction moves forward, I think it is critical that everyone understand what tax reform will do for our country and, perhaps more importantly, what will happen if we fail.  Tax reform has been the chief focus of the Senate Finance Committee for years now. In the 6\1/2\ years that I have been the lead Republican on the committee, we have had about 70 hearings focused on the Tax In the vast majority of those hearings, we have heard both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge the inefficiency of our current tax system, with very few members having spent their time and energy defending the status quo, which is not at all surprising.  Our current tax system imposes undue burdens on middle-class families. Our current tax system is obscenely complex, riddled with credits, exemptions, and deductions, many of which were designed to benefit special interests. Our current tax system's complicated rate structure makes it difficult for families to plan and, for some workers, creates a disincentive to work for additional earnings. Our current tax system subjects American businesses and job creators to the highest tax rates in the industrialized world. Our current tax system creates incentives for businesses to move headquarters and operations offshore, eroding our Nation's tax base. And our current system has forced companies to keep trillions of dollars offshore, preventing further investment and growth here at home.  Reform of this broken system is long overdue. The last major overhaul to our Tax Code was more than three decades ago. Even if the Tax Code hadn't changed dramatically since that time,[[Page S6430]]the economy of 1986 was dramatically different from the one we have today. Of course, the code has undergone a number of piecemeal changes since the 1986 reform, but that approach has left us with a system that simply does not work.  Fundamental change is what our tax system needs--change that takes the entire system into account and change that will create a tax code that, at the very least, looks as though it was designed on purpose. That is what we aim to provide once the Senate and the House have passed a consensus budget resolution.  On the Finance Committee, we are working to craft legislation pursuant to the guideposts in the unified framework released last month. Our bill, based on the uniform tax reform framework, will give much needed relief to millions of low- to middle-income families. It will level the playing field for Americans and for American job creators and promote more investment in the United  In the end, all of this will mean bigger paychecks for American workers, a more vibrant U.economy, and more American jobs. But without this budget resolution, we are unlikely to get there.  Don't get me wrong, I would like to produce a tax reform product that could get 60 votes. I have spent years asking my Democratic colleagues to meaningfully engage in this effort. To be sure, there have been Democrats who have been willing to put themselves out there on tax reform in recent years, including the former Finance Committee chairman, Max Baucus, and our current ranking member, Senator But they have generally been the exception.  When President Obama was in office, many Democrats typically talked about tax reform only in the context of raising revenues to fuel additional spending, which isn't tax reform at all. It is simply raising taxes.  Under President Trump, the focus, at least among many in the Democratic leadership, seems to be about preventing passage of anything that could be viewed as a win for the President and Republicans in Perhaps I am wrong about that--and I hope I am--but when we are talking about tax reform these days, most of the talk from my friends on the other side of the aisle has been about unreasonable and unprecedented process demands.  That is unfortunate. There are a number of areas of tax reform where Democrats and Republicans are largely in agreement. Those areas include middle-class tax relief, bringing down the corporate rates, and fixing our international tax system to make American companies more competitive.  Given these shared concerns, I am still hopeful that some of our Democratic colleagues will join us in this effort. I remain willing to work with any Member of the Senate who wants to engage in this effort in good faith.  Historically speaking, tax bills that pass through the budget reconciliation process tend to have support from both parties. In fact, when Republicans have held the White House and Congress, purely partisan tax reconciliation bills have not been enacted. That being the case, I think the unified framework envisions a tax reform approach that both parties can and should support.  Long story short, I haven't given up on producing a bipartisan tax reform package. But, once again, we need to pass this budget resolution if we are going to move the ball forward. That being the case, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution before us this week and to work with us as we develop tax reform legislation that will help middle-class families and job creators throughout the country.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

810,topic-id,2164,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose this deeply flawed budget that is terrible for America and particularly harmful to working families.  The Republican plan that we face today is a budget-busting first step toward issuing massive tax breaks to special interests and to wealthy individuals. This proposed budget fails to improve economic growth or to drive up wages. It should look awfully familiar to all of us because it is a retread of the failed trickle-down economics which exploded budget deficits in the 1980s and squandered the budget surplus we had briefly in the early 2000s. That trickle-down theory ruined our budget and failed to grow the economy then, and we cannot afford to relive those failed policies now.  Our Nation faces significant economic challenges today that need to be addressed directly. Wages have barely improved in the past 20 years; the costs of education, childcare, and other essential living expenses continue to climb.  Job creation is slowing. From February through September of this year, the economy added the lowest number of jobs in 7 years. Wages are also falling this year. Since the Trump administration took over, 39 States and the District of Columbia have seen workers' wages decline, after adjusting for inflation. Nearly 4 in 10 rural families don't have access to high-speed internet and the opportunities it affords.  We all know many of the communities we represent, in both rural and urban areas, still have not fully recovered from the great recession. Yet this budget only makes life harder for working families by cutting vital programs and critical services that invest directly in those communities. The Republican budget ignores our current reality and makes it tougher for American families to afford a college education or access quality healthcare coverage. As we saw through last week's executive actions, the Trump administration remains singularly focused on taking away healthcare from 20 million Americans and sabotaging the system for those left. This proposed budget would take us deeper down that destructive path.  The Republican 2018 budget cuts more than $5 trillion over the next decade in healthcare, education, transportation, medical research, and other critical investments. It slashes Medicaid by $1 trillion and Medicare by more than $470 billion. When they are done, these budget-busting tax giveaways will leave other Federal efforts with a gaping $660 billion hole, bringing our domestic Federal investments as a share of our Nation's GDP to the lowest levels since the Hoover administration.  If you are at home listening, all of that sounds pretty unbelievable. Washington Republicans wouldn't really jeopardize our Nation's healthcare, our educational system, our rural communities, and bust the budget all at the same time, right? Unfortunately, all of that is true when we look at the details of this failing budget. Again, this is all based on a brazen theory that led to the failed and harmful tax policies of the past.  The real question we should be asking now is, How do we improve our communities, grow our economy, and drive up wages for hard-working families? That is what I am focused on when I look at the budget.  Republicans believe step one should be to take funds out of Medicare, out of education, out of infrastructure, and pull healthcare away from the working poor. Then step two of their plan is to give all that money to wealthy political interests under the ruse that regular people, someday, will be better off because America's elite investing class will have done something spectacular with the money we just sucked out of our communities.  It is truly amazing that this idea continues to resurface because the promise of wild economic growth and trickle-down benefits has failed to materialize time and time again. What we have found is, working families, rural communities, and others who are robbed to finance this type of plan are the ones who suffer, all to put money into other people's pockets.  Who exactly loses in this budget? For starters, senior citizens, who will see Medicare cut $470 billion, to be exact. Let me say that again. This Republican budget cuts Medicare to the tune of nearly half a trillion dollars.  Children, working families, and people in need of opioid treatment will be pounded by Medicaid cuts of more than $1 trillion. Medicaid cuts will lead to millions losing their coverage. They will unravel the progress we have made fighting the opioid epidemic, jeopardize mental health coverage, and force many rural hospitals to close.  The hit will be especially hard in rural areas, where more than 12 percent of rural hospital revenue comes from In New Mexico, Medicaid actually accounts for more than 20 percent of hospital revenue in rural areas.  For seniors, the Medicare and Medicaid cuts together will have devastating consequences. Let's look at one example, Alzheimer's disease. Medicare and Medicaid together pay for nearly 70 percent of care for those 65 and older with Alzheimer's. These deep cuts will force families to make a terrible choice between working and caring for their family members. Already, 15 percent of caregivers to someone with Alzheimer's have left their jobs or retired early in the past year due to their caregiving responsibilities. Cutting Medicare and Medicaid, when Alzheimer's costs are getting higher and no cure is in sight, will saddle individuals and their families with massive costs and hardship.  The devastation this budget will create does not stop there. More than 8 million students will see their Pell grants cut by one-third. That is right. Republicans want to cut investments in education so they can give special interests a tax break. These are Americans who are striving for a college degree, who just want a fair shot at opportunity without being crushed by debt. Pell grants are the primary form of financial aid for so many students, giving them access to an education that might otherwise be out of reach.  This chart pretty much sums up what I have been saying about the priorities reflected in this budget: tax cuts over investments in things like Medicare, Medicaid, education. The picture is pretty clear. They are taking direct investments away from our people and our communities and instead giving those dollars away as part of a convoluted plan that leaves the wealthy better off.  What is more amazing about this plan is that Republicans have changed budget rules to allow them to add $1.5 trillion to the debt while doing it. For many years, the Conrad rule in the Senate specifically prohibited reconciliation legislation from increasing the deficit in the first 10 years. It was what reconciliation bills were designed to do--reduce the deficit. Then, Republicans repealed that rule in 2015 and[[Page S6435]]threw any illusion of fiscal responsibility out the window.  Remember when Republicans believed in fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets? Under President Trump, Republicans barely give these values lip service--and this year's budget goes even further than before to reject fiscal reason. It removes a Senate requirement for the CBO--the Congressional Budget Office--to issue a cost estimate a day ahead of votes on the Senate floor, the so-called 28-hour rule. Why? Because they want to hide how fiscally irresponsible these votes are from their constituents and the American people.  Finally, the Republican budget assumes far faster growth than the CBO could possibly justify under even the rosiest assumptions. This backward math says that their budget magically delivers $1.24 trillion in deficit reduction. According to the Tax Policy Center, the Republican tax plan will reduce revenues by $2.4 trillion over the first 10 years and another $3.2 trillion over the next 10 years. The actual cost far exceeds the Republican estimates.  Where do all the tax cuts go? Most of them go to wealthy folks who are doing just fine without them. We don't need to be doling out tax breaks to wealthy trust-funders when families in Las Cruces, Gallup, and Santa Rosa are struggling to make ends meet, don't have high-speed internet, and haven't gotten a raise in years, in some cases.  Under this Republican plan, the top 0.1 percent will receive a tax cut of more than $700,000 a year. It would take a typical household in my State nearly 15 years--15 years of work and earning--just to match the giveaway being provided to a single wealthy investor under this budget. That is not just wrong, it is downright sickening.  Part of this massive benefit to the rich comes from the creation of a special rate for passthrough income of 25 percent. This plan is designed to help large law firms and hedge funds that, in my mind, don't need a special tax break to further enrich themselves. Millions of working families will actually face higher taxes as a result. Under the Republican tax plan, nearly 8 million working households will actually see an average tax hike of $794. Now, $800 may not seem like a lot if you are working on Wall Street, but $800 is a lot for people working hard on relatively modest incomes in New  Unfortunately, as I said earlier, we have seen this movie before. We don't need another bad sequel.  This Republican plan delivers higher deficits and fewer community investments. Tax cuts in 1981 and the early 2000s led to less revenue as a share of GDP and higher deficits. The national debt nearly tripled under President Reagan and nearly doubled under President George  We have also seen the dangers of reckless tax cuts for the wealthy at the State level. In Kansas, Republicans slashed individual rates by more than 20 percent and abolished taxes on passthrough income. Sound familiar? Since the tax cuts were enacted in 2012, the State's revenue plummeted, and Kansas has buckled under an economy that has trailed the United States in job, wage, and economic growth.  A recent study found that for tax cuts to pay for themselves, the economy would have to grow $5 to $6 for every single dollar of cuts. Yet the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found that tax cuts generate nowhere near that amount. According to them, each dollar of tax cuts would lead to only 4 cents to, at best, $1.25 in new economic activity.  The evidence is clear. Large tax cuts for special interests and for the rich simply don't pay for themselves. As we have seen, time and time again, trickle down only works in fake, so-called think tank models, not in real life.  Rather than rely on disproven theories, we should be investing in what we know actually works in increasing wages and accelerating economic growth. Expanding the earned-income tax credit, for example, has proven to be effective at increasing the living standards of working families. It effectively raises their wages. Let's strengthen and make fully refundable the child tax credit.  Instead of slashing infrastructure spending, as this budget does, we should be investing to prepare our Nation to compete. Investing in infrastructure is proven to create good-paying jobs and stimulate our overall economy. President Trump talked about infrastructure investment incessantly on the campaign trail. Where is that rhetoric today? Where is that commitment today? Sending kids to high-quality pre-K is shown to improve both theirs and, for that matter, their parents' economic outcomes.  We need to invest in clean energy because it is cheaper, because it is good for the economy, and because all of our future livelihoods depend on addressing climate change. The renewable energy sector is a place where jobs are growing rapidly in New Mexico--and not just in urban metro areas but especially in rural communities.  We need to invest in Federal research and development that has led to the internet, to the GPS, to the laser, and to lifesaving medical breakthroughs. We must ensure that startups can access the capital they need to launch and grow their businesses, whether they are in rural New Mexico or downtown We need to close the digital divide so that every person in America, regardless of ZIP Code, has access to high-speed internet that connects people and communities to financial and educational opportunities.  Democrats have a plan to grow the economy, to increase wages, and to improve the lives of folks who work on Main Streets across this country. Our plan connects people with the opportunities that will exist tomorrow.  The Republican plan is very different. It is written by the lobbyists on K Street, with much of the benefit flowing to the investment bankers on Wall Regrettably, Republicans are pursuing the same partisan process with the budget and with tax reform that failed when they tried to repeal the Affordable Care  The cost of Republican chaos and backward thinking is growing by the day, and this budget will continue that process. We need bipartisan, pragmatic solutions to the challenges that our country faces.  To all of my colleagues, we are asking simply to do what we know works. Let's work across the aisle through regular order to get things done for our constituents.  Mr.President, I yield back.

This week we are setting in motion one of my top legislative priorities in the Senate; that is, to bring tax relief to American families.  For decades, Nevadans have been waiting for an affordable and fair tax code that they can understand, and I have long said that the Tax Code is too costly and too complex. We need to simplify our code in a way that creates jobs and allows Nevadans to keep more of their hard-earned tax dollars. With this budget, we are taking an enormous first step in providing meaningful relief to Nevadans and middle-class families across the  Under our leadership and thanks to the work of the chairman of the Budget Committee, we are finally in a place where we can provide real, meaningful tax relief for all of As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have been working with my colleagues to craft a tax bill that accomplishes three major goals. The first is to create more jobs; 2 is to increase wages; and, finally, 3 is to boost American competitiveness.  So the question is, What does tax reform mean to an average Nevadan who works hard and is trying to provide a better life for themselves and for their children? It means you can keep more of your hard-earned paycheck, and it will be easier for you to file your taxes, less paperwork, more money. Lower rates for businesses mean more jobs, they mean higher wages, and they mean growth in our communities, all of which will benefit you.  As the son of a school cook and an auto mechanic, I understand discipline and hard work--all of it--that goes into every dollar and every paycheck, and I am working to see that we have more of it in your back pocket. That is why my amendment is absolutely critical, because it delivers this desperately needed relief and lets the middle-class families keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, helping them make ends meet and invest in their families.  For too long, American families have been struggling with stagnant wages and incomes, as well as slow economic growth made worse by the policies of the Obama administration. In inflation-adjusted terms, nationwide median household incomes stayed below what it was in 2007 all the way up to 2015. Last year, it was only $890 more than it was in 2007. In my home State of Nevada, the situation is even worse. Median household income still hasn't fully recovered and is $7,000 lower today than it was in 2007.  Tax relief for families with children, through an enhanced child tax credit, for example, will help begin to address the financial insecurities facing American families and will help families confront the rising cost of raising children. Expansion of the child tax credit will help hard-working, middle-class families in many ways, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned income to use for the needs of their families and for their children.  I urge everyone in this Chamber to support children, I urge them to support middle-class families, and I urge them to support my amendment.  I yield the floor.

701,topic-id,1487,"Mr.President, I rise today still in shock, still in mourning over the events of October 1, when 58 people--some of them Nevadans, many of them visitors to our State--were brutally gunned down by a madman on the Las Vegas  In addition to those horrible deaths, almost 500 people were injured. Many of them face long roads to physical recovery and an even longer and more painful road to emotional recovery. I know I speak for all of my Senate colleagues in praying for them and wishing them the quickest recovery possible.  This madman's actions devastated our city, but I rise today to tell you that the sense of devastation is being replaced by a renewed sense of community, a renewed sense of family, of unity, of faith, and a renewed sense of strength. I have had the honor of experiencing it firsthand in the eyes and the voices of those who survived and those who chose to stay in harm's way to help each other when they could have fled to safety. I have heard and seen this renewed sense of community and strength in the faces of our first responders, none of whom have ever encountered anything as horrific as the carnage of October 1 but who plunged into danger to save lives. Because? Because that is what they do.  I had the privilege of meeting a Las Vegas police officer, Sergeant Jonathan Riddle, who was stationed a block from the shooting scene doing traffic work. When he first heard the popping noises, like most of the concertgoers, he thought it was fireworks, but the second volley told him otherwise, and his training kicked in. He grabbed his rifle and he sprinted toward the chaos. Keep in mind, this police officer knew, through his training, that heavy-caliber bullets were being fired and that his protective vest would not stop them. He also knew his rifle was useless because the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, and he couldn't shoot at the hotel for fear of hitting an innocent bystander. So he was, for all intents and purposes, defenseless. He knew it, but he ran anyway. He ran toward the violence. He ran toward it with one purpose, to help in any way he could.  It is almost not fair to single him out because dozens of metro police officers did the same thing, and firefighters, paramedics, and ambulance drivers[[Page S6527]]also. It was not just professional first responders who emerged as true heroes on October 1. Taylor Winston, a marine, was just trying to enjoy the concert that night, but when the bullets started raining down, he was driven by his training, his instincts, his compassion for his fellow human beings. He helped several people over a fence where they took cover, but he realized the danger wasn't over. Looking around, he spotted a pickup truck with a long bed. He borrowed the truck. I use the term ``borrowed'' loosely. He loaded the back of it with injured people and rushed them to the hospital, but he wasn't done. He made a return trip, loaded the pickup again with wounded individuals and got them to the hospital.  Jack Beaton's last act on Earth was one of sacrifice and heroism. He draped himself over his wife, protecting her from the deadly bullets. He told her he loved her, then was hit and died in her arms.  Jonathan Smith shouted warnings when he realized what was happening, but when some people were too stunned to move toward safety, Jonathan moved toward them, getting them out of the line of fire. That is when Jonathan himself was hit. He survived but will likely always have a bullet lodged in his neck. It is a painful reminder of his heroics, but I hope it will also remind him of the people he saved.  John, a cab driver, accelerated toward the screams and the chaos and shouted for a frightened group of girls to jump into his cab, and he drove them to safety. Then John turned around and drove back to the shooting scene and transported another group to safety. In all, John possibly saved 11 lives.  There was a woman at the concert, a respiratory therapist, who had her cell phone shattered by a bullet while the cell phone was still in her hand. Shards of hard plastic tore through her hand and embedded in her skin. What did she do? She pulled the shards out of her hand, bandaged herself up, and rushed to the hospital where she worked to try to help other people more badly injured.  At our local hospitals, doctors and nurses worked miracles around the clock. When operating rooms were not available, they treated the wounded in hallways. Surrounded by shouting, crying, chaos, and blood, they saved one life after another after another. Their skill, their composure, their dedication to saving lives was stronger that night than the evil intentions of the madman with a rifle.  I was walking the hallway of one of our hospitals with the hospital's CEO when a woman rushed toward him, grabbed him by the arm, and through tears and sobs, thanked him for the work his staff had done. Her niece had been wounded, but she was heading home. She said she could never thank the hospital staff enough.  In the aftermath, the community banded together to provide every resource possible to the victims and their families. The Las Vegas Convention Center's South Hall was dedicated to family reunification and support services. Airlines answered the call to provide free flights to the families of victims. Hotels and casinos across Las Vegas offered free rooms. The American Red Cross partnered with the Mirage to host a blood drive. Millions of dollars have been raised by local businesses and people across the country to support the victims.  The employees of Mandalay Bay and other MGM resort properties were understandably stricken and horrified by the shooting, but they too asked how they could help. Instead of being frozen by their shock and grief, they mobilized--donating blood, offering help to the families of the victims, organizing memorials, and otherwise coming together as a team, motivated by compassion and selflessness and providing comfort and solace.  True leaders have emerged in the wake of this tragedy. My friend Sheriff Joe Lombardo, head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, has been steadfast in this crisis. He will always be remembered as a rock-solid presence when our city most needed one.  Let me say this for the world to hear. Our great city will not cower in fear because of this horrible act. We will mourn, we will heal, we will comfort each other, and we will pray, but make no mistake about it, Las Vegas is open for business. Las Vegas will not simply go on, but we will thrive. So come to Las Vegas, and maybe come away with a greater appreciation of what our city, our people are all about. From the blood and the horror, the terror, the carnage of October 1, Las Vegas has risen.  We have never shied away from our image as a city of entertainment. Our hospitality defines us, but the world has now seen a side much more profound--something we have always seen--and that is a home, a family, a community of people who will stand by each other during the darkest moments, a community of people bound by faith who will stand in the face of danger to protect a neighbor, a friend, a family member, or someone they have never met.  Everyone around the world has heard of Las The very name conjures images almost immediately. Its skyline cannot be mistaken for any other. Yet prior to October 1, almost no one knew the true Las Vegas, the Las Vegas we are seeing now, a city that responds to cowardly violence with love and compassion for each other, a city that responds to hatred with faith and strength. ``Las Vegas Strong'' is a slogan we are now seeing on billboards, marquees, and T-shirts, but behind that slogan is a true story of true strength. It is a story of a city growing, emerging, and becoming closer and more united.  A deranged man with a rifle brought death and carnage and terror to Las Vegas, but today Las Vegas stands stronger. Las Vegas stands unafraid. Las Vegas's true identity has been revealed, and it is one of compassion and one of heroism. It is my hope that we will honor the memory of those lost by holding on to the sense of unity and family that has emerged since October 1 and that we will, all of us, continue to be Las Vegas  May God bless the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and may God bless the United States of  I yield back.

661,topic-id,1791,"Mr.President, I am pleased to follow the distinguished Senator from South Carolina and appreciate very much his remarks and how he does such a good job of really explaining why this tax relief is so very important.  I rise today to talk about the need for tax relief and how our Tax Code is now both outdated, very complex, and again, as my esteemed colleague from South Carolina said, it is past time to provide tax relief for our Nation's families, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. That is what passing this legislation is all about--providing much needed tax relief for our hard-working citizens. As I said, it is past time to modernize our outdated American Tax Code and bring it into the 21st century. We need to do so to ensure that American businesses can compete on the global stage; it is a global economy, and we must compete. And it is very much focused on our efforts to bring tax relief to middle-class families, who have been struggling to get ahead and stay ahead over the last decade.  As I said, the Senate this week is taking the first step--a very important step--toward enacting pro-growth tax reform by passing a budget resolution that provides the path toward improving our economic growth and putting more money back into the pockets of hard-working American people. Voting for this budget will enable us to move forward to enact that tax relief, again, not only for our families, but for farmers, ranchers, and small businesses across this country. Small business is the absolute backbone of our economy, and that is where the vast majority of jobs are created.  It is very important to understand and realize that this is not just about tax relief--making sure that, after taxes, hard-working Americans keep more of their money in their pocket, again, as so eloquently detailed by the Senator from South Carolina--but it is also about growing our economy. This is also pro-growth. This is about stimulating economic growth, meaning more jobs and, as the businesses that create those jobs invest the capital, create those jobs as they compete for labor, that also moves wages and income higher. So think about it. For that hard-working American, it is not only about reducing his or her tax burden, it is about increasing their wages and income. That is the rising tide that lifts all boats, so it is both. It is both about improving wages and income, as well as reducing the tax burden.  The recently released tax blueprint proposes sweeping tax reform, tax relief that will benefit working families and small businesses across the country while promoting job creation, economic growth, and global competitiveness.  This country was built on hard work by individuals and families who strive each and every day to make ends meet, provide for their loved ones, and plan for retirement, but this past decade has seen too many families struggling to get by. The current Tax Code is complex; it is riddled with loopholes. That not only does nothing to help our hard-working families keep more of their money, it makes it very difficult to even fill out their tax returns.  Tax relief will help individuals and families in my State of North Dakota[[Page S6517]]and across the country to get ahead by generating new jobs through economic growth, as I said, while also lowering their overall tax burden so that they keep more of their paycheck. For example, by doubling the standard deduction, we will eliminate taxes on the first $12,000 earned by an individual and $24,000 earned by a married couple, effectively establishing a 0-percent tax rate up to $24,000. This means that the nearly 81 percent of North Dakotans who claim the standard deduction--again, my State--will see a significant increase in their take-home pay, and that is true across the country.  Our tax framework aims to generate greater opportunities for small business owners and farmers, helping them to become more competitive. Remember, we all compete in a global economy now, so how do we help our farmers, our ranchers, our small businesses become more competitive?  Small business represents nearly 96 percent of all employers in my State, and while we have fostered a business-friendly environment in North Dakota, the Federal Tax Code continues to place undue burdens on our small businesses that operate across North Dakota and across the other 49 That includes our farmers and ranchers, who can pay a marginal tax rate as high as almost 45 percent, which is nearly twice the rate of the rest of the industrialized world.  The tax framework follows an example that we have set, and the tax framework that we have proposed will restore economic opportunity and, as I said, enact a pro-growth tax code for our country.  Last week, I hosted tax reform sessions and roundtables across North Dakota to hear directly from our small businesses and also from ag leaders, our farm leaders, on their priorities. I want to talk about some of those priorities in agriculture for just a minute. Agriculture is 1 in North We are a huge energy State, as well, but agriculture is and always will be 1 in our So when we talk about tax relief, we need to talk about tax relief for our farmers and our ranchers.  The right tax reform will help our farmers continue to provide the highest quality, lowest cost food supply in the world, which benefits every single American every single day. So that includes reducing the tax burden on these hard-working farmers and across the board for small businesses which, as I said, are the job creators in our economy, in our country. The biggest way we do that is to drop that rate for small business to 25 percent. That is a huge step forward. It not only makes our farms, ranches, and small businesses across the country more competitive, but it generates the economic growth that is so important for job creation and higher wages.  Another important issue is, in this framework, we eliminate the death tax or the estate tax. The death tax can result in double and sometimes triple taxation of income. For example, an individual's wages are taxed when they are earned, and interest, dividends, and capital gains from saved wages are taxed again. The death tax hits those earnings again when an individual dies.  The average farmer today is 60 years old. The average farmer is 60 years old, and we continually see fewer and fewer young people able to get into the business of farming. With a tax code that disincentivizes passing down the family farm to the next generation, how do we expect to feed our Nation and, in fact, the world, which is exactly what we do?  The estate tax also stifles economic growth and reduces our Nation's competitiveness. A study by the Joint Economic Committee in 2012 found that the death tax had destroyed $1.1 trillion in capital stock in the economy, and, of course, less capital investment means fewer jobs. Eliminating the death tax will encourage individuals to save, grow our economy, and, according to the Tax Foundation, will increase the capital investment reinvested back into our economy.  Additionally many of our producers, our farmers, and other small businesses do not have access to the equity they need to operate, so they rely heavily on debt financing to fund their businesses, and that is particularly true for new and beginning enterprises. Our Tax Code should incentivize our Nation's entrepreneurs to start their business or farm operation and allow them to grow and prosper. That is why it is a priority--certainly one of my priorities--that as we do tax reform, we maintain the ability of these businesses to deduct from their taxes the interest they pay on their debt in order to maintain a level playing field for small business.  Think about a family farmer out there. When family farmers need capital, it is very hard for them to go out and get equity. So they have to borrow that money in order to buy equipment and invest in their enterprises, and that is why the interest deduction for farmers is so very, very important. They don't have access to that equity capital; they have to borrow their money, which is a huge cost to their operation, and that is why the interest deduction for our farmers and for our ranchers is so very important.  Also, expensing is important for farmers and ranchers, and this is important for all small businesses. Being able to expense what they invest in their business makes a huge difference. Equipment, business supplies, and other capital expenditures can be very costly. For example, a new combine nowadays probably costs about one-half million dollars. For farmers to come up with one-half million dollars to buy a combine, which they obviously need, is hard to do unless they are able to expense that investment and deduct the interest on the debt that goes with it.  The tax framework we have proposed would allow businesses to immediately write off or expense the cost of new investment and business assets, effectively reinvesting in our Nation's businesses and helping to drive economic growth. It will allow businesses to increase investment and, again, increase job creation and wages. I would propose that we have full expensing for the first 5 years--that is great--but we should also on a long-term basis keep the section 179 expensing provision, which we have worked very hard to make permanent and which should be retained in this new Tax Code for the long-term, as we get beyond the first 5 years, as part of tax reform and tax relief that really works for our ag sector.  So these are some of the priorities we will be working on to include in our tax relief package to ensure that our farmers, our ranchers, and our ag industry continue to remain strong and really the leaders worldwide when it comes to, as I said, not only producing the highest quality but the lowest cost food supply in the world, which benefits every American every single day.  Tax reform is about getting the American economy going and growing, it is about creating jobs, and it is about creating jobs here at home, not overseas. It is about bringing that capital that is stranded overseas and repatriating it back to America and creating jobs in this country.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together. We need to pass this budget, and we need to pass tax reform for the hard-working people of North Dakota and for hard-working Americans across this great country.  I yield the floor.

364,topic-id,523,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I rise in support of this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, millions of our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are looking to Congress and the administration to work together to provide aid and assistance in recovery and rebuilding.  I disagree with the President of the United States that we are going to leave Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands or any other American precipitously before we have done the job we need to do.  The recent hurricanes have left 3.6 million Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands still without power, fuel, clean water, food, electricity, and access to medical facilities. That is unacceptable, I say to the administration.  We are witnessing a humanitarian disaster of historic proportions, and it will get worse if we do not come together as a nation and bring to bear the full force of the Federal Government to assist.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this bill to the floor to effect that end.  That is why I have called on President Trump to muster every Federal resource, to muster and ensure that aid and supplies can reach those who need them, and to work on restoring power, water, and communications. Because many are still out of reach, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and loss of life.  Today's Washington Post has a front page story chronicling the tragedy that continues as of now to unfold in Puerto Rico, where nightfall brings complete darkness, and diseases are spreading by way of contaminated water. The island has been plunged into the 19th century. The Virgin Islands shares that status.  This supplemental must be followed in the weeks and months ahead by additional measures to provide disaster relief funding and financial assistance to bring the infrastructure of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands up to 21st century standards in order to prevent a repeat of what has occurred.  According to a letter sent to the congressional leadership on October 7, by the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, the damage of that island is[[Page H7996]]estimated to cost as much as $95 billion, which is 150 percent of Puerto Rico's gross national product.  This funding package is an important step, though it fails to provide urgently needed Medicaid funding to help the 1.6 million in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare.  Congress must do its part and ensure that the resources are available, but it is up to the administration to make certain that the resources we provide get to those who need them.  So I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this bill, and I call on the President again to take every necessary measure to address this humanitarian crisis affecting our fellow  Mr.President, do not send a message to any American that we will turn our backs on them.

21,topic-id,457,"Mr.Speaker, no one has ever had a better partner on a piece of[[Page H7957]]legislation than I have had. The best way I can describe Mr.Connolly is, like anyone else who came to a realization of something, he came to it with a great deal of zeal. This partnership, which began before the passage in 2014, to modernize a 1996 initiative that had fallen short, has been his passion and mine.  Normally, when you are chairman, people talk about what divides the committee. But nothing united us more than recognizing that over $80 billion was being spent--and much of it needlessly. We don't achieve what we want to because there is never enough. Part of it is how we procure.  Prior to the passage of this legislation, it certainly was possible to have major pieces of procurement have somebody in charge who could not, in fact, change or drop the expenditure and who could not simply say: This isn't working. On top of that, often the people who did have the authority lacked the expertise. This has been true in all sorts of areas. There is much more work to be done.  Unlike Clinger-Cohen, which went on for 18 years before being updated, we were just 3 years past the implementation of this bill. With Congressman Connolly's effort, we are coming back and making real changes--ones that can continue the process and speed it up.  Obviously, there are some areas like the IT dashboard and others that simply need to be continued to be renewed. This bill does it.  When I first talked to Mr.Connolly, he was the best known for absolutely wanting to consolidate processing centers; consolidate these server farms that had proliferated. The number he had at the time turned out to be, although exorbitant, less than a quarter of the number we found. So there is more work to be done.  Procurement has to be done smart and is often consolidated. With the help of my colleague and Senator Warner, the passage of the DATA Act allowed us to find, with greater detail, redundancy of expenditure.  So as we reauthorize FITARA, we also have the information to consolidate purchasing across vast numbers of agencies, eliminate redundancy, and, in fact, buy better. More needs to be done.  As Mr.Connolly said so accurately, more money is spent on legacy systems than is spent on new systems that will actually save money and provide better services both to government workers and to the public.  So as we reauthorize the bill, I look forward to the oversight that the Oversight Committee has done and is able to do, and I look forward to continuing to work with my partner from Virginia, Mr. Mr.Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.

America's strength also comes from the power to use diplomacy.  In October 1945, President Harry Truman, my favorite President, changed the seal of the Office of the President to have the eagle face the olive branches of diplomacy instead of the arrows of war, signifying that America would also prefer that we use diplomacy first. In modern times, our judgments to go to war rather than use diplomacy have been flawed. Under this administration, diplomacy, in my view, is under assault, and that is why I rise today.  We see a decimated State in the USAID budget. We see bellicose rhetoric from the We see efforts to undermine, publicly, American diplomats engaged in negotiations. We see the refusal to even nominate key State Department diplomatic appointees.  As of last week, the administration has not put forward a nominee for approximately 52 percent of high-level positions at the State Department that require approval by the Thirty-two countries do not yet have Ambassadors in place, and that includes no nomination from the White House for Ambassadors to key countries like South Korea, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and No one has been nominated for Assistant Secretary for Arms Control, for Assistant Secretary for International Security and Nonproliferation, for Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs, or for East Asian and Pacific  How serious can the administration be about nuclear threats with no Ambassador to South Korea or no ambassadorial nomination for the key State Department official around nonproliferation? And the President has repeatedly undercut his Secretary of State's diplomatic efforts with North  President Trump's most recent action--his recent attack on diplomacy--is the decision to decertify the Iran deal, and I think this could be the most dangerous yet. By stepping back from a diplomatic deal that the United States made with the global community that is clearly working, the President is publicly undercutting diplomatic negotiations, and he is setting us on a road where military options become increasingly more likely. I will state it bluntly. If you weaken diplomacy, you raise the risk of unnecessary war, and that is what this President is doing.  First, President Trump's refusal to make the Iran certification and his threat to abandon the nuclear deal with Iran recalls the disastrous U.entrance into the Iraq war in 2003, where intelligence was politicized, and the administration repeatedly made false claims to justify going to war--a war of choice--to overthrow Saddam  The Bush administration insisted that regime change in Iraq was necessary, and it insisted on that because of the claim of Iraq's continuing productions of weapons of mass destruction.  In March of 2003, the IAEA came out and said there was no credible evidence that Iraq had a program of weapons of mass destruction and that there was no evidence they had revived the nuclear program they shelved in the 1990s, but the Bush administration would not accept that claim. It did not fit with the narrative they were selling to the American people about Saddam Hussein so they said the IAEA was wrong. They said we needed to initiate war--one that has proven so costly to Virginians and to Americans in treasure and in regional stability but especially in American lives--to prevent Iraq from obtaining weapons of mass destruction.  We went to war. It turned out the scientists and the technicians and the IAEA were right. Iraq didn't have a program of weapons of mass destruction. The politicians who tried to undermine the credibility of the international agencies were wrong. Of course, the consequences of that decision are significant. Ironically, you[[Page S6599]]could claim--I believe there is strong evidence--that decision in 2003 has today led to greater Iranian influence in Iraq and the region and a proliferation of extremist groups that didn't exist before.  We are now hearing the Trump administration make similar claims about Iran; that Iran will soon enough have a nuclear weapons program, that the IAEA cannot be trusted, that Iran supports al-Qaida, and from a Republican colleague: ``The policy of the United States should be regime change in Iran,'' and from Secretary of State Tillerson, we need a ``peaceful transition'' of the Iranian  We should stop to think, Is this really about the nuclear deal or is it about beginning a drumbeat from the administration to march the United States toward another preventable war in the Middle East?  Second, while threatening to unilaterally terminate the nuclear deal at any time, President Trump also wants to revisit the terms of the deal to address what he sees as its flaws.  This isn't new. Since the day the deal was announced, some critics have argued that we could get a better deal or push for an alternative. I wasn't then, nor am I now, interested in the world of hypotheticals. I am interested in the world of facts. The fact is, the deal is working, and it is dramatically better than the alternative for at least 15 years or possibly longer.  Additionally, if we want to renegotiate the deal, Iran will seek to do the same. If we take a step back from the deal, Iran will take a step back, and what will they ask for--that they get to now increase centrifuges or get some of their enriched uranium back? I don't want to give Iran one thing back from this deal, but if we step back from a deal that is working and say we want to renegotiate, they will, too, and I don't think we should tolerate that.  Most wars start because of miscalculations. The notion that we can renegotiate the deal just on our side and the other side wouldn't think of renegotiation is magical thinking. The U.entrance in World War I 100 years ago started with miscalculations--most nations do. A miscommunication, a misunderstanding, another step, another step, and you are at war. We should be very, very wary.  I and all of us are very willing to go after Iran on the nonnuclear front. It was just 2 months ago that we passed--I think unanimously; maybe there was one ``no'' vote in this body--a set of stiff sanctions against Iran, North Korea, and We have given the power to the President to impose more sanctions on Iran for bellicose behavior, for activities in other countries, for violations of human rights, and for violating U.Security Council resolutions on their missile program. The President should use the sanctions power we just gave him to go after Iran's activities that violate international norms and make America less safe. But when the IAEA, our allies, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of State all say that with respect to the nuclear deal, Iran is complying, we should avoid stepping back on that deal, lest we suggest that the United States cannot be trusted in good faith to follow a deal.  Third, I worry about the timing of this effort to step away from the Iran deal with respect to the imminent threat. I hear concerns about the Iran deal and what Iran might be able to do in year 8 or year 10 or year 15. Let me tell you about something I am worrying about this month, and that is the North Korean nuclear program.  We have been in briefings, and we hear the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State say to us and say to the world: The United States will always push for a diplomatic solution. We are never out of diplomatic solutions.  But let's be candid. What are the chances of a diplomatic solution with North Korea that would end or dramatically limit their nuclear weapons ambitions? I don't think the chances are high. I would say they are 20 percent at best. They are not zero, but they are not high, either. But if there is any chance of a diplomatic negotiation and a diplomatic end to this program, don't we owe it to the American public and don't we owe it to our troops to seek to exhaust and explore it? Of course we do. Yet every time Secretary of State Tillerson talks about trying to have some diplomatic outcome to pressure the Chinese to use leverage against North Korea, the President pours cold water on him.  I would argue that stepping back from the Iran deal sends an unmistakable signal to North Korea if I am right, and there is even a small chance of a diplomatic resolution. But the message we send to North Korea is that the United States will back out of a nuclear deal even when it is being complied with. I think we drive the chances of a diplomatic resolution with North Korea down to zero, and we should not do that.  There is significant evidence that while Iran's nonnuclear behavior is worthy of additional sanctions and pressure, the deal on the nuclear program is working. Our closest European allies, U.intelligence services, the IAEA, the P5--when I visit Israel and speak to national security and intelligence leaders, such as Gadi Eisenkot, who is essentially the equivalent of the head of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, they say Iran is complying with the deal, and it is making the world safer in the near and medium term. Secretary Dunford and General Mattis have said the same thing.  The deal gives us more intelligence because we have inspections that we didn't have before. We have more inspections, and we know more about their program. In the first paragraph of the deal, on the first page of the deal, Iran pledges to never purchase, acquire, or develop military weapons. That promise, which is in perpetuity, gives us a legal justification, if they ever break it, to take action, including military action, to punish them for violating what they have signed. Do we want to give Iran the ability to step back from that promise they have made by stepping back ourselves when the deal is working?  Finally, the deal gives us a coalition. Our partners around the world who have signed on to the deal, who have been witness to the Iranian pledge, who know that Iran will have to permanently comply with the additional protocol of inspections under the deal--if we move away from the deal and Iran moves away from the deal, could we count on the coalition partners being with us to try to put a deal back together when it is we alone among the partners who have walked away from the table? What coalition could we expect if we are the ones who walk away from the table, if we say we are not interested in diplomacy? Then, later, if we need to take military action against Iran after we walked away from a deal, could we expect a coalition to support us in that?  I would like to conclude in this way: I think the President's decision to step back from this diplomatic deal poses a real challenge for this The President has done some things I agree with. He has done a number of things I disagree with. He has done only one thing that scares me, and it is this. I think that, together with defunding the State Department and pouring cold water on diplomacy and not filling key posts, this leads us closer to an unnecessary war. When you reject diplomacy or weaken it, you run the risk of an unnecessary war.  I have had to cast two war votes in the Senate, both as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations I have been a city councilman, a mayor, a Lieutenant Governor, and a Governor, and casting a war vote is different from any vote you ever have to cast--any vote you ever have to cast. I have a son in the military, and that makes that vote different from any vote I have cast in 23 years in public life. As a Member of Congress, I may have to cast other votes to go to war against other nations, whether against nonstate terrorist groups or against a nation like North Korea or even Iran if they break for nuclear weapons. If I have to cast that vote, if I have to contemplate putting Congress on record that we should go to war, I want to be able to look American troops in the face and say: I exhausted every diplomatic option before I cast this vote. I think that is an obligation we owe to the public and to our troops. We have to exhaust diplomacy.  There may come a time when that eagle just cannot face the olive branches of diplomacy, but we have to insist on military strength to keep order in the world and protect But if we turn to those arrows of[[Page S6600]]war, we should be able to look at our public and look at our troops and say we exhausted diplomacy.  Stepping away from a diplomatic deal that is working is exactly the wrong thing for us to do at this time. It is my hope that Congress will not dignify what the President is doing in this regard and that we will insist, yes, upon strict compliance and also insist upon sanctions against Iran for nonnuclear behavior. But let's not be a nation that refuses to keep its diplomatic commitments. The stakes are just too high.  Mr.President I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan).

Two years ago, the Senate passed a budget that added a laudatory requirement to have a Congressional Budget Office score for reconciliation legislation 28 hours in advance of voting on the legislation. There are obvious benefits to the Members who are voting and obvious benefits to the American public.  The budget resolution before us from committee repeals that requirement. The majority has argued that it is unnecessary because the requirement has never been triggered. But I remember that just a couple of months ago, the Senate was debating healthcare legislation that hadn't seen the light of day and didn't have a CBO score.  Do we really believe the answer to our problem is to make it easier to pass legislation without knowing the cost? I think the 28-hour requirement is worthy, it should be continued, and I think it should be extended to include amendments in the nature of a substitute.

290,topic-id,399,"Mr.President, this bill authorizes additions to two existing wilderness areas within the George Washington National Forest in Virginia; the Rich Hole and Rough Mountain Wilderness It's a relatively simple bill, and it provides only a small window into the volume of work done by Virginians to manage a vast swath of Federal land in this region collaboratively and responsibly.  America's Federal lands are some of our most precious assets. We may hike or bike them; derive energy, minerals, or goods from them; or sometimes just leave them to nature. There is a long history of conflict among stakeholders who disagree on which Federal lands are best suited to which purposes.  Many years ago, forest users with different views and interests formed the George Washington National Forest Stakeholder Through hard work and consensus, the Collaborative agreed upon a number of recommendations for forest management and protection. Everyone got some of what they wanted and gave some ground. Preservation advocates consented to timber harvest and other active forest restoration and management in certain areas. The forest products industry consented to wilderness and lightly-managed areas elsewhere. The U.Forest Service's 2014 revised GW Forest Management Plan reflected many of these agreements.  Subsequently, the Forest Service convened the Lower Cowpasture Restoration and Management Project, bringing more stakeholders to the table, earlier in the process, to negotiate out how to manage this particular part of the Forest, located in the lower portion of the Cowpasture River watershed, in ways that work for everyone. Within this process, further compromises were made to achieve a mutually satisfactory project that could gather broad support. All members of the Stakeholder Collaborative now support the wilderness additions identified in this bill.  I am proud to partner on this with my colleague Senator Mark Warner, and we are following in the path blazed by Senator John Warner and Representative Rick Boucher, who were instrumental in passing the original Virginia Wilderness Act in 1984.  Taking care of our Nation's outdoor resources is good for our economy and good for our environment. Land disputes may sometimes be difficult, but the example of the GW Forest Stakeholder Collaborative proves they don't have to be. When everyone comes to the table and invests the necessary time, we can find common ground. I hope this will be a lesson for us in other tough policy challenges, and I encourage the Senate to support this bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-17-pt1-PgS6464.txt,2176,"JAVIER VEGA, JR.

812,topic-id,1662,"Mr.President, I also rise to speak about the budget. I find many points of agreement with my colleague from  Just to sort of jump into it, normally we wouldn't be having this budget discussion in the fall. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 suggests that the President would give us a budget in February, that we would pass a budget by April, and that budget would then set top-line numbers that would be given to the committees, that would then write their authorizing bills with those budgetary numbers. Then it would be handed over, and the appropriators would ultimately fashion appropriations bills that were responsive to the budget and the authorizing bills. We are into a new fiscal year, and the many of the authorizing committees have already done their jobs.  I am on the Armed Services Probably the biggest piece of legislation we do every year is the We have already written it without having a budget. We didn't have a budget top-line number this year. We have gone ahead and written the bill, and the appropriators are already working.  I think what everybody on this floor understands is that this really isn't a budget debate; it is an effort to set up a set of instructions around which to do tax reform via budget reconciliation. In my view, this budgetary document fails as a budget, and it also fails as a good-faith beginning to a tax reform discussion.  I want to talk about each of these: why this document fails as a budget--I voted against it in committee, and I am going to vote against it on the floor--and why it fails as an effort to initiate the necessary process for reforming the Tax Code for the first time since 1986.  If you look at this document, the budget that is on the floor has a whole set of priorities that are either wrong or completely unrealistic. As an example, the budget proposes over $5 trillion in spending cuts, $470-plus billion cut to Medicare, and an over $1 trillion cut to That would not only be a bad idea, but it is completely unrealistic and unlikely to occur. These cuts are not going to happen, and so it is just artificial.  Second, the budget does not address the primary budgetary reality--a dangerous reality we are living under--of sequestration and budget caps. It continues to gut domestic discretionary programs, to the tune of over $600 billion over the decade.  Finally, just a particular item that I think is very important: The budget proposes a fast track, a 50-vote process, to open up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife That is really not a budgetary matter; it is shoehorned into the budget because we like to assume we are going to get a big chunk of revenue by drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife But this is a fundamental matter of environmental policy that shouldn't be squirreled away in a tiny detail on the budget.  I opposed drilling in the National Arctic Wildlife Refuge when it was last on the floor in the mid-2000s. We were dealing with high oil prices and overreliance on Middle Eastern oil. The energy situation has completely changed.[[Page S6441]]We are moving to low- and no-carbon energy sources, and oil prices are significantly lower. We are not relying on Middle Eastern oil. I would also argue that the cost-benefit calculation now makes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a particularly poor idea. I went to the Refuge two summers ago and saw the environmental damage that would be caused by drilling there, and I opposed it.  So the budget--from the unrealistic expense cuts to Medicaid and Medicare that would really hurt people, to other cuts--is unrealistic. The fact that it was being done after the authorizers and appropriators were generally done with their work demonstrates that the budget isn't that serious. What this is really about is coming up with an instruction to begin the process of tax reform.  Tax reform done through the reconciliation process is a bad idea for at least two reasons. First, it begins as completely partisan. If you are going to do tax reform for the first time since 1986, you ought to try to get the best ideas of both parties. But that is not what is done with reconciliation. When you say ``We are going to do it through reconciliation,'' you are saying ``We, the majority, have 52 votes. All we need is 50 plus a tiebreaker. We are not going to listen to We are not going to meaningfully entertain the ideas you have. We are going to do it on our own.''  I would venture to say that the same outcome as was achieved with the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act via reconciliation is going to be the end result here. Trying to do something this important all on your own, without meaningfully including the public and the minority, almost destines it for failure.  The second reason it is a bad idea to do tax reform via reconciliation is this: Matters in reconciliation are temporary, not permanent.  I went to the Chamber of Commerce in Northern Virginia with Senator Warner a couple of weeks back. We talked about tax reform. We talked about the fact that it was needed to grow the economy, that it hadn't been done for a long time. But what my business leaders want is tax reform that is permanent. They don't want a tax reform bill where the provisions expire, and because of the rules of reconciliation, that is what happens. So to do tax reform via reconciliation is a mistake.  But let's go further and look at the tax reform ideas that have been discussed by the administration and others that we will likely embark upon if this budget passes. The budget sets up a mechanism for partisan and temporary tax cuts that would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. The first page of the GOP's own budget talks about the challenges of deficits:       ``Continual overspending and its resulting deficits will      expand the Federal debt. During the next 10 years, debt held      by the public is slated to rise from 77 percent of GDP ($15      trillion) to 91 percent of GDP ($26 trillion).''  Why would we propose to increase the debt by $1.5 trillion in a partisan, temporary tax reconciliation bill? If folks--especially the GOP--are so focused on the deficit and debt, and we should be, why are we including a mechanism in this instruction to raise the debt by $1.5 trillion? I think, again, the answer is that this is not a serious proposal, and it is only the vehicle for partisan and temporary tax cuts.  The initial analyses I have seen of this tax proposal suggests a couple of things. First, the tax benefits would overwhelmingly be for folks at the top, the wealthiest, the folks who least need a break in taxes. To give an example, the Republican proposal calls for the elimination of the estate tax. That would cost more than $270 billion over 10 years. The estate tax has high thresholds already. It affects an extremely limited number of Virginians and a limited number of folks in virtually every Giving up $270 billion to get rid of the estate tax is enough to provide every child from a low- or moderate-income family with access to free preschool. That is about 7 million kids. You would still have enough money left over to take every student off Head Start waiting lists. Which would you rather do--cut the estate tax $270 billion for a few families or provide access to free preschool to every low- and moderate-income kid in this country and take every child on a Head Start waiting list off the list?  Second, the proposal has some gimmicks and special quirks that I think need to be brought to attention. I hope we will bring it to attention on the floor. Here is an example: The budget that is before us repeals a rule that is currently in place that requires the CBO to issue scores on legislation coming out of reconciliation at least 28 hours in advance of a vote. Now, 28 hours isn't that long, but at least it is enough time for a Senator and staff to read a bill and understand the consequences of the bill before voting. This Republican budget repeals the transparency rule that forces the CBO to issue a score. I have an amendment to not repeal the rule but to restore it and make it stronger. There should be a CBO score to let every Senator and especially the public know what we are voting on with respect to these matters.  I will conclude and say this: Tax reform is important. Let's not sugarcoat this. We are not really debating a budget on the floor. If we were really going to debate a budget, we would have done it last spring. This is all about setting the stage for tax reform. We haven't done it for a long time. It is important. We should promote tax reform that makes the Tax Code simpler and fair and that focuses on middle-class working families and makes it easier to start businesses and grow them. We shouldn't be doing tax reform that is partisan, that is temporary, that increases the deficit, and that produces the overwhelming benefit of a tax reform package to those at the top of the income scale who don't need it.  It is my hope that we will have that debate in earnest on the floor of the I would love to join my colleagues in a good-faith effort to reform the Tax Reconciliation and this particular proposal is not the way to do that.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Rubio). The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

The Trump-led FEMA, that is the Federal Emergency[[Page H7985]]Management Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is falling far short on disaster relief in Puerto In fact, I think one could say they are actually perilously short on helping the people, our fellow citizens, in Puerto  It has now been 22 days, that is 528 hours, since Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico still--still--have no fresh water, no power, little food, with many villages lacking any means for communication. Many have no dry cots or even dry sleeping bags to replace the wet mattresses and moldy surroundings that characterize the Puerto Rico of today.  Let me say that Puerto Rico is not a large island. It is a little over 100 miles wide, not much larger than my congressional district in Ohio which extends from Cleveland to The difference with Puerto Rico is the topography is much more hilly.  I ask myself the question: Why hasn't FEMA had airdrops of vital sustenance from the very start? Where is that help to these far-flung villages that have been cut off because, when the rains came, they washed out bridges and roads that make all these tiny towns inaccessible?  Fresh water packets can be airdropped. Our military does that all over the world. Why can't those fresh water packets be dropped in Puerto Rico?  We can drop packets with peanut butter and bread. We do that all over the world. Why can't we do that in Puerto Rico? Why can't we airdrop food?

Had      just planted roughly 200 coffee trees and couldn't wait to      watch them grow. They had planted different herbs as well as      squash and beans.

642,topic-id,2726,"Mr.President, I listened with interest to the comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania, and as always he was articulate and thoughtful and made a strong case.  I would like to speak to the issue we are going to be addressing over the next few days, the next few weeks, and probably the next few months, not necessarily to be unalterably opposed but to talk about how we can get where we all want to be, which is lower taxes, higher growth, and a stronger U.economy.  I think it is important to emphasize at the beginning, just so we all know, what we are talking about the next couple days isn't the budget. As the Senator from Pennsylvania noted, it is really a vehicle for a massive tax cut.  My problem with the tax cut is not necessarily that we are going to have[[Page S6497]]one, but the question is, How is it structured? Who gets the benefits? How to pay for it?  As the Senator pointed out, we still don't know what the plan is. We have an outline; we have principles; we have bullet points; we have lists, but we don't have a plan. Therefore, it is difficult to analyze.  We do have some particulars that have been released. You don't need to be an economist to understand that if the rate for the lowest taxpayers is being increased and the rate for the highest taxpayers is being decreased, that the overall effect will be loaded toward those at the upper income level.  The only analysis we have from the tax policy foundation, an outside nonpartisan group, is that under the plan, as it has been described by the White House and by Members of Congress, about 80 percent of the benefits of this proposal go to the top 1 percent of wage earners in this country. Eighty percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent.  It may be that as the details of the plan are more well known and more thoroughly described, we will find it is slightly different than that. One of the things that really bothers me about this budget resolution we are going to be voting on is, it explicitly waives a longtime budget rule that before you can vote on issues such as this, there must be a Congressional Budget Office score 28 hours prior to the vote. It waives that provision. That is not a good sign. That doesn't reassure me that we are going to have a clear idea of what we are voting on.  When you combine the cuts proposed to Medicare and Medicaid, which go into paying for these massive tax cuts, it looks to me like the biggest losers in this whole process will be seniors.  When you look at what we know about the structure of the tax cuts and the fact that there is a one-half trillion-dollar cut in Medicare projected over 10 years and a $1.5 trillion cut in Medicaid, seniors are going to take the most serious hit. Why do I say that? Well, we all know Medicare specifically applies to seniors, so that is pretty easy. If you are cutting Medicare, you are hitting seniors.  Secondly, though, what a lot of people don't realize about Medicaid is that 70 percent of the nursing home beds in America are paid for by By definition, who is in those beds? When you cut Medicare and Medicaid, you are going to be impacting seniors.  The provisions of the tax plan, as we know it--and I keep emphasizing ``as we know it'' because we are voting on something today to clear the path for a major tax cut, and we don't know what it is, but it appears it will impact seniors disproportionately.  I want to touch on a couple of other points. One is the argument that the cuts to Medicaid and Medicare aren't really cuts; they are just reductions in growth. Well, that argument applies if you are talking about the NASA budget, for example. If the NASA budget is projected to grow 5 percent a year, and we cut it to 4 percent a year, that is a reduction in growth; that we are going to do one less trip into space or whatever the policy outcome of that cut is.  Medicare and Medicaid are different, however. They have to pay costs in the real world as they come up when necessary. The increased growth that is projected in those two programs is based upon two unalterable facts. One is demographics.  We are getting older, and that means more work, more demands on the medical system. It also is based on medical inflation, which everyone knows in recent years has proven to be higher than the ordinary rate of inflation. This is the best projection we have, but if you project that the current level of medical costs today, 8 years from now or 10 years from now are going to cost what they cost today, plus medical inflation, plus the impact of demographics, people getting older, that is a real cost. If you cut that, fewer people are going to get services. Rural hospitals will close. There will be undeniable impacts on both the economy of our rural regions of the country and real people.  This argument that cuts to Medicare and Medicaid are just a cut in growth--it is not really a cut--is just not true. That may be true in some areas, but it is not true here because these are real costs that are going to be incurred. If the costs go up and fewer dollars are there to meet them, somebody is going to get hurt. These are real cuts to real people.  The other thing I want to touch on is the deficit and debt. I have to say, I am sort of puzzled by this whole process because as I have been here over the past 5 years and as I have lived my life over the past 25 years, the majority party in the Senate has been focused on the debt and on the deficit and the dangers of the debt to our country, to our economy, and how bad it was that we were mortgaging our children's future, and all of a sudden it is no big deal. All of a sudden it is OK to knowingly, consciously, deliberately talk about a $1.5 trillion increase in the debt over the next 10 years. That assumes, by the way, that the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid take place and that other cuts that are in the budget, exemptions and deductions, take place. It could be that the effect on the debt and the deficit will be much greater.  I remember 2 or 3 years ago, when we were in a recession and people were trying to get jobs and we had millions of people unemployed, there was a motion to extend unemployment benefits for 6 months. I can't remember the cost. I think it was $5 or $6 billion. Oh, no, point of order. We can't do that. It will increase the deficit. We are talking about $1.5 trillion that we know of, but that is That is  I think we need to understand this. What this really is, if we pass unfunded tax cuts, they aren't really tax cuts. They are simply a deferral of the tax from us to our kids. We don't have to pay the tax, but the money to be spent is still going to be spent, so the hole gets deeper. We borrow that money, and our kids and our grandchildren are going to have to pay it back with interest. That is called shift and shaft. That is not a tax cut. We are just shifting the tax and shafting our kids. It is as if on your deathbed you call your children over and say: I have some final words for you. The kid leans over, and you say: Here is my credit card bill. I had a wonderful trip to I hope you don't mind paying for it. That is what we are doing. We are indulging ourselves and stealing from the next generation because we are not willing to pay the costs of the programs we all support and think are important.  I think there is another fact that needs to be realized. As we build up this deficit and debt, eventually the bill is going to come due, and because we have used up all of our resources, the only place to go to cut them is going to be Social Security and Medicare because the discretionary budget is essentially going to be all gone.  It is really simple to make the interest rate calculation. We now owe $20 trillion. Seventy-seven percent of our annual GDP we owe. The interest rate calculation is simple: 1 percent, $200 billion a year.  I think it is more a question of when than if. When interest rates return to a more normal level of 5 percent, that is $1 trillion a year in interest, just interest. That happens to be very close to the entire discretionary budget of the U.Government--$1.1 trillion--this year, defense and nondefense. We will be paying almost as much in interest as the entire discretionary budget. How are we going to manage that situation? The only way it can be managed is to start talking about Social Security and  So this is a long-distance, slow-motion diminution of the value of those programs that are so important to so many Americans, particularly senior  The final point I wish to touch on relates to the Senator from Pennsylvania basically predicting: Don't worry, these tax cuts will pay for themselves. I have been hearing that all my adult life; I have never seen it work. It didn't work in the middle of the last decade during the Bush tax cuts. All those tax cuts were going to pay for themselves: Don't worry, the stimulus of economic growth will be such that there will be more income, more revenues, and we will, in fact, as the Senator said, reduce the deficit.  The problem is there is no evidence that it has ever worked in the history of mankind. The best economic research I have seen says that maybe the economic growth will offset about 20 percent of the cost of the tax cuts, but 80 percent is going to go straight to the debt. So to make the assumption that[[Page S6498]]somehow this is all going to pay for itself, I believe, is irresponsible.  I have a modest suggestion for those who are making that argument. Will my colleagues accept a friendly amendment which says that if the growth does not occur, then the taxes--or certain taxes--are automatically retriggered in order to fill the gap? If my colleagues are right, that will never need to happen, but if you are not right, that will protect our kids. I think that is a reasonable solution. I don't think it is going to happen. Why? Because it hasn't happened. It hasn't happened in It hasn't happened here. I have never seen it happen.  I have looked at the economic research and, as near as I can tell, there is no data that indicates an automatic correlation between tax cuts and economic growth. I suspect there are tax cuts that can stimulate economic growth; it depends on where they are and what they are. But there is no evidence that is the case regarding tax cuts in general.  So those of our membership who believe this rosy scenario--the temptress, rosy scenario--is going to occur, fine. But if it doesn't, let's put language in the whole tax program which says that insofar as the growth does not occur as projected, the deficit will be maintained at no worse than current levels by automatically triggering tax increases to fill the gap. Then we are being honest. Then we are being honest to the next generation.  I believe there are important areas where tax cuts are necessary in order to make us more competitive, in order to help to grow our economy. However, I don't think what I have heard so far is the answer, and there are many problems with what has been described. I am willing to hold my fire and see what the Finance Committee comes up with and see whether, as the Senator from Pennsylvania said, it will be an open and bipartisan process, with amendments. If that is the case, we, I think, could come up with, on a bipartisan basis, a reasonable tax change--tax cuts, tax reform--that will strengthen our economy without adding to the deficit and without requiring massive cuts to programs such as Medicaid and Medicare that are so important to millions of It can be done right.  In 1986, it was done right. That was true tax reform. That was the last time we did tax reform. And I think it is very interesting that over the last several months, the language that describes what we are about to do has migrated from ``tax reform'' to ``tax cuts.'' Tax reform means you change the Tax Code, get rid of the inefficiencies, simplify it, take away some exemptions and deductions, lower rates, but we end up revenue neutral and we have a stronger economic base from which to proceed. Tax cuts simply add to the deficit or are based upon unrealistic and, indeed, cruel cuts to people in the future.  I think we have an opportunity to do this right. I think there is more consensus here than perhaps people realize on the question of doing tax reform in a way that will benefit the entire country. I don't think the Members on this side of the aisle are categorically opposed to tax cuts under any circumstances.  When I was the Governor of Maine, we cut taxes--I can't remember, 10 or 15 times--overall by about 15 percent. We cut the income tax. We cut the sales tax. We cut the property tax. So it can be done. That was done on a bipartisan basis with a legislature that went back and forth between Republican and Democratic control. They had this sort of strange Independent Governor, but we made it work. It can be done, and it can be done on a bipartisan basis.  It certainly looks as though this is about to be railroaded. It is about to be shoved down our throats without adequate analysis and without fully understanding it. I deeply hope that is not the case. I hope we learned something from healthcare, that we can do good things when we work together. When we don't, it rarely ends well.  So I understand that the votes are probably there to pass this budget, but the real question will come: What happens next? What does the plan look like? How responsible is it? What kind of assumptions is it based on? What kind of analysis do the Joint Taxation Committee and the Congressional Budget Office provide us on a nonpartisan basis as to what it will really do? Then we can have a real debate. Then we can talk about what is best for I think, between the group of us who work here and down the hall, we can find a good solution. But if the solution is thrust upon us, if it is ill-conceived, if it is skewed toward the wealthy, if it balances the budget on the backs of seniors, on Medicare, and Medicaid recipients, if it is based upon unrealistic assumptions about growth, then we are going to harm our country, not help it.  Eventually, if we keep going down the road we are traveling in terms of the national debt, the piper will have to be paid. It may not have to be paid by our generation, but it is going to have to be paid by these young people and by their peers all across I don't think that is right. That is not the legacy I came here to leave to my children and grandchildren.

The Army stopped issuing them 30 years ago, yet the Army has been prevented from disposing of them due to parochial interests tied to the Civilian Marksmanship Program, or  The CMP's proponents basically want to transfer the pistols to a private corporation so that it can sell them. Do we want this to happen? We have the opportunity in this year's NDAA to stop this transfer of tens of thousands of M-1911 A-1 pistols which constitutes a multimillion-dollar government giveaway.  It is also important to note that this would make our streets more dangerous at a time when gun violence is all too common.  The CMP was established in 1903--just to put this in historical context--following the Spanish-American War when American militiamen demonstrated distressingly poor marksmanship. At that time, our Nation needed a better trained and organized militia, and the CMP helped the government build a broader base of able citizen-soldiers.  Now, the program was an important component of our national defense back then. But today, Mr.Speaker, over a century later, we have a professional military and many rifle clubs, and the CMP is, quite frankly, no longer needed. Congress clearly understood this when it privatized the CMP in 1996.  Now, as an initial capital investment at a time when earmarks were still common, Congress provided the newly chartered corporation with a stock of rifles, ammunition, and other spare parts. The CMP could sell the surplus equipment--mostly M1 Garand rifles--in order to fund its activities until it became self-sufficient.                              {time}  1400  However, it was never Congress' intent to equip the CMP with handguns, or it would have provided the corporation with surplus M-1911-A1 .45-caliber pistols at that time.  Now, more than two decades later, the CMP is running out of rifles to sell. The reality is that it is in dire financial straits as, more than 20 years later, the program is still reliant on rifle sales to support its activities.  So, Mr.Speaker, it is clearly not the taxpayers' responsibility to bail out the To do so would be an unprecedented government handout at a time when earmarks have been banned for years.[[Page H8005]]  So what makes this program so special?  There is nothing.  Beyond this, it would flood our streets with handguns--the guns that are most often used by criminals. I believe this would be extremely dangerous when, more than 2 years ago, the first attempt was made to effectuate this earmark, I heard the argument that storing surplus pistols, as the Army is now doing, is a waste of government funds. Well, I agree. However, a handout is not the answer.  There is no national security reason to put these guns on our streets. In fact, an increase in the number of handguns will only result potentially in more violence.  So, Mr.Speaker, we should allow the Army to dispose of these pistols by melting them down, as it plans to do with other surplus arms.  Senate language in the NDAA exempts M-1911-A1 pistols from Army disposal, but I urge my colleagues to support the motion to instruct the conferees to reject this exemption. There is no reason to store these pistols. There is no reason to flood our streets with them. There is no reason to give an earmark, again, to a private corporation. They should be melted down and repurchased for other military uses, which is exactly what this motion supports.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

276,topic-id,567,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, Congress intended for the CMP to become self-sufficient after it was privatized in 1996. It was never meant to be the recipient of another multimillion-dollar government handout years later, especially not a handout of tens of thousands of pistols which then would be used immediately for sale to the public to fund its operations.  Again, perhaps one could argue that, when earmarks were around, they needed this to fund their operations. Again, there was a time when earmarks were in existence. Earmarks are no longer regular order. They don't exist anymore. They were done away with several years ago.  Mr.Speaker, I think it is clear that I don't hold with the need for the CMP to receive Federal support.  On another note, I don't often see eye to eye with the NRA, but I must agree with the statement on the NRA's website that the Association is ``the premier firearms education organization in the world.''                              {time}  1415  Well, the NRA does not receive Federal support from its education programs, which are widely accessible, and in our professional military, the need for marksmanship training for national security purposes has evaporated. Even if we truly think the CMP is deserving of a government subsidy, Congress should do so through the appropriations process, not through a provision that is, quite frankly, again, an earmark.  As my colleagues so well know, earmarks were banned in the 112th Congress, yet the provisions at issue in the House-passed NDAA would transfer millions of dollars, ostensibly, in government property to a corporation that is in the congressional district of the measure's chief advocate. And while I have deep respect for my colleague, the government shouldn't be engaged in this type of practice.  The government has occasionally transferred surplus property to nonprofit corporations for education or other purposes; however, it has never done so with the intent that the property be immediately sold, with the proceeds going to the corporation's bottom line. So if that isn't an earmark, Mr.Speaker, I don't know what is. It is blatant subversion of congressional order, and it would set, I believe, a very dangerous precedent.  I hope that my colleagues would join me in upholding the rules of the House and support the motion to instruct.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to highlight the danger of this transfer, potentially, to public safety. Injecting tens of thousands of new pistols onto our streets by providing them to the CMP, I believe, could be disastrous, as handguns are regularly used in crime.  Now, in 2013, of the 6,498 homicides committed by a firearm for which the type of weapon was known, 89 percent were handgun related--89 percent. Only 4 percent were carried out using a rifle, the type of firearm the CMP has traditionally sold.  The qualities that made the M1911A1 .45-caliber pistol a fun sidearm is the fact that it is easily concealed, extremely reliable, and packs quite a punch, all qualities that make it prized also among criminals. In fact, the Department of Justice has tracked 1,768 M1911A1s over the last decade due to their involvement in criminal activity.  In a time when mass shootings have become all too common and 93 Americans are killed with guns every day, the last thing we need is more guns on our streets.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-10-12-pt1-PgH8004-3.txt,1668,RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF THELONIOUS MONK,2017.0,12.0,October

I was proud to support it in committee, overall, because it provides for our national defense. It supports key programs of the Department of Defense to make sure our warfighters have every advantage possible. We never want to send our warfighters into a fair fight, and this bill, overall, goes a long way toward ensuring for our national defense and provides great support for our men and women in uniform.  Unfortunately, this CMP issue has been an unnecessary distraction. It is something I don't believe belongs in the bill. I believe that and, again, I made the point that we have done away with earmarks, and so we shouldn't be using an earmark and subverting congressional authority and will through the regular order process, through the appropriations process, to help to fund a private organization.  Again, there are many, I am sure, meritorious organizations around the country that would love to have an earmark, but we don't do them anymore, and we shouldn't be doing a sidestep here to give a private organization such an earmark.  As I said, I have highlighted again the potential for guns to fall into the wrong hands. And although the owners of the weapons may be of good character and those who purchased the guns, to fund, again, the operations of the CMP, a private organization, even if they have them in their home, if there is criminal activity that takes place, whether it is an act of violence or if the home is broken into and the weapon is stolen, which happens every day in America that a law-abiding citizen has a weapon that gets in the wrong hands, that weapon is then used in the crime. The more weapons out there, the more likely something like that could potentially happen.  This is what we are trying to prevent. We want to do this in a responsible way. Again, we want to make sure that the guns don't just wind up out in our streets, and we want to make sure that they are melted down like other surplus equipment.  The Army surely does not need to store them any longer. We want to get rid of them. We want the Army to be able to do that, but they should be able to do what they do with other surplus equipment, and that is melt it down,[[Page H8007]]perhaps use that melted down material for making other weapons that the Army does need that are relevant at this time.

1185,topic-id,806,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate all his time and effort he is putting into bringing attention to this vital issue. It is an honor to join him this evening as we highlight the imminent need to pass a full reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance  Now, I represent the great State of Rhode Island, a State with over 27,000 children and pregnant women at risk of losing healthcare if CHIP is not fully funded. It is deeply troubling to me and many of my constituents, my colleagues in government; and we fought hard over the years to make sure that we did better by our young people, by the most vulnerable, and by pregnant women in making sure that they had the healthcare coverage that they desperately need and deserve.  Now, in Rhode Island, the lack of a reauthorization endangers $26 million in Federal funds that support this vulnerable population, many of whom will not otherwise have comprehensive coverage. This is particularly frustrating because congressional Republicans knew that CHIP funding would expire on September 30. They had ample time to fix this problem in a bipartisan way and have chosen not to.  Instead of proactively crafting legislation to ensure 9 million low-income children and families maintain access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, Republicans focused their efforts on gutting the Affordable Care Act to the exclusion of everything else.  Now, in the service of their political priority to eliminate coverage for 23 million, they are passing on an opportunity to govern on multiple healthcare fronts. Rather than work to find meaningful bipartisan solutions, Republicans still seek ways of systematically unraveling ACA protections and have only offered untenable options to offset the cost of That is no way to govern responsibly or to even remotely do it in a bipartisan way, which they could do.  Now, their plan to pay for healthcare for one population by stripping access to healthcare from another is wrong. This approach of robbing Peter to pay Paul does nothing to build a foundation for a healthier future, nor does it protect the communities with sufficient healthcare access today.  Proposing to slash the ACA's Prevention and Public Health Fund and creating a greater financial burden on seniors by suggesting destructive Medicare changes are not acceptable ways to bring Democrats to the table and pass a CHIP reauthorization with bipartisan support. Which, by the way, I am sure my colleagues have mentioned as they were speaking tonight, when CHIP was first authorized, it was done collaboratively in a bipartisan way at a contentious time in Congress, back when it was first enacted. But they found a way to do the right thing for vulnerable individuals, particularly our children, and we need to come together again.  We have a responsibility to move quickly, to ensure our children continue to have access to high-quality, affordable coverage. States like Rhode Island deserve to know that we will support the efforts to provide for the children in the The health professionals who treat these children deserve more certainty. Most importantly, the children who benefit from CHIP deserve much better than to be threatened with coverage termination because my colleagues in the majority can't set aside their political ambitions and goals.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to again thank my colleague for raising an alarm bell on this issue, calling attention and focusing the American people on the need to reauthorize  We take great pride in Rhode Island that over the years we have built a very strong program to cover vulnerable children and pregnant women. We have been leaders in the country in having a very low rate of uninsured. Going back even before the ACA was enacted, we had a model program with our Rite Care and Rite Share program. There were hard-fought battles that moved the ball forward for providing better and more responsible health coverage for the people who need it and deserve it the most.  We need to come together now in a bipartisan way to make sure that CHIP is reauthorized. We cannot let this program fail. We cannot fail our children, our most vulnerable populations. We can come together in a bipartisan way. Democrats stand ready to do just that, come together in a bipartisan way to reauthorize CHIP, just as it had been authorized in a bipartisan way when it was first created.

They propose increasing the debt not to invest in our infrastructure or in educating the next generation. They propose increasing the debt not to expand access to healthcare or promote medical research. No--they propose exploding the debt to give corporations and the top one percent a tax cut. Once again, they majority is turning away from the bipartisan traditions of this Senate and toward the hyperpartisan tactics that do not result in progress for the American people.  This budget invests in millionaires and billionaires like the Trump family, the Koch brothers, wealthy corporations, and the top 1 percent. It turns its back on millions of hard-working American families. While the resolution authorizes a $1.5 trillion increase in the debt, independent experts calculate that the real cost of the Trump tax plan will far exceed that amount. How will the majority pay for the difference? It will slash Medicaid, a proposal already rejected by the Senate this year. It will slash It will slash programs for veterans and infrastructure.  It will be middle-class Americans who bear the brunt of these cuts. According to independent analysts, middle-class Americans will see their home values drop and will experience a tax increase as a result of the Trump tax plan. This shameful budget sends the message that the Senate supports putting tax cuts for the wealthy and biggest corporations on our Nation's credit card and, to the extent we pay for any of it, that we do so on the backs of the middle class and seniors and at the expense of protecting the environment.

This is not how our Nation became the greatest country on Earth.[[Page S6615]]  After years of claiming that the deficit is one of the greatest threats to our country, the majority today will waive away any concern about the long-term impact of increasing it. They argue that the economic growth spurred by these tax cuts will outpace the foregone revenue, but as we saw with the Bush tax cuts, this claim is simply not based in reality. This argument is based on a pyramid scheme of assumptions on top of assumptions, and while we should be taking a close look at the Congressional Budget Office's projections--a range of both dynamic and conventional scores--this budget resolution eliminates the only existing mechanism that requires the Senate to have a CBO estimate in advance of a vote. Why might the majority want to rush a vote before examining the long-term economic impacts of these proposed tax cuts?  Our Tax Code is complex--very much, overly complex--and I share the view that it is in need of improvement and simplification. We can and should have a meaningful debate about tax reform, but any reforms must be certain to benefit middle-class Americans, not just the top 1 percent.

The Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program, or PILT, was designed to address this very inequity by paying States for the property tax revenue they lost as a result of Federal land ownership, but the current formula for PILT does not adequately compensate local governments for this loss.

811,topic-id,7091,"Mr.President, I wish to thank my colleague, the Senator from Wyoming, chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr.Enzi, for allowing me, as the vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, some time on the Senate floor to discuss the budget.  Our budget process is important, and it has long been in a period of neglect. It needs reform. That is what I am here to talk about today. There are so many areas that are affected by our budgeting process or, at least, that should be. In fact, it is difficult to conceive of any aspect of the Federal Government that couldn't be or shouldn't be addressed through the budgeting process.  When we look at the budget process, it is important for us to focus, to one degree or another, on the Budget Act of 1974. This is an old law. Forty-three years in statute has not exactly improved it. It hasn't matured into something better. In other words, rather than a piece of art that has appreciated in value over time, this is something more akin to the 8-track tape player that you might have purchased in 1974 to go inside your Ford Pinto, which would explode upon impact. This is something that didn't really improve in the 43 years since it was passed, especially not the way we have followed it or, better said, the way we have utterly failed to follow it.  One of the best ways to describe the budgeting process, prescribed by the Budget Act of 1974, is that it is nonbinding. It is less legislation than it is legislative fiction. It is aspirational in the sense that it aims for what could be and what should be, except no one actually aspires to it. In Congress, we don't get to the aspiration, basically, ever. It is reminiscent almost of the immortal words of When he was undergoing his transition to Christianity, he famously said: ``Lord, grant me chastity . . . but not yet''--always wanting to restrain oneself later and not now, even though the need for restraint, the need for reform is present now, is calling out for reform right now. That is why it is important to remember that what comes next is[[Page S6436]]important, and next is now. We are discussing the budget this week, and it is important that we focus on these issues right now.  We do have a system that has to be kept carefully in balance. That balance depends on Congress keeping the national interest front and center. It depends on Congress being willing to restrain itself and follow the dictates of our constitutional structure. We have failed on these scores.  Congress collectively, actively, almost defiantly avoids the very type of accountability built into our constitutional structure--the type of accountability called for by article I of the Article I, the very first clause of the first section of the first article of the Constitution, makes clear that if you are going to make policy within the Federal Government, if you are going to establish norms that will be enforceable as generally applicable laws within our Federal Government, you have to go through  ``All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.'' Article I, section 1 tells us that.  Article I, section 7 tells us that in order to make a law in our Federal system, you first have to pass something through the House of Representatives and the Senate, and then you have to submit it to the White You cannot make law without going through that process. That process is also worked in for a budgeting process.  The way the Budget Act of 1974 is supposed to work, the way our budget process is supposed to operate is that we will pass a series of laws appropriating money in various aspects of the Federal We have a budget that gets passed first, which is an aspirational statement not submitted to the It is a resolution passed jointly by both Houses of Congress that sets budgeting priorities. Then, following from those priorities, there are supposed to be 13 separate appropriations bills that spend money, that allocate the scarce resources of the Federal Government, understanding that they are finite to each of the major areas of government spending.  There will be one bill, for example, that funds National There is another bill that will fund our Justice Department or Federal court system. There is another bill that will fund, for example, our national parks, and so on and so forth. When you follow that formula, you avoid the kind of circumstance in which we push all spending decisions into one legislative package, setting up a potential for disaster.  A common analogy that I sometimes use to describe this is, imagine if you live in an outlying area, in an area where there is only one grocery store for 100, maybe 200 miles around. Upon moving there, suppose, on your way home from work, you receive a phone call from your significant other telling you to stop by the store: Don't come home without bread, milk, and eggs. You don't need everything else. Just get bread, milk, and eggs.  You go to the grocery store. You get your shopping cart, and you put in your bread, milk, and eggs. You get to the checkout counter. You put out your bread, milk, and eggs.  The cashier says to you: Excuse me, there is a problem. You can't buy just bread, milk, and eggs. This is a special kind of store where you can't buy bread, milk, and eggs unless you also buy a bucket of nails, one-half ton of iron ore, a Barry Manilow album, and a book about cowboy poetry. In fact, for that matter, this is the kind of store where you have to buy one of every item in order to buy anything else. That is kind of what it is like every time we pass a spending bill lately because, even though the Budget Act of 1974 contemplates 12 or 13 separate appropriations bills, each addressing one discreet aspect of the Federal Government's spending, we end up, more often than not--in fact, basically every single time for the last 6 of \1/2\ years I have been serving here, and even longer than that, we end up passing either a continuing resolution, which basically is a reset button saying that we will continue to spend next year at the same rate we have been spending this year, subject to these minor exceptions or, alternatively, we might pass an omnibus spending bill, which can be 1,000, maybe 2,000 pages long, sometimes longer, and identify all the areas in which we will be spending but put into one unified bill.  The problem with these bills, the way we have tended to do continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills, is that we tend to consider and pass them under a compacted time agreement in the final hours or minutes before a cliff. By ``cliff,'' I mean an arbitrary deadline, after which a spending measure already in place will expire. So if there is a spending bill that expires on September 30 of a particular year, it is not uncommon for us to address a spending bill on September 30, sometimes late in the day on September 30 or in the days leading up to it.  It is not uncommon for Members of Congress to be told at that moment: You have two choices. You can either pass this as is and have everything funded more or less as it has been or you can shut down the government.  Nobody really wants to cause a government shutdown. Certainly, nobody wants to be accused of shutting down the government.  Most Members tend to vote for it, and then the American people continue to get what they have been getting. They continue to operate a Federal Government that spends about $4 trillion a year, with little or no control, even by the people's own elected Representatives in Congress, whose job it is to do these things over their own government. This is wrong.  We shouldn't be governing this way. Yet there is a touch of irony in this in that we govern this way, I think, at least in part, because of a fear of public outcry against the process or criticism about the process in which we might engage. Yet, as we undertake this process, which undercuts that process altogether and sidesteps it, as we have avoided that studiously in order to avoid criticism, we have seen Congress's approval rating plummet. In fact, if you look at most opinion polls these days, it puts our approval rating as an institution right around 10 percent. The last time I checked, in the United States of America, that makes us less popular than Fidel It makes us only slightly more popular than the influenza virus, which is rapidly gaining on us.  If what we are wanting to do is avoid criticism, then the last thing we ought to do is continue to do what we have been doing, which is to consolidate all spending decisions into one legislative package to be addressed at the end of the fiscal year, telling Members they have to either vote for it or be blamed for a government shutdown. That is wrong. That shuts out the American people, and it makes their government unaccountable to them.  In the process, we avoid reforming a lot of programs that need reforming. Among other things, we avoid reforming entitlement spending. It is important when we think about entitlement spending and how it needs to be reformed to remember the immortal words of President John Kennedy, who said that ``to govern is to choose.'' But today, to budget is not to choose or to choose in advance not to choose, to avoid choosing altogether.  We are $20 trillion in debt, and we choose to ignore that. Twenty trillion dollars is an enormous amount of money, as is the interest we pay on that sum every single year, which is about $250 billion a year--an enormous sum of money in and of itself. But that isn't the scary part. The scary part is that $250 billion, which is what we spend every year on interest on our national debt, is roughly the same interest payment we had about 20 years ago. I believe our national debt was one-sixth or one-seventh of its current size. The only reason it is even that low is because our Treasury yield rates--the interest rate at which the U.Government pays its creditors--is at an all-time historical low.  Laws of mathematics are such that what goes down must inevitably come back up. As soon as it does come back up, even if it comes up only to its historical average and doesn't rebound above that average, in a short period of time, within a few years after that, we will find ourselves going from about $250 billion a year in interest on debt to about $1 trillion a year in interest on debt, leaving ourselves with the uncomfortable, darned-near impossible[[Page S6437]]prospect of having to cover a $750 billion shortfall--this on top of our existing sprawling national deficit--without any clear means of doing so.  Congress, in many cases, fears reform, but reform remains necessary to make programs structurally reliable and fiscally sustainable. In other words, we are fearing the wrong thing. A lot of people in my home State of Utah fear snakes, understandably. We have rattlesnakes in parts of Rattlesnakes can do a lot of damage to you if they bite you. You don't want to mess with a rattlesnake. But sometimes we fear the wrong things, at least in the sense of, in addition to a lot of rattlesnakes, we also have a lot of deer. They should actually fear deer more than rattlesnakes. More people die in the United States every year as a result of deer causing automotive accidents than they do from rattlesnake bites altogether. Sometimes we fear the wrong things.  We fear making reform. But reform is not what we should fear; we should fear the consequences of failure to do that.  In some ways, the central unifying problem isn't just about the debt or dysfunction but the distrust. Congress has squandered the trust of the American people, and we as an institution have a responsibility to work hard to win back that trust. The only way to win back that trust is through real reform. We have to put the national interest ahead of our own interests, our own political interests and the special interests that are constantly moving here in Washington, That work can begin with this very budget. It should begin with this budget. Budgets provide us with an opportunity to discuss our priorities. Those priorities always need to be all about reform.  This budget is far from perfect, but in understanding that it is not perfect, it is a vehicle to begin the real process of reform. Nowhere is this more important than with tax reform, and this will set in motion those events that can culminate in real, genuine, and much needed tax reform.  There are a couple of odd quirks within our Federal Tax First of all, its sheer length and complexity are a problem. Arthur Brooks from the American Enterprise Institute said that complexity is itself a subsidy--a subsidy that disproportionately benefits the well connected, the wealthy, the well educated, the specialists who handle the complexity and profit from it. One hundred years ago, our Tax Code was only a few hundred pages long. Today, our Tax Code, depending on what you count, can fairly be described as much closer to 100,000 pages than to a few hundred.  Among the many problems we can find in the Tax Code is the marriage tax penalty, which many Americans are familiar with, whereby a hard-working American couple might pay higher taxes only because of the fact that they happen to be married. This is wrong, and it needs to be fixed.  There is a related point--a related flaw--that is much less well known than the Tax Code marriage penalty, and that is the Tax Code parent penalty. Let me explain what that is. Imagine two couples--couple A and couple Imagine that couple A and couple B are identical in every respect but one. In other words, they both have the same income, they both have the same pattern of charitable contributions, mortgage interest, State and local taxes, and so forth. Everything that affects their taxes is the same except one thing: Couple A has three children and couple B chooses to remain childless. Because of the way our Tax Code interacts and intersects with our senior entitlement programs--namely, Social Security and Medicare--we end up penalizing parents, creating this parent tax penalty. Let me explain that a little bit.  Let's call couple A--the couple with three children--Jack and According to very modest assessments made by the U.Department of Agriculture, Jack and Julie, with their three children, will incur costs of about $700,000 as they raise their children. These are the costs of raising children. I believe it is a little faulty--there are a number of things it doesn't include--but it is an estimate produced by the U.Department of Jack and Julie, our hypothetical couple A, will spend $700,000 raising their three children to maturity. It doesn't take into account the non-economic costs associated with parenting or the myriad benefits that go along with that--but $700,000. That is the amount they will put into raising these three children. That cost doesn't benefit just Jack and Julie, it doesn't benefit just their three children--no, the way our system works, the way Social Security and Medicare work, it also goes to stabilize, to shore-up entitlement benefits for tomorrow's retirees, because Social Security and Medicare operate on a pay-as-you-go basis. Today's retiree benefits are paid by today's workers. Today's workers will be tomorrow's retirees. Today's children will be tomorrow's workers and will be paying the retirement benefits of today's workers, tomorrow's retirees.  Let's look at couple A, back to Jack and Jack and Julie operate solely with Julie's income. Jack is a stay-at-home father. Meanwhile, Julie has a good job that pays $75,000 a year. As you look at this chart, it shows how the pay stubs Julie receives twice a month might look.  I would imagine many Americans look at this the same way I do. People approach their pay stubs with a degree of trepidation. It is almost easier not to look at it when you see all the things the government does to your paycheck each time it goes through.  Jack and Julie look at Julie's pay stub when it comes out twice a month, and they see a few things, including the fact that, in addition to the $205 that is withheld from her Federal income tax twice a month, she also sees $41.84 withheld for Medicare, $178 withheld for Social Security, and $144 withheld for State income tax.  So when we look at Julie's pay stub, we see that what Julie is paying into Social Security and Medicare is roughly the same as what we will see from couple B, who chooses to remain childless. Couple B has every right not to have children. We don't want to penalize anybody regarding their decision on whether to have children. But the point here is that the investment Jack and Julie are making into the Social Security system comes twice--first as they pay their taxes, including their Social Security and Medicare taxes--and with Social Security taxes, by the way, that is also going to play a role in determining the Social Security benefits for which Jack and Julie will one day be eligible when they retire. Yet the Tax Code doesn't adequately take into account the $700,000 they are investing into their own children and that those children will make it possible for couple B to receive their Social Security and Medicare benefits when they retire. That is why we need to fix the parent tax penalty.  The parent tax penalty consists of this unique interaction between our tax system and our senior entitlement programs and doesn't take into account the intense investment in financial terms that America's moms and dads make in their children.  By increasing the child tax credit, we could offset this penalty. One of the proposals out there would involve raising it to, say, $2,000 per child. I think that would be great. I could even go higher than that, but $2,000 wouldn't cover the whole problem, it wouldn't undo the whole penalty, but it would go a long way toward offsetting that. I would welcome that. That would be a good development. There are people just like Jack and Julie Jones all over this country who would benefit from that, and the American people as a whole would benefit from it. Social Security and Medicare would be more stable and made more sustainable by this change.  The next step we need to make with tax reform involves making the Tax Code more pro-worker. A lot of people criticize the Tax Code for the fact that it has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world at 35 percent. I believe that the best reform we could achieve would be substantial. There are a lot of people who are talking about reducing the corporate tax rate to maybe 15 percent or 20 percent. I hope we can get to something like that, and that would be a great first step. What I would really like to do is to bring that down not to 25 percent or 20 percent or 15 percent, I would like to see it brought down to zero. Let me explain why I believe that.  A corporation consists of and is animated by two things: capital and labor, investors and workers. Investors and workers join together and form partnerships to make profits. Both of them[[Page S6438]]pay a share of the corporate tax. In the United States, forces of globalization have benefited from this arrangement between workers and investors. The forces of globalization have benefited the investor class more than the workers. In this new global economic environment, we need to think about how to increase the returns to workers.  Globalization has helped the investors, and policy now needs to go out of its way to help the workers. One way to do that would be to eliminate the corporate tax altogether and tax investment income the same way we do regular income. That would shift the worker share of business tax to business owners. This would immediately do two things: It would give a raise to American workers, who really need it, and it would turn the United States into an irresistible magnet for foreign investment in the United States of In one stroke, the most profitable, favorable tax strategy in the global economy would be creating American jobs.  The current code gives preferential treatment to U.investors sending their money overseas. While this is their right to do, this is not something we should be incentivizing and pushing them into, which is exactly what the status quo does. Reform would give preferential treatment to international investors coming here, which is, after all, what we want. Let's level the national playing field between the working class and the investor class, while tilting the global playing field toward the United States rather than pushing it outward, away from our great country.  If these tax reforms could be set in motion through this budget or at least set in motion indirectly if not directly, the Tax Code would finally start working again for American families and finally start benefiting hard-working American mothers and fathers.  Another issue that we struggle with significantly in the Federal Government involves Federal regulations. This, too, is something we could start to address through the budgeting process. Our Federal regulatory system is economically damaging. This is something that strangles small business. It inherently--by its very nature, it inures disproportionately to the benefit of large, established, incumbent businesses, those that can afford an army of lawyers, accountants, lobbyists, and compliance specialists, that benefit from a heavy system of regulation, which is often made heavier still at the urging of the largest, wealthiest, most established companies because these Federal regulations provide a natural restriction on entry, a natural barrier that disincentivizes and in some ways disables would-be competitors from joining and entering into the marketplace. One thing we know about competition is that it brings down costs and it raises quality, and that is a good thing.  Federal regulations also create a sort of constitutional distrust. They themselves represent a harsh deviation from the natural constitutional order. I mentioned a few minutes ago the provisions of article Article I, section 1, and article I, section 7 require that Federal laws be passed by Federal regulations get around that.  Sometimes Congress chooses voluntarily to delegate to someone else the task that we, by operation of the Constitution, are supposed to perform and not to delegate to someone else. This administrative action makes things easier on occasion for Congress, but that is a bug, not a feature. The Constitution never was intended to make life easier for Members of  Let me explain how this happens and how it shows up here. It happens sometimes with good intentions. Congress wants to approach a particular issue, solve a particular problem without necessarily having to go into the difficult, painstaking, line-drawing process that inevitably is brought into question anytime we are trying to solve a problem through lawmaking. In other words, Congress will identify a problem and pass a law that says, for instance: We shall have a good law in area X, and we hereby delegate to agency Y the power to make and enforce rules carrying the force of generally applicable Federal law that will carry out the objectives we have outlined in our legislation.  In other words--let's get to something more approximating a real example. Congress, for instance, passes a law that says: We shall have clean air. We hereby delegate to the EPA the power to decide what clean air is, what pollution is, what acceptable limits on pollution might be, and what penalties will befall polluters. And then those same regulators, those same people at that same agency who made all the rules defining pollution and defining acceptable limits for pollution, prescribing penalties, they are the same people who also enforce them. You have the lawmakers who are also the law enforcers, and none of them are subject to an election.  Now, I don't mean to disparage the character or the capabilities of any of the fine people who work at the EPA or any of our other Federal bureaucracies. For the most part, these are well-intentioned, hard-working, well-educated, and highly specialized public figures or government employees, we might say, but there is a difference.  People in Congress are not magically empowered with any gifts for coming up with good legislation any more than any other American is, but there is a difference. We are elected, and we are subject to the people at regular intervals. You can fire your U.Senator every 6 years, you can fire your Representative every 2 years. You cannot fire a government bureaucrat. As Ronald Reagan said, the closest thing we see to eternal life on this Earth is a new government program. The closest thing you can find to a lifelong career is in government, in many government bureaucracies.  What this has produced is a profound proliferation of Federal law. We have been able to make more things Federal, and we have been able to make more Federal laws as a result of the fact that Congress now delegates away far more of its legislative power than it actually exercises. Let me explain what I mean.  I keep in my office two sets of documents. I welcome any of you to come by. In my office, we serve Jell-O every Wednesday at 3:30. For reasons I don't entirely understand, Utah consumes more Jell-O than any other State in the Union on a per capita basis.

They are not tainted with alcohol or anything like that, but we serve Jell-O every Wednesday at 3:30. You are all invited to join us any time you would like. If the Senate is in session and if it is Wednesday at 3:30, it is time for Jell- When you come by my office for Jell-O Wednesday, you will see two stacks of documents that I have represented in this graph. One stack of documents is a few inches tall, it is about 3,000 pages long, and it consists of the laws passed by Congress last year. The other stack is 13 feet tall, it is about 96,000 pages long, and it consists of last year's Federal  For those of you who are fortunate enough not to know what the Federal Register is--and I really do envy you--it is the annual index, the compilation of Federal regulations. First is their release for public notice and comment, and then later is their finalized Federal  These are laws. These are not just rules exclusively deciding what time the lights will go on and off at the Commerce Department or what times the gates will be staffed at this or that Many of these are regulations that impose affirmative obligations on the American people, sometimes with criminal penalties, often with substantial civil penalties attached to them, and yet they are not passed by anyone who is elected. In many cases, they are not even written by people who are accountable to anyone who is, in turn, elected. This is a problem.  During 2016, Congress enacted 214 laws; whereas, the agencies issued 3,853 rules. Those are 18 rules that were put in place by Federal agencies for every 1 law that was enacted by This is not without consequence. This is not just an abstract constitutional violation.  This costs the American people a lot of money, and it costs them money in a way that is kind of invisible. You have the Tax You have your pay stub. I showed you that chart earlier from Julie's pay stub showing how much the government takes out of each paycheck. That is visible. That is tangible. That is something she can see each week. There is another bite that[[Page S6439]]gets taken out of each and every one of her paychecks that is invisible, and that bite is taken out by these Federal regulations, meaning everything that Jack and Julie, everything that every one of you, everything that every American purchases, every good or every service is made more expensive by these Federal regulations. In fact, it is fair to say really that the costs of compliance with these Federal regulations are passed on disproportionately to America's poor and middle class who pay for those regulations through higher prices on goods and services, diminished wages, unemployment, and underemployment, and it is not insignificant.  Twenty years ago, when I first started studying this problem, I was shocked to learn that this backdoor, invisible, highly regressive form of tax--that is the cost of compliance with Federal regulations--stood at $300 billion a year. That was astounding to me, stunning. Today that number stands at about $2 trillion a year. In 20 years, we have seen the cost of complying with Federal regulations multiply nearly sevenfold. That is troubling.  If the cost of complying with U.Federal regulations were a country, if it were the GDP, the $2 trillion in compliance costs, that is roughly the same as the gross domestic product of India and The cost of complying with Federal regulations is slightly less than the GDP of India and slightly more than the GDP of That is sad, that is stunning, that is a constitutional problem, and it is a public policy problem. The 2016 Federal Register contains 95,894 pages--the highest level in its history and 19 percent higher than the previous year of 2015, which contained 80,260 pages.  In the absence of trust, we need an abundance of transparency, and that is what constitutional lawmaking is all about. We need to restore that constitutional order by passing reforms like the REINS Act, which would require congressional assent before major rules are put into place. It would require Congress to affirmatively enact a regulation into law before an economically significant regulation could take effect.  There are some other areas where we need transparency--in higher education and healthcare. These things appear to have little in common at the outset, and yet, in many ways, they have a lot in common in that they are two areas where there has been a lot of Federal involvement where there probably shouldn't be and where that Federal involvement has made things more opaque and less transparent and resulted in higher costs.  In higher education, I highlighted the need in the last Congress for reforms through my introduction of the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity Act, which would have opened up the accreditation process. Currently, the higher education system in America has been commandeered by the iron triangle, consisting of the U.Department of Education, Federal accreditation bodies, and institutions of higher education in this country. Unless you are part of that iron triangle, you can't really break into the higher education market because you can't get Federal higher education assistance.  As a result, things like apprenticeships, distance learning, massive open online courses--or MOOCs, as they are sometimes described--suffer. They get left out. The upshot is, if we reformed this area, we would have more opportunities to get postsecondary skills and training, we would lower the cost of higher education, we would save money for both borrowers and taxpayers alike, and we would have more people able to pursue their chosen vocation.  With healthcare, as in higher education, Federal influence is driving up prices while outcomes are flatlined. In 2009, Congress doubled down on what wasn't working when they passed The results were instability, lost coverage, new plans, higher premiums, and higher deductibles at the same time.  Meanwhile, you had a whole lot of concentration of market power in a few companies. The top 10 health insurance companies in 2008--the year President Obama was elected President--had combined profits of about $8 billion a year. Last year, that number skyrocketed to $15 billion a year. The difference was  ObamaCare made it easier for those companies to see their profits skyrocket, but they did so on the backs of America's poor and middle class. With ObamaCare, we also had the unsustainable expansion of Medicaid, a failed program we should be trying to rescue people from, not trap them in. We need to repeal and replace  As we look toward reform, a guiding principle should always be restoring the constitutional principal of federalism or some might call it localism or the principle of subsidiarity. The idea is that you should govern locally, as locally as possible. There is a reason for this. The Constitution requires it, but it is also the case that we all benefit when we follow that constitutional system. It allows more Americans to get more of the kind of government they want and less of the kind of government they don't want. Bad things happen when we ignore federalism, as we have over the last 80 years and increasingly so over the last decade. There are some examples of that.  One involves transportation. Our Interstate Highway System was created by the Federal Government in the 1950s under the leadership of President He acknowledged that for national security and interstate commerce reasons, it would be a good idea to have an interstate highway system. So we proposed--and Congress passed into law--a gasoline tax that would fund the establishment, the creation of an interstate highway system. The idea was always to hand that interstate highway system back over to the States after the project was completed, which it has been now since the 1980s. Yet we are still collecting a Federal gasoline tax--18.4 cents per gallon, to be precise. Yet that 18.4 cents per gallon still doesn't ever seem to be sufficient, even though the Interstate Highway System has been completed since the 1980s and even though, stunningly, you could maintain the existing Interstate Highway System for about 4 cents per gallon. So where is the rest of it going? Well, it is going to purely local projects: surface roads, bike paths, all sorts of other things, many of which might well be worthy but aren't necessarily Federal in nature.  Another example involves public land. A lot of people were surprised to learn this--especially people from the East--but the Federal Government owns and controls about 30 percent of the land in the United A lot of people in the East aren't aware of this because, in every State east of Colorado, the Federal Government owns less than 15 percent of the land. In no State west of Colorado does the Federal Government own less than 15 percent and, in many States like my own, that number is much larger. In fact, in my State, the State of Utah, the Federal Government owns 67 percent of the land.  Let's set aside the question, for a minute, of why the Federal Government needs to own that much land at all and why it needs to own 30 percent of the landmass in the United If it is going to own that much, why does it disproportionately own so much land in States like mine, especially when that harms people in States like mine?  You see, in Utah--this map shows Federal land. Anyplace you see white, that is non-Federal land. If you see any of these colors represented here, that is one type of Federal land ownership or another. Where you see color on this chart, that is where the Federal land is owned and controlled by the Federal Government and the local taxing authorities can't tax it. As a result, people have to go to the Federal Government for a ``Mother May I'' in order to even cross the property or utilize the property for some legitimate business or personal need, and the local taxing authorities can't tax it. This harms westerners disproportionately, and it is wrong. We need reform in this area.  We also need to get the Federal Government out of the business of thinking it needs to own this much land and into the business of thinking, if it is going to own that much, then it needs to allow taxing authorities to collect at least a rough equivalent of property tax.  Also, in the area of primary and secondary education, because public education is so important, the Federal Government needs to stay out of the K-12 education arena. In other words, what is taught in the K-12 classroom[[Page S6440]]needs to be decisions made by teachers in consultation with parents, principals, local school officials and, in some cases, State officials, not from Washington, That is not an appropriate decision to make from Washington, DC, unless you are talking about educational experiences perhaps in the District of Columbia or a U.territory or on a military base or something like that.  The Federal Government should have no role in K-12 public education. That is not our job. We have to remember the text of the 10th Amendment echoing the structure of the original Constitution: that powers not granted to Congress and not prohibited to the States are reserved to the States respectively or the people. That has to mean something. In order for it to mean something, there has to be some limit to what powers are, in fact, granted to the Federal  Over the last 80 years, we gradually drifted away from this idea. We concluded that every problem in society is a government problem and that every government problem is a Federal problem. That is wrong. That has harmed the American people.  We need to restore federalism, localism, and subsidiary. This will free the people of the tyranny they feel as the result of a lost election. At any given moment in America, there are people who are disappointed about the last election, especially so with House elections, Senate elections, and the occupant of the White At any given moment, the people who feel as if they are not well represented in Washington--either at the U.Capitol or at the White House or both--can be counted in the tens, if not hundreds of millions. We will end this tyranny if we return a lot of that power.  In other words, let's say someone living in Connecticut might not quite be on the bandwagon of ``make America great again.'' If they don't want to make America great again, they can want to make Connecticut great again. In other words, federalism allows more people in America to get more of the kind of government they want and less of the kind of government they don't want. It allows more people to have more of a say because local governments, while not perfect, are more responsive to their local constituencies. It better protects both the minorities and majorities. It lowers the temperature of our national politics. One of the reasons national politics have become so contentious is because everything has been centered in Washington, There is no reason it has to be that way. In fact, the Constitution says it should never be that way.  Finally, with regard to federalism, there are a few things that only the Federal Government can do. Those things include national defense, establishing a uniform system of weights and measures, coming up with a uniform system of laws governing immigration and naturalization and a uniform system of laws governing interstate and foreign trade or commerce. Those things that can be done only by Congress must be done well. When we are so busy doing the things we are not supposed to do, we fail to do those things that only we can do. That is yet another reason to restore federalism.  Then, whatever is left over, whatever remains, whatever we can't bring back, needs to be fixed. It needs to be made to work. Whatever we don't return to the States can be made more effective and more efficient, and we should do that.  The 1974 Budget Act, as I explained at the outset of my address today, is outdated. We have to reform it. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation use formulas that are opaque and unknown, that are effectively a black box. This is wrong, and we have to get rid of those.  That is one of the reasons I introduced the CBO Show Your Work Act, so they can't just tell us anymore: You can't know why we reached the conclusions we reached that have stunning implications for law and public policy.  From budget, to taxing, to spending policy and policymaking, the constant theme is inertia. One could argue that the consistent theme is nostalgia. We are stuck in that era of the Ford Pinto and the eight-track cassette player. Americans are being held back, not only by outdated policies but by a process that is out of date too.  We met the challenges of the 20th century with policies that met the moment, but we have to be constantly updating, constantly overseeing and tweaking and improving. Government may well move at the pace of a turtle, but it can move, nonetheless, and move it must because the only way to get to next is to focus on now.  In our increasingly personalized, customizable society and economy, government's obsession with centralization is making these things worse, not better. We need to govern locally and not nationally in every single instance. We need to empower individuals and local communities.  In Washington, we have to embrace accountability, especially the kind of accountability prescribed by the We can do better, but we have to first recognize the need to do so.  The budget is indicative of all the problems we face in It is also indicative of Congress's authority and its ability to create solutions. We can do this. We can. We must. And together, we will.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2105, the NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act of 2017, a bipartisan effort to help small businesses implement the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for Critical  I thank Mr.Webster for his work on the bill and all of my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for their support of the bill.  I would also like to thank Senator Schatz and my colleagues in the Senate for working to pass the companion version over there, which I hope that we can follow suit on here today.[[Page H7938]]  The NIST cybersecurity framework provides valuable guidance on cybersecurity best practices for organizations of all sizes, but small businesses often don't have the time or resources to figure out how to adapt it to their needs and implement it. This bill directs NIST to create clear guidelines, tools, and best practices specifically for small businesses so that they can protect their networked resources.  Most small businesses do not have significant IT departments. Some do not even have any dedicated information security personnel. Thus, they may be more at risk of cyber attack than large enterprises.  According to data released last month, 53 percent of American businesses of all sizes suffered a cyber attack in the past year. Of those, 72 percent spent more than $5,000 to investigate and recover. A 2016 report found that 42 percent of businesses suffered a cyber attack of some kind.  Incidents like these do not only hurt individual small-business owners, employees, and customers, they hurt American competitiveness.  In my district in the southwest suburbs of Chicago, there is a fourth-generation family manufacturing business that has suffered multiple sophisticated phishing attacks. The few times they have fallen victim to these attacks, the costs have been significant. The owners have told me that they would welcome guidance on affordable, off-the-shelf resources to strengthen their cyber defenses and let them get back to focusing on their business.  This is a story repeated across the country. That is why we must act, and we must pass this bill for our small businesses. The guidelines created under this bill, like the NIST framework, will be voluntary, so we won't be adding to the regulatory burden on small businesses. Instead, we will be offering them an opportunity to secure their networks so that they can compete on a level playing field.

The SBIR and STTR programs have helped countless innovative small businesses grow jobs through American ingenuity. This bill will make these programs work even better by providing small businesses with additional tools for bringing innovations to market. Better SBIR and STTR programs mean more successful small businesses and more jobs.  I especially want to thank my colleagues for supporting inclusion of two provisions that I put forward in committee.  First, the bill increases the amount of money that grant recipients are allowed to spend on business and technical services, like market research, intellectual property protection; or participation in entrepreneurial training programs, like the highly successful Innovation Corps program. This helps small businesses, especially startups, use their funds where they know they are needed most, for technical assistance, creative approaches to problem solving, and other types of guidance needed in today's complex marketplaces.  Second, this bill expands the highly successful Phase 0 Proof of Concept Partnership pilot program, which I helped create at the National Institutes of Health in a previous SBIR reauthorization. This highly successful program provides the earliest funding for researchers exploring the possibility of turning their research into a viable medical product.  After just 2 years in operation, the three hubs created by the NIH program have filed 30 patent applications, negotiated 14 technology licenses, formed 7 companies, and have 70 promising technologies in the pipeline.  This bill extends the Phase 0 program for another 5 years at NIH and expands it to the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Department of In doing so, we will be giving a needed boost to more researchers who are budding entrepreneurs who will create the jobs of tomorrow.

Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support of 920, the National Clinical Care Commission 920, as was mentioned already, creates a commission comprised of clinical endocrinologists, other physician specialists, primary care physicians, healthcare professionals, patients, and representatives from the Federal agencies most involved in diabetes care.  The commission is charged with making recommendations to streamline Federal investments in diabetes, to improve the coordination and clinical care outcomes for people with diabetes, prediabetes, and other insulin-related metabolic and autoimmune diseases.  Passage of this legislation will help the Nation undertake more and innovative approaches to diabetes and its disease complications, for which the United States spends some $322 billion annually.  I urge the Secretary also to move expeditiously to set up the commission so it can begin its important work as soon as possible. Clinical training and expertise in diabetes and other insulin-related diseases will be needed to lead the commission, and it is my hope that a clinical endocrinologist will be chosen to serve as the chairperson of the commission. I think that is very important.  With a clinical endocrinologist as chair and representatives from other medical specialities, healthcare professions, and patient advocacy groups, serving alongside with Federal diabetes experts, the commission created under 920 will help to ensure that new innovative medications and devices are[[Page H7948]]effectively translated to the clinical setting for the benefit of patients.

654,topic-id,1806,"Madam President, I would like to begin by quoting David David Stockman was the head of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration. He wrote a famous book after his tenure running the Office of Management and It is called ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed.'' Let me read you a quote from David Stockman's book. This is what he says:       The hard part of the supply-side tax cut is dropping the      top rate--the rest of it is a secondary matter. . . . Then,      the general argument was that, in order to make this      palatable as a political matter, you had to bring down all of      the brackets. But, I mean, [the plan] was always a Trojan      horse to bring down the top rate.  I quote from David Stockman in his book ``The Triumph of Politics.'' He wrote about how President Reagan sold massive, deficit-busting tax cuts for the wealthy by making knowingly erroneous arguments, by making faulty economic arguments.  As we stand here on the Senate floor today, debating the Trump budget of 2017, we focus on what Mark Twain once said: History does not repeat itself, but it does tend to rhyme.  This looks very much like what Reagan tried to pull off in the early 1980s, to no avail, and his book is very clear as to why they were unsuccessful. The Reagan-era promises of economic growth and budget surpluses turned out to be massive debt and deficits. There is some kind of nostalgia, political nostalgia, for a Reagan era that never existed and, instead, a painting of a past that just has to be replicated today. Let's look at what David Stockman said he did and why it turned out so unsuccessful for President The Republicans are back again with a new budget, but they are using the same old bag of tricks and gimmicks from more than 30 years ago.  This is their plan, which is very simple, and it is identical: 1, claim unspecified funding cuts to many domestic programs many, many years in the future; 2, assume unrealistic growth from your policies that will magically balance the deficit; and finally, 3, use those questionable economic assumptions to provide massive tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations in our country.[[Page S6509]]  The budget we are debating today hits all of these points. It claims to balance the deficit, while in reality it is a blatant attack on the middle class for the benefit of these super rich.  First, let's start with the budgetary trick: unspecified cuts to domestic programs. Back in the 1980s, David Stockman called these ``magic asterisks,'' meaning that the Reagan administration would count the savings from these future cuts, but in reality, they would be someone else's problem to figure out at a later time.  Today, we are dealing with a budget containing more than $1 trillion in completely unspecified and unallocated funding cuts over the next decade--the magic asterisks, programs to be cut but not specified. Please vote for this budget, but do not take any responsibility, my Republican colleagues, for actually telling the American people what programs are going to get cut--the magic asterisks.  Second, we have the same unrealistic economic growth assumptions that Stockman referred to in the 1980s as a rosy scenario. That is what he called it.  Today, we are being told that tax cuts for the wealthy will magically grow the economy to the tune of an additional $1.2 trillion and will somehow pay for themselves. History taught us that tax cuts do not pay for themselves. It was not true under Reagan, and David Stockman, his budgetary expert, tells us this. It was not true under Bush, and it will certainly not be true under Donald Trump as well.  The Republicans forget recent history and continue to use these fairy tale economic assumptions for the same reasons they did in the 1980s. The tax cuts for the wealthy do not look completely irresponsible to the rest of the American people. Can we sell the American people once again on magic asterisks, on rosy scenarios, on unspecified cuts, on a budget that is balanced sometime in the future but is not the responsibility of these Members of the Republican conference at this time out on the floor of the Senate? Can we pull it off again? Can we fool the American people again? Can we hide our real agenda, which is to give a huge tax break to the wealthiest people in America?  In the same way that David Stockman called that the Trojan horse to get the tax break for the wealthy, so too have they built another budget as a Trojan horse to get the tax breaks without any of those specific cuts in programs that they know will be like touching political kryptonite. They are not going to lay out which programs are going to get cut at some point in the future.  That is why these tax cuts are irresponsible. The framework that Republican leadership has presented is devoid of details for what it will do to families. It doesn't specify what it will do for small businesses, and it is completely silent on how it will assist workers, who have been struggling for years to keep up with the rising costs of living.  What the Republican tax framework is crystal clear on is how it will benefit the wealthiest Americans and corporations. In fact, the tax framework released by the Republican leadership will send 80 percent of the benefits directly to the top 1 percent of the wealthiest individuals in this country--Ronald Reagan redux, David Stockman redux. And 80 percent of the benefits go to the upper 1 percentile. What did David Stockman say? ``But, I mean, [the plan] was always a Trojan horse to bring down the top rate.''  What we have now is a Republican Party genetically hard-wired in order to do the same thing that failed as an economic policy in the early 1980s. It was such a catastrophe and it was so bad that Republicans actually had to get together with Democrats in order to fix it after it went into effect.  This particular version of it will provide tax cuts for shareholders and It allows the richest 1 percent of all Americans to concentrate wealth to an even greater degree than they already can, while many middle-class families will actually see their tax bill go up. They want to take away the State and local tax deduction. We are going to see millions of Americans with an actual tax increase. They are the middle class. There is almost nothing in this bill that helps the middle three quintiles. From 20 percent to 80 percent, there is almost nothing in this bill that helps them.  They know it, by the way. They know what they are doing. They know that 80 percent of this is going to the upper 1 percentile. They know almost nothing goes to the middle three quintiles, and they also know they are going to take away the tax break for State and local deductions from those people as well. It is not a tax plan. It is a tax scam.  Despite their talk about how these tax giveaways for the rich will pay for themselves, the Republican tax plan will create a $2.4 trillion hole in the deficit. We know what Republicans and the Trump administration will do with those deficits. They will be used to go where the 1980s plan did not ultimately go, and that is to gut Medicare, to gut Medicaid, and to gut Social  Let's give them credit. In this bill, at least on Medicare and Medicaid, they actually do talk about these specific cuts. They actually talk about it. There is a $470 billion cut in You can hear that, grandma or grandpa. They are going to cut Medicare by $470 billion in this bill. I tell you one thing. Both grandma and grandpa may be old, but they are not stupid. They are not stupid. They know what you are doing. They are going to figure this out.  They want to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion, as well, for those tax breaks for the upper 1-percenters. There is your plan. It is pretty simple to understand. Grandma and grandpa are going to understand it. The American people are going to understand it. It is all toward the Trojan horse to get the tax break for the upper 1 percentile.  The recent report from the Democratic staff of the Senate Budget Committee found that the budget would also slash $5 trillion from critical programs like education and transportation. It is unspecified at this particular point in time because they know it would create a political nightmare for them. It would be ``nitro hits glycerin'' politically if they specify at this time where those cuts would come from.  Over the last 8 years, our friends on the other side of the aisle explained to us that the Federal deficits were the greatest threats facing our country. We couldn't invest in clean energy. We couldn't finance infrastructure. We couldn't do anything about healthcare or the people who need it in our country because of the threat to our national debt. Before that, we were famously told in the 2000s that deficits don't matter. Of course, that was after President Clinton's budgets in the 1990s put us on a path to a budget surplus.  Before that, David Stockman was convincing President Reagan that deficits were of no concern and should not get in the way of tax cuts for the wealthy. We have seen this movie before, and now, once again, it sounds like the present rhymes with the past.  We come back to the central erroneous premise of the Republican Party, which they continue to try to sell to the American people--that it is possible, simultaneously, to have massive tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent, to increase defense spending simultaneously and massively, and to balance the budget at the same time. It is not possible. The American people know it. They have seen it in the past. They are trying to run the same old movie past the American people, but it is all--in the immortal words of David Stockman--toward the goal of creating a Trojan horse to bring down the rates for the wealthiest people in That is the choice the American people are going to have to make.  This budget is a moral disgrace to be considered on the floor of the Congress--Medicare and Medicaid, a sacrifice for a tax break for the wealthiest people in our country. This is a shameful day in the history of this institution.  I yield back the remainder of my time.

That is when the Republicans can find a refuge. Unfortunately, it is the Arctic National Wildlife  But the Republican plan to offset $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for the superwealthy will only result in $1 billion being able to be raised from allowing the oil companies to drill in this pristine refuge. That plan neither makes any sense nor will it actually bring in any cents sufficient to pay for this[[Page S6444]]huge tax break and the deficit they are creating.  Maybe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think there is a different exchange rate above the Arctic Circle, but down here those numbers don't even come close to adding up. This is exactly the kind of polarizing politics we need to get away from--giveaways to Big Oil and billionaires at the expense of the American people and our planet.  There is a long, bipartisan history of fighting to protect the Arctic Refuge for future generations. It was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower who began this bipartisan legacy by setting aside the core of the Arctic Refuge in 1960. It was further protected by President Kennedy and Senator Tom Udall's father, Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall, during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Then, Representative Mo Udall succeeded in doubling the size of the Refuge, protecting even more of this untrammeled wilderness. Protecting this special place has always been an issue that rose above party lines, and it should continue to do so.  In 2015 the Interior Department recommended that Congress designate this area as wilderness and not open it to drilling. In making that wilderness recommendation, the Department of the Interior concluded that the ``Arctic Refuge exemplifies the idea of wilderness--to leave some remnants of this nation's natural heritage intact, wild, and free of the human intent to control, alter, or manipulate the natural order.''  The Coastal Plain is the biological heart of the The Fish and Wildlife Service has called it the ``center for wildlife activity'' in the It supports more than 250 species, including caribou, polar bears, and migratory birds, but that is exactly where this Republican legislation would allow Big Oil to drill, forever despoiling this ecosystem.  Two years ago, we lifted the four-decades-old ban on exporting American crude oil. As a result of that giveaway to the big oil industry, we are now exporting more U.crude oil--nearly 1 million barrels a day--than we could ever produce from drilling in the Arctic  We have a fracking revolution taking place in our country right now. We hear it over and over from President We hear it from the Republicans: There is a fracking revolution. We are on our way to energy independence. We should lift the ban on exporting oil out of the United We should start selling it around the world to the highest bidder. We have so much oil that we can afford to send it out of our own country. Don't worry about it; there is no problem with exporting American oil.  As a matter of fact, what the Trump administration also says is this: Don't worry about the fuel economy standards in We are going to start to review them so we can lower--lower--the goals for our country for making the vehicles that we drive in our country more efficient.  Where do we put the oil in our country? We put 70 percent into gasoline tanks. We don't have to be a detective to figure out what happens if, instead of having our cars continue to get more and more efficient in terms of reducing the amount of oil that we need, we have our standards get lower and lower, and, as a result, we need to consume more oil.  What does the Trump administration say? They say they are going to review the fuel economy standards. They are going to take a ``we can't do it'' stand. They are going to take an ``it's too hard to improve the economy standards'' stand. That is what they said for four decades: It is too hard.  But during the Obama administration they were able to put on the books a standard that moves America to 54.5 miles per gallon by the year 2025 in the United States of America--54.5 miles per gallon. That is where the plug-in hybrid revolution comes from. That is where the all-electric vehicle revolution comes from. That is where Elon Musk comes from. That is where all of these statements coming from the Chinese, the Indians, Volvo, and others come from. It is this movement toward plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles, reducing the amount of oil that we consume,--not just here in the United States, but around the globe.  What does the Trump administration say? We can't do it. It is too hard. We are going to review those standards. So they are saying: We don't have the technological capability to accomplish something that avoids the necessity of having to drill in a pristine wildlife refuge--to put a gasoline station on top of something that should be preserved for generations to come. They are saying: We can't improve the fuel economy standards. We are going to export 1 million barrels of oil a day. Guess what. We are going to go up into the Arctic Refuge in order to find the oil so that the gas guzzlers can stay on the road and so we can export oil to We are going to allow, finally, for the Big Oil cartel--which is now taking over the Department of the Interior, the Department of Energy, and the EPA--the ability to be able to despoil one of the last untrammeled, perfect, pristine areas in our country.  That is just fundamentally wrong, and we are going to have a vote on it on the floor of the Senate during this budget debate. To raise $1 billion total as they run up a deficit of $1.5 trillion, they despoil this sacred part of our country. It is immoral. It is wrong. It says that the Trump administration is handing over the keys of our government to the big oil companies. It is saying: No matter how many hurricanes hit our country, no matter how warm the water is off the coast of our country, they are going to remain in climate change denial--that it is really not a problem. Therefore, you don't have to increase the fuel economy standards. You don't have to reduce the fossil fuels going into the atmosphere. You don't have to worry. Climate change--ignore it. Fuel economy standards--we are not going to do it. What is the one thing we will do? For the oil industry, we are going to allow them to drill in the pristine Arctic wilderness. It is immoral--fundamentally immoral.  For 60 years, going back to Eisenhower, we figured out how to protect it. But now, at the height of a fracking revolution, with millions of new barrels of oil; at the height of an incredible plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicle revolution, as we are reducing the amount of oil we are consuming in our country; at the height of storms that are assaulting every part of our Nation with an intensity we have never seen in our history, the President says: I am going to ignore all of those issues and just focus upon what Big Oil wants.  This is going to be a monumental debate we will have on the floor of the Senate this week. I am looking forward to that debate because I think the American people are going to want to know who has voted which way on this critical environmental issue--the environment issue, in my opinion--which will be taken on the floor of the Senate this week and will be led by our great leader on energy and environment issues, Senator Maria Cantwell, from the State of She has been a clear, consistent, insistent voice on these issues.

1098,topic-id,1571,"Mr.President, having been away for a while from the Senate, I am pretty amazed to come back today and see a budget that is passed that throws away years of rhetoric about fiscal conservatism. The Senate just passed a budget that adds $1.5 trillion to our national debt, a budget that slashes seniors' healthcare by $473 billion. It decimates the Medicaid Program for parents and grandparents in nursing homes, those who are disabled, and those who are among the poorest, with cuts of over $1 trillion over the next decade.  In total, the Republican budget would cut more than $5 trillion over the next decade from education, healthcare, affordable housing, childcare, nutrition assistance, transportation, and other programs that all Americans rely on.  The question many New Jerseyans will be asking me is, Why? Why do Republicans in Congress add $1.5 trillion[[Page S6631]]to our national debt while slashing the Medicare Program? The answer is simple. We are on a pathway to provide massive tax breaks to corporate interests, special interests, and the wealthiest 1 percent. This has been a Republican agenda for as long as I can remember.  What I find most galling is that this budget plan is meant to set up a special process that we know here as reconciliation to pass the Trump tax plan--a plan, which, by which their own admission, will raise taxes on middle-class families. Think about that. The Republican Party is adding $1.5 billion to the debt to pay for massive tax breaks for the wealthiest among us--I should say trillion, $1.5 trillion to the debt to pay for massive tax breaks for the wealthiest among us. They aren't even guaranteeing that middle-class taxes will not go up.  What the Republican budget fails to realize is that budgets are not just about numbers. Budgets are about people, their hopes, their dreams, their expectations for a better life for themselves and their children.  My view is that this budget sells America short. It is not what the American people believe our collective values would be. Hard-working families want us to work together and pass a budget that addresses their concerns. They want safe communities, not a budget that threatens to cut the firefighter grants and stretches local budgets even thinner. They want peace of mind when they reach their golden years, not a budget that raises their healthcare costs. They want a tax proposal that cuts taxes for the middle class and working people, not more tax breaks for the folks that have been rigging the system against us.  People are willing to do their part if everyone is sharing in the sacrifice. But this budget fails that test. It fails to recognize that we are all in this together and should benefit together and sacrifice together--each of us working for the betterment of all of us.  Mr.President, another area where it is critical that we come together, not as 50 separate States but as the United States of America, is to help the 3.5 million American citizens living in Puerto I have serious concerns that the current disaster relief package currently being considered by Congress falls far short of that.  Tomorrow will mark 1 month since Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Puerto Rico, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction, despair, and suffering. It is 1 month later, and still 88 percent of our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico don't have power. It is 1 month later, and still one-third of the island lacks access to clean, safe drinking water.  Outside of the city of San Juan, the situation is even worse, as nearly two-thirds of people still remain without water. Let me just pause for a moment to think about that. Think about it: an entire month without clean water, without water to bathe, to cook with, or simply to drink. How many of us can even imagine such an existence? More than half of the island's cell towers are down, which is not just an inconvenience. It is a threat to safety. Imagine the sense of isolation and desperation when your power is out, when you have run out of potable water, with none on the way, and you can't even call for help.  As bad as it looks on TV, the situation on the ground, as I saw it, is tragically worse. I am concerned that the package we are considering now is both inadequate in scope and unfair in treatment--inadequate because it is just a fraction of what Puerto Rico needs to recover, unfair because it treats the people of Puerto Rico different than Florida and Texas, even though they are U.citizens.  While all three areas have been devastated by natural disasters, only Puerto Rico is being required to pay back natural disaster assistance. That is right. Unlike Florida and Texas, the majority of Puerto Rico's assistance is coming in the form of a loan. While there are a lot of things that the people of Puerto Rico need from their Federal Government, one thing they absolutely do not need and simply cannot afford is billions of dollars of more debt.  This is not a normal disaster loan. Just like everything else with Puerto Rico, this loan comes with a major stipulation. While disaster loans are normally forgiven according to a standard formula under the Stafford Act, this package overrules longstanding law and leaves the decision entirely in the hands of the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland  While disaster loans are normally used to help people be safe and start the recovery process, this legislation gives the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Security the authority to control how Puerto Rico spends the money. If Secretary Mnuchin decides that some, most, or even all of the loan should be used to pay off his friends on Wall Street, there is nothing Puerto Rico can do to stop him. If he decides that debt bondholders are more important than those who are suffering in darkness, there is nothing they can do to stop him. Instead of being treated like the rest of the country, Puerto Rico is left at the mercy of Treasury Secretary They are at the mercy of someone who made his fortune off the backs of seniors and hard-working families who lost their homes in the foreclosure crisis.  Do we really think that someone who callously rejected the pleas of struggling families to save their homes and instead put them on the fast track to foreclosure is going to suddenly change now for the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico? Does anyone really believe he is going to put the people of Puerto Rico first? What a tragedy it would be if, instead of helping our most vulnerable citizens, this loan was used to pay off, in whole or in part, vulture funds. We need people saved, not bondholders.  We need a response that answers Puerto Rico's call. Instead of continuing to treat Puerto Rico like a foreign country and make them start a tab at the U.Treasury while they are vulnerable and pleading for help, we need to treat them just like their fellow American citizens in Florida and We need to provide unconditional assistance--real dollars to rebuild roads, the electrical grid, and to put people back in their homes and businesses. We need to address the massive Medicaid cliff that is forcing even more doctors and nurses off the island and threatening the health of the people of Puerto We need strong protections to make sure that the disaster relief stays with the people of Puerto Rico, where it is needed the most.  Let me close by saying that I grew up believing the United States was the greatest country the world had ever seen. I still believe that today as strongly as ever. Ultimately, our response as it relates to the people of Puerto Rico is not just about the people of Puerto Rico but about all of us. It is about our values--who we are as a people, who we are as a nation. How we respond to this crisis will test the collective conscience of our Nation, and it will define us.  As I have said many times, I have never shied away from voting for assistance for flooding in Mississippi, for wildfires in the West, for hurricanes like Katrina, and any other natural disaster that has faced our country with our fellow I was amazed when I had to struggle and fight here on the Senate floor for the first time--I don't know--in my lifetime to get assistance in the New York-New Jersey area after Superstorm It took a major fight, with people voting no, even though I had always voted yes.  The people of Puerto Rico do not have a U.Senator to cast their vote for them or to raise their voices for them. Yet, as long as I am a Member of this Chamber, I am going to continue to prick the conscience of the Senate to understand that when we walk to the Vietnam wall and see those names, a disproportionate number of them are Americans of Puerto Rican descent, who wore the uniform, gave their lives, and made the ultimate sacrifice. They did not leave the conflict early; they gave it their all. We cannot leave them early, nor should we leave them short.  I yield the floor.

644,topic-id,1560,"Mr.President, our Nation was founded on a principle encapsulated in the first three and most important words of our Constitution: ``We the People.'' Our Founders wanted to have a nation that didn't work for the benefit of the powerful and the privileged, but for decisions of the people, by the people, and for the people, as President Lincoln so eloquently described our He did not describe a nation by and for the powerful, not a nation by and for the privileged, but by and for the people.  Tomorrow, a bill is coming to the floor that couldn't be more of a ``by and for the powerful'' bill than we have seen on the floor of the Senate before. It is a bill completely contrary to the fundamental values embedded in our  This bill is a budget bill, and at its heart, it says: We are going to do $5 trillion of tax cuts almost completely for the richest Americans, and we are going to do so by gutting programs that make America work for working  The President said: When it comes to tax reform, I want to help the middle class; I am not going to do anything for the rich and powerful.  Then why, I ask you, is this bill coming to the floor of the Senate completely for the rich and powerful?  President Trump, come before the American people and explain how you can make a promise that you are going to do tax reform for the middle class and then put a bill on the floor of the Senate that is all about benefits--raiding the National Treasury--for the rich and powerful. How do you explain this complete opposite?  What a complete pretense we have, to say this bill is about helping American workers when it is all about the rich and powerful.  The Republican budget plan not only has $5-plus trillion, virtually all in tax giveaways, a raid on the National Treasury for the rich and powerful, but it proceeds to cut healthcare for older Americans, a cut of $1 trillion in Medicaid for working There will be a lot of damage done to ordinary Americans who just want peace of mind that when their loved one gets sick, when their loved one gets injured, they will get the care they need. Is peace of mind too much to ask of our national healthcare system? Are my colleagues so callous, so out of touch, so cruel that they want to fund tax cuts for the richest Americans by destroying healthcare and diminishing healthcare for our seniors?  It is not just our seniors, it is our citizens on In Oregon, it is the Oregon Health It serves the poorest among us, many of them working part-time jobs that have no healthcare plan, many of them working shifts that are determined at the last second. Some of the most stressful jobs in America are at the very bottom, some of the most stressful work schedules are at the very bottom, and we are going to cut not just $1 trillion from Medicaid but half a trillion from  Let's look at the other programs that would be devastated by this Republican budget in order to fund that $5 trillion in tax cuts, almost all for the wealthiest  The Senate Budget Committee Democratic staff said that if those cuts in the Republican budget are extended evenly, distributed reductions, it would have the following impact: It would eliminate housing assistance for more than 1 million families. It would eliminate heating assistance for nearly 700,000 seniors on fixed incomes. It would eliminate nutrition assistance by more than $100 billion--a 33-percent cut. In other words, to translate that, there would be a lot more hunger in an already hungry It would slash Pell grant funding by more than $100 million, eliminate Head Start services for 25,000 children in an average year, cut mandatory transportation funding by $200 billion, cut funding for the National Institutes of Health by $37 billion--all to give a massive tax giveaway to the richest  If the President is proceeding to say that this is a plan for the middle class, then we would expect virtually all the benefit to go to the middle class, but what do we actually have? Four out of five dollars of benefits go to the top 1 percent, and 40 percent of that goes to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. Why should there be one single penny going to the very richest Americans in a nation in which we should be striving for a foundation for every family to thrive?  We know that to thrive, our children have to have food to eat, we need to have healthcare programs that create peace of mind, and we need to make sure our seniors have a strong foundation in their retirement, but instead we see all those programs--including the opportunity for college and Pell grants--being raided for this massive giveaway to the top 1 percent.  President Trump, come before the American people and explain how it is possible that you can claim you are doing a plan for middle-class America, and you are sending virtually the entire benefit to the top 1 percent of  This budget resolution's associated tax plan is one of the most egregious examples of rigging the system of America for the powerful and privileged rather than a government of, by, and for the people.  I am here today to stand up and say: Not one penny to the top 1 percent. If you want a fair plan for America, it would be not one penny to the top 1 percent. If you want a plan that strengthens the middle class, there would be not one penny to the top 1 percent. Not one penny for billionaires while we gut Medicare and Not one penny for billionaires when middle-class families' taxes will go up under this plan. Not one penny for our billionaires while we destroy programs, safety nets, and opportunities for education, from Head Start to Pell grants to attend college.  We could do a great deal of good to invest in We could invest in transportation. We have an incredible number of bridges and roads that need repairs. We can put an incredible number of people to work building middle-class jobs and middle-class incomes through building infrastructure instead of a giveaway of the National Treasury to the top 1 percent. By investing more than $1 trillion, we can create millions of good-paying American jobs.  There are more than 56,000 bridges in One out of eleven is structurally deficient. Engineers estimate that we could easily spend $123 billion on repairing bridges and $420 billion modernizing highways and that we would get a return back to our economy, with lower vehicle maintenance, decreased delays, lower fuel consumption, improved safety, lower long-term maintenance costs, lower emissions--all benefits of investing in transportation, in addition to the fact that it will strengthen our economy.  We can think about the investment we need to make in our water infrastructure, the water supply systems and certainly wastewater treatment--a problem in virtually every town across What about all those lead pipes that need to be replaced? Two thousand years ago, the Romans were poisoned by their own water because they lined their aqueducts with lead, and here we are, 20 centuries later, poisoning our citizens with lead pipes. Why aren't we spending money to take care of that problem? It is not just a problem in Flint; it is a problem in hundreds of cities across this country.  If we want America to thrive, why not invest in rural broadband? Why not create high-speed broadband in every rural town and village across this Nation, which would strengthen that economy, which would give people the ability to build their businesses in smalltown, rural America, instead of spending trillions of dollars in tax giveaways to the very richest Americans?  How about an investment in our students--not decreasing Pell grants but strengthening Pell grants to make it possible for more people to attend college without ending up with a debt the[[Page S6500]]size of a home mortgage? It is a real possibility to create debt-free college in our public universities. Why don't we do that? That will strengthen the foundation for every family to thrive.  Good jobs, good education, good infrastructure, not a theft from the American Treasury of $4 trillion to $5 trillion for the very richest Americans--that is what is being proposed here. Has there ever been a train robbery as audacious as this theft of the National Treasury for the richest Americans? Has there ever been a bank robbery as audacious and outrageous as this theft of the American Treasury for the richest 1 percent of Americans?  Here on the floor, we should be wrestling with how to create a foundation for every family in America to thrive, not considering a bill that wipes out healthcare, wipes out Pell grants, does damage to every conceivable thing that would make this Nation stronger in order to give the billionaires more zeroes in their bank accounts.  This bill is destructive, it is shameful, and it is contrary to the very principle of our Constitution of government of, by, and for the people. This bill is government of, by, and for the 1 percent. It must not stand.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-10-18-pt1-PgS6492-3.txt,1900,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,18.0,October

There are reports that decertification may come as early as tomorrow, and I certainly hope so.  The Iran nuclear deal was a giant mistake. It has been bad for America's national security, bad for our ally Israel's national security, and bad for the world.  By decertifying the flawed Iran nuclear deal before October 15, the administration has a chance to send a strong message that the United States will not sit idly by while the Iranian threat continues to grow.  The deal was premised on a naive notion that Iran would somehow evolve into a peaceful global partner, but that couldn't have been further from the truth. Make no mistake about it: Iran is not our friend, does not share our values, and should not have been trusted.  For decades, Iran has called the United States the Great Satan, and their leadership continues to call for the total annihilation of our ally Iran remains the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world and is actively working towards obtaining a nuclear bomb.  This much is clear: Iran has not upheld the spirit of this deal. Now is the time to reassert our authority on the world stage and hold Iran accountable.

It is not only good from a policy perspective to ensure that we don't pull out the underpinnings on the individual market here, but it is good, from the perspective of the health of our institution, to be able to demonstrate that, at a time when things are a little tense, let's just say, on issues that are highly emotional, highly personal, and highly, highly complex, we can come together and we can demonstrate the ability to govern. It doesn't come without great patience and persistence, and these two individuals, these two leaders, have really helped guide us here in the Senate to find a better path, not only when it comes to how we deal with access to healthcare, reducing costs, reducing premiums, and providing for better levels of care but also a better path for the  So I want to acknowledge and show my genuine appreciation for their leadership.  Mr.President, as chairman of the Energy Committee, I come to the floor today to urge every Member here to vote against amendment 1301, which will be voted on later on this afternoon.  The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution instructs the Energy Committee to raise $1 billion over the next decade. That is all that it does. It just says: Go out and find $1 billion over the next decade.  I appreciate Chairman Enzi's willingness to include this instruction, and I have every confidence that our committee will be able to meet the instruction. There are good reasons why we should be able to meet it, and, really, very good reasons why we should oppose an amendment that would preemptively strike it.  I think it is fair to say that we have opportunities within the energy sector to help advance this country when it comes to our energy security, our national security, and our economic security. But we need to be able to move forward with that.  So what we are able to do within this instruction, which is pretty wide open, is to focus on those areas where we might be able to see increased energy production that could bring us new wealth--that could create new wealth in this country.  I am going to be the first to agree that some of our options within this open instruction are better than others. Some will create jobs. Some may end jobs. Some will reduce energy costs as opposed to raising them. Some will increase our energy and mineral security as opposed to sacrifice or selling it off.  What I hope Members will do is look at this instruction as an opportunity to do something constructive for the country. The best example of that is to expand energy development in our Federal areas where we have seen decline in recent years.  I think we recognize that responsible development not only will reduce our immediate deficits, but it is about jobs and job creation. It is about wealth and wealth creation, about allowing us to build new wealth and create prosperity. It will help energy affordability for our families and businesses. That is something I hear about all the time. It will strengthen our national security and our competitiveness.  This is a point that needs to be emphasized over and over again. It is not only energy security, but it is national security. When we are dependent on other nations for our energy resources, there is an energy insecurity and vulnerability. We also realize energy production will ensure the type of growth we need to finally begin reducing the Federal debt, which is now over $20 trillion.  In short, what we will be able to do with this energy instruction is allow us to create new wealth. Why wouldn't that be something we would all embrace? I think the instruction will allow us to see some enduring benefits that will be felt all across our country. I think it is important to recognize and to state that this does not come at the expense of our environment. This is not an either/or proposition. Anyone familiar with modern development can recognize that as the scare tactic it is.  Senator Sullivan, my colleague from the State of Alaska, was on the floor earlier this morning, and he spoke to the outdated, stale arguments we have heard repeated on the floor and why we must reject them.  The amendment we have in front of us, 1301, simply strikes the section in the resolution that would provide for the Energy Committee instruction. The purpose perhaps takes it a little bit further in mentioning and bringing out the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, There has been a lot of discussion on the floor about ANWR already.  Senator Sullivan, when he spoke earlier, spoke to the broader opportunities we have seen in the Arctic with Arctic development in general. I want to raise a few facts about ANWR more specifically, since it clearly has been put out there for discussion.  As an Alaskan, and one who has been part of these debates for many years now, not only on the Senate floor but in Alaska, we know what we are talking about when we discuss the issue of Arctic development. We know and understand what ANWR is, where the wilderness area is, and what the 1002 area is.  I think it is important to put it into context. ANWR is an area of 19.3 million acres. It is about the size of the State of South Included in this ANWR area are 8 million acres of Federal wilderness. You have wilderness area, you have refuge area, but you have nonwilderness area designated as the 1002 area. That is this area on the coastal plain. This is an area of 1.5 million acres. Delaware is about 1.3 million acres. The 1002 area is what was specifically set aside under ANILCA that would allow for consideration for its oil and gas potential. When ANWR was established, it was recognized that there were areas that were appropriate for wilderness, and there were areas that were appropriate to be reviewed and considered for their exploration and production potential.  That is what we are talking about within the 1002 area. Even within this area that was specifically set aside, we are not asking to develop all of the 1002. We are asking to develop just 2,000 Federal acres within it, effectively one ten-thousandths of the refuge area.  You can't see it, but that little red dot is basically what we are talking about. We can say this. We can say we don't need to do more than 2,000 acres, in this 19.3 million-acre area that has been set aside specifically for oil and gas production, because of what has happened over the decades with regard to our technologies, how we have worked to reduce the footprint since Prudhoe Bay opened over 40 years ago. Well pads on the North Slope have shrunk by over 80 percent in these intervening years. We are talking now about pad areas that are 12 acres in size--10, 11, 12 acres in size.  We have reduced the footprint dramatically, but what we have expanded[[Page S6610]]dramatically is the subsurface reach. The new technologies have allowed us to increase the ability to reach out under the surface to an area 125 square miles--125 miles. We have increased it by 4,000 percent, in the years we have been producing, exploring, and innovating up north, due to the technologies we use for exploration. Senator Sullivan showed the ice roads we use that reduce the impact on the surface and avoid the need for permanent roads.  We use forward looking infrared cameras to survey for polar bear dens so we can avoid them. There was actually a story just this spring about a polar bear that was denning. We found where she was by using the technologies that we know and literally working around where that polar bear was until she emerged from her den with her cub in the spring. It is working with the technologies we have to allow for the activity but with minimal disturbance to not only the land but to the wildlife there.  We all know about the caribou in the North Slope area. What we have learned is that over the years, the caribou that occupy these areas have not suffered. In fact, they have thrived. When oil development first began, we were looking at herds in the numbers of about 5,000. Just this last year, the caribou herd is numbering about 22,000, and it has maintained steady and substantial levels.  When you understand what the 1002 area really is and what development would actually look like, it is not hard to understand why you have Alaskans' support. Over 70 percent of Alaskans support responsible development there.  I want to give you one of the best examples. Matthew Rexford is the president of Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, KIC, which is a member of the Voice of the Arctic This is a group of community leaders from our North He wrote a great opinion piece not too long ago, explaining why he supports responsible development in the 1002 area.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Matthew Rexford's op-ed.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, 2, 2017]                  Alaskans Say Yes to Drilling in ANWR                          (By Matthew Rexford)       The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the largest wildlife      refuge in Spanning more than 19 million acres, it's      an area larger than 10 U.states. This vast expanse is home      to caribou, fox, bears and other species. Much of that land      is also home to the Native Inupiat, and our people have used      the resources it has blessed us with for more than 10,000      years. One of those natural resources lies beneath this great      land--oil and gas, and lots of it.       The debate over opening ANWR to drilling gained headway      nationally in 1980, when President Jimmy Carter set aside      less than 8 percent of the refuge for potential oil and gas      development. This section of ANWR became known as the 1002      area, after a section of the Alaska National Interest Lands      Conservation       Since then, Alaskans and the oil and gas industry have      fought unsuccessfully to open the 1002 area to drilling,      which literally requires an act of At the same      time, Lower 48 lawmakers, special interest groups across the      country, folks and organizations around the world have waged      war on the idea, citing the disruption of wildlife and the      pristine Arctic environment.       As ANWR debates occur, the views of the Inupiat who call      the area home are oftentimes left out. The wishes of the      people who live in and around the refuge's coastal plain      frequently are drowned out by people who live hundreds--even      thousands--of miles away, many of whom have never bothered to      set foot anywhere near the Well, today is a new day.       Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, an organization with 21      members from across the Arctic Slope region, including      members from Kaktovik located inside ANWR, have voted      unanimously to pass a resolution supporting oil and gas      development in the 1002 area. This is an unprecedented show      of unity by community leaders of the North Slope--those who      live in and around the coastal plain of the refuge--and      should send a clear message to America that we support      development of a portion of the coastal plain.       My fellow Inupiat and I firmly believe in a social license      to operate, and perhaps no other potential project in the      history of America has called for such a blessing from local      indigenous peoples more than this one.       When oil was first discovered on our land in 1969, the      Inupiat were worried of industry activities and fought hard      for self-determination to protect our subsistence resources.      So we fully understand the trepidation from outsiders: the      fear that the presence of industry on the coastal plain of      ANWR could disrupt wildlife and affect America's manufactured      perspective of our land and culture.       However, we also have the benefit of decades of experience      working with the oil and gas industry to implement stringent      regulations to protect our lands, and the industry      consistently has lived up to our standards. Prudhoe Bay, the      largest oil field on the continent, located 60 miles west of      the coastal plain of ANWR, has demonstrated for four decades      that resource development and ecological preservation can      coexist in the       The oil and gas industry supports our communities by      providing jobs, business opportunities and infrastructure      investments, has built our schools and hospitals, and has      provided other basic services most Americans may take for      granted. Our region recognizes its importance to our local      and state economy, and we believe that development can be      done responsibly in a portion of the 1002 area. We are not      alone.       During the past 35 years, the Alaska Legislature has      consistently passed resolution after resolution supporting      the opening of ANWR to drilling. During that same time, each      Alaska member of Congress and every Alaska governor has      supported responsible development of the 1002 area.       More recently, in January, U.Lisa Murkowski      introduced Senate Bill 49--the Alaska Oil and Gas Production      Act--to allow development of 2,000 surface acres in the      refuge's coastal plain. This legislation served as the      catalyst for the Inupiat people coming together to make an      informed, united decision on whether or not to support      drilling in       As Inupiat, we stand to be unarguably the most affected by      oil and gas activity in the Therefore, we have the      greatest stake in seeing that any and all development keeps      our land and subsistence resources safe. We know it can be      done, because it's being done.       Now is the time to open ANWR to drilling.

I am with Matthew and a strong majority of Alaskans are. These are the voices we need to be listening to. My answer on this discussion is yes. Opening the nonwilderness 1002 area to development is an option to meet the instructions to the Energy Committee, but it is not the only option. I will tell you, it is the best option, and it is on the table.  We should be clear, amendment 1301 is not a vote to open the 1002 area or to keep it closed. It is about whether this instruction should stay in the budget resolution, and it is about whether we are going to recognize the substantial benefits that await us or whether we are going to ignore our future energy needs and once again wind up in a situation where we see prices rising, families hurting, and everyone is wondering: Why didn't you act when you had a chance?  I think we all recognize that we are enjoying some benefits of lower energy prices, and some have suggested here: Hey, we are all fine. We don't need to do anything. A few have even said that[[Page S6611]]because we are exporting oil now, we don't need to do more for ourselves here. It is truly an open invitation to ignore the supply side. That is just a bad idea. Quite honestly, we have been down that road before, and we know enough not to be in that place again.  The EIA, the Energy Information Administration, projects that in 2040, the world will be using more oil, not less. They project that our country will still be importing about 7 million barrels a day on a net basis. They project prices will be back above $100 a barrel. There are other experts who are already pointing to other signs. The International Energy Agency recently found that ``global oil supply could struggle to keep pace with demand after 2020, risking a sharp increase in prices, unless new projects are approved soon.''  My point here is we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity not only to help America create jobs, to allow for opportunities not only in my home State but around the country, we have an opportunity to ensure a level of energy security while at the same time broadening this to enhance our national security.  So what I am asking my colleagues today is to not preempt this very important conversation. Give us a chance to consider this instruction within our committee. We will have an opportunity for hearings, and we will be able to put these options out on the table and understand more fully how we can do more when it comes to energy production in this country. Let the Energy and Natural Resources Committee do its part in helping. Let's not pull the plug even before we get going.  Given everything that we have heard here on the floor about strengthening our economy and protecting the middle class and making life better for people whom we serve, I think we really have to ask the very legitimate question: Why? Why would one leave energy out of this debate? Why would we limit our opportunity to create new wealth in this country?  I would again urge the Senate to reject this amendment. It would deprive us of a substantial opportunity to benefit our country and ensure that we have great prospects and possibilities in front of us.  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee wanted to see this instruction in the budget resolution. I have every confidence that we can meet it, so I would urge Members to vote no on the motion to strike when that comes up later today.  I yield the floor.

Those who support this amendment will deny us the opportunity to do something constructive in this country when it comes to our opportunities to produce energy, to produce wealth.

We can and we must do more as a nation to responsibly develop our resources, our energy resources providing economic security, energy security, and national security.

142,topic-id,773,"Mr.President, first I thank Chairman Alexander for his leadership in launching a bipartisan process, as well as his dedication to seeing it through and getting a result, as he said.  I have to say that, after 7 years of intense partisanship on these issues, which would lead everyone to believe that there was no hope for Republicans and Democrats to come together and work to strengthen our healthcare, I am really pleased with this common ground we have been able to find, providing multiple years of certainty when it comes to payments to reduce out-of-pocket costs that affect the people Senator Alexander just talked about--the waitress, the songwriter, and people who care and need this--restoring critical investments, making sure people know about enrollment and can get coverage, and offering States more flexibility to innovate, as the Affordable Care Act intended, while maintaining those essential health benefits, like maternity care, protecting people with preexisting conditions, and the elderly. It does all this while making sure that costs do go down for our families and preventing insurers from double-dipping and getting the benefit of both cost reduction and higher premiums. If there are ways to do this even more, to make sure patients come first and insurers can't pad their profits, I, as I know Senator Alexander is, as well, am open to that.  Chairman Alexander just took some time to lay out the policies we are putting forward in this legislation. So I will not go into those details. But I do want to take a few minutes to focus on what this legislation would mean for the people we are all here to serve because what is really at stake is that patients and families across the country are now looking ahead to next year, and they are realizing they are about to pay the price for the uncertainty and partisanship we have seen, especially from this administration, on healthcare over the last 9 months.  To many of those families, that out-of-pocket cost-reduction payment we are debating in Congress has nothing to do with politics and has everything to do with whether they will be able to make ends meet at the end of the month. Now the law is very clear that these payments are required, but with the President's decision to stop them, families are looking to this Congress and the administration and asking what we plan to do.  So I am very glad that Democrats and Republicans agreed that we need to act. We could do much better working together under regular order rather than doubling down on partisanship and dysfunction. As a result of the hard work of Chairman Alexander and members of our HELP Committee and with input from half of the Senate, we were able to put forward an answer--a bipartisan solution that prevents families from paying the price of sabotage and uncertainty and one that Members on both sides of the aisle can be proud to support, starting with the list of original cosponsors we are revealing today. Senator Alexander listed the 12 The 12 Democrats are Senators Murray, King, Shaheen, Donnelly, Klobuchar, Heitkamp, Franken, Manchin, Carper, Baldwin, McCaskill and  We are doing this today not only because it will help protect our families from premium spikes that are set to kick off in the next year but because it sends a powerful message that, when Members of Congress decide to get past our talking points and take a few steps out of our partisan corners, there is a lot we can agree on and a lot we can get done.  Chairman Alexander and I are going to continue to make the case for this agreement. We are already getting a promising response from many Members on both sides of the aisle. I am very appreciative of Senator Schumer for his strong support and I am optimistic that, with Chairman Alexander working on this, we will continue to build momentum and, as he said, we will get this done.  At the end of the day, this isn't about Republicans or It is about doing the right thing for the people we serve. That means having an answer to the premium spikes that are going to set in and burden our families next year. We have been able to find one. It is bipartisan. We both gave on this. I really hope all of our colleagues will work with us to get this signed into law and show the American public that we can get the job done for them and we understand the priorities of this country.

The one issue we did not disagree on but we worked the hardest on and had the most discussion on was how we make sure we have the language in place on this--that consumers benefit and it is not a bailout for insurers. We absolutely share that point, and I know we both heard from Members on both sides of the aisle that they share that point.  We have strong language in here, but we are still open together to make it stronger under anybody's suggestion because our intent is to make sure our constituents get the result of this. We are together on that and working on that. I, absolutely, disregard anyone who says this is a bailout for insurers because they haven't read the bill, if they have seen it.

224,topic-id,149,"Mr.President, Republicans have now put forward proposal after proposal to rip protections away from Americans with preexisting conditions. This amendment is yet another example of Republican efforts to increase costs for people who need healthcare the most. It would put insurance companies back in charge. It would allow them to deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions or discriminate against them by charging higher premiums.  This repeals the essential health benefits, rips away access to critical services like maternity care, mental health, and substance use disorder treatment, and repeals the requirement that coverage be available to dependents under the age of 26.  Americans have rejected this crass partisan proposal.

646,topic-id,1040,"Mr.President, I want to start by making it very clear that this is not the way our budget process should work. In fact, to even call this a budget process gives it more credit than it deserves. With Republicans in control of the White House and both Chambers of Congress, the budget process has now descended into chaos and dysfunction. I talked about this in the Budget Committee, but I am going to keep talking about it because it is important.  First of all, look at the date. We are debating a budget for fiscal year 2018 months too late and more than 2 weeks into the fiscal year for which we are supposed to be budgeting.  Secondly and far more importantly, we are not really here to talk about a budget. We are not really here to have a debate about our values and our priorities or where we should be directing[[Page S6503]]our limited national resources. We are not here to talk about what or whom we should be investing in as a nation. We are certainly not really here to try to come together around a shared vision for where our country can head next year or 5 years from now or even 10 years from now. Yet Democrats do want to have this conversation. We believe this is a critical debate to have, and we would love to spend time on this floor debating a budget that opens up that conversation and puts us on a path toward working together to actually get that done.  We all know why we are really here. It is that Republican leaders want to start another fast-track, partisan process to jam legislation through Congress and do everything possible not to have to work with For what? It is to give more tax breaks to the rich, to raise taxes on the middle class, to circumvent any debate about a major environmental decision that would be unwise and potentially catastrophic, and to blast a hole in our budget that will increase the deficit, blow up the debt, and put Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education investments, healthcare, and so many more priorities at risk.  All of this is not just shameful and wrong--it is not going to work. We all have seen what has happened in the last few months. The Republicans have spent months trying to jam TrumpCare through Congress, and they have refused to work with So here we are now, months later, with Democrats and Republicans finally working together to improve healthcare after there being months of delay.  I say this to my Republican colleagues: Let's skip this first part. Let's skip this partisanship and dysfunction and acrimony and bitterness, and let's move, right now, to the bipartisan work and negotiations that we all know our constituents actually want and expect. I know it will not be easy, but I am confident that we can get it done.  All we are asking is that President Trump keep the promises he made on the campaign trail to put workers and the middle class first. It should not be that difficult, and the choice could not be clearer. Should we give President Trump and his Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires more tax breaks, or should we cut taxes for the mom or dad who is working two jobs or struggling to pay his mortgage or help his kid go to college? Should we preserve and protect Medicare and Medicaid, or should we allow those critical programs to be cut to give tax breaks to the rich? That is really the crux of this debate.  Democrats believe that workers and the middle class should get tax breaks, and from everything we are seeing about this Republican plan and everything we are seeing in this budget today, Republicans do not agree. I am hoping we can move away from this partisan process and really get to work for the people we represent, and I am hoping we can return to a budget process that will allow a true debate about our values and our priorities as a nation.  We should be here talking about the path to another bipartisan budget deal that will restore the investments in domestic and defense priorities. We should be having conversations about ways to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, not to cut them. We should be talking a lot about how we tackle our deficit and debt challenges fairly and responsibly.  On that point, I note that I find it especially interesting that so many Republicans have spent years pretending to care about the deficit when it has come to making cuts to middle-class priorities, but the minute that it has come to handing tax breaks to the rich, all of that has gone out the window. One Republican even admitted to the New York Times that deficit concerns are nothing more than a ``great talking point'' when Democrats are in charge. With a budget that would add trillions of dollars to the debt--a budget that is on the floor today--we will see where people actually stand on that issue.  Finally, we should be talking about ways to help our workers.

808,topic-id,652,"Mr.President, I wish to thank Chairman Alexander for his tremendous work on this. I am very grateful for his leadership in supporting a bipartisan discussion under regular order in the HELP Committee and his determination to see it to this point and beyond.  I remember very clearly back in July when it was clear that the so-called skinny repeal didn't have the votes to pass. We talked right then and there about getting to work on ways to stabilize the healthcare market and protect patients and families from premium spikes as a result of the uncertainty this administration caused. We were able to engage nearly half the Senate in our hearings and conversations on the HELP Committee, and we found that there was a lot more that we agreed on than we disagreed on when it came to strengthening healthcare and controlling costs in the near term.  Since then, actions by this administration have made our work more urgent. So I am very glad Democrats and Republicans agreed to work together to address this, and I am extremely pleased that, with the input of Members on both sides of the aisle, as well as Governors and patients and advocates, we were able to reach an agreement that I hope will set the healthcare discussion in Congress on a very different path than the one we have all seen for the last 7 years.  This agreement provides certainty on the reduction of out-of-pocket payments for the next 2 years. It will address attempts by this administration to keep people from getting enrolled in the care they need. It takes a number of very strong, bipartisan steps to offer States more flexibility to innovate in the way the Affordable Care Act intended, without undermining the essential health benefits, such as maternity care and mental health coverage, or burdening people who have preexisting conditions.  This is an agreement I am proud to support, not only because of the important steps to strengthen our healthcare system but because of the message it sends about the best way to get things done in this The way to deliver results, as Chairman Alexander says, for patients and families is to work under regular order, to find common ground rather than retreating to partisan corners, and to hear from our experts and our families and our Members on both sides of the aisle rather than reciting talking points to each other. We know that is true because[[Page S6434]]just a month ago, the idea of an agreement between Republicans and Democrats on healthcare seemed impossible at best, if not improbable. Thanks to the strong, bipartisan work of Chairman Alexander and many of our Members, we have been able to bridge the divide.  I strongly believe that patients and families in every State across our country will be stronger if we can get this agreement signed into law. I urge my colleagues to not only support it but to continue working together because there is no question we have work to do.  I thank Chairman Alexander and all the Republicans and Democrats who have been so engaged in this effort, and I echo the comments of Senator Alexander about what is in the bill. I won't repeat them. I agree with his last comments that we both want to make sure the payments go to consumers. We are working on that language, and I wish to assure our colleagues that is our joint intent as we get this language finalized and put into place.  I thank the Presiding Officer for this short amount of time during a busy day on the floor. I again thank Chairman Alexander, and I remain committed to him to get this done in the right way for the people of this country.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

464,topic-id,1840,"Madam President, I want to talk about a matter of life and death. It is happening, as we speak, in Puerto I went there yesterday. I didn't want to have a flyover of the island, but at the invitation of Governor Rossello, I got into a helicopter so that I could get up into the mountains and into the areas that have been closed because people hadn't been able to get there on the roads. That is what I wanted to see.  We have had colleagues come back and, because of a flyover in a helicopter, say that they say don't see a lot of damage. Of course not, because they are flying over parts of towns in which most of the structures are concrete blocks. But if you get down there on the ground and go into the structure, then you will see a different story.  First of all, you will smell a different story because the water has accumulated, and now it is turning to mold and mildew--inhabitable conditions. But when you get up into the mountains, you see the places that were cut off. Not until a week ago did they have the roads cleared so that people could get up there. And as we speak, as of yesterday, they are still reconstructing the roads so that people can get on these narrow, winding, little dirt roads that go up through the mountains. So for 2 and a half weeks, communities have been completely cut off, like the one that I saw yesterday, Utuado, which is way up in the mountains.  I want to show you some pictures, but I want you to realize that today is Next Wednesday will be 4 weeks since the hurricane hit. Can you imagine going into a State with 3.5 million people and 85 percent of the people do not have electricity? And by the way, these are our fellow American citizens; they are just in a territory. Can you imagine going into a State where a month after the hurricane, 50[[Page S6389]]percent of the people do not have potable water? It is an absolute outrage. And I don't think the American people realize what is happening.  Let me be your eyes by what I saw yesterday. This is a river bottom in the little town of This side of the river is cut off from this side of the river because the one bridge washed out. If you look at this structure, the question is, How long is this going to last? It is tilting to the left. Any major rush of water is going to take out this section.  I want you to see how creative these people are. It is hard to see at this distance, but they erected a cable system going over to the other side. They took the basket of a grocery cart, took the wheels and handles off, and this is on a pulley, and these guys are pulling it over here and then they pull it back. This is how people on this side of the river are getting food and water and medicine if they can't walk across. This is how people are surviving. If this section of the bridge goes--and it is just a matter of time--they are going to try to hook up a cable over here at the top of this riverbank over to the top of this riverbank and do the same kind of pulley.  Here in the States, on the mainland, if something like this happened, the Corps of Engineers would be there. We would be rebuilding. The Department of Transportation would be rebuilding that bridge. These are our fellow American citizens, and they are going without.  Let me show you another picture. This is the bank of another river. Let me show you the result. This is what happened. You see this whole house right behind here. I will show you the church in a minute. I asked the pastor: Did the people survive? He said that one was trapped in the house. They were able to get that person out. The others had already fled. But you can see that with the force of the extra rain and the water coming down, houses like that are history.  Here is that same section of the river with the church in the background. The church survived. I talked to the pastor of the church. Here I am having a conversation with the people who live on this side. I asked the pastor whether he lost any parishioners. He did not. On the side of his church, he has a dish, and because he has a generator, he is the only person in this town who has any kind of communication--in this case, through the satellite dish for television. Everything else is being run on generators because there is no electricity. As you know, these generators are not powerful enough to run air-conditioners; therefore, the water accumulates. Mold and mildew start to accumulate, with all the health effects as a result of that.  Does this look like something we would have in this country, or does this look like a third world country? Do the images in these photographs bring to mind other Caribbean nations that we have seen that have been devastated by earthquakes and hurricanes? Think about what happened to  When people go to San Juan--by the way, 85 percent of San Juan is without power. You see these little pockets, and of course they are trying to get the generators going in the hospitals for obvious reasons. They need the generators to go to stations where people are getting their dialysis treatments. That is obvious. But what about the wear and tear on the generators and the replacements?  The Governor of Puerto Rico, Governor Rossello, has a very ambitious schedule: He wants to restore 95 percent of power by the middle of I hope the Governor is right. It has been turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers to get the electrical grid and structures up and running. I am afraid it is going to be a lot longer. I asked for estimates on the immediate needs, especially rebuilding the grid. He said $4 billion. Are we going to be able to get that for them?  What are going to be the ultimate needs of Puerto Rico? We just heard the Senator from Texas talk about his State and the estimates that you heard out of Texas being as much as $100 billion. What about the needs of Puerto Rico? What about the needs of Florida? What about the needs of the Virgin Islands?  We have a supplemental coming up, but is that going to take care of the needs of all of those four areas that have been hit hard? If Texas is $100 billion, a long-term fix for Puerto Rico may well be $80 billion to $90 billion. And who knows what it is going to be for Florida and the Virgin Therefore, are we in this Congress, with or without the leadership of the White House, going to have the stomach to help our fellow American citizens? I am sure we are going to help Texas, and I certainly hope we will help my State of Florida, but are we willing to help the American citizens in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico? It is not a rosy picture, but we hear some Members of Congress come back and say they didn't see a lot of damage. It is people using a pulley they have jerry-rigged across a river to survive with daily supplies of food and fuel and water. You can't see that from the air. If you have no power, you have no water, and you have no sewer systems, then, what you have is chaos.  It has been a month since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto The hospitals are rationing services while they struggle to get the medicines and the fuel they need to power the generators. The dialysis centers are struggling to get the water and fuel they need to operate.  Like many, I have written, in this case, to the U.Department of Health and Human Services, to urge the Department to do more to help these dialysis centers obtain the supplies they need.  I wanted to come to the floor of the Senate, having gotten back very late last night from Puerto Rico, and tell the Senate that more needs to be done, and it is going to have to be done for a very long period of time. We have to do more to ensure that the supplies that are reaching the island are getting to those who need them.  Remember, things got piled up in the ports in the first week, and they didn't get out to be distributed. Senator Rubio and I were saying at the time that it is going to take the U.military, which is uniquely organized and capable of distribution of long logistical lines. It wasn't until a week after the hurricane that three-star General Buchanan was put in charge. I met with him and the head of FEMA down in the Puerto Rico area. Finally, those supplies are getting out. These are supplies for survival.  We need to pass a disaster relief package that fully funds Puerto Rico's recovery. We need to provide Puerto Rico with the community development block grant money that Governor Rossello has requested, just like we need the CDBGs for Texas and Florida and the Virgin Islands as well. We need to make Puerto Rico eligible for permanent work assistance so they can start to rebuild their infrastructure immediately.  I want to make something fairly clear. There should be absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on in Puerto It isn't rosy. It isn't that you can sit in a comfortable seat in a helicopter looking down from 1,500 or 2,000 feet on structures that look like they are intact, when, in fact, the reality on the ground below is completely different. Certainly, they didn't go up there and see all those bridges washed out in the mountains. They didn't see people scrambling for food. They didn't see the Puerto Rican National Guard rebuilding that little narrow dirt road winding along the banks of that river. They didn't see or walk into the buildings where you would almost be overwhelmed with the smells--the smells, particularly, of mold and mildew.  People have died as a result of this hurricane. People have died because of the lack of supplies and power. Our fellow Americans are dying, and they desperately need our help.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I have seen it with my own eyes on the ground, and I am here to urge this Congress and the administration that we have to act and act for a very long period of time.  Our citizens in Puerto Rico need our help. We have the responsibility to help fellow citizens in need.  Madam President, I yield the floor.

I applaud RSC's Chairman Mike Walker for his leadership on this and on this initiative. On the promises to repeal and secure, the House has begun to deliver by passing the American Health Care Act and providing $1.6 billion in border wall funding.  Tonight, I want to focus on the third promise: passing comprehensive tax reform. Our Nation's Tax Code affects every family, business, and worker and is a key driver behind America's economic competitiveness. Congress has not passed comprehensive tax reform since 1986. That is 31 years.  The average cost of a new house then in the United States was $89,430. For a new Ford F-150 pickup truck, the average price was $8,350. Mr.Speaker, it has been way too long before we have taken comprehensive tax reform into consideration.  Since then, the number of pages in the IRS code has increased by nearly 50,000 pages. The corporate tax rate is at 35 percent, which is the highest in the industrialized world. Ireland's, to give you an example, is 12 percent. This is inexcusable.  Congress took an important step forward last week through passing a budget resolution, and now it is time for the Senate to do their job on the budget so that we can deliver comprehensive tax reform for the American people.  Mr.Speaker, our tax reform plan is both profamily, and proworker. The typical American family will receive a $4,000 pay raise under our plan and will turbocharge the economy through enabling gross domestic product growth to reach 3.2 percent minimum for the next 5 years.

This legislation enhances the existing award program for Federal employees whose identification of waste, fraud, and abuse results in cost savings to an agency.  Every day, Federal employees across the country provide vital services to the American people. They ensure that our veterans receive the benefits to which they are entitled. They work to keep our air safe to breathe and our water safe to drink. They spend long hours and put their lives at risk to safeguard our national and homeland security. And Federal employees are on the front lines in ensuring that these important missions are carried out as effectively and efficiently as possible.  I think we can all agree that no one benefits when taxpayer dollars are wasted. This bill aims to increase government efficiency and save taxpayer dollars by providing incentives to Federal employees to identify wasteful spending. The legislation allows an agency head to award an employee a bonus for the identification of wasteful expenses that result in agency cost savings.  The bill also doubles the amount that an inspector general may award an employee for disclosures of waste, fraud, and abuse that result in cost savings from $10,000 to $20,000.  In addition, the bill contains several accountability measures so that Congress and the American people can determine whether the legislation is working as intended. First, agencies must include information on disclosures of wasteful spending and awards distributed under this legislation in their annual, publicly available, performance report.  The bill also includes a requirement that the director of the Office of Management and Budget submit a report to Congress each year certifying that each agency's cash award program complies with the bill.  In addition, the bill requires a GAO report on the operation of awards program within 3 years, including any recommendations for legislative changes.

318,topic-id,386,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of 920, the National Clinical Care Commission Act, a bipartisan bill that has received unanimous support within both the House and the Senate 920 is the Senate companion to my bill, H.309, which is cosponsored by over half of my House colleagues.  It has this level of support because our Nation faces an epidemic. Diabetes or prediabetes affects over 100 million Nearly one in three of our neighbors is affected.  This legislation will also help many others who are affected by other diseases like heart disease, obesity, and many others.  When I first came to Congress in 2009, it was crystal clear that we had a big problem. The benefits of all the Federal research dollars going into these diseases were simply not making their way to patients. Researchers at the NIH, the CDC, the DOD, the VA, and the FDA weren't sharing diabetes research. Who knows? Sharing information may have put us on a path to cure diabetes.  It was clear then, and it is still clear today: we need a laser-like approach to improve patient care by pursuing a strong Federal focus on research.  This bill accomplishes that goal by creating a National Clinical Care Commission comprised of doctors who specialize in diabetes care for patients.  This commission will have 3 years to strengthen the partnership between Federal stakeholders and health professionals who will bring hands-on, clinical experience to improve care.  This is not a new, unending bureaucracy. After 3 years, this commission will sunset. In 3 years, it will be gone.  We have already made such a huge investment of taxpayer dollars into research. It is time to leverage that investment into meaningful prevention and effective treatment options.  President Reagan once said: ``There is no limit to the amount of good you can do if you don't care who gets the credit.''  That is why I stand here today in strong support of my bill, which became Senator Shaheen's bill, because this bill will help so many Americans who are suffering from diabetes.  So today I ask my colleagues to again help all those who suffer from diabetes and other complex metabolic and autoimmune disorders by voting for 920.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, this is a great day back home in Pearland, Texas, because right now this House is about to honor a fallen hero from Pearland, Endy  Endy was born in Nigeria in 1985, the same year I graduated from college. When he was 11, his family left Nigeria to come to America to provide a better life for them. They moved to Long Island in 1996. He obtained a degree in psychology and sociology from Hofstra University in New York and later earned his MBA and master's degree in criminal justice from the University of  The call to serve his country and his community never left Endy, which is why, after moving to Pearland, Texas, he enrolled in the Alvin Community College Police He graduated with the 105th class in December of 2015, and he was sworn in as a Pearland police officer 6 months later.  In less than 6 months after December of 2015, his time with us was cut short just 2 days before his 31st birthday. At approximately 4 a.m. on the morning of June 12, 2016, Endy was hit head-on by a drunk driver while responding to an emergency call. He was the first officer to die in Pearland while on duty in over 40 years.  Endy's life embodies the selfless dedication of our law enforcement officials back in His sacrifice will never ever be forgotten. That is why I am proud that today this House will pass a bill to name the post office at 2700 Cullen Boulevard after It will be a source of great pride for our local community and will ensure that his sacrifice is remembered for generations to come.  This small gesture can't make up for the loss of Endy's life. The grief his wife, his young son, and his parents have will never go away. The Pearland community has suffered, but this small gesture is a testament to Endy's commitment to protect and serve. It will be an inspiration for future generations to strive to improve their community just like Endy did in his short time with us.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.

168,topic-id,1457,"Mr.President, I think I am the only one standing between this body and a vote on something that 2 years ago I didn't know existed, and that is a ``vote-arama'' in local Senate terms. Being an outsider to the political process, I find a lot of this very strange.  I came to Washington, and now I have a new vocabulary. It includes things like ``scoring,'' which doesn't have anything to do with sports, ``vote-arama,'' which doesn't have anything to do with the carnival down the road, or ``deficit-neutral reserve fund.'' I am still trying to figure out what that is; I see the Presiding Officer is smiling up there. Then there are ``points of order.'' There is a vocabulary centered around what we are going to be doing this afternoon, but I want to speak to the budget process itself.  First of all, I want to be very clear with my colleagues on both sides. I support this budget that we are going to vote on today for one very strong reason. It is a vehicle to get to tax reform in the United I will not speak on taxes today in the few minutes that I have, but I do want to speak about the process.  What we are doing in America right now in the Senate and the Congress--and what we have been doing over the[[Page S6617]]last 43 years--is losing the right to do the right thing. Let me say that again. We are losing the right to do the right thing.  Just a few weeks ago, we voted without batting an eye for $15 billion of allocated funds for the victims of two hurricanes in Florida, Texas, and other southern States, with every dime of that money in borrowed money. We have to go to China and other places and borrow that money so we can spend and do the right thing. That is not an embellishment or an exaggeration.  What about research for the rising, spiraling cost of our healthcare, driven by Alzheimer's, cancer, and diabetes? We spend about the same amount of money on that as we spend on all foreign aid. Yet, if we were to do more, we could cure those heinous diseases and lower our medical costs. We can invest in our infrastructure. We can absolutely take care of victims of wildfires, and now we have Puerto  Tonight we are going to be asked to vote up or down on a supplemental bill for some $30 billion-plus for the needs of these catastrophes. We have lost the right to do the right thing, which is, of course, to meet those needs.  Here is the biggest one. You just heard my great colleague, Senator McCain from He is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member. He talked about how decimated our military is from a funding standpoint. He talked about readiness. He talked about capitalization. But today, we are borrowing every dime we spend on our military, on our veterans, and on every domestic discretionary program in the United That is a fact. Where do we get the money when we run out of our own money? We spend every dime of our own. By the way, we collected over $3.5 trillion of Federal tax revenue last year. It is the largest amount America has ever collected in income taxes and total taxes for the Federal Government--the most we have ever collected--but all of that money goes to mandatory expenses.  As a matter of fact, since 2000, under one Republican President and one Democratic President, our government has grown from $2.4 trillion to $4 trillion. That is not the worst of it. The worst is yet to come. We have added in two Presidencies $14 trillion to our Federal debt. Of our $20 trillion, $14 trillion of it was added under these two  In the next 10 years, the current budget under which we are working will add another $11 trillion to our debt.  Here is the problem. The blue line here is what you heard Senator McCain talk about earlier. That is our discretionary spending. It is flat. As a matter of fact, between 2009 and today, we have lowered discretionary spending by over one-third, by $400 billion. But what has happened is that our mandatory expenses have exploded.  On this chart, this line here, are our mandatory expenses; that is, Social Security, Medicare, pension and benefits for Federal employees, and the interest on our debt. This is a formula for financial disaster.  At this point, we already have $20 trillion of debt. Over the next 30 years, some estimates say that we will have over $130 trillion of future commitments, liabilities coming at us like a freight train.  We are hamstrung because we have a budget process that doesn't work. One thing that contributes to this is a process that over the last 43 years, since the 1974 Budget Act was put in place, which created this budget process, the budget has worked only four times in 43 years. It has funded the Federal Government only four times. That is not a partisan comment; that is an indictment on this body and on the body across the hall.  In any other environment--sports, medicine, business, military--imagine if you had a process that worked only four times. Imagine if you had a tank in World War II, and you are over there, and every 43 times you fired it, it worked only four times. Imagine what result would be.  What we have here is a system that doesn't work. I am going to try to explain that very quickly.  First, we have committees in the U.Senate that involve themselves in appropriations and the funding of the Federal Some are called authorizing committees. These are committees like the Foreign Relations Committee; we have We have all of these authorizing committees over here on the left. On the right here are Appropriations Today, these committees have to pass 12 bills in order to fund the Federal  Over the last 43 years, out of the 12 bills we have to appropriate to fund the government, we have averaged only 2\1/2\ bills. In any other world, that can't work. It doesn't work here. So we end up with 179 continuing resolutions to get us past the end of our fiscal year to continue spending at last year's rate, and then we go to an ``omnibus''--another new term that I had never heard of--at the end of the calendar year. Basically, most times, six or eight people will get in a room and decide how to spend $1 trillion. This current budget deals with, primarily, issues that are not on the mandatory side.  There is a way forward. There are Members on the other side--and I am going to call out one--my good friend from the State of Rhode Senator Whitehouse and I and others have been working on this for quite some time. He has a great idea: Let's pick a point in the future, make the debt a percentage of our GDP, and work backward from there with guardrails on what we can do every year.  There is a budget process we have been working on that creates a politically neutral platform that allows both sides, in a bipartisan way, to argue and fight over what we think the budget should include, because we believe the budget should be a law.  Today, the budget is only a resolution, which means it is nothing but a political statement by the majority party.  We then go to an authorizing process where the minority party, because they weren't asked to play in the budget process--we have an authorizing process in which, today, we have over $300 billion of Federal expenditures a year that are not authorized, over $300 billion.  Then we are supposed to go to an appropriations process. As I have just said, we have appropriated, on average, over those 43 years, only 2\1/2\ bills a year instead of 12.  We can fix this. It is not a partisan issue. We will absolutely fix this budget process in a bipartisan way. I am going to vote for this. I hope my colleagues will vote for this budget bill so we can go on and debate taxes.  The debt crisis is the 1 crisis we face in our country. It keeps us from doing the right thing--funding our national defense and taking care of our needs.  I will support this budget today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

163,topic-id,1128,"Mr.President, later today the majority is going to attempt to pass a budget for 2018. Passing a budget has come to mean all sorts of things in Congress these days. Last year's budget was an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care This budget is supposedly all about tax reform. However, a budget, first and foremost,[[Page S6614]]should be a statement about priorities for the coming year and for the coming decade.  Let's take a moment and examine what this budget says about the majority's priorities. With any budget, I think you need to look at the end result and ask a couple of very simple questions.  First, does this budget help reduce Federal deficits and debt with a responsible, sensible approach? Second, does this budget, ultimately, put us on a sustainable fiscal path?  The answer to these questions is a clear no. Instead, this budget is primarily intended to allow the majority to use an expedited procedure to move tax breaks that would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will say that this lost revenue is offset by spending cuts and promises of new revenues from economic growth far beyond what almost every single mainstream economist predicts.  Let's look at the trillions in cuts that the majority is proposing. Where the budget is specific, it is bad. Medicaid is cut by $1 trillion. Medicare, which provides essential healthcare services to our seniors, is cut by $470 billion. On top of that, the budget includes over $3 trillion in unspecified cuts.  You don't have to be an expert in the Federal budget to know that $3 trillion in unspecified cuts means one of two things. They are either, 1, cuts to programs that families and communities rely on, like Head Start, Pell grants, and transportation funding, or, 2, they are unspecified because they are simply never going to happen.  That is what we are voting on today. There is nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, and then there are trillions in cuts that are either so unpopular that no one dares name what they are or trillions more in deficits because there is not a plan.  The Federal budget is about choices. You can learn a lot about which choices a budget puts in black and white and which are left deliberately unspecified. When it comes to the majority's tax plan, we know only a few details, but we know enough to see where there will be winners and where there will be losers. The winners will be the wealthiest Americans in our country and global corporations.  We also need to look at what it means for Michigan families and small businesses, but there is a deliberate lack of detail that makes figuring out what the bottom line is for working families impossible. We don't know where the tax brackets will start and where they will stop. We don't know what personal exemptions families will be able to take. We don't know the size and the scope of the child tax credit. We don't know if important incentives for charitable contributions will be kept. The majority is even keeping open the possibility of raising taxes on Americans who are trying to save for their retirement.  This budget should be straightforward. We should reduce the tax burden on middle class families. We should make it simpler for Americans to file and understand their taxes. We should make it easier for them to save for retirement. We should increase take-home pay for Americans that work hard each and every day to make a living.  Unfortunately, none of these details that are important for middle-class folks were important enough to include in this budget. That is why I will vote against it. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  We cannot add another $1.5 trillion to the deficit. We cannot slash Medicare and This is simply the wrong direction for our country.  So why are we moving forward with this budget at all? Well, on this issue, I think the administration has been clear. Passing this budget is all about passing a so-called tax reform bill. However, passing this budget is not a requirement for passing tax reform. Passing this budget is only a requirement to pass a tax bill with as few votes as possible--without input or buy-in from Members of the minority. This is not the way we should pass real tax reform. If tax reform is going to be successful, it must have broad bipartisan input. I stand ready to work with my colleagues on real tax reform.  Modernizing and streamlining our Tax Code can boost Michigan businesses, raise take-home pay for workers across sectors, and help create the type of 21st century economy we need.  We can make it easier for small businesses, including manufacturers and family farms, to invest in themselves, and we can make the code fair across sectors. We can establish incentives for smart investment in our communities. We can implement strong, enforceable rules to prevent companies from gaming our tax system and moving profits and jobs overseas.  For families, we can meaningfully boost take-home pay. We can expand the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit, and we can work together to find real ways to help alleviate the cost of child care. We can lessen the burden of student debt, and we can help people save for retirement.  Tax reform can help create more good jobs right here at home, fix some of the issues in the code that drive jobs and companies overseas, and put more money in the pockets of working families.  In 1986, Congress passed the most dramatic reform of the Federal Tax Code in modern history. How many votes did this sweeping overhaul of the tax system get? When tax reform ultimately passed the Senate in 1986, it received 97 votes.  If we want to repeat that accomplishment and truly overhaul our code to make it work better for American families and American businesses, that level of bipartisanship should be our goal, not 50 or 51.  I know we can do these things in a truly bipartisan manner if we are just given the chance. Let's work together to pass real tax reform with broad support from both sides of the aisle. The American people deserve nothing less.  I stand ready to work with the majority, and so do my colleagues. I urge the majority to abandon this effort and start over. Make the decision not to add trillions more to the deficit. Make the decision not to cut Medicare and Medicaid for Americans in need. Start over. Let's find a path forward to find real, lasting, bipartisan solutions.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-10-19-pt1-PgS6593-8.txt,2113,STAFF SERGEANT RYAN SCOTT OSTROM POST OFFICE,2017.0,19.0,October
369,topic-id,572,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey for bringing more disaster relief legislation to the floor today.  I am pleased to see much-needed support for ongoing disaster response efforts in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other hurricane-affected areas, including direct assistance to families, debris removal operations, and emergency protective measures carried out by FEMA, and additional activities of numerous other Federal agencies that are on the ground working around the clock to help us to recover and rebuild.  I cannot thank enough all of our Federal and local personnel helping us through this. I have been on the ground after Irma, after Maria, and just recently, and I tell you, their support is invaluable.  I am particularly pleased to see the subdivision of $5 billion for Disaster Direct Loan Program to assist local governments and with measures taking into account the unique aid and flexibility needed for the Virgin Islands and Puerto  Multiple loans will be available based on different types of losses and unanticipated spending needs, and waivers of amount limits are also helpful. Additional loans to pay for local matching requirements is an important support.  However, I am deeply concerned about the important relief that was left out of this bill and the administration's disaster relief request last week. This does not incorporate the medium and long-term assistance that played a clear critical role in the recovery following previous disasters like Katrina and Sandy, and the Virgin Islands cannot afford to wait for this to be a higher priority of the Federal  The package does not include community development and social service block grant funding, Economic Development Administration funds, supplemental housing assistance, nor additional funds for repair of our water infrastructure, ports, community facilities, airports, roads, parks, wetlands, and fisheries.  Damage sustained in all of these areas has been catastrophic, and waiting around until another end of the year for auxiliary funding for these pressing needs is not acceptable.  Perhaps most concerning is the lack of Medicaid program assistance to the territory. Even before two consecutive Category 5 hurricanes that decimated our hospitals and medical infrastructure, the Virgin Islands was forced to operate a Medicaid program that is capped in an amount that has no relationship to local needs, and our rate of Federal matching funds, our FMAP, is limited to an arbitrarily low 55 percent Federal to 45 percent local contribution.                              {time}  1300  Thousands of our citizens go without adequate care due to this treatment every year, in addition to the impacts on our providers and hospitals due to uncompensated care, but after these back-to-back storms, there is no revenue being generated in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico at this time. Our tourism-related economy is gone. We will miss this entire year, at the very least.  With our public health and social welfare needs, we are in dire need of supplemental Medicaid support, including a temporary 100 percent Federal contribution, just like what was provided to Americans living in Louisiana and Texas following  I was pleased to see Ranking Member Pallone's proposal to provide this 100 percent temporary Federal share with a substantial plus-up to our allotment so that the American citizens--yes, American citizens--in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico can have the benefit of Medicaid in this time of greatest need.

548,topic-id,1553,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. As my colleague noted, Kirkpatrick was a psychologist at a VA medical center in In 2009, he was fired from his job after allegedly questioning the overmedication of his patients, particularly related to opioids. Tragically, that very same day, Kirkpatrick committed suicide.  I think we can all agree that protecting whistleblowers helps to ensure that waste, fraud, and abuse in our government does not go unnoticed or ignored.  It is our responsibility to empower and encourage whistleblowers to come forward and speak out when something isn't right. No one should have to live in fear of retaliation for bringing the truth to light. No one should fear losing their job or career or their life simply for following the rules.  The Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act increases accountability by enacting mandatory punishments for any manager or superior at an agency who has been found to have retaliated against a whistleblower.  The bill also contains VA-specific reforms to better protect the privacy of medical records. Employee medical records would now be prohibited from being accessed in the case of potential retaliation cases, which adds an additional level of accountability for supervisors; and protecting the whistleblower from attacks and threats based on their personal medical history, which would be completely inappropriate.  Mr.Speaker, while there are strong and necessary reforms in this bill, I want to make sure that you know that legislation can always be improved through the amendment process or at least through conducting a hearing and markup of a bill.  Sadly, but unsurprisingly in this Congress, this bill didn't have a markup in committee; didn't have a hearing; is considered under a closed rule, where amendments that were brought forward aren't even allowed to be debated on the House floor.  This might be a surprise even to the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who himself requested a structured rule that allowed for debate on amendments.  Much of my statement today echoes the sentiment of Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member Cummings and his testimony yesterday evening in the Rules Though this bill isn't perfect, it can be improved and strengthened by a few relatively straightforward amendments, which, unfortunately, were shut[[Page H7932]]down in the Rules Committee last night.  The first amendment, which was blocked today, would have addressed the bill's constitutional concerns first raised by the Office of Personnel Management by revising the mandatory disciplinary procedures to allow superiors their constitutional rights to due process in responding to accusations of retaliation. It would have improved the bill and made it more likely to stand up in court to challenge.  An amendment reaffirming the right to due process would have been something at least worth voting on, and, in fact, could have preserved the constitutionality of the core elements of this bill, ensuring that it stays in place to protect whistleblowers.  Another amendment blocked under this rule would have addressed privacy concerns contained in the bill. Specifically, the amendment would have protected the privacy of a whistleblower who commits suicide, by requiring the permission of the whistleblower's next of kin before an agency can share information regarding the suicide.  Again, it seems like a straightforward fix to protect the privacy of whistleblowers and their families. At the very least, even if Members of this body disagreed with it, why didn't we at least bring it forward for debate and a vote?  Another amendment that was blocked today contained the text of Mr.Cummings' bill, H.702, which was passed by the House of Representatives unanimously. As you know, this bill would expand protections for employees who face discrimination, and it solidifies our commitment to protecting whistleblowers and other employees from retaliation. It was a bipartisan bill. It passed the House unanimously. We simply should have allowed it under this bill to become part of a related effort.  Now, I know that my colleagues on the other side will say: Oh, the Senate is slow. They won't take up this bill on time. It is better for us to pass something now than have to wait for their approval.  But it only takes 10 minutes usually to debate an amendment. So we could have allowed three amendments and spent no more than 30 minutes debating them and still reported this bill out expeditiously.  Now, I happen to think that, while there are many on the other side of the aisle who would agree the House needs to return to regular order, it is time that Members actually started by voting according to what they are saying. By voting ``no'' on this rule and rejecting it, we can send the message to House leadership that we want an open, regular order process.  Bills should come out of committee through markups. Republicans and Democrats should have the opportunity to amend bills on the floor of the Perhaps if we did that more often, the Senate would not simply cast aside many of the bills that have passed the House, knowing that they went through the process of deliberate consideration by our body, rather than a bill that appears fully formed where Members of this body simply get an up-or-down vote.  This bill will enjoy bipartisan support when it passes the House later today, as it should, but it also begs the question of: Why are we spending valuable time debating a noncontroversial bill, especially if it is considered under a closed rule? Why not have simply put it up on suspension in the first place?  To say things bluntly, we are actually running out of time this year. By my count, we only have 30 legislative days left in the first half of the 115th Congress, yet we are faced with so many important issues we need to move forward on.  Nine million children face losing their health insurance because Congress has not yet acted to reauthorize Almost 1 million young, aspiring Americans have no idea what their lives will look like 6 months from now because of the President's decision to end DACA and Congress's continued inability to make it permanent law. The citizens of Puerto Rico, American citizens, still have not been granted a Federal aid package and are suffering from a lack of food, clean water, healthcare supplies, and electricity, jeopardizing many of their lives today.  Yet here we are debating a bill without even allowing an amendment process that we could have passed under suspension vote yesterday so we could move on to CHIP, to Puerto Rico, to DACA today, rather than spend one of our 30 remaining days of business this year avoiding the topics that the American people want us to take on.  Despite the important goals we have left to accomplish this year, it is misleading to assume that regular order isn't feasible. We have all seen how fast Congress can work when we are pushed right up to the edge. It is past time that we show that same urgency and commitment in considering legislation under regular order, even if it means we have to stay here on Thursdays and Fridays, even if it means we are working until 8 or 9 or 10 or midnight. The American people deserve no less.  Make no mistake, the Whistleblower Protection Act is an important piece of legislation that will help protect whistleblowers and hold Federal agencies accountable, but if we are going to devote this much time to legislation that protects employees, let's take it a step further and talk about expanding worker protections for an even greater number of  For example, my legislation, the Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act--which I introduced last session and this session, and has yet to receive a hearing, no less a markup in the Education and Workforce Committee--would protect workers from wage theft, prevent taxpayer funds from going towards union busting, and establish first contract arbitration to prevent companies from dragging on labor negotiations unnecessarily to the detriment of workers.                              {time}  1300  We don't have time to waste. If we are going to consider an issue, let's dive in. We can protect whistleblowers from retaliation and strengthen the rights of workers at the same time. Given the minimal amount of time we have left to work with, 30 days this year, we have an obligation to do both.  By the way, the fact that we only work 30 more days this year here in the United States Congress probably comes as a great surprise to many hardworking Americans who are accustomed to working 5 days a week. We have the rest of the month of October, November, Well, many Americans might get Christmas Day off, perhaps even Christmas Eve, but I don't think Americans realize that Congress is only going to work 30 days out of the next 78 days. That is less than a half-time job, Mr. I think the American people deserve more from us in this body, especially when so many issues like CHIP, like DACA, like Puerto Rico, and many others have gone unanswered by us in this body, the House of Representatives, or by colleagues across the way in the  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, President Trump has been relentless on his attack on immigrant Americans, generally, and, in particular, DREAMers since he took office.

551,topic-id,576,"Mr.Speaker, by defeating the previous question today, we can bring forward the Dream Act, which I am confident would pass on the floor of the House probably by a good margin.  What the Dream Act does is it allows young people who grew up in our country, who know no other country, a pathway to become citizens. They have gone to our schools, they have been on the football team or cheerleaders like your own kids or grandkids, Mr. They are able to work legally in our country because of the deferred action program, which is scheduled by President Trump to be canceled in 4\1/2\ months. We need to act now to give these young people the certainty they need to live their lives as Americans, the only country they know, and the only country that they are loyal to.  We simply don't have time to waste. We need to give these young de facto Americans the certainty they need to continue with their lives to be able to contribute to our country, join our military, pay taxes, and all of the other responsibilities that Americans have.  Of course, Mr.Speaker, protecting whistleblowers is important. It is critical to ensure that our democracy functions honestly and with accountability and government is truly working in the best interests of the people that it serves. But we could get there a better way, by having an open process that allows Democrats and Republicans to suggest further improvements to whistleblower protection rather than having a bill that was never marked up in committee, that simply appeared fully formed for the full House to consider without the opportunity for Democrats or Republicans to make it any better.  The Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act will strengthen the rights of whistleblowers and reaffirm their value and importance to our country. But once again, this bill should have gone through a regular process that allowed us to amend it.  The fact that this bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support shouldn't stop us from making changes in this body, the House of Representatives, to improve the bill and make it work even better. We have an obligation to our constituents to thoughtfully consider every piece of legislation in front of us and to amend where we see fit.  As we move forward on addressing the pressing issues in front of us, such as finding a path forward on deferred action, which we will present if we can defeat the previous question, reauthorizing CHIP, or making improvements in our healthcare system, let's do it through a regular process that allows Democrats and Republicans, the 435 of us who serve here, to bring forward our ideas, not just the ideas of leadership in making the country a better place.  We have good, smart, deliberate Members on both sides of the aisle who want to work, want to legislate. It is ridiculous that we only have 30 days out of the next 78 in which Congress[[Page H7934]]will even be working, and I suspect for most of the 30 days, like today, Democrats and Republicans won't even be able to offer their ideas and have them considered. The American people deserve better.  We as an institution, as the United States Congress, can do better, and we can begin by defeating the previous question and defeating the rule.  Mr.Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.

It simply says that under this budget we would do international tax reform. It would create incentives to have more jobs here in this country. Those are incentives for both U.companies and foreign companies to create jobs here in  This is not a partisan issue; it has been bipartisan. In fact, it was part of the Simpson-Bowles provisions with regard to tax reform. Only a couple of years ago, I cochaired a working group on this issue with the now minority leader, Senator Schumer, where we came up with a proposal which said that the international system is broken and that we need to move to one like the one we are talking about in this amendment that brings back jobs.  One of the problems is that the current Tax Code actually encourages companies to keep their money offshore. We think we could bring back a lot of that money. There is probably $2.5 to $3 trillion locked out offshore. But it is worse than that. It also leads to American companies being taken over by foreign companies and these inversions we have heard so much about. In the last 24 hours, we had another major inversion.

1100,topic-id,2311,"Mr.President, as we have just seen, there is no more decent or honest Senator in the U.Senate than the Senator from Wyoming who just spoke, and that is why we were able to expedite the process tonight. It may seem like we are here late, but, frankly, we all expected to be here until 2 or 3 or 4 in the morning, and instead we worked things out. He is an example of why we did, both in committee and on the floor. Senator Enzi was able to work with people, be fair, honest, and that pays off. It gave everybody a fair shot.  I will also say he has produced a budget that does balance, which I think most Americans agree with. As he said so well, the budget is a framework. So the budget itself does not have the specific policies in it. In fact, those have to go to other committees to be passed and then will be passed by[[Page S6634]]the full Senate and the House and signed into law by the  What it does do is it prepares this body to do something really important and really exciting, and that is the opportunity to reform our broken Tax It is so important because it will give us a shot in the arm, in terms of our economy. It will get this economy moving again, and it is going to help people who have been left behind in this economy. Really, when we look over the past 15 years, so many people whom I represent and who are represented by the other Members in this Chamber have not seen their wages go up. In fact, they have been flat, and what has gone up are expenses--healthcare expenses more than any, frankly. It is the biggest single increase people see in their family budget but also food, medicine, and tuition. We have seen flat wages, not more take-home pay, and higher expenses.  What we have an opportunity to do in this tax reform bill--that is a framework, not a mandate--that was made possible by the budget that was passed tonight is we have set the stage for commonsense tax reform that is essential to this effort to grow our economy and create more and better jobs and increased wages for middle-class  We heard a lot of discussion about it adding to the deficit. I will just add to what has been said already. If we do this tax reform right, it will not add to the deficit. In fact, I strongly believe it will reduce the deficit over the next 10 years. Why do I say that?  I am going to talk for a second about some of the things that are in good pro-growth tax reform that we are planning to implement that will actually grow the economy that will result in more economic activity and more revenue coming into the  If you assume, as the Congressional Budget Office does, that we are only going to grow this economy 1.9 percent, which is a pretty paltry amount over the next 10 years--way below what the average has been for the past 30 years--then let's say all this tax reform we are doing only grows the economy by a little bit more. Let's say .4 percent. So instead of 1.9 percent, let's grow the economy at 2.3 percent. That is a conservative estimate, I believe, based on the kinds of things we are talking about. That will mean we actually not only have a revenue-neutral tax proposal, but we begin paying back some of the national debt by having the deficit, once again, as it was in the years 2000 and 2001, be on a unified basis at a zero deficit.  This is an exciting opportunity to help people be able to seek their goals in life but also to actually help with regard to the budget deficit. I agree with the chairman on that. I think we have an opportunity, if we do the right tax relief, to really help to get the budget deficit down.  How does this comprehensive tax reform help the middle class? We talked a little bit about this today. Some offered amendments. I offered one with regard to the business tax side of things, but I think it does it in three ways. First, it immediately helps the family budget by cutting middle-class taxes. So everything that has been laid out in terms of the proposals tonight on the tax side, we can talk about the fact that for families who are working families in this country who are making $30, $40, $50, $60,000 a year, those folks will see a reduction in their taxes which will help the family budget.  The Tax Code, of course, is very complicated, too burdensome. One thing we are proposing is to double the standard deduction. That means for people who take the deduction now--and about two-thirds of the people I represent do--they will be able to have a doubling of that, from $12,000 for a family to up to $24,000 for a family. That is a 0 tax bracket for the first $24,000 in income. That is significant middle-class tax relief.  Second, we are going to expand the child tax credit. That is really important, not just to provide relief but to help families with kids be able to afford childcare.  Finally, we will adjust the bracket so people who are beyond the standard deduction, double or nothing, and who don't take advantage of the child tax credit also get tax relief.  So these are ways in which folks are going to see immediate help for the family budget, but it is more than that. It is more than that.  I think, frankly, the most significant part of this reform is going to be giving the economy that shot in the arm and helping to increase jobs and improve wages. That is going to happen, I think, through the business tax relief that we have talked about. First, with regard to smaller companies, the so-called passthrough companies, about three-quarters of the companies in America pay their taxes as individuals. This is the corner drugstore; this is the small manufacturing business in your town. Those folks are going to see a reduction in their taxes on their business income so they can invest more in that business and create more jobs, and a lot of the growth is going to come from these smaller businesses. That is the 25-percent rate people are talking about as compared to, say, a 35-percent or higher rate for individuals. That is something that is fair, in part because we are also going to lower the rates for people who are in the larger businesses. These are the C corporations that are being talked about. That rate has to come down. If it does not, America will continue to lose jobs and investment overseas, and that is what is happening right now.  Just in the last 24 hours, another major American company announced that they are inverting; in other words, they are going overseas. Why? Because of the Tax It is amazing that the Tax Code that this Congress is responsible for improving is so bad that people are actually voting with their feet and leaving the country and taking jobs and investment with them. We have done research on this, we have had investigations on this, and we know what is happening. We know, as an example, that because of our Tax Code, there are almost 5,000--4,700 companies just in the last 13 years that have become foreign companies that otherwise would be American companies. Think about that. That is the Ernst & Young study we recently saw. This is amazing. We know for a fact that it is not just about these companies leaving America and going to other countries and doing these so-called inversions--becoming a foreign company--but it is also foreign companies coming here and taking over U.companies, and, again, what is happening here is that jobs and investment are going overseas.  Why is this? Well, it is for a couple of reasons. One is that American companies now have the highest tax rate in all of the industrialized world. So the 35-percent tax rate you hear about, that is a high rate compared to every other country in the world that we do business with. That is a negative, but it is also how we tax. We tax in a way that discourages us from bringing profits back to America to the point that, unbelievably, there is between $2.5 trillion and $3 trillion--and some say more--of earnings stuck overseas, locked out of America, which could come back here to expand plants, equipment, and jobs, to actually get this economy moving. This is a huge opportunity for us. We don't want to see these companies go offshore. We want to see them come back.  Trade policy is important. Regulations are important. Worker retraining programs are important. Healthcare cost containment is important. But nothing is more important than fixing this broken Tax Code if we are going to see the kind of economic growth and improvement in wages that we all hope for.  There have been a lot of studies done on this, and they say that we haven't changed our code since the mid-1980s, but every other one of our competitors have. They have all lowered their rates, and they have all gone to a system of taxation that is more efficient to get this money back to their countries.  In 1986, Ronald Reagan was He made some great changes. That was 31 years ago. Things have changed a lot since then. By the way, back then Pete Rose was still playing for my Cincinnati That is how long ago it was.  It is time for us to update this Tax Code, to modernize it, and to bring back those jobs and that investment. We can do it. We can do it because of what happened tonight. This creates the framework for us to able to do this.  In a recent business roundtable survey of 150 American companies--these are the CEOs--82 percent said that tax[[Page S6635]]reform that we are talking about will prompt them to increase capital spending. Three-quarters of them--76 percent--said that it is going to increase hiring. And with this reduced tax burden, businesses are going to have the money to invest in their workers.  I will tell you, with the tighter job market that is out there now as the economy has begun to improve, this will increase competition for workers, and this will increase wages. We know that is going to happen.  Every economist agrees that this kind of tax reform is going to change behavior. Some might think it doesn't improve the economy as much as others do, but everyone believes this will incentivize us to create more jobs and improve wages here in the United States of  There is a group called the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group up here that we work with. They have a study that says that as much as 70 percent of the benefit from that lower corporate rate is going to go to the workers in terms of higher wages, better benefits. That is the way we are going to help the middle class also--not just with regard to the tax relief directly but with regard to helping to improve job creation and increase wages. So I am excited about this. I think it can happen. I think it is something that is long overdue.  I think it is something, frankly, that should be bipartisan. This was what the Simpson-Bowles proposal, which was a totally bipartisan proposal, said we ought to do. In fact, they took the top rate down to 28 percent--lower than anybody is talking about here. But they said that we should go to this kind of taxation we are talking about in terms of international businesses, in terms of corporations, in terms of creating jobs.  Two years ago, I worked with Chuck Schumer, who is now the Democratic leader here in the U.Senate, and we were asked to cochair a working group on taxation--particularly folks on the international side--and we came up with a consensus, which said that we have to fix this broken Tax It is not working, and we need to bring this money back. We need to bring these jobs back by going through this kind of system we are talking about, a so-called territorial system. In the past, this has been bipartisan, and my hope is it can be again.  Yes, the budget provides the framework for us to get this done, not on a 60-vote basis but a 50-vote basis. But we should do it with more than 60 votes. We welcome input from our Democratic colleagues. I believe, in the end, this will be bipartisan because I do believe that the vast majority of Americans out there, as they understand this tax reform proposal will say: Yes, I think middle-class tax relief makes sense, and, yes, I think we should be bringing back the jobs and the investment to this country. I think that is going to be something that Members will hear across this country and across this aisle. When they do, I believe we will have the opportunity to have the kind of commonsense, bipartisan tax reform we need in this country. We need to do it to be able to have a thriving American middle class, and we need to do it to have a stronger  I am excited about this opportunity. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  Mr.President, I yield back my time on that, but I have another matter that I need to do, the closing business.

647,topic-id,1605,"Mr.President, I rise in strong opposition to the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018.  Let me say that consideration of this budget resolution seems surreal, not only because of the timing--coming, as it does, 3 weeks into the fiscal year--but also because of the real challenges the United States faces today.  We have important work to do. At this moment, three States and two U.territories are struggling to recover after experiencing significant natural disasters. The resources we are providing are simply not sufficient.  In addition, sadly and tragically, Las Vegas just experienced the worst mass shooting in American history, breaking the record that was set only last year in the tragic mass shooting in Orlando, but there is no serious bipartisan and comprehensive effort to address gun violence.  After President Trump's reckless efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, Congress needs to act to stabilize private insurance exchanges. I think that we were all pleased, as I was, to see Senator Alexander and Senator Murray take strong steps to do that over the last few days. It appears, however, that they are once again being undermined by the  Next week, the President is officially going to declare the opioid crisis as a national emergency, which is what we all have recognized over several years, but declarations mean nothing without there being the resources to help. This is an emergency, and we need to provide those resources now, but given this budget resolution before us, those resources will not be available.  States are already taking steps to reduce healthcare coverage for kids under the Children's Health Insurance Program and services through community health centers because we have not been able to act in time to reauthorize these critical initiatives.  We face international crises in Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, which are inflamed, unfortunately, every time the President tweets or comments about these issues.  Before December 8, the President and Congress need to come to an agreement to provide relief from sequester funding caps for defense and non-defense priorities.  The President and Congress need to act immediately to undo the crisis that has been created by the President's Executive order on DACA, which will put thousands of Dreamers at risk of deportation and have an adverse impact on our economy.  This budget addresses none of these challenges. In fact, it so weights tax cuts to the rich and deficits that we will not have the resources with which to deal with any one of these issues. Instead, a week after the President took steps that will cause millions to lose their private health insurance, this budget will pave the way for trillions of dollars in cuts to healthcare offered under Medicare and  Last week, the President basically tried to strangle the Affordable Care Now the goal is to undo Medicare and Medicaid, and that is astounding. The real goal behind that is not just to undo these critical programs for every American; the real goal is to provide trillions more in tax cuts that will overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest.  The majority will say that the budget only lays out a broad fiscal plan and that none of the details have been set, but we have seen this play before. It starts with tax cuts for all, but it will end with nothing short of a historic transfer of wealth from low- and middle-income Americans to those who are[[Page S6504]]prospering the most in this country. It starts with the promise of a balanced budget, but it will end with greater deficits. It will start this time when, after a long and difficult recovery from the economic crash of the Bush administration, the economy is finally moving forward with stock market highs, low employment, and low interest rates.  Nothing about our current economic situation demands massive, deficit-busting tax cuts, particularly to the wealthiest Indeed, it is instructive to look back to the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts. These tax plans were also paid for with trillions of dollars of debt because the Nation was newly at war. These plans also overwhelmingly favored the top 1 percent of We were told then that the tax benefits would trickle down to the working class and pay for themselves. I opposed these tax plans because I didn't believe that would occur, and, in fact, it didn't occur. Despite the substantial benefits for those at the top, overall economic growth from 2001 to 2007 was weaker than average. Median household income fell 2.7 percent while prices and poverty continued to rise. With weak regulation and oversight, this fiscal policy ushered us into the great recession. Now the GOP is poised to do the same thing yet again.  Just for contrast, in the early 1990s, under President Clinton, Democrats took tough votes to raise revenue and rein in spending. Despite predictions to the contrary, the economy took off in one of the biggest economic booms in history, and at the same time we turned budget deficits into the first surplus in a generation.  There are lessons in that experience. There are no shortcuts to restoring fiscal order. Tax cuts do not pay for themselves, and you can't balance the budget while cutting revenue. So how does the majority promise to turn straw into gold this time? By pairing $5.8 trillion in cuts from basic services, including Medicare and Medicaid, with massive deficits and rosy revenue assumptions. With these in place, the GOP says that it can balance the budget and cut taxes by $1.5 trillion. Never mind the fact that the Republican tax cuts to the wealthy will likely cost more than $1.5 trillion, and never mind that this budget assumes absurd cuts to nondefense programs and leaves spending for defense at sequester levels, which we all recognize are inadequate. But even if the numbers are phony and built on loose, unrealistic assumptions, won't most Americans be getting a substantial tax windfall under this plan? Sadly, no.  According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center's analysis of the available information on the GOP tax plan, about 80 percent of the tax cuts will go to the top 1 percent, increasing their after-tax income by about 9 percent. Nearly half of that money will go to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. Meanwhile, the bottom 80 percent of American wage earners will get only 13 percent of the tax cuts, and many hard-working families with children could actually see their taxes go up.  Based on the Tax Policy Center's analysis, most Rhode Islanders who get a tax cut will receive only $190 or less out of this deal. That is less than the cost of a week's worth of groceries for a family of four. Yet most Rhode Islanders and most Americans stand to lose much, much more due to the inevitable cuts in investments like Medicaid, Pell grants, Title I, health research, and public infrastructure. Most middle-class families in my State depend on programs like these. To send their children to school, they need Pell grants; to make sure that their elderly mother or father is well cared for, they need the assistance of Medicaid for nursing homes. So that $190 tax cut will be nothing compared to the losses they will incur in the cost of college for their children, the cost of healthcare for their parents who are just struggling to get by.  On the other hand, people on the top end of the bracket will get a tax cut large enough to buy a new If the recent past is any indication, they will pocket that money, invest it, or send it overseas. That money doesn't trickle down, and working Americans at the losing end of the tax bill will not see it in their paychecks.  The American people deserve a better deal than this budget resolution offers. I know President Trump and the leadership on the other side of the aisle are desperate for a legislative win. They have spent an entire year trying to ram through the partisan TrumpCare healthcare bill that would upend our entire healthcare system, kick over 30 million Americans off of their insurance, and make massive cuts to Medicaid, harming our most vulnerable citizens, including seniors, children, and people with disabilities. The process, the tactics, and the product alienated even Members of their own party and Americans across the political spectrum.  After having failed with TrumpCare and with all of the other challenges we face, the majority leadership has set in this budget blueprint a deadline of November 13 for committees to produce tax cut legislation. All the other business we need to do must wait until we cut taxes for the wealthy.  I know there is room for compromise and that there are Members of good will on both sides who are actively working to address many of the real challenges I mentioned earlier, but tax cuts for the rich shouldn't be on our to-do list, let alone at the top of the list, as it is today.  One of the things we should be standing up for is our men and women in uniform by providing the revenue we need to support them. But when it comes to providing that revenue, this resolution takes a knee and gives revenue away to millionaires and billionaires.  This is a truly rigged process. Its only purpose is to fast-track tax cuts for the rich and cut funding to healthcare and other key initiatives that most Americans count on. For that reason, I will oppose this budget resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  With that, I yield the floor.

549,topic-id,907,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill, 585, the Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.  This bill strengthens penalties against those who retaliate against whistleblowers, adds protections and opportunities for whistleblowers placed on probation, and ensures Federal employees have a greater knowledge of whistleblower rights and protections.  Specifically, this bill forbids a supervisor from taking or threatening to take action against an employee because they refuse to obey an order that would violate a law, rule, or regulation.  I want to thank Senator Ron Johnson for his persistence in pushing this legislation even after the former Senator Harry Reid shut it down last  What a poignant and meaningful gesture to name this bill after Chris Kirkpatrick, a VA employee who took his own life after being subjected to cruel retaliation from VA officials. I hope it puts in perspective the immense emotional burdens that victims of retaliation face.  Mr.Speaker, this issue is personal for me. Unfortunately, I have seen exactly what retaliation against whistleblowers looks like, how easy it is to get[[Page H7933]]away with it, and why we have to put a stop to it.  Last week marked the 3-year anniversary since the director of the central Alabama VA became the first senior manager in the country fired as a result of the wait-list scandal. That was a major step towards turning around one of the Nation's worst VA systems and restoring trust with the veteran population it serves.  Mr.Speaker, I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it would have never happened without brave whistleblowers inside the VA telling me the truth.  Two brave individuals in particular, Sheila Meuse and Rich Tremaine, told me the truth about major instances of misconduct and mismanagement when no one else would. Seeing no other way to achieve change, they finally told their story to the media, at great personal risk to their careers.  The stories that emerged from these exposures were almost unbelievable:  More than 1,000 X-ray cancer screenings were lost and unread for years, even though some showed malignancies. When alerted to the problem, top administrators tried to cover this up.  A pulmonologist manipulated more than 1,200 patient records but, even after being caught twice, was still given a satisfactory review.  A central Alabama VA employee took a recovering veteran to a crack house and bought him drugs and prostitutes in order to extort his VA payments. Even when caught, this employee was not fired until a year and a half later when we exposed it in the newspaper.  Mr.Speaker, this behavior is egregious, and, trust me, there is a lot more where it came from.  However, had it not been for the courage of those on the inside to expose this wrongdoing, the world might not have ever known. To me and to the veterans whose lives they might have saved, they are heroes. But that is not how they were treated by VA officials. They were treated as enemies and outcasts, all because they tried to do the right thing.  Rich Tremaine actually testified here before the Veterans' Affairs Committee, detailing the systemic way that some VA officials attempted to silence and marginalize him. The effects of him blowing the whistle on wrongdoing follow him to this day, far away from Montgomery,  Mr.Speaker, my experience working to clean house at the VA taught me a fascinating and frustrating truth about the culture in some parts of the The system routinely goes out of its way to protect those who don't do their jobs or even harm veterans, but then goes after those who try to stop that misbehavior.  For years, because of poorly written civil service laws and powerful unions, too many VA employees got the message that misconduct, negligence, and poor performance would be tolerated, but blowing the whistle on that kind of behavior would not be.  I have seen it too many times. All too frequently, VA employees caught for doing the wrong thing are reprimanded, shuffled around to different jobs, or allowed to quietly retire, but those who try to do the right thing by our veterans by shining a light on misconduct are persecuted, intimidated, or worse.  While I am proud of the work that we have done for the last 3 years to put an end to this unacceptable culture at the VA, there is much work left to be done.  Mr.Speaker, there is a reason why Federal employees face retaliation for speaking up. It is not because people are just naturally mean or because there is some kind of misunderstanding. The reason whistleblowers face systemic retaliation is because it works. When a brave whistleblower faces intimidation or persecution for their action, every other employee sees it, and they know what will happen to them if they tell the truth. It has a powerful, chilling effect--one we saw firsthand in  They retaliate because it works. That is just wrong, and it is time to punish those who do it with harsher penalties. We need to rethink our civil service laws in this country to make sure public servants live up to the honor and responsibility of the public trust, and I believe that this bill is another positive step in that direction. Mr.Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to bring it to the floor by supporting this rule.  ",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7930.txt,1986,ASSISTANCE FOR PUERTO RICO,2017.0,11.0,October

1152,topic-id,4445,"Mr.Speaker, let me just note I believe that our President is doing a terrific job. I think that the last Presidents of the United States have left us an incredibly dangerous situation, and this President is trying to deal with it with strength and purpose, and, yes, being a forceful leader.  For example, during the Clinton administration, we provided $4 billion to $5 billion to North Korea, the same way the last administration tried to provide funds for  What do we have now?  A crisis with possible nuclear weapons and missiles in North That is called kicking the can down the road. They sure kicked it down to us, and now the people want to kick the can down the road with the No, let's not do that again and leave future generations to face the music that we left them.  Our President wants to make sure that Iran does not become a nuclear power as long as it is controlled by radical, fanatic mullahs who don't even represent their own people. In fact, if Iran was more peaceful and actually more democratic, then we wouldn't have to worry about that because they wouldn't want to have a wasteful program of nuclear weapons.  Those are the type of issues we face today. We face a lot of uncertainties at home and abroad, and it behooves us to look for explanations for the shifts in power, the dangers, and the influence that are taking place in the world today.  Europe, along with the United States, for five decades, seemed to be the center of world order and progress. NATO, the European Union, and the common market all seemed to be the epitome of sophisticated and proper governance needed to offset humankind's destructive and combative inclinations. World Wars I and II had undercut, if not destroyed, the expansion of classical liberalism that was in the process of retiring royalist and imperialist domination of the world, which, of course, is where the world was at the turn and the beginning of the 20th century as classical liberalism began to replace imperialism and monarchy.  Yes, the two World Wars that we experienced were traumas that still impact our lives. The Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I was the last gasp of European colonialism.                              {time}  1800  Maps drawn at that international gathering brought on World War Some of those other lines that they drew on that map plague us to this day.  Those national borders mandated by the Versailles Treaty made the world temporarily tranquil. Maybe we just heard about that a few moments ago, how we have got to overcome the tragedy right now, like we did in Korea, by not having confrontations with those people who were engaged in hostile activity.  Yes, the Treaty of Versailles gave the world temporary tranquility, but doomed following generations to instability and conflict. Such future challenges were left to the League of When that failed, the baton was passed to the United  Humanity, obviously, hoped that global government, in one form or the other, would solve everything. The EU, the common market, NATO, and other multinational bureaucracies would demonstrate how nation-states can cooperate and achieve a collective peace, freedom, and prosperity.  Well, just as things changed dramatically after the 19th century turned into the 20th century, and it became a different world, so, too, is our world changing. We must make sure that we have turned from the 20th century into the 21st.  The 20th century was dominated by the wars and by the defeat of the Soviet Yet we are plagued with conflicts and upheavals that can be traced back to border and sovereign decisions made long ago by people who are now dead, not only from the 20th century, but, as I said, from the end of World War  Many of the confrontations between various nationalities that we face today could be solved and the greatest threats of violence, insurrection, and war itself could be defused if our world would again recognize the right of self-determination.  It seems to have been forgotten that the United States was not only founded on the principles of liberty and independence, but also of the right of people to demand their rights, and, yes, that right of independence. They had a right to declare their independence.  This was the revolutionary idea that people have a right to select their government. This was the revolutionary idea that gave our Founding Fathers and Mothers the moral high ground to free themselves from the British Without this, they probably would not have won, if it were just a battle between powermongers.  This was what the fundamental beliefs were: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but also the right of people to declare themselves free and independent to create a country based on shared beliefs and shared ideals and values.  This is what we hope--those shared values and beliefs in liberty and justice--are the things that unite us today. That is what united had our Founding Fathers and Mothers and that is what made us a nation. After all, we don't have one race or one religion or one ethnic group to identify us as being Americans and create that unity.  But that said, there are many other countries of the world whose nationalism and patriotism are based on the fact that they have an identity with other people that share their cultural and racial identities. This is what unites them as a people. They are ethnically the same, they are culturally the same, and they have the same type of national and racial roots in their past.  Yes, this is what most countries are like. That is what defines a nationality. Recognizing that people of similar values and culture do not want to live in the subjugation of others has been ignored and/or rejected by the powers that be throughout the world.  So we live in a world where this idea of just recognizing that people want to be like people with similar people. For example, you have differences between Catholics and Protestants in many areas of the world.  Yes, they like to have people who maybe speak their same language and have the same culture, enjoy the same music. There is nothing wrong with people identifying others as being part of their national family. We should promote that as a positive, rather than as a negative. We should encourage people to work together.  There are many, for example, Jewish charities, which is wonderful that Jewish people now, because they have gone through a certain amount of oppression throughout the world, take care of each other in Jewish charities. We have that. We have Catholic schools and different things.  Yes, it is meant because people do share certain values that they can work together on. That is a good thing. However, the idea that people like that might want to be in their own country, which is what our Founding Fathers said, because it was only shared values, it wasn't specific that we wanted freedom of religion for all people.  Well, today the world is threatened by people who want to be independent of domination of others who don't share their same values and their nationality. The reason why it is being rejected is basically by the power brokers throughout the world because it threatens those in power with losing authority over people who don't want to live under their domination.  That is what self-determination is all about: letting people decide their own fate. If a majority of people in an area want to be independent of a country, that is what they should be, according to our Declaration of And this is something that brings a[[Page H8027]]more peaceful world, rather than trying to have subjugation of one people by another.  There has been a major cause of conflict in the world today when people don't recognize that, yes, there are others who feel that they are being oppressed by being forced under the jurisdiction of a particular government. They would like to have their own independence.  This, of course, has been especially true where people, since the end of the Cold War, have started looking at their own self-identification. When the right of self-determination is recognized, disputes are usually settled peacefully, as happened when, for example, after the fall of communism, the Czechs and the Slovaks, who had one country before, under the Treaty of Versailles, Czechoslovakia became the Czech Republic and the Slovak Well, that is fine. It is a good thing that they were able to separate. Now they can be friends.  But when they were one country, if the Czechs and Slovaks felt like they were being oppressed, they weren't satisfied. It was a good thing to permit them right off the bat: If you don't want to be part of the country with us, yes, you can be a separate country. Otherwise, there would have been turmoil at one level or another.  We also saw a peaceful solution in countries like Yugoslavia was breaking up, Tito was dead, the Cold War was over, and guess what. Slovenia and a bunch of other republics within Yugoslavia wanted to be independent, and they were able to do it.  Well, perhaps they were able to do it because the Serbs had already launched attacks on the Croatians and the Kosovars and other people in Yugoslavia that now was splitting apart because these people wanted to be independent and free, but the Serbs attacked them.  They didn't attack Slovenia, because I think by that time they realized that they could not succeed going to war with all of these various groups. Had the Kosovars and the Croatians been free to go and separate and become independent countries--as Croatia is today, and as the Kosovars would like to be, and as we are trying to help them to be--that would have been better for It would have been better for everybody. There would have probably been by now an agreement for some kind of free trade zone.  Instead, when the Serbs used force to keep those people under its jurisdiction, we had violence throughout the Balkans that has lasted for several decades. That is a tragedy. We should be working today in the  Let me just note that the Serbs today are an example of people who are reaching out, for example, to the Kosovars and others to try to find peaceful solutions and trying to come to some agreements that will make peace more likely.  But, again, if you would have had people who were under their thumb, nobody would be talking to them because they would be afraid of them. People who treat other people as equals and have rights as people in the world, they are more likely to reach understandings that are of mutual cooperation that will bring peace to the world.  I am not trying to say you have to submit yourself to some other group of people. The former Soviet Union, Ukraine, and other of the so-called Soviet republics were actually permitted at the end of the Cold War to, basically, peacefully establish their own independence. I know it is not as simple as that, but it happened in a peaceful way in which thousands of lives were not lost trying to force groups of people who do not want to be under Moscow's control.  Those people, whether Ukraine or elsewhere in the Baltics or the Balkans, had the right--and also in Central Asia--and people were permitted to have, basically, an independent government free from being only suppressed by Moscow and have to follow its orders.  That happened relatively peacefully. Had that not happened, there probably would be conflict throughout that part of the world today. There certainly would have been, as communism faltered in Russia itself.  So it took a lot of prodding for us to make sure that the Russians in the Soviet Union, in Moscow, understood that they could not keep people under their thumb. It was the Cold  Thank God, we ended the Cold War peacefully, because that was the great gift that Ronald Reagan gave to us. I am very proud to have served with Ronald Reagan for 7 years in the White House as a senior speechwriter to the President for 7\1/2\ years, as well as being a Special Assistant to the President and very involved with his efforts to try to move peace in the world. A lot of it was peace by recognizing people's right to independence.  Look back, for example--Ronald Reagan was an Irish American--at the needless violence that the British perpetrated and what happened in Ireland because the British insisted that the Irish be kept under British rule for so long, when it was clear that the Irish people wanted to be independent of Great  Look at what happened, in contrast, in Singapore and Malaysia, where the British just peacefully permitted those countries that were basically under the domination--they were part of Great Britain and the British Empire--to leave and establish their independence peacefully. Then Malaysia and Singapore separated from Great Britain, and then separated from each other, peacefully.  But in any one of these cases, if somebody demanded that these people stay in this particular status within this particular government, there would have been a lot more violence.  When self-determination is respected, peace is more likely. When a people are subjugated to the orders of a government in a country they don't want to be part of, violence is more likely.  How easy is that?  Special interests and power elites throughout the world are not so inclined to this obvious reason.  Why?  Because it is not in their interest to let people just go when they have them right there under their control.  So let's look at a few examples where self-determination has manifest itself in conflict.  Today, one of the greatest conflict areas of the world is the Middle Again, many of the conflicts that we have seen, if not a majority, can be traced right back to the Treaty of Versailles, right back to World War I, and the decisions of colonialists and imperialists and royalists to draw borders in the Middle East, just as they did in Africa and elsewhere, which made no sense.  Yes, we ended up separating whole nations. For example, one nation of people that we are aware of today are the The Kurds were separated into various countries in the Treaty of Versailles by these British and French colonialists.  And we are supposed to just abide by their decision of what the borders should be today, 100 years later?  No, I don't think so.                              {time}  1815  The Kurds, of course, were not living just subjugating themselves to what they had been dictated. No, the Kurds have been our greatest ally in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism, and what they are doing today and what they just voted on recently was they had a vote to determine if their people wanted self-determination and wanted to be an independent country from  Yes, that was a good thing, and we should recognize that. They won overwhelmingly, and we should look at the map of--we should say a map of the Middle East needs to be changed so you can have a Kurdistan that flows all the way from Turkey and Iraq and Iran and There are more, for example, Kurds in Iran than there are in In Turkey, there are more Kurds, and, of course, in  This should be a modern country. Why are we letting this turmoil go on when our greatest allies are looking for their own self-determination and these other countries are becoming or are already our enemies? Yes, it will behoove the United States to support the independence of Kurdistan and all the We should support in bringing together these Kurdish people as a nation, because that is what they are. They are a nation without a state. Let them have their country.  There has been so much bloodshed in trying to repress the Kurds from the Iranians, from the mullah regime, but also the Shah before him. The Kurds were oppressed by Saddam Hussein,[[Page H8028]]and right now, what we have is a repression of people even in Iran where the mullah regime is oppressing not only the rest of its people, not only the other people who make up Iran, but the Kurds, in particular.  Look at what is going on with the Baloch, for example. Now, a small group--there are groups of people. There is an area in Iran where the vast majority of people are of the Baloch extraction. They would like their independence. They deserve their right to self-determination, and they are not suffering from the oppression of  By the way, if we are going to try to deal with Iran, let's not ratchet up our military and threaten to attack them that way. Let's ratchet up our support for people like the Kurds and the Baloch and the Azaris and other people who live in Iran who don't like the oppression of the mullahs, and we can even be supportive of the Persian people who hate the mullah regime.  These are not our enemies in It is the mullah regime, the fanatics that would drop a bomb on us and not even think twice because they think they are doing God's work. They are the enemy. So we need to be supporting, for example, the Baloch, when I talk about in The Baloch are also persecuted, mainly persecuted by the Pakistanis who have them under their thumb, and they murder people constantly. They pick these young people up and they murder them, and then they drop their bodies in little villages just to show people what is going to happen to them if they try to resist Pakistani authority.  This is the history of Right now they are doing it to the Baloch, to the Sindhis, to the Singhs, you name it. You have got just a group of people--except for, of course, the Punjabis and then others, the Pashtuns who control that Government in  Well, remember what happened before. We have seen it before. When the people of Bangladesh wanted to be a little independent of the Pakistani Government, have some way to, you know, control their own lives and control their own government, they were brutally repressed by the Pakistani Government, and that is what led to, basically, the uprising of the people in Bangladesh when they freed themselves.  Remember, that same type of oppression is continuing not only on the Baloch, but, for example, the populations that came over from India, after India and Pakistan split. A lot of them went to Those people in Karachi now, there are people who want to have Karachi--it is like a Singapore of that part of the world, an independent. That is what they want to do because they have a right of self-determination.  They don't want to be subjugated by this corrupt, militaristic, proterrorist Government in We should be siding with people like that who want their independence and believe in these same values that we believe in.  Another example of that, of course, is what we see in Spain today. Today, of course, now there are groups of people who live in Catalonia is a province with a long history in People identify themselves as Yes, Spanish, but also They should have a right to vote on whether or not they want to remain part of Spain, whether or not they give up their sovereignty to a central government in Madrid or do they want to have a government of Catalonia that they can have their own government, and yes, their own sovereignty.  Well, the Spanish overreaction to the efforts of the Catalonians just to have a poll--basically it was a vote on independence, but it was--you know, basically it had to be recognized for it to have effect. But instead of letting them do this and just saying, ``Well, it has no legal effect,'' instead, the Spanish Government came down with brute force and conducted violence, as you would think violence coming from terrorists would exert on a group of people in It was their own government that was exercising violence and force and intimidation against the people of  Now, of course, the people of Catalonia are united because they know the brutality and subjugation of what is going on with  Now, the British knew how to do it. Unlike Madrid and Spain, the British permitted their people in Scotland to have a vote, and that was a wonderful thing. The Scots had their vote, there was no interference, and if they didn't want to be part of Great Britain, they didn't have to be, and that was a wonderful example to the world of how you should do this.  Now, the Scots decided to stay part of England, part of Great That is fine, but they had their chance. The people in Spain weren't given that chance. No, instead their government came down and beat them up when they tried to go to the polls. And let's say also, the British seemed also to be demonstrating, they believe, in self-determination.  They are exiting--they are taking the Brexit issue of whether or not you should have Britain as part of the EU and the common market. That vote that they allowed their people to decide, it wasn't decided by an elite. The Brexit vote let all the people of Britain decide whether or not they were going to be basically part of a subjugated people in Europe or whether they were going to be an independent force and a nation, which is their history as a people of Great  I am proud that they permitted Scotland to vote, and I am also proud that they voted not to subjugate themselves to the EU and to the common market, et cetera.  We need to make sure that we stay true to our principles and have a vision about what this world will be. If you are just looking at things of what we can do every day, Ronald Reagan succeeded because he had a vision of a peaceful world based on those individual rights and those concepts of freedom and democracy that were at the heart of the American experience, but also an America that encompassed people from all over the world.  Reagan had a vision, and it wasn't to get into a war with the Soviet Union and destroy communism. Reagan's vision was let's have--yes, we have to have strength in our military in order to defeat this enemy of Soviet communism, because it was threatening the world peace. It was taking over countries and overthrowing governments and replacing them with atheist dictatorships. Reagan knew we had to stop that.  Just like today, our primary enemy today is no longer the Soviet Union because Reagan helped eliminate the Soviet Union, the communist threat. The threat today is radical Islamic terrorists who will murder our people and are murdering people all over the world and murdering people in their own countries in order to terrorize them into submission.  Well, the bottom line is, Ronald Reagan's vision succeeded with Russia because, at that time, it was the Soviet Union, and now we have a Russia that we have so much more potential.  Now, there are a lot of flaws. There are a lot of flaws in the Russian Government, and there are things that we have to make sure that we are taking care of and standing firm on, but, by and large, we have to understand that they, today, are being attacked and murdered by radical Islamic terrorists as well. They know that, and they know the dangers that we face because they face a common danger.  We need to work to build a new alliance because what is happening is, Islam is making such inroads into the stupidity of our western European allies that the western Europe that we know--here again, time is going on, 19th century into the 20th century. Now we are in the 21st century. The 21st century will see that Europe becomes a whole different place than what it has been for the last 150 or 200 years.  There will be Islamic countries in Europe, and they will be, then, either part of or they will not fight against a radical Islamic terrorist threat that today threatens the peace of the world just as the Soviet Union did that 10 years, or I should say, 10 decades ago.  So with that, we need a vision, and one vision that we should have is, number one, a vision of self-determination that we all agree on.  Number two, let's make sure that we ally ourselves in a positive way with people who are not going to be weakened by the onslaught of I would suggest that America will be a more peaceful place and our country will be more secure and the world will be more peaceful and secure if we establish a new relationship in which we are[[Page H8029]]watching out for each other with four countries. The United States, of course; the other one is India, and I will soon be going to In fact, I will be going to India tomorrow. And number three, Japan; and number four,  Now, there is some work that needs to be done to make a coalition like that real, but a coalition of those countries working together, not mandated that we have to do this and we have to subjugate ourselves to decisions of what the four say, but, instead, seeking out cooperation with those countries where there is mutual benefit to do, we can make this a better world. We can secure our prosperity and secure the peace of our own country and the security of our own country.  So with a vision and with a recognition of fundamental things like the right of self-determination and the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that our Founding Fathers talked about, and limited government where they said government only derives its just powers from the consent of the governed, let us champion these values and these ideals.  Let us have a vision for the future, as Ronald Reagan did, and we can make this a more peaceful world as we side with people all over the world who want to control their own destiny by having their own nation rather than being subjected to someone else.

This multimillion-dollar government handout to a private corporation is bad policy. It places more military-grade[[Page H8006]]weapons on our streets and in our communities.

It is now more urgent than ever that we take meaningful action on passing gun safety measures. That should be our priority, yet here we are taking a step backwards.  Instead of bringing legislation on the floor to ban the manufacture of bump stocks that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, instead of being on the floor to ban the sale of high-capacity magazines used to inflict widespread carnage, or instead of being on the floor to expand background checks to all commercial gun sales so that felons and the seriously mentally ill and terrorists cannot obtain access to dangerous weapons, we are here debating a provision that increases a number of military weapons on our streets.  I know we can uphold the Second Amendment while taking reasonable steps to reduce the toll of gun violence inflicted on our communities. Putting nearly 100,000 more military-grade firearms designed for Army use into our neighborhoods is not a reasonable step in the right direction.  According to its text, the provision included in this bill mandates the immediate transfer of an unlimited number of guns to the Civilian Marksmanship Program for sale to the public.  This program was originally created to instruct Americans in marksmanship, promote firearms safety, and conduct friendly shooting competitions in controlled environments.  The NDAA provision we are speaking of today would turn this program into a mass firearms retailer, with the new mission to sell as many military-grade weapons to the public as possible. It defies logic and common sense. Gun violence has become a public crisis.  So I urge my colleagues to join together and work across the aisle to decrease the scope and devastation caused by tragic mass shootings.

This taxpayer bailout maintains a program that has resulted in taxpayer-subsidized development and reconstruction of homes that repeatedly flood.  Madam Speaker, why are we not reforming this program that puts residents and first responders in harm's way? How much more debt are we willing to let this program pile onto the next generation?  Americans in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands need help, and I would have liked to vote for the relief portion of today's legislation, but the multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout of an unreformed program made the bill unacceptable.  I urge my colleagues to reconsider the path we are on. We could have had a bill that not only provided relief to hurricane victims, but would have provided relief for taxpayers and the next generation as well, but we did not.  We will get another chance for fiscal sanity in December, when we reconsider the additional disaster funding and funding for the rest of 2018. Let's hope we make better progress at that time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-12-pt1-PgH8015.txt,2158,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018--Continued",2017.0,12.0,October
181,topic-id,165,"Mr.President, this amendment relates to the child tax credit. It is abundantly clear that perhaps one of the most effective ways to deliver tax relief--tax cuts--to working families is through the expansion of this credit, as it is our hope to achieve during tax reform.  I think it is important to point out that the U.Department of Agriculture compiles data on how much it costs to raise children in the 21st century. Today, it is expected that middle-income families are going to spend $230,000 to raise their children. By the way, that does not include the cost of their going to college.  Being able to deliver relief to hard-working families through the expansion of the child tax credit, which is applicable not just against income tax but payroll tax, is perhaps the single most effective way to do that given the framework under which we will be working. That is what this amendment intends to reserve the opportunity to do.

645,topic-id,4452,"Mr.President, I am very happy the Senate is engaged in this debate on tax policy. It actually is long overdue. It has been some 30-odd years since this country has undertaken a massive reform of our Tax  It is interesting. If we go back and think what life was like back in 1986, it was just a different planet, a different world, different economics. So, at a minimum, our code needs to be modernized. Everybody who has run for office--certainly every candidate for President from both parties for over two decades now--has run on the promise of tax reform and the need for it. So this is a very important debate.  What we are debating now on the budget, so people who are watching at home understand--you and I at home think of a family budget as a plan on what you are going to spend money on, and that is what the Federal budget is. It is kind of an outline, a framework of how and the parameters under which the government would spend its money. Then you have to actually go out and spend it through a separate process called appropriations. So this budget creates a framework for how we are going to spend money in the year to come, and then it is going to be used as a vehicle to pass tax reform, which is obviously the way and the system under which we generate revenue for the government to pay for the things we need to pay for. That is the first debate. But obviously the debate on the budget has led us to this debate on tax reform, because that is the primary purpose this year it is being used as a vehicle for.  Why does that matter? There are a lot of speeches going on already about tax reform and how bad the bill is and how this is a giveaway for this group of people or that group of people. That is hard to do since there is still not a bill, and the reason there is not a bill is that it is going to be worked through the normal process of the  That was the criticism, for example, from my friends on the other side and many outside of this building in the press. The criticism was, you put together a healthcare plan, and you didn't even go through committee, no one had any input, and there were no public hearings. That is what they are going to do with tax reform, and that is what is going to produce a bill.  The only thing that has been put out is called a framework, and the framework basically says: These are some of the ideas we have. This is our starting point that we want to operate from. But we are going to go through the committee process, there are going to be votes, there is going to be an opportunity to weigh in and make differences, and from that, we intend to produce a tax bill.  So they can criticize the framework, I suppose, but to basically go out and start trying to convince people that there is a tax bill that will do this versus that when it is just not true and when you have a seat here in the Senate and potentially on the committee where you can actually weigh in about the specifics of what is going to be in the bill and what is not, I think it is unfair and disingenuous. In any event, that is kind of the way things go nowadays. So I look forward to that debate.  The second thing that has been an interesting development is hearing people talk about how horrible this is going to be, that this is going to add to the debt, and then all of a sudden a bunch of people who have never had any problem spending as much money as they possibly could out of the Federal Treasury are suddenly becoming deficit hawks.  Here is what is so interesting. If we were to turn around and say: Forget about tax reform. We are going to take $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years and we are going to use it for debt spending. We are going to borrow $1.5 trillion and use it to fund all these things the government is going to do--for example, one of our colleagues here has offered a plan to provide healthcare for everyone in America, paid for by the Federal That would cost tens of trillions of dollars. Over a dozen Members of the Senate have signed on to it as a plan. There is no plan to pay for it. It is not $1.5 trillion over 10 years; it is like tens of trillions of dollars over the next number of years. So there is a lot of concern there. It kind of boils down to we are prepared to borrow money and spend it so long as the government gets to spend it, but if this is money we are going take and give to you to spend, then that is a real problem, and that is irresponsible. That is the framework.  The second point I would make on the debt is, I believe the debt is a significant threat to the future of the United The problem is, we can't tax our way out of it, and we can't simply grow our way out of it. We have to do a combination of things. The first is, we have to grow our economy. The second thing we have to do is bring some constraint to future spending--not slash Medicare, not get rid of Social  My mother is on Social Security and This may surprise many people watching, but there are a significant number of people in my home State of Florida on Social Security and on As I said, my mother is one of them. I am an enormous supporter of these programs. I also look at those programs and I look at the number of people going into them and how long they are going to live, and the math tells you these programs are going to have some big problems in the years to come, which threatens not just to take them down but threatens to trigger a debt crisis in  We have to deal with the spending side and create a more disciplined way of spending in the future years to bring some certainty, but we also have to grow the economy. In essence, if you take a stagnant economy, no cuts in the world are going to get you there. You can't simply cut your way there, and you can't simply tax your way there. The only solution to our debt problem--and it happens to be good for America all around--is the combination of discipline in future spending combined with rapid, robust, and sustained economic growth.  As much as anything else, this effort of tax reform is, among other things, an effort to generate sustained economic growth and to do so in a unique period in the history of the world. This is not 1986. Our economy is not the only show in town anymore. There are now dozens of developed economies around the world that are following our example from the eighties--reduce taxes, reduce regulations, and, frankly, make investments in infrastructure and the like--and today they are no longer recipients of our aid. They are no longer nations looking to work with the United States to get a little bit closer to the way we are. They are full-blown competitors in the global economy.  Every 4 years--every 2 years, actually, once in the winter and the next 2 years in the summer, we send our best athletes in different events to the Olympics to compete. In our economy, it is the Olympics every single day. What makes it even more complicated is, sometimes our team isn't just made up of Our team is partnered with the Japanese team to create a company or the Mexican team to create a manufacturing chain. So that complicates it further.  The fundamental thing to understand is, America today is in a competition--by the way, a competition that doesn't[[Page S6501]]have to be one where they lose and we win or we lose and they win but a competition nonetheless. Every day, businesses, investors, people with ideas are making a decision: Where do I want to do this activity? Where do I want to create this new job? Where do I want to create this new company? Where do I want to innovate this new idea? Where do I want to hire people to do all of this? Do I want to do it in America or do I want to do it somewhere else?  We are not performing well in that competition. It is not just because of taxes. We have infrastructure problems that we have to confront. We have a higher education system that is not built for the 21st century. We are not teaching people, in sufficient numbers, the skills they need for some of the best jobs in the world. I have no problem with a 4-year degree from a liberal arts college. That should always be an option on the menu. We need a lot of plumbers, pipefitters, electricians, and welders. These are important jobs as well. In fact, oftentimes, they pay a lot more than a 4-year degree in political science will ever pay you. We need to do a better job of training those people in those fields as well.  We need to have an immigration system that is pro-American but a pro-American economy that allows us to compete for the best talent in the world. If you think about it, I don't see anybody complaining that their team just signed a guy who can throw 98-mile-an-hour fastballs, but he is from the Dominican If in sports we go out and find the best people, we should be able to do that in our economy as well. You can do that without hurting the American worker.  We also have to have a tax code that is competitive. It cannot be substantially more complicated and expensive to start a business or operate one in America than it is somewhere else because if we do that, we will lose. That, as much as anything else in this global economy, is hurting the American people.  You talk about putting America first. I think it is about allowing America to compete. I am not asking for an unfair advantage over other countries. We are just asking for a fair chance to compete because I believe the American people who have been given the chance to compete can outthink, outinnovate, and outwork anybody in the world, and our Tax Code is a key part of it.  The goal here is, when you hear a lot of this talk about businesses getting this or that deduction, we want to make America an attractive place to invest. We don't want people taking that money and investing all of it in another country. We want them to invest it here, invest it here to allow a company to grow and hire more people. We want companies to decide that this is the place where we want to hire. This is the place where we want to innovate. We have to have a tax code that reflects that.  We have to understand that the vast majority of American businesses don't pay taxes the way the big companies do. They pay the small businesses through passthroughs. A lot of them--you know them because I know them--are not sophisticated operations. They are successful, but they don't have an army of lawyers to deal with a complicated tax code and accountants who know every trick in the book. To them, the Tax Code hurts them, especially since they are paying on their personal rates.  That is why the personal side is related to the business side. These are things we need to deal with so we can be competitive, so we can have more taxpayers--not more taxes, more taxpayers. More people making more money not just improves their quality of life, it generates more revenue to pay for the bridges, the roads, and the national security of the United States of So tax reform, as much as anything else, is the growth side of this endeavor, and it is not the only thing we need to do, but it is an important thing we need to do if we are going to let America compete and win in the 21st century global economy.  There is another dynamic of the 21st century that is different from 1986. From that, I rely heavily on my own personal experience, not just today but growing up. In 1986, I was in ninth grade. My mom worked at Kmart, and my father was a bartender in We owned a home. We didn't have everything we wanted, but we had everything we needed. They were able to sustain a family and allow us to go to school--public school--go on to college and do those sorts of things on the salary of a bartender and a stock clerk at  I don't need to tell anybody here that there isn't a community in the country at this point, in the 21st century, where my parents could achieve the standard of living they had in 1986, for two reasons: everything costs more, and those jobs either don't exist anymore or have not kept pace with the cost of living.  Since the year 2000, up until today, my wife Jeanette and I have been raising four children in the 21st century. I enter it by telling you that while we certainly have been blessed to have more resources available to us than the vast majority of people who will be impacted by what we are about to do here, we certainly have enough people in our lives and certainly have had periods in our lives where we understand some of the challenges facing people today. Here is the bottom line. Raising children in the 21st century is more expensive than raising children at any point in the history of this country. The reason is, there are more things to pay for. I know people may tell you that Wi-Fi and access to the internet is a luxury. I am sorry, you can't do homework in the 21st century with your kids if you don't have access to the internet, and that costs money. Not only do you have to have access to the internet, you have to have access to it on a mobile device. Those mobile devices cost money. Those data plans cost money. If you are paying for a data plan, you know how much they cost. It is not just about watching movies on Netflix or talking to your friends on Snapchat, you literally cannot do homework in many of the schools in the country in the 21st century unless you have access to it. That is why I personally have witnessed people at McDonald's at 6:30 in the evening because they have free Wi-Fi, and the single mom or single dad is there helping their kids with homework.  The cost of everything keeps going up, the cost of clothing, of food, of everything. You look at our Tax Code, and it has not kept pace with it. Let me give you an example. Accounting for inflation, from 1960 to 2015, which is when the latest numbers were available, the average cost per child of raising that child, in a middle-income family, went up by over $11,000. It is over $11,000 more expensive, accounting for inflation.  Here is a stunning figure. Again, this is different in different communities, but, by and large, for middle-income families--and by that we mean a firefighter and a teacher who are raising a child--they are going to spend approximately $230,000 to raise that child in the 21st century from 0 to 18. By the way, my oldest is now 17\1/2\. I have been told by plenty of my colleagues that it doesn't end at 18. In many cases, it begins to accelerate in some form or fashion--but, nevertheless, $230,000.  Let me tell you something else. That does not even include college. That doesn't even include going to college, which is another thing we are going through right now, which, by the way, is completely and totally out of control in terms of what they are charging. It is more than that. There are people out there spending $10 or $15,000 on SAT prep courses. For the life of me, I don't understand how these schools can expect someone who comes from a single-parent home in a poor neighborhood to keep pace with people who are having these sorts of resources available to them, but that is another topic for another day. That is a cost that is involved in all of this.  How about childcare? In 38 out of 50 States, childcare is more expensive than college. Think about it. Let's say you take home $900 a week, and childcare is $250 or $350 a week. That is one-third of your paycheck just for childcare. These expenses are reducing the ability of families to afford to have children and to raise them. These costs keep going up.  One of the things we have offered as a partial solution--it is not going to solve every problem--is to increase the child tax credit and to do so in a way that actually helps people. What it would do is it would reduce families' tax bills on a per-child basis, increasing the flexibility that family has at a time, for example, when childcare costs[[Page S6502]]have risen more than ever before and are already higher than they have ever been. We have to understand, the family is the most important unit in all of society. It is the most important institution in society. It is the first government. It is the first school. It is the core institution that underlies everything else we do as a nation. There is no more important job than any of us will ever do than the job of a parent.  If you think about our Tax Code, it says: If you invest money in a piece of equipment or a business, the Tax Code will help you with that, but if you invest it in the future of an American taxpayer, if you invest it in someone whom we are going to need to build the sort of economy and future we want for our Nation, the Tax Code does not really take it into account. That makes no sense to me.  I have two charts to outline how important this tax credit is to tax reform. Again, I am operating off the framework because there is no bill out yet, but based on the framework, the amount of tax relief a working- or middle-class family will get almost entirely depends--almost entirely--on what we do with a child tax credit.  Here is the first chart. This chart shows the average tax cut for American families if the child tax credit is doubled from its current size--not just doubled, but we make it refundable against payroll tax liability, which is the tax every American pays. For Social Security and Medicare, it is the first chunk that comes off your paycheck. No matter how little you make, everyone pays it. If we make the child tax credit double, and we apply it toward your liability on payroll tax, this chart--which is what I propose, and it is what Senator Lee and I have been working on, what Ivanka Trump has been advocating and we have been working with her office on--shows you what the impact of that would be. That is the blue line. You can see from the blue line that the chart begins with some cut, depending on how much money you make, and it begins to drop as the amount of--obviously, the more money you make, the larger the credit will be up to its limit because you can't get a credit if you are not making any money at all, even if it applies to payroll tax. You start to see that it also grows with the number of children because it is per child. It doesn't just phase off at two children. That is the blue chart.  What is the red chart? The red chart is if we do nothing or basically just do a gimmicky thing about it. Then you start to see that without the child tax credit being made refundable and without the child tax credit applying toward the payroll refundable, and without the tax credit being per child and sufficiently increased, this framework would be a tax increase. People would actually pay more, and the more children you have, the bigger your tax increase will be.  Suffice it to say, we have to do it. This red line cannot be what we wind up at. I don't think that is the intent of the people who drew up the framework, but that is where we wind up if we don't do it. I pulled that chart out to show you how important it is that we do it as part of this framework. It has to happen. It has to. It will not pass without it. It is the right thing to do. This is a pro-job, pro-family initiative. I actually think it is pro-growth. It is hard for economists to measure it that way, but it would be.  There are a lot of people who can't start a business because they can't afford to leave the security of a certain type of employment. The tax credit frees that up for them to be able to do it.  Let me get to the second chart. This shows you basically the same dynamic but now based on how much people are making, what kind of jobs they do. We arbitrarily picked out some of the jobs where many of us know people who are in these fields: a home health aide, a retail person working sales at Macy's, an office clerk--we all see office clerks every day--a truckdriver, an individual with a vocation to be a nurse, firefighters. Obviously, I have three firefighters in my own family. Again, of the $1,500 child tax credit, only the first $1,000 was refundable, and you start to see that red line here and how pathetic it is for these folks in these professions. It does not really do much.  Now look at the blue line. That is what we want to get to, which shows an at least $2,000 child tax credit being applied to their payroll taxes. Now you start to see the figures get better here. You start to see the home health aide getting about $1,000 in relief, the retail salesperson getting a little bit under $1,000, the truckdriver and the office clerk getting down to $1,400, the nurse getting down to about $1,200, the firefighter getting down to about $1,200.  A lot of people will tell you that $1,200 or $1,400 is not going to change the world, but it will help. I didn't say this was the solution to every problem. Another solution is to get these salaries up higher. That is the other part of it. Another solution is to get the cost of some of these things lower, like get a grip on the cost of obtaining college credits. Another solution is to provide more childcare options for people. Yet there is no way that this does not help. It helps. It helps the people whom we need to help, and it helps us get closer to the goal that we all have for this Nation, which is being a place of equal opportunity. We pride ourselves on equal opportunity, but I am telling you that we are lacking equal opportunity if, of two children who grow up in two different homes, one has access to quality pre-K education, then to quality schooling, and then to the right support for that schooling, and one does not. It starts by the time you are a junior and senior. It hurts you. It absolutely hurts you in your way forward in life.  This is not the solution to all of our problems--that would be misleading--but it is a big step in that direction. It would show in tax policy that we are supporting the most important institution in society, which is the family, and the most important function that any of us will ever have, which is being a parent. We are investing in America's future.  The children being raised--the two, three, four children--do you know who those are? Those are the people who are going to fund Social Security and Medicare when I retire and when many of you retire. Those are the people who are going to be starting the businesses. Those are the people who are going to be the backbone of our economy not in 50 years but in the next 10, 15, 20 years. This is the future of America--literally and figuratively the future of our Nation--in which we would be investing. We would be allowing their parents to make that investment on their behalf, who are the right people to be making the investment.  This has to be a part of whatever else happens. I think this has strong bipartisan support, and I know the White House supports it. I am optimistic that it will happen. The only thing that would keep it from happening is if tax reform itself goes down, but this has to happen. There is no choice but to do it. We have to, and it is the right thing to do.  I am pleased that we have come this far on it, and I look forward to the work in getting it achieved, but it cannot just be a gimmick, it cannot just be that we increase the child tax credit by a little bit. If we do not do it right and sufficiently and structure it in an appropriate way, we will be raising taxes on working families. That cannot happen. I know no one here wants to see that happen.  We will have a lot of debate about everything else, but this is the one that I hope will have strong bipartisan support as we move forward on tax reform, and I am excited to be able to work on it.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-10-18-pt1-PgS6492-3.txt,2084,REMEMBERING PATRICK FLANAGAN,2017.0,18.0,October

433,topic-id,254,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of 190, the Power and Security Systems, or PASS,  Mr.Speaker, this bill would provide a noncontroversial technical fix to a Department of Energy efficiency standard, and it has widespread bipartisan support.  I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues, Mr.Welch from Vermont, Mr.Brooks from Alabama, as well as Senator Gardner and Senator Cantwell, for their work in sponsoring this bill and getting it to the floor here today.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation would simply amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Department of Energy to issue a rule by July 1, 2021, which would determine whether energy conservation standards for external power supplies should be amended.  The rule must contain any amendment standards and would apply to products manufactured on or after July 1, 2023.  Mr.Speaker, current law exempts external power supplies for security or life safety systems from energy conservation standards until July 1, 2017. This bill simply extends that exemption to July 1, 2023.  Mr.Speaker, this clarification is necessary in order to exclude power supply circuits, drivers, and devices that are designed to power security alarms, lifesaving devices, and surveillance systems.  Mr.Speaker, as I stated, this legislative fix has widespread support from both houses of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, as well as from industry and the energy efficiency community.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this valuable piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

31,topic-id,431,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.3031, the TSP Modernization Act of 2017, introduced by Ranking Member Cummings from Maryland and Mr.Meadows from North Carolina earlier this year.  Federal employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Retirement System--known as FERS--enjoy the benefits of a three-part retirement structure. Those are a defined benefit pension plan, Social Security, and a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan known as the Thrift Savings Plan, or  With its low administrative costs and simple design, the TSP is an ideal retirement vehicle. Participants can choose from a variety of investment options, including index funds designed to track the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the Dow Jones U.Completion Total Stock Market Index, or a low-risk government securities investment fund.  Participants can also passively manage their investments by putting money into a Lifecycle Fund, which allows the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to purchase a combination of investments based on the year the employee is expected to retire.  Employees have a lot of options when investing their TSP funds, but when it comes to withdrawing their funds, the options are much more limited. This is because current statutory rules preclude employees from taking multiple post-service partial withdrawals. Employees cannot request a partial withdrawal or annuity purchase after making a periodic payment withdrawal election.  Statutory rules also require the purchase of an annuity if a participant fails to make an election by age 70\1/2\. The rules also restrict an employee's ability to make multiple in-service, age-based withdrawals.  The Board conducted a study in 2013, which found that separated participants moved $9 billion from the TSP fund to other, costlier institutions. Nearly one out of every three of these participants cited a desire for additional withdrawal flexibility.  The study also found that, among currently employed participants, the same ratio of participants requested additional withdrawal flexibility for age-based withdrawals to address life events that arise. This bill would afford those additional flexibilities to address those concerns.  The bill provides more control to Federal employees over their own retirement by allowing for multiple post-separation partial withdrawals and in-service, age-based withdrawals. H.3031 allows employees to change withdrawal elections as they grow older, and it allows the Board to avoid purchasing expensive annuities if a participant fails to make an election by age 70\1/2\.  This bill puts power and control in the hands of the employees that make our Federal Government run to make retirement decisions based on their personal situations.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I speak in support of H.378, introduced by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.Fleischmann), the Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2017.  The people in the best position to identify waste throughout the Federal Government are the employees on the front lines at the Federal agencies. They are the ones on the ground who know when agencies waste money. It is in the taxpayers' best interest to encourage Federal employees to report waste when they see it.  H.378 increases the incentive for Federal employees to report wasteful spending by authorizing a reward of up to $20,000 for blowing the whistle on waste. This incentive is especially necessary at the end of the fiscal year when too many agencies adopt a ``use it or lose it'' mentality regarding their budgets.  Some agencies fear that if they do not spend every last dollar in their budget, that Congress will somehow decrease their future funding. That dynamic leads to the most outrageous expenditures in the last week before the end of the fiscal year on September 30.  Under the structure put in place by H.378, agency leadership will also be able to verify that spending identified by whistleblowers is actually wasteful. This was a concern raised by our colleagues in the minority. We are thankful for their constructive work in getting this bill to a mutually agreeable compromise.  The bill also maintains Congress' constitutional role in the appropriations process. As we know, Congress is responsible for authorizing spending by the Federal Government, and this bill is careful to respect that authority.  After the agency's chief financial officer affirms that the spending in question is indeed wasteful, the agency must submit a report to the The President may then submit a recommendation to Congress to eliminate the wasteful spending in question.  H.378 is the result of a bipartisan process, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill as an example of what we can achieve when both sides put their minds to reform and husband the taxpayers' dollars.

410,topic-id,358,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I speak in support of H.2196, a bill I introduced with Ranking Member Cummings, Mr.Lynch, and Mr.Farenthold from Texas earlier this year to allow whistleblowers to disclose information to certain recipients.  Whistleblowers in the Federal Government should be able to tell their supervisors when something is wrong. That is true no matter what, but especially so in cases involving classified information, which implies a matter of national security.  If whistleblowers cannot make a protected disclosure to their supervisors, they are more likely to make an illegal disclosure to people or entities without the proper security clearances.  Under current law, whistleblowers in the intelligence community can make protected disclosures to their supervisors. However, whistleblowers dealing with classified information outside the intelligence community do not have that same protection.  Federal employees inside the intelligence community can blow the whistle to their supervisors, to the appropriate inspector general, and to Employees outside the intelligence community do not have those protections when it comes to classified information, and they have fewer options when it comes to blowing the whistle, except to put it in the hands of those who have no clearances.  Federal employees outside the intelligence community must be reassured that they can report wrongdoing to the appropriate people, including their supervisors. With this protection, whistleblowers will be less likely to disclose potentially sensitive information on waste, fraud, and abuse to the media, or other entities or individuals without the proper security clearance.  This bill allows whistleblowers to make protected disclosures of classified information to individuals within their chain of command. There are very few conceivable circumstances in which a whistleblower complaint to a supervisor would jeopardize national security, but such disclosures are not currently protected, as strange as that may seem.  There is no reasonable basis for concern about giving whistleblowers throughout the Federal Government the right to contact those individuals about waste, fraud, or abuse of a classified nature. These additional protections will make it easier for these employees to do the responsible thing when it comes to classified disclosures.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I speak in support of H.2229, the All Circuit Review Act, which Ranking Member Cummings of Maryland and Mr.Farenthold of Texas introduced earlier this year. It is critical that we guarantee whistleblowers have access to fair and efficient reviews of their claims of retaliation.  Between 1982 and 2012, whistleblowers could only appeal retaliation rulings made against them by the Merit Systems Protection Board, or the MSPB, to the Federal circuit. That monopoly led to the Federal circuit shaping key interpretations of whistleblower protection law without a check by any of the other circuit courts.  In 2012, to the wide acclaim of the whistleblower community, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act ended the Federal circuit court's monopoly over whistleblower retaliation appeals. The result, as expected, was better case law and more expeditious appeals.  As a pilot program, that expansion was set to expire 3 years after enactment. In 2014, Congress acted to extend the program until November of this year. Now, this highly effective program will expire next month unless it is renewed. The whistleblower community has benefited tremendously from the pilot program. There is no good argument against making this permanent.  Critics had feared that expanding jurisdiction over the MSPB appeals would lead to a torrent of cases for those circuits, swamping dockets across the Those fears have proved to be unfounded. Instead, the whistleblower community has benefited from other circuits having an opportunity to interpret Federal whistleblower case law.  H.2229 makes the all circuit expansion permanent, ensuring the benefits of the pilot program continue. This bipartisan initiative will put the question of appeal jurisdiction for whistleblower retaliation cases to rest once and for all.

656,topic-id,2038,"Mr.President, let me thank Senator Van Hollen for his very perceptive and comprehensive analysis of this budget proposal, which is designed to give huge tax breaks to people who don't need it and make terrible cuts to millions of families in this country who are struggling to keep their heads above water. I thank him very much for his remarks.  For the past 10 months, my Republican colleagues in the Senate have tried and failed to slash Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars. Even though the American people have stood up and said ``Don't do it; Medicaid is just too important,'' they keep coming back and back and back.  What I want to tell the American people today is, despite the fact that we were able to prevent cuts to Medicaid in the so-called Republican healthcare proposals, they are back again in this budget proposition calling for a $1 trillion cut in Medicaid over the next decade. Meanwhile, as Senator Van Hollen just pointed out, these cuts are designed to provide a $1.9 trillion tax break to the top 1 percent.  There may be some people who think it is a good idea to cut healthcare for working families and give tax breaks to billionaires. There may be some people, but I don't think there are a lot of people who think that makes any sense at all. So the amendment I am offering today, along with Senators Casey and Stabenow--which I believe will be voted on at 3 p.m.--is very simple and straightforward. It would simply prevent the Republicans from cutting Medicaid by $1 trillion, and it would be fully paid for by stopping the Republican effort to give the wealthiest people in America another tax break.  Plain and simple, this budget resolution is nothing more than a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the very rich, with huge tax breaks for billionaires and terrible cutbacks on programs that working families desperately need.  At a time when the middle class of this country continues to shrink, when families in the State of Vermont and all across this country are struggling to make ends meet, struggling to put food on the table, put gas in the car, pay their electric bill, pay their health insurance, maybe put away a few bucks to send their kids to college, it would be highly immoral and bad economic policy to take from these working families, to take from America's senior citizens, to give even more to the wealthiest people in this country--people, by the way, who are already doing phenomenally well.  At a time when 28 million Americans have no health insurance and millions more are underinsured with high deductibles and high copayments, at a time when so many of our people cannot afford the prescription drugs they desperately need, cutting Medicaid by over $1 trillion would throw at least 15 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently have.  It is beyond my comprehension how anyone with a conscience could support legislation that throws 15 million people off of the health insurance they have. Think for a moment about people who are struggling with cancer, struggling with heart disease, struggling with diabetes, struggling with life-threatening illnesses, and they have Medicaid is their lifeline to the healthcare they need.  I hope the Presiding Officer will get up here at some point and tell the American people what happens to those folks when they lose their Have you done any studies as to how many people will die? The truth is, there have been studies that have been done, and the answer is that thousands and thousands of people every single year will die if Medicaid is cut for 15 million people who lose their health insurance.  Let me say what happens when you cut Medicaid by over $1 trillion nationwide over a 10-year period. What it means is that not only will thousands of our fellow Americans die, it also means that a child with a severe disability--perhaps with Down syndrome or some other serious problem--will no longer be able to get the healthcare they need to adequately function. An estimated 11 million children--or 15 percent of all kids in the United States--have special healthcare needs. They may have conditions such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, autism, or one of a host of other serious problems. They may have mental health needs, such as depression, anxiety, or complications from a premature birth. Today, Medicaid covers 5 million--or 44 percent--of these children, providing them with coverage so that many of them can live at home with their families.  In addition to standard healthcare services, Medicaid helps these children get special education at school, long-term care, personal assistance from nurses and attendants, and may cover technology that helps them thrive. Medicaid may also cover social workers to help parents of children with special health needs make sense of all the bureaucratic redtape and get the services they need for their kids.  Medicaid provides these children with quality care. Ninety-two percent of children enrolled in Medicaid have had a primary care visit in the past year, which is higher than families with private insurance. If Medicaid is cut by $1 trillion over a 10-year period, children with special needs could be left to fend for themselves. What a terrible thing that is to do to families who are struggling today, to tell them that you are going to remove the support they get for their child who has a disability.  It is not just the children who will suffer if this bill is passed. It is our parents. It is the senior citizens of this country. What every person should know--and I fear many do not know--is that Medicaid now pays for over two-thirds of all nursing home care. Let's think about this for a moment. What happens if there is a $1 trillion dollar cut over 10 years to Medicaid? What happens to our parents and our grandparents and people with disabilities in America who have their nursing home coverage paid for by Medicaid today?  I may be wrong, but I don't recall that there has been one hearing to hear from groups like the AARP, to hear from senior citizen groups, to hear from doctors, to hear from nurses, to hear from nursing homes as to what the implications are of a $1 trillion cut in Medicaid and what it means to the families in this country who have loved ones in nursing homes. There may have been a hearing. I don't believe there has been. My Republican colleagues are going forward with this disastrous cut without even knowing what the implications are, not having heard from one expert about what this legislation would mean.  Tragically, all of us know that our country is in the midst of an opioid[[Page S6513]]epidemic, which has hit my State of Vermont very hard, and it is hitting virtually the entire country. This is quite unbelievable, but each and every day, more than 90 people die in our country from an opioid overdose, nearly 4,000 people every day begin abusing prescription painkillers, and--it is almost unthinkable but true--almost 600 people start using heroin every single day. How horrible is that?  Today, Medicaid covers one out of every three Americans who are addicted to opioids. Opioid treatment is difficult. It is expensive. It is not always successful, but I dare say there is virtually not one State in the country--I know my State is trying hard, we do better than most--that can say they now have the treatment capabilities available for people who are hooked on opioids or on heroin.  If we cut Medicaid by $1 trillion, there is no question--none whatsoever--that there will be a massive reduction in the kind of care available to people who have opioid or heroin addiction.  I find it hard to understand why my Republican colleagues would come up with legislation that would do so much harm to the working families of this country with a $1 trillion cut in Medicaid--and some of my colleagues in a few moments will talk about a proposed $470 billion cut to Medicare and what that would mean--all to give incredibly large tax breaks to billionaires like the Walton family, like the Koch brothers, like the Trump family. I would hope my Republican colleagues understand that what they are proposing is way out of touch with where the American people are.  According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, 60 percent of Americans oppose cutting A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll finds that only 12 percent of the American people believe the wealthy should receive a tax cut. Twelve percent believe the wealthy should receive a tax cut, while 62 percent believe the wealthy should pay more in taxes. In other words, what this legislation does is exactly the opposite of what the American people want.  On the other hand, we must be honest about it and acknowledge that we have an extremely corrupt campaign finance system. As a result of Citizens United--that disastrous Supreme Court decision--our campaign finance system has become even worse than it used to be. You have an example of where the American people say overwhelmingly: Don't cut Don't cut Don't give tax breaks to the rich. In fact, ask the wealthy to start paying their fair share of taxes. That is what the American people are saying in poll after poll.  There is another group--and we have to be honest about that--who do believe that billionaires should get more tax breaks, and there is a group that believes we should cut Medicare and Unfortunately, those are the people who make hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions to the Republican Those are people like the Koch brothers and a few of their billionaire friends--a small of group people, half a dozen, 10 people--who will contribute $3 to $400 million to elect candidates who represent the wealthy and the powerful, just in this 2-year election cycle--$3 to $400 million.  What this debate is about is not what the American people want. The American people are pretty clear about it. It is really about what the billionaire class wants. The billionaire class, despite the fact that their wealth has increased phenomenally, despite the fact that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, that is not good enough. The Koch brothers are only worth $90 billion. How are you going to get by on $90 billion? How do you take care of the kids? How do you put gas in the car? Only $90 billion. They need more.  If this legislation goes through and if the estate tax is passed--and I know people think I am not telling the truth because it is so unbelievable that anyone would propose this, but I am telling the truth--the Walton family, the wealthiest family in America, worth well over $100 billion, could get up to a $50 billion tax break. The Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family, worth over $90 billion, their family, their heirs will get over a $30 billion tax break. So from their perspective, putting a few hundred million dollars to help elect some Republicans is pocket change if your family is going to get a $30 billion tax break.  Let me just say, the legislation brought forth is really quite preposterous. It is based on a trickle-down economic theory of giving tax breaks to billionaires and corporations and seeing all kinds of new jobs being created. It is a theory that is fraudulent, doesn't work, hasn't worked, but it is legislation--legislation we are dealing with here--that does work very well for the billionaire class of  I have the radical idea--I know it is a radical idea--that maybe, just maybe the U.Senate should pay attention to the needs of the middle class, the working class, and lower income people in this country, the vast majority people, and not just a handful of billionaires.

What I do want to do is spend a moment on the amendment that will come up next, and that is that it would establish a 60-vote budget point of order to prevent the top 1 percent of Americans--people who are doing phenomenally well--from receiving any future tax cuts. It is not a radical idea to suggest that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the people on top are doing unbelievably well, at a time when the middle class is shrinking, now is not the time to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the very wealthiest families in this country.

982,topic-id,2781,"Mr.President, I know that budgets are not particularly sexy and exciting discussions. A lot of people wonder about a trillion here and a hundred billion there and what it all means. It means a lot. What it means is that if this horrific Republican budget is implemented, it will mean an enormous amount of pain for tens of millions of working-class, middle-class, and lower income people in this country. That is what this budget means.  After failing to pass a so-called healthcare bill that would throw up to 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently have--a bill that was widely opposed by the American people--Donald Trump and the Republican leadership are back again. While I totally disagree with what they are trying to do, I do appreciate their temerity. They are not giving up in terms of trying to protect the interests of the billionaire class against the vast majority of the American people.  The Republicans are now pushing one of the most destructive and unfair budget and tax proposals in the modern history of the United States--a plan that would do incalculable harm to tens of millions of working families, our children, the sick, the elderly, and the poor. The Republican budget we are debating on the floor of the Senate this week is the Robin Hood principle in reverse. Robin Hood took from the rich and gave to the poor. What this budget does is take from working people, the middle class, the elderly, and the poor[[Page S6426]]to give massive tax breaks to people who are already living in incredible opulence.  Donald Trump and the Republican leadership claim that their plan would provide a ``big league'' tax cut for the middle class. Nothing could be further from the truth.  According to the Tax Policy Center, by the end of this decade, nearly 80 percent--underline 80 percent--of the tax benefits of the Republican plan would go to the top 1 percent. Even more incredibly, the top one-tenth of 1 percent would receive some 40 percent of the tax breaks over a 10-year period. A tax proposal which gives 80 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent and 40 percent of the benefits to the top one-tenth of 1 percent is not a tax proposal benefiting the middle-class or working families of this country; it is a tax proposal designed to benefit the wealthiest people and the campaign contributors of the billionaire class.  This budget cuts Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over a 10-year period. That is kind of strange. The United States of America is the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all people. What the American people want, in my view, is to join the rest of the world and understand that healthcare is a right, that we should not have 28 million people without any health insurance and even more underinsured with high deductibles and high copayments. Yet what this budget does, unbelievably, is throw 15 million people off of the health insurance they have with a trillion-dollar cut in  I would hope that my friend the chairman of the Budget Committee might at some point during this long debate tell us what happens to somebody today who is struggling with cancer, with heart disease, with diabetes, with a life-threatening illness, who suddenly loses the Medicaid health insurance they have. What happens to that person? I would hope that some of my Republican friends would tell the American people what happens, because study after study tells us what will happen, and that is that thousands of people will lose their lives. They will die because they will no longer have access to the health insurance they had.  Further, this budget does what Republicans have not yet attempted to do during the past year in their so-called healthcare legislation, and that is to make a $473 billion cut to So it is not only a trillion-dollar cut to Medicaid, it is also a $473 billion cut to  Interestingly enough, I think many Americans will recall that during his campaign for President, Donald Trump told the American people that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and He said that over and over again. On April 18, 2015--this is just one quote of many--Mr.Trump said:       Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social      Security, they want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it      on And we can't do that. And it's not fair to the      people that have been paying in for years and now all of a      sudden they want to be cut.  That is Donald Trump running for  Well, I would say to President Trump: That is what you told the American people during your campaign, and now I hope you will tell your Republican friends right here in the Senate that they should respect the campaign promises you ran on and that if they pass a budget that cuts Medicare or Medicaid, you will veto that legislation.  I hope the President has the integrity to do that. I don't think he will, but I hope he does that.  Poll after poll tells us that the overwhelming majority of the American people do not want Congress to cut Medicare or In fact, I think in this country today, if you ask people what their deepest concerns are, they are concerned about jobs, and they are concerned about income. I think even more so they are concerned about the healthcare they have, how much it costs, and whether they are going to have it tomorrow.  Poll after poll tells us that the American people do not want Congress to cut Medicare--which, by the way, is the most popular health insurance program in this country--and they don't want to see Medicaid cut either because they know, among other things, that about two-thirds of nursing home dollars come from So if you have a mom or a dad dealing with Alzheimer's or some other terrible illness in a nursing home and massive cuts to Medicaid are made, what is going to happen to your parent who is in a nursing home? People know that. They do not want to cut Medicare and  A recent Pew Foundation poll finds that 85 percent of Republicans and 94 percent of Democrats want to either maintain or increase funding for  Sixty percent of Americans oppose slashing Medicaid, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll.  A recent Wall Street Journal and NBC poll finds that only 12 percent of the American people believe the wealthy should receive a tax cut, while 62 percent believe the wealthiest people in our country should pay more in taxes.  You have the American people saying: Don't cut Don't cut Don't give tax breaks to billionaires. In fact, ask them to pay more in taxes. That, by and large, is where the American people are coming from, whether Democrats, Republicans, or  Then the question arises: Why is the Republican leadership bringing forward a budget that does the exact opposite of what the American people want? The answer to that question, I am sorry to say, is not complicated. It has everything to do with a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires and the wealthiest people in this country to exert their influence over the political process. Increasingly, it is not the ordinary American middle-class worker the Congress listens to, but it is wealthy campaign contributors. Today, we have a corrupt campaign finance system that enables multibillionaires, along with some of the most powerful CEOs in America, to contribute many hundreds of millions of dollars to the political process.  Many of us believe that the concept of democracy is one person, one vote. You get a vote, and I get a vote. Sometimes you win; sometimes you lose. The majority wins. That is what we teach the children in the fifth grade and sixth grade: One person, one vote, majority wins.  Unfortunately, as a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, the American campaign finance system has been totally corrupted. We now have a situation where billionaire families can spend unlimited sums of money to help elect candidates who protect their interests, and not only can they spend that money, that is exactly what they are doing.  There was a very interesting article in the Boston Globe just the other day, October 14. This is what the article says. The headline is: ``The Koch brothers (and their friends) want President Trump's tax cut. Very badly.''  This is what the article says--but first, I should say a word about the Koch brothers. Not everyone knows who they are. The Koch brothers are the second wealthiest family in They are struggling to catch up to the They are not quite there. They are worth only $90 billion. They are struggling, but they are getting by, I am happy to tell you. With that $90 billion, what they are doing, along with a few of their friends, is spending hundreds of millions of dollars every campaign cycle to elect people, in this case Republicans, who support their agenda. This is what the article says:       The message from the billionaire-led Koch network of donors      to President Trump and the Republican Congress it helped to      shape couldn't be more clear: Pass a tax overhaul, or else.       As the donors mixed and mingled for a policy summit at the      Regis hotel in midtown Manhattan last week, just a block      south from Trump Tower, it came up again. And again. And      again.       ``It's the most significant federal effort we've ever taken      on,'' said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for      Prosperity, a Koch-aligned group with offices in 36      ``The stakes for the Republicans, I've never seen them this      high.''       Many in the Koch network, a vast group of libertarian-     leaning nonprofits and advocacy and political organizations,      described the upcoming legislative push for a tax overhaul as      an inflection point in modern political history, a do-or-die      moment that would define whether their efforts over the years      will pay off or not. The network leaders plan to dedicate      much of their two-year $400 million politics and policy      budget to the effort--though they wouldn't give an exact      number.  That is $400 million in the next two years to pass this piece of legislation.[[Page S6427]]This comes from a family, the Koch brothers, who are pretty upfront about what they believe. They do not want to cut Social Security or Medicare and They will take that, but that is really not their goal. They want to eliminate Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every other Federal program that provides help to the working families of this country.  By the way, just in passing, if the estate tax, which is part of the Republican budget, is repealed, we might want to mention that the Koch brothers' family would see a benefit of some $30 billion. If your family is going to get a $30 billion benefit, then putting a few hundred million dollars into seeing that legislation passed is not a difficult idea.  This budget makes clear who the Republicans in Congress are listening to, and it is not the middle class or the working families who do not want to see Medicare cut or Medicaid cut and who certainly do not want to see a $1.9 trillion tax break for the top 1 percent. I am afraid that my Republican colleagues are listening to their top campaign contributors who have told the Republican Party, in no uncertain terms, that if they do not get their tax cuts, they will stop providing the Republicans with hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions. How sad is that?  Think about the incredibly brave Americans who have fought for democracy over the years. Some of them never return from the battlefields where they have fought for an American democracy that makes us a country where people rule. Abraham Lincoln reminded us that we are a ``government of the people, by the people, for the people,'' not a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires.  Let's be clear about something else. The entire economic theory that Senate Republicans and President Trump have embraced with this budget is called trickle-down economics. That is what it is. You give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, and the benefits trickle down. They improve the economy. This whole theory is a fraud, and when applied, it has been an abysmal failure.  Since Ronald Reagan and George Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and deregulated Wall Street, trillions of dollars in wealth have been redistributed from the middle class and working families to a handful of millionaires and billionaires. Today, we have more wealth and income inequality than at any time since the 1920s. Today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. This budget would make a bad situation even worse by widening that gap with its trillions in cuts to social programs and gifts to the top 1 percent.  The Republican budget we are debating today would make horrific cuts to the needs of working families. Let me give you a few examples. This budget would give the wealthiest family in America, the Walton family of Walmart, a tax cut of up to $52 billion. Does anyone in their right mind think that the wealthiest family in this country needs a tax break of up to $52 billion? They do that by repealing the estate tax.  At the same time, however, if you are a low-income senior citizen--and we have too many of them in the State of Vermont--trying to figure out how to keep warm in a cold winter, you and 700,000 other senior citizens and families might not be able to keep your home warm in the winter because of a cut of about $4 billion to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance  This budget says that if you are the second wealthiest family in America, the Koch brothers, your family will see a tax break of up to $33 billion. But if you are a working class kid right now in high school in Vermont or in Texas or in Wyoming and you are scratching your head as to how you can afford to go to college and, in your computations, you are looking at what a Pell grant might mean to you, this budget would cut over $100 billion in Pell grants and other financial assistance programs.  This budget gives members of the Trump family a tax cut of up to $4 billion. But if you are a low-income, pregnant woman, you and over a million other new moms, babies, and toddlers may not be able to get the nutrition you need, thanks to a $6.5 billion cut to the Women, Infants, and Children Program, the so-called WIC  At a time when millions of working-class families all across this country are paying 40 percent or 50 percent or more for the housing they need, this budget eliminates housing assistance for more than a million families due to a cut of about $37 billion to the Section 8 rental assistance program and other housing programs.  At a time when the cost of childcare has skyrocketed, which is a very serious problem in my State, the Republican budget eliminates Head Start services for 25,000 children each and every year by cutting this program by some $3 billion.  In total, the Republican budget would cut more than $5 trillion from education, healthcare, affordable housing, childcare, transportation, and other programs that working people desperately need over the next decade.  What is alarming is that despite this incredible giveaway for the billionaire class, the Koch brothers and their network say that it is not enough. They want more. Let us be very clear that their eventual goal--not today, not tomorrow, but their eventual goal is to see that programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are completely eliminated.  Let me conclude by saying that this budget is not a budget for the people of It is not a budget for the people of Vermont or the people of Wyoming or the people of the United States of This is a budget for the billionaire class, which today is already doing phenomenally well. This is a budget for campaign contributors whose greed has no end, who provide millions of dollars to candidates who represent their interests.  This is a budget that must be opposed by the American people. I urge the American people to tell their Members of the Senate to vote no on this budget.  With that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-17-pt1-PgS6424-4.txt,1010,1600,2017.0,17.0,October
764,topic-id,535,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I would make two quick points on the importance of tax reform. One, I would refer to an editorial that appeared in yesterday's Wall Street What it talked about was the nexus between deficits and tax reform. Oddly enough, if you look at the numbers here of late and if you look at the 2017 CBO report, what it shows is that, in fact, deficits are creeping up again. Last year's number is $668 billion.  What they point to in this editorial was that a good part of the reason why deficits have escalated has been tied to anemic economic growth and that, unlike other recoveries that had been more robust in nature, the revenues had not come in as they have in past recoveries. As a consequence, deficits have exploded.  So if you care about the deficits--and I do, and I know that the gentleman from North Carolina does, and I know that other members of the RSC do. If you care about deficits, then you have got to do something about tax reform this year was, in essence, the premise of the editorial.  The other point I would make is this. In a capitalistic society, capital matters. In essence, it is a mathematical formula.  Savings drives investment, which drives productivity gain, which ultimately impacts standards of living or wages, which we talk about. There are only two ways of increasing or improving human productivity. One is with gray matter: you can build a better mousetrap because you have been well educated and you can think of something different. The other is with physical capital. One person with a bulldozer can move a lot more dirt than one person with a shovel.  Yet what we oftentimes forget in the debate on tax reform is how important it is that we encourage and, in essence, complement the efforts of those who are out there risking on a daily basis. So with that in mind, it is important that we have tax reform that includes people who are actually, again, building businesses.  Think about this: the top 25 percent of the earners out there pay 90 percent of the taxes; the top 10 percent pay 60 percent of the taxes.  Now, let's define that for just a second. If you are in the top 25 percent, that begins at $77,000. If you are in the top 10 percent, you are at $133,000.  Now, tell me this: When I talk to a truck driver and a schoolteacher at home, their combined income could be around $100,000. Are they rich? I would say no. But they are out there making the kinds of risks that are necessary to the building of capital that was exactly what The Wall Street Journal talked about.  If we want to do something about deficits, and if we want to do something about capital formation that is so necessary to raising wages, then we have got to do something about this equation. It is important that those earners and those small-business people not be left out, as is the case right now. That is yet another reason why tax reform is so important this year.

113,topic-id,1472,"Mr.President, first, on healthcare, my two good friends Senators Alexander and Murray have constructed a good, fair, bipartisan agreement that gives us a way forward on healthcare. It will offer stability in the markets, and it will help lower premiums.  We have seen President Trump's near-constant equivocation on the agreement. We shouldn't let it impede the progress of this very important bipartisan compromise. He is for the bill one day, against it the next. That is not uncommon; the President sometimes is for and against something in the same sentence. We can only hope he comes around again once he grasps what is in the bill.  The Alexander-Murray deal is not a bailout to the insurance companies at all; it is the opposite. We have taken pains to ensure that insurance companies do not reap any benefits from this program. That is what Alexander and Murray have done. They have explicit provisions in the bill to ensure that the cost-sharing program does what it is intended to do: Lower premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs for Americans who can least afford it.  I was reading an article this morning where they interviewed a retired manufacturing worker in Pennsylvania who was upset by the President's decision. The man said:       It seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class. . . .      He [President Trump] says he's going to make it better for      everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?  That is the question the President should ask himself. Ending cost-sharing hurts people, not insurance companies. Restoring cost sharing will help people, not insurance companies. Senators Alexander and Murray have made sure of it. I have talked to them about their language. It is good language, well intended. Maybe we can make it better. If the President has a suggestion, we welcome it, but as it is, it is pretty strong.  Well-intentioned Members on both sides should continue to sign their names onto this bill. I believe it has significant support within my caucus, and if Leader McConnell puts it on the floor of the Senate, I am pretty certain it would pass.  I urge my Republican colleagues to take a good, hard look at the bill and to cosponsor it. So many of my Republican friends have said: Why can't we be more bipartisan? This is a bipartisan agreement. It wasn't one party coming up with something and telling the other to be for it, as too often happens in this It was done together by the chair of the HELP Committee and the ranking Democrat of the HELP It is truly bipartisan, and it is a good way for us to go forward and set a metaphor for future bipartisanship.  Mr.President, now on the budget, today the Senate will vote on more amendments to the GOP budget resolution, which increases deficits by $1.5 trillion, slashes Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and sets up this awful, partisan process--the same one our Republican friends used in healthcare.  The Democrats could have offered an unlimited number of amendments on the bill, but this bill is so bad that we didn't want to be all over the lot. We wanted to focus on a few issues where we know the American people are overwhelmingly with us, not with the language in the bill.  Here is some of what we are doing.  We are going to make our colleagues say that they want to vote to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. After 8 years of crowing about debts and deficits under a Democratic President, the Republican deficit hawks seem to have flown the coop. This budget is going to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Our amendment would say: No, it should be deficit neutral. We have heard that for the last 8 years. Whenever a spending program comes about, I know our side says that spending programs grow the economy; their side says that tax cuts grow the economy. But if there is going to be an actual deficit, we should vote for it. Put your convictions where your votes are.  We are also going to make our Republican colleagues vote on whether they want to raise taxes on the middle class. The President claims that his tax plan will cut taxes, but it actually will raise them on millions of hard-working families. Today our Republican colleagues will decide whether they want to support those tax increases or protect the middle class from paying more taxes.  We are going to make our Republican colleagues vote on their specific proposal to eliminate the State and local deduction. Nearly one-third of all taxpayers take the deduction--red States,[[Page S6596]]blue States, everyone in between. As the chairman of the Finance Committee knows, 35 percent of Utahns take the State and local deduction. It goes right to the heart of the middle class and upper middle class, giving families tens of thousands of dollars in deductions so taxes are lower. The elimination of State and local deductibility is a sure sign that the Republican tax plan does not favor the middle class.  In fact, AP reported yesterday that, according to experts, the GOP tax plan may still allow corporations to claim State and local deductibility but not individuals. Did you hear that? Corporations can claim it, but individuals can't. Isn't that backward? It shouldn't be taken away from either one. What the GOP plan takes away from individuals and families, it makes sure remains for big corporations.  So today Democrats will ask our Republican friends to vote on our amendment, led by Senators Cantwell and Van Hollen, to protect State and local deductibility for middle-class families.  Senator Capito has an alternative amendment that is incredibly vague and leaves the door open to eliminating State and local. It doesn't say it will, but it leaves it open. That is why a coalition of groups, including the National Governors Association, the U.Conference of Mayors, and organizations representing firefighters, teachers, and sheriffs have just come out against Senator Capito's amendment.  Senator Cantwell and Van Hollen's amendment, by contrast, is crystal clear: no elimination of State and local. I hope my Republican friends won't vote to raise taxes on so many of their middle-class residents.  Mr.President, finally, every morning I hear my friends the majority leader and the chairman of the Finance Committee talk about the need for tax reform because the middle class is stuck in a rut and the economy isn't working the way it should for American families. I agree with that assessment. We need to do more to grow the economy, create jobs, raise wages, and put money in the pockets of average Americans, but when you hear the details of the plan they have to solve those problems, your head spins. Lower the tax rate on big corporations and the top 1 percent, repeal the estate tax, which goes only to estates of over $5 million, and eliminate critical middle-class tax breaks like State and local deductibility. In what world does that deliver middle-class tax relief or solve the problems we are talking about?  It is the same game they played with healthcare: Complain about high premiums, deductibles, counties without enough insurers, and then each Republican bill exacerbates the problem.  The Republicans slide in their favorite solution--tax cuts for the rich--as the answer to every ill. If the economy is doing well, Republicans push tax cuts for the rich. If the economy is doing poorly, Republicans push for tax cuts for the rich. If our healthcare system needs to be improved, tax cuts for the rich. It is entirely divorced from the real problems in the economy and our society.  Our economy suffers from massive inequality, which is growing, with a concentration of wealth at the very apex of our country's elite. The rich are doing well in God bless them; I am glad they are. American corporations are recording record-high profits. Look at the stock market, which reflects that. God bless them too. We hope they do well. But looking at the GOP tax plan, the American people have to wonder, is now the time to tilt the scales even further in favor of big corporations and the very rich? I believe the American people will reject that approach soundly and roundly, and after the amendment votes today, the American people will have a much clearer picture of what the Republican budget and tax plan is about.  There is still a chance to turn back from this budget and the one-party legislating that has stymied this I urge my colleagues on the Republican side to reject this budget. Come work with Democrats, and we can produce real, successful, bipartisan tax reform.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to both sides.

459,topic-id,2381,"Madam President, first, on the issue of healthcare, last week, President Trump committed two[[Page S6384]]acts of pointless sabotage of our Nation's healthcare system. He signed an Executive order that would give insurers more latitude to sell temporary, junk plans that are not only incredibly risky to the consumer but undermine the rest of the healthcare market by drawing healthy Americans out of the pool. Even worse, President Trump decided to stop the cost-sharing program, which reduces premiums, deductibles, and copays for 7 million Americans a year. There is literally no upside to the President's decision to end the cost-sharing program.  Because of the President's actions, premiums will go up between 20 and 25 percent, according to the Just today in Pennsylvania, we saw premiums rise by 30 percent as a direct result of the President's actions. Deductibles and out-of-pocket costs will go up by thousands of dollars. Deficits will rise by $194 billion because the government will have to pay more in subsidies to make up for the lack of the cost-sharing program, and the marketplaces will become less stable because more people will go uninsured.  The Republican Governor of Nevada, Brian Sandoval, may have said it best:       It's going to hurt people. It's going to hurt kids. It's      going to hurt families. It's going to hurt individuals. It's      going to hurt people with mental health issues. It's going to      hurt veterans. It's going to hurt everybody.  That is from Republican Governor Brian  Another point that the President should hear is that nearly 70 percent of the Americans who benefit from these cost-sharing payments live in States that Donald Trump won in the election.  Make no mistake about it--the President is deliberately undermining our healthcare system with these two actions. When premiums go up because of this action, the blame will fall on his shoulders.  There is a way out. The way out of all of this is for Congress to aggressively pursue a bipartisan healthcare bill that will take cost-sharing out of the President's hands by locking in the payments. For many months, Democrats have been pushing to stabilize the markets and to work toward a bipartisan agreement that would keep premiums down for millions of Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating a package that would include cost-sharing as well as some provisions that the Republicans want. These negotiations began long before the President's decision to end cost-sharing last week. I am encouraged by the progress of the negotiations, and I am hopeful that we are nearing an agreement that makes clear that we have no intention of supporting the President's reckless efforts at sabotage.  If President Trump is now supportive of an agreement that stabilizes and improves the existing system under the Affordable Care Act, we certainly welcome the change of heart. We have been asking for this for a long time. We hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in their realizing the damage the President has done, will join us in strengthening, not in sabotaging, the healthcare system.                       Tax Reform and the Budget  Madam President, now a word on the Republican tax plan.  This week, the Republican majority will likely move to pass a budget resolution that includes reconciliation instructions to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Amazingly, it also includes a total of $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Cutting taxes on the wealthy to be paid for by cutting Medicare and Medicaid? How many Americans want that--Democrat, Republican, Independent, liberal, conservative? The GOP budget makes it as clear as day that the Republicans will try to pay for a massive tax cut for the wealthy by cutting Medicare and It is the same formula they used for TrumpCare--cutting healthcare to pay for tax cuts for the rich. The American people rose up against that plan, and it failed. This plan should fail for the same exact reason.  Now the White House is out with a new report today, which reads that a giant tax cut for big corporations will increase wages for middle-class President Trump complains about fake news. Well, this is fake math, and it is as bad as any of the so-called fake news the President has complained about. This is a deliberate manipulation of numbers and facts that, quite frankly, is appalling. History shows that tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy and the powerful to the exclusion of the middle class. History shows that corporations will use tax cuts for CEO bonuses, stock buybacks, and dividends rather than for increasing worker pay or creating new jobs.  In fact, none other than Goldman Sachs concluded that shareholders, not workers, ``typically get most of the benefits of tax cuts.'' This is not a liberal think tank or Chuck Schumer talking; this is Goldman Sachs, which represents shareholders--a lot of them. The two authors of this plan, Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, who are from Goldman Sachs, should heed what their former employer says. Even Goldman Sachs is saying that the Trump tax cuts will not create massive growth or new jobs or higher wages. In fact, another recent report by Goldman Sachs predicts only the most minor growth effects from this tax cut, not more than 0.1 or 0.2 percent.  As the President likes to point out, the stock market is at record highs, and companies are raking in unprecedented profits; yet wages have remained relatively flat. The companies are already flush with money--record profits. They are not creating jobs; they are enriching their shareholders and enhancing their CEOs' salaries with stock buybacks. It is proof positive that companies already have the cash reserves but do not use them to boost wages.  To assert the opposite, which is that giving corporations and the wealthy a tax cut leads to higher middle-class wages, belies the facts and the history, and it is a blatant attempt to fool Americans into thinking that the GOP plan would benefit them when in reality it is a sop to the rich. No wonder our Republican friends cannot talk about what the plan does--cuts taxes for the wealthy and powerful. They have to hide it and say that this is job growth. Those are fake numbers, and I would like my friends on this side of the aisle to admit that they believe in trickle-down economics, because that is what their plan is all about.  Rather than helping the biggest corporations avoid paying their fair share, tax reform ought to reward those companies that create jobs and raise wages here at home. Similarly, tax reform ought to directly benefit the middle class, but the Republican tax plan slashes a key middle-class deduction in the form of the State and local deductibility.  Now let's talk about Vice President He is visiting Buffalo, NY--a city I love in my home Since Vice President Pence is traveling to Buffalo, I thought that I would share some numbers about how the elimination of the State and local deduction affects western New  In Representative Collins' district, which stretches from East Buffalo toward Rochester, 29 percent of the residents claim the State and local deduction. They get an average deduction of $12,125. In Representative Higgins' district, which is in the heart of Buffalo, 27 percent of the residents claim the State and local deduction, with an average deduction of $12,083. In Representative Reed's district, which is just south and east of Buffalo, 22 percent of the residents claim the State and local deduction, with an average deduction of $11,716. Their constituents get clobbered, as do just about all New Yorkers and so many in the rest of the country, when you eliminate the State and local deductibility. It affects the middle class and the upper class. The State and local deduction elimination is a dagger to the heart, not just to Buffalo but to Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, and all of Upstate New  Will Vice President Pence have the courage to answer questions about this deduction elimination? Will he tell middle-class New Yorkers that they are going to get a huge tax increase under this bill? When the Vice President arrives in Buffalo tomorrow, I hope he is prepared to explain why he wants to hike taxes on thousands of middle-class families in the Buffalo area, in the Rochester area, in the Syracuse area, and in the Albany area.  Eliminating the State and local deduction hurts the middle class, and it hammers the New York economy. Businesses, if they do not have this State[[Page S6385]]and local deduction, are not likely to relocate in Buffalo or Rochester or Syracuse or It also hurts homeowners. Make no mistake about it--if we get rid of the State and local deduction, the values of homes will go down. That is why the realtors are so opposed to this elimination. It is not just true in New York or in California or in Connecticut or in New Jersey; it is true across the whole country.  As for my dear friend and chairman of the Finance Committee's State of Utah, because of the great charity of his people--and so many tithe--35 percent of the taxpayers will get a huge, huge increase in their taxes with the elimination of State and local deductibility. So many of them do not use the standard deduction because they are so charitable, but they are penalized for that charity.  Eliminating the State and local deduction, while slashing taxes for the wealthy and huge corporations, will hurt middle-class taxpayers.  Now there are some efforts to compromise State and local deductibility. They don't work. Some have proposed letting taxpayers make a choice between getting rid of the mortgage deduction and getting rid of the State and local deduction. That is like saying: Should I chop off my left hand or my right hand, Mr.Middle-Class Taxpayer?  Others have said: Let's limit it to people who earn below $100,000. That still leaves lots of people at risk, particularly in high-priced areas like Long Island, and it doesn't reduce the deficit by much. It is estimated that a large percentage of the deficit will still go up.  It makes no sense to eliminate State and local deductibility. Vice President Pence ought to go to western New York, but instead of going just to a small business--and we want to lower small business taxes--he should go to a middle-class family in Amherst or in Orchard Park or Tonawanda and tell them that he is there to raise their taxes.                        Nomination of Tom Marino  Madam President, I want to address the President's nominee to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Representative  An article in yesterday's Washington Post described Representative Marino's advocacy for a law that may have prevented the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, from going after the worst practices of drug distributors. It is a profoundly troubling revelation about the man who has been tapped to lead the primary agency in our government that focuses on stopping the opioid crisis.  The opioid crisis was in part fueled by wholesale drug distributors sending millions of unnecessary pills into communities. As my friend Senator Manchin has pointed out, one company shipped 20 million doses of opioids to pharmacies in his State of West Virginia over a 5-year period. That included 11 million doses sent to Mingo County, WV, where the population is 25,000. There were 11 million pills sent to a county of 25,000 people over a 5-year period. No wonder there is a crisis.  What the Washington Post revealed yesterday was that Representative Marino worked to pass a bill in 2016 that made it ``virtually impossible for the DEA to freeze suspicious narcotic shipments.'' Confirming Representative Marino as our Nation's drug czar would be like putting a wolf in charge of the henhouse.  The American people deserve someone totally committed to fighting the opioid crisis, not someone who has labored on behalf of the drug industry. So tonight I am calling on President Trump to withdraw the nomination of Representative Marino for the We can do better. Senator Manchin has made such a call, and he is right. President Trump ought to withdraw Representative Marino's nomination.  If the President presses forward with Representative Marino, it will be another betrayal in a long line of betrayals on issues near and dear to rural The President's healthcare proposals would have put daggers into the heart of rural America, decimating Medicaid and rural hospitals. The President's tax plan lavishes the wealthy and the big corporations but does little for the working man or woman in rural The President promised several months ago to label the opioid crisis a national emergency, yet he still hasn't done it. He said this afternoon that he will finally do it next week. We will see.  By now, the idea that the President is sticking up for the forgotten man and woman in the forgotten parts of rural America should be dismissed. President Trump seems to have forgotten the forgotten parts of America, and his lack of action--we don't need talk; we need action--on the opioid crisis and his nomination of Representative Marino is just another example.                          california wildfires  Madam President, over the weekend, several parts of California were swept by some of the most devastating wildfires the region has seen. At least 40 people have died, thousands of homes and businesses have been utterly destroyed, and at one point over 100,000 people were evacuated. As Jerry Brown said, ``This is truly one of the greatest, if not the greatest, tragedies that California has ever faced.''  Our thoughts are with everyone affected by these wildfires. We are enduringly grateful for the firefighters and all our first responders. And our response here in the Senate must be to send aid where aid is needed.  For our country, this has been a devastating few months of fires and floods. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma buffeted Texas, Louisiana, and Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands are contending with a humanitarian crisis on an unprecedented scale in the wake of Hurricane Our job is to speedily send aid, and I am hopeful that we can pass another supplemental aid package this week as well as another more comprehensive package later in the year.

640,topic-id,2243,"Mr.President, yesterday the chairman and the ranking member of the HELP Committee came to a bipartisan agreement on a package to stabilize our healthcare law and to lower premiums. It was the product of months of difficult negotiations. Like all good negotiations, both sides gave some and both sides got some. The product is something that neither side is completely happy with but that both sides can move forward with. That is what a good, fair compromise looks like. It took work, and, at a time when bipartisanship is desperately sought after, this was not even just a flicker but a nice flame of bipartisanship burning brightly.  Then, a few minutes ago, President Trump tweeted: I am supportive of Lamar as a person, and also of the process, but I can never support bailing out insurance companies who have made a fortune with  There are many reasons to be vehemently strongly upset about this tweet and how wrong it is. First, frankly, the President doesn't know what he is talking about in the compromise.  It doesn't bail out insurance companies. It helps people who are sick and who need healthcare. It keeps their premiums low. It allows them to go to a doctor or get a medicine that they need.  Senators Alexander and Murray made sure that, in the provisions they were writing, the money would not go to the insurance companies but rather would go to millions of Americans who need help because they couldn't afford healthcare on their own.  The President ought to know what he is talking about when he tweets about bills because on this one, he had no understanding of what it is about. This helps millions of people. This keeps premiums down. This allows Americans--working class, middle class, many of whom are in rural areas in red States--it allows them to go to the doctor, go to the hospital, get medicine. Nothing bothers Americans more than when they can't get healthcare they desperately need for themselves or a loved one.  So, first, the President ought to know what the bill is about before he tweets. Clearly from this tweet, he doesn't.  Second, this President keeps zigging and zagging, so it is impossible to govern. Two Thursdays ago, the President called me in the gym and said: Let's work on a bipartisan solution on healthcare. It was his initiation. He first talked about, let's repeal and replace; I told him that is off the table. But I then said that Senator Alexander and Senator Murray are working on a compromise--and I outlined the basic compromise they were coming up with, that each side got something--and the President suggested that he call Senator Alexander and I call Senator Murray and encourage them. I called Senator Murray; he called Senator And he called Senator Alexander, from what Senator Alexander told me, several times to encourage him.  Yesterday, he called the Murray-Alexander deal a ``very good solution.'' Now, this morning, he says he can't support it. He can't support bailing out insurance companies that have made a fortune with He is wrong on the facts, as I mentioned, doesn't know what the bill is. We should have a President who actually knows the facts of bills he talks about.  Second, he is totally inconsistent. He is for it one day, against it the next day.  Mr.President, you cannot govern a country, you cannot keep America great if you don't know what is in the bills and don't have a consistent policy about them.  But he keeps zigging and zagging. Our only hope is that maybe tomorrow he will be for this again.  Finally, a word in general: We all know there are extremes in The hard right has a lot of power here. If every time the hard right says ``jump,'' the President says ``how high,'' his Presidency will be a failure. Yet that is what has happened repeatedly.  The hard right doesn't represent America on healthcare. Eighty percent of the people did not like the TrumpCare bill that the hard right supported--80 percent. The majority of Americans, by a substantial margin, want to see ObamaCare strengthened, not repealed. The hard right doesn't; they want to get rid of it.  If the President simply is responding to them, it is not leadership. He did the same thing on Leader Pelosi and I met with him. It was clear what we sought--approval of the Dream He agreed, provided there was border security, explicitly no wall. The next day, the rightwing attacked him. Laura Ingraham or one of those radio commentators said he should be impeached. I think Breitbart News called him Amnesty And he totally reversed himself.  That is not leadership, Mr.That is blatant fear.[[Page S6494]]  We all understand political forces. They push us all around. When you are President, you have an obligation to lead. And this Presidency has been so unsuccessful in accomplishing things--he can blame Mitch McConnell, which the President has done, or the Republicans in the He can blame the But really the reason that we are not getting anything done and his Presidency has been so bare of accomplishment is that this President is embracing a hard-right, extreme position that is very far away from what Americans want. His Presidency will continue to fail, continue to be a failure, if he continues to do that.  So I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, going back to the agreement, the agreement is fair, and it is down the middle. As I said, each side gave. Let's move forward. Let's get a large percentage, a large number of Democrats and Republicans to sponsor this legislation. Let Leader McConnell have the good sense and the courage to put it on the floor. I would bet my bottom dollar it will pass. Let Speaker Ryan do the same, and we will have shown that we can get something done in a bipartisan way.  Lamar Alexander is not obstructing. Patty Murray is not obstructing. The President is obstructing at the moment. We should overcome that obstruction and work together. That is what the American people want.  I hope the President rethinks his position. He has rethought it several times already. I hope he actually reads and learns what is in the bill. And I hope we can get this done--not for any party's sake or any individual's sake but for the American people's sake, the millions and millions of Americans who can't afford high premiums, who desperately need healthcare and medicine, and who are praying for us to do something to help them.  Mr.President, on the budget, yesterday the Republican majority voted to start debate on a budget resolution that would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion--so much for the deficit hawks. It would slash Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion--so much for the many people who don't want to cut it, who promised not to cut it, including the It blows a huge hole in the deficit--as I said, deficit hawks. Finally, it favors the very wealthy.  My friend here was once head of the Club for I salute him. He states his position. He believes tax cuts on the very wealthy and on big corporations will create jobs. We can have that debate. It is called trickle-down economics. But he is honest about it.  Some of the others--our Secretary of the Treasury, our advisers to the President, many in this Chamber--are saying this is a middle-class tax cut. When 80 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent, when we remove the estate tax, which doesn't apply to anyone whose estate is less than close to $11 million, it is a tax cut for the wealthy. Some people believe that is a good way to exercise policy. The American people don't. But let's debate it that way.  Our Republican colleagues, just like on healthcare, are ashamed of this bill. They can't debate it on what they really believe, and so they put up these chimeras. They sort of make it up: Oh, no, we won't have a deficit; there will be huge growth. I think the Secretary of the Treasury said that it will decrease the deficit by a trillion dollars. That was laughable. Oh, it will go to the middle class, not the wealthy. When they lower the top rate, raise the bottom rate, get rid of the estate tax, and allow passthroughs which will mainly go to very wealthy individuals to reduce their tax rate to 15 percent--that is in the outline.  So today we begin the process of shining light on this awful proposal, of telling the truth. That is what the amendment process will be today.  Today we are going to vote on a Democratic amendment to strike the trillion dollars of cuts in If our colleagues don't want to cut Medicaid, they should vote for this. If our colleagues are OK with a trillion dollars of cuts in Medicaid, let them vote against the amendment, but believe me, the American people will know exactly how each Member of this Chamber feels when it comes to dramatically cutting  We will also propose an amendment to strike the cuts to Now, in the healthcare bill, in one of the reiterations, we debated cutting We haven't debated cutting Medicare, but now we will. Some $473 billion of cuts are in the exact budget our Republican colleagues wish us to vote for. And it will shine a light on what really is in this bill, not what is said.  How many of you on the Republican side have mentioned that this bill cuts Medicare and Medicaid, this budget proposal? Are you going to start mentioning it today, or are you going to try to hide it? Because it does. By the way, the idea that this doesn't count because it is just in a budget that we can ignore is belied by the fact that there is statutory pay-go--statutory, not rules--and it says that Medicare is cut 4 percent if there is a deficit in terms of tax cuts. OK? Are you going to cut Medicare 4 percent? We don't want to do that. We hope you don't. But this budget would require that under the pay-go rules, and that is law.  So we are going to have amendments. Do you want to cut Medicaid or not? Yes or no. Do you want to cut Medicare or not? Yes or no. Do you want to vote for a $1.5 trillion deficit or not? Yes or no. And do you want 80 percent of the tax cuts to go to the top 1 percent, to the very wealthy, while middle-class taxes are raised for many people? Yes or no.  Today begins the process of truth. Today begins the process that shines light on all of the misrepresentations by Secretary Mnuchin and Gary Cohn and by the President himself, who says he is just going to cut taxes on the middle class, not on the wealthy.  This process will be going on for a while. There is going to be a very bright light shining on our Republican colleagues in the House and It is going to take them a while to come up with a bill. It is not easy writing a massive tax bill. And all the while, while they are writing it--and certainly once it comes out--that bright line of truth will produce, in my judgment, the same result we had on healthcare. The more the American people see, the less they will like it.  A CBS poll on Sunday said that 58 percent of the American people believe that the Trump bill is tax cuts for the wealthy; only 19 percent believe it is for the middle class. That number is going to get worse, my colleagues, just as the healthcare thing got worse. The American people turned against you as we Democrats shined a bright light on what it really did.  You cannot govern from the hard right. As wealthy as they are, as much as they threaten you with primaries, it is not going to work. We still have a foundation of democracy. There is still a foundation of honor and truth. And when honor and truth and sunlight hit this bill, it will crumble.  Now, I say to some of my colleagues that we want to work with you on a good tax reform bill, one that is revenue neutral, one that doesn't favor the wealthy. We believe small businesses should get tax breaks. We believe money from overseas should come back and be used to create jobs. There are lots of things we can do on common ground without blowing a hole in the deficit, without cutting Medicare and Medicaid, without favoring the rich. Defeat this bill, we will work with you, just as we have on healthcare. We said: If you defeat that bill, we will try to come up with a bipartisan compromise, and we have--one that the President is flip-flopping on, zigzagging on, saying yes one day and no the next. But we have come up with a compromise, and the same thing can happen on taxes.  Today is a beginning turning point in the tax debate, the day that what is really in this Republican bill will come to light, and the American people, as they learn about it, will not like it.

941,topic-id,1587,"Mr.President, on the GOP tax plan, as soon as today, we will vote on the motion to proceed to the GOP budget resolution, which includes instructions to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion, slash Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and sets up, unfortunately for everybody, the same destructive, partisan process on taxes that the GOP used for healthcare called reconciliation. It says: We don't need you. We are just going to rush it through with our votes. It didn't work on healthcare. It is not going to work on this either.  Tax reform--if it is real reform--or even just tax cuts are very complicated. If you don't have the center coming together, everyone can pick it apart, and they are setting themselves up to do just that.  Although the Republican tax plan is little more than principles at the moment--and we have talked a lot about these principles of the Republican plan--it is so far away from what the American people want because of the process they have decided to use. When you don't want Democrats and use just Republicans, the people of the hard right--a minority in the Republican Party probably--can push the debate so far over because they say: We are not voting for this unless you do it our way. So we have a bill that really is so out of touch and harmful to all but the wealthiest Americans that it is hard to believe the Republicans are putting it forward with a straight face.  It is going to be the first time, my friends, that Republicans in Congress will vote to increase our Nation's deficit by $1.5 trillion, which is spelled out as clear as day in the budget. I hope, given this dramatic increase in the deficit, all of the Republican deficit hawks are out of their nests for this one.  For the sake of ideological consistency, the same folks who decried debt and deficit under President Obama ought to denounce them under President Trump, but we haven't heard much of a peep from a whole lot of Republicans on this side with a few notable, brave, and leaderlike exceptions.  Here is what Representative Walker, a conservative Member of the House, said, lamenting what was going on:       [The deficit is] a great talking point when you have an      administration that is Democrat-led. It's a little different      now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.      There's been less talk about it this year with a Republican-     led administration than there has been the last seven or      eight years.  Representative Walker is exactly accurate.[[Page S6423]]  The Republican leader on May 16 told Bloomberg TV that tax reform ``will have to be revenue neutral.'' These are his words. That is a principle he has advanced for years.  We are not hearing much from Republicans about deficits now. Yet, I repeat, this budget instructs the committees to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. It will be difficult for many of my Republican friends to say that they care about deficits and still vote for this budget.  The GOP budget resolution will also be the first time that my Republican colleagues vote to slash The budget spells out over $400 billion in Medicare cuts, as well as over $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts--even more than the healthcare bill, and probably the 1 reason for its demise was that huge slash to  So it is going to be difficult for my Republican friends and this Republican Party to say that they want to protect Medicare and Medicaid and still vote for this budget. Unfortunately, this will not be the first time Republicans vote to advance a major piece of legislation--changes to our Tax Code--through a hyperpartisan process known as reconciliation. Reconciliation, as has just been documented in an article--I believe it was in Politico, but in one of our leading publications--was never intended for this type of purpose.  With this vote, though, Republicans are saying from the very outset that they don't really want Democratic input on this bill because they are setting up a process in which they don't really need Democratic votes. It is honestly a shame. And just as the partisan reconciliation process portended failure for the Republican healthcare bill, it is likely to portend failure here as well.  It is difficult to pass major legislation in the Senate, as it should be. That is what the Founding Fathers intended. That is the true conservatism of our government: checks and balances, no rush. It is even more difficult if you work only with the votes of one party. As I said, that allows a small few, usually on the hard right, to dictate what is in this bill.  My guess is that the vast majority of people here didn't want to vote for Medicare and Medicaid cuts, but because they couldn't get enough votes in the House to pass the budget without putting that in, because maybe 30 or 40 Members there insisted on it, it is in there. It is not going to serve you well. If anyone thinks it doesn't have real effect, look at the PAYGO rules. This is not just the budget. PAYGO, after this budget passes, would insist on slashes in Medicare, 4 percent. That is the law; that is not a rule.  I hope that our colleagues will vote down this bill, and then I promise you, just as we are doing on healthcare, we can come together in a bipartisan way. That doesn't mean you get everything you like. It probably means more of the tax cuts go to the middle class and fewer to the wealthy, but there are lots of people on our side of the aisle who want to see small business get a tax cut, who want to see money from overseas come here and be used for jobs, and who want to see a middle-class tax break. We could come up with a bipartisan bill that would make, for the first time in a long time, this body shine.  The Republican Congress, at least at the moment on the path it is on, has abandoned the grand tradition of bipartisanship, working together, which has made this Chamber great through the decades and centuries.  When Republicans need Democratic votes, they come to us. The President and the leader have said: Come vote with us. Make it bipartisan. That is not what bipartisanship is. You don't craft a bill just within your party and then say: Voting with us is bipartisan. Bipartisanship means you sit down together and you come out with a proposal that a majority of both parties can support. They are not doing that.  Republicans will spend the entire first year of this Congress trying to pass their major agendas through reconciliation or similar vehicles, first with CRAs, then healthcare, now taxes. The majority leader himself said in a speech, ``Restoring the Senate,'' in 2014 that ``when the Senate is allowed to work the way it was designed to, it arrives at a result acceptable to people all along the political spectrum.'' But if it's an ``assembly line for one party's partisan legislative agenda,'' it creates ``instability and strife'' rather than ``good, stable law.''  The American people want to see us work together. We may not always succeed. It may not be easy, but we can try.  As I said--and I would say this to my colleagues--there are areas in which we can agree on taxes: Lower middle-class taxes; don't raise them. Give some relief to small business. Try to bring the money from overseas and put it into infrastructure and job creation. We can work together, but not in this process and not with this awful bill, which favors the wealthy dramatically, raises taxes on the middle class, hurts the deficit--increases the deficit dramatically--and is a partisan process. I hope my Republican friends keep that in mind when they vote today. If you vote this down, I promise you that we will come together in a bipartisan way and work for something that actually could pass, instead of what happened with healthcare. Try it. Try it. Reconciliation--working with one party--failed miserably for you on healthcare, and now we are coming together. Let's not repeat the same mistake on taxes.           Office of National Drug Control Policy Nomination  Finally, Mr.President, I just heard that the nomination of Representative Marino to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy has been withdrawn. That is the right decision. The fact that he was nominated in the first place is evidence that the Trump administration talks the talk but refuses to walk the walk. The bottom line is that this Congressman supported President Trump but is the wrong person for the job, and I am glad they saw it and withdrew.  I want to salute two of my colleagues who were way out in front on this: Senator Manchin, whose State has been ravaged by opioids, and Senator McCaskill, who has similar problems, particularly in rural areas, but all over. Senator McCaskill has legislation that I think would correct the kinds of ills we have seen in Representative Marino's proposals, and I hope that in a bipartisan way we can support them.  The opioid crisis demands that the next drug czar be solely focused on getting communities across the country the help they desperately need, and we hope the administration nominates someone who fits that bill so we can pass that nominee quickly and in a bipartisan way.

951,topic-id,629,"First, Mr.President, a brief word on healthcare. Senators Alexander and Murray continue to negotiate a bipartisan package of legislation to stabilize our healthcare markets and lower premiums, a process that began over the summer. From what I have heard, they are down to a few final issues and are hopefully close to an agreement that can be taken back to both of our caucuses. Congress ought to show, through the work started by Senators Alexander and Murray way back in July, that Congress can work in a bipartisan way on healthcare, and we have no intention of going along with President Trump's reckless sabotage of the Nation's healthcare law.  Last week, President Trump showed that he is willing to take a wrecking ball to our Nation's healthcare for the sake of politics without any regard to the people it would hurt: veterans, senior citizens, kids, and folks struggling to afford insurance. President Trump was so angry they couldn't repeal and replace, he instead said: I am going to wreck the system. The problem is, it hurts millions of innocent people all for pique and politics. He has shown he is willing to put at risk the healthcare of millions of President Trump's decision to end the cost-sharing program was an act of impulsive malice with no benefit and no end.  This seems to be his He throws red meat to his rightwing base, whether it is on healthcare, immigration, Iran, or disaster aid. Then he says to Congress: You fix it up. That is not the way to lead. That is following. That is an act that exhibits no strength--no strength.  We want our President to be a strong leader. Every American does, regardless of ideology, but when the President plays so many political games that are not just harmless but that hurt people and then says to Congress to clean it up, blaming Congress for the mess he created, it doesn't work, it is not fair, it is not right, and it is the reason that, except for his base, President Trump's numbers keep sliding. They are flat now, and they are down below 40 percent. No President has had such low numbers. By the way, it is not helping the Republican Numbers today show a record difference between whether people prefer Democrats or Republicans, so I would urge him to stop these harmful, almost malicious shenanigans and let us all work together for the good of our country.  On healthcare, we in Congress should continue to shore up the healthcare markets and lower premiums in a bipartisan way. We ought to reject the path of President Trump's sabotage and destruction and instead view a path of consensus and compromise. That is the way it has to go. No side wins everything they want. That is not how the Founding Fathers set up this country, otherwise we would be a dictatorship or a country without checks and balances. We ought to work together to improve our healthcare system, to lower costs for people, and to ensure that more people have access to health coverage. We Democrats have been pushing that for several months now.  I salute Senators Alexander and Murray for understanding that. They have been in careful negotiations that represent the best first step forward on healthcare. I hope we hear more from them on the status of negotiations. I hope they can come to an agreement that includes curtailing the sabotage I spoke of that the President is doing. I hope Leader McConnell and I can support this bill together, and then maybe even the House might pass it. The President has said, I think--we don't know, it changes from day to day--but I think the most recent pronouncement is that he might sign it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-17-pt1-PgS6422-2.txt,1036,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,17.0,October
660,topic-id,812,"Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, so often when you hear folks speak in Washington, it sounds as if we are only speaking to ourselves because most people around the country simply cannot understand what we are talking about when it comes to tax reform. We talk about repatriation and going from a global system to a territorial system and preventing inversions and the number of cohorts on the individual side and passthroughs and corporate cuts. We talk about static scores versus dynamic scores. Too often, too many of us speak in a language that no one truly appreciates or understands.  From my perspective, tax reform is really about two very simple pillars. The first pillar is, how do we increase the take-home pay of the average person in this country, and how do we make sure the jobs of the future are created here in the good old U.of A?  Mr.President, I was privileged to grow up in a home with a strong, powerful, optimistic mother. She raised two boys on her own. I will tell you, when you think about the challenges of single moms today, I think about the one who raised me. I think back to the times when she was working 16 hours each day 3 days a week and 8 hours a day a couple days a week. She was a nurse's aide. She wasn't an LPN or an She wasn't even a She was simply a nurse's aide, which means for several hours each day of her shift she changed bedpans, she rolled patients over.  So when I think about the average single mom, with a couple of kids in the household, whose average income today is less than $36,000 a year, I think to myself, how are we going to make sure that single mother takes home more of her hard-earned money? Tax reform is the fastest way for us here in Washington to actually translate our activities to that household. See, if we take less out of her paycheck, she gets to take home more of her money.  Some have joked about the fact that I said hashtag ``keep yo money.'' Why do I say that? Well, it is the way we speak at home, 1, and 2, it simplifies and crystallizes whom we are talking about. We are simply talking about single moms like mine. We are talking about folks who work hard every day, who are strapped, challenged, with very little margin in their schedules and even less in their paychecks.  The average American--I heard that somewhere around 50 percent of Americans do not have $500 in their savings account. When we are talking about tax reform, we are talking about increasing the margin for a family.  The second major pillar of tax reform is simply making sure that the jobs of the future are created here at home. Well, simple question: How do you do that? The answer is even simpler. When you look around the globe, you find very carefully and critically and simply that there are countries that have a tax rate on their business production of around 12.5 percent. The competition for countries like ours--say, the OECD, high-income countries; there are about 39 of them--the average tax rate is 22 percent. Our corporate tax rate is 35 percent. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the difference between 35 and 22 is 13 percent, but more importantly, there are fewer jobs created here at home.  That is a problem we should solve. We solve that problem by making sure our corporate tax rate is competitive with our global competitors--common sense, some would suggest. I would suggest they are right. But not only that--whether you are on the left or the right, economists on both sides and our current President Trump and our former President Obama agreed on one thing--and we should all stop and celebrate when we have agreement on both sides--they both say that the corporate tax must come down because a part of who pays the price of the corporate tax are the workers. Some have said that 25 percent of the corporate taxes are paid by corporate workers, and others have said it is 80 percent.  Here is what we know: Our workers in this country take home less of their money because our corporate tax rate is too high. We can do something about that.  So when we talk about tax reform, when we talk about the importance of inversions being eliminated, satisfying the need to grow our economy, let's keep it simple. Let's talk about moms and dads like my single mom, income under $36,000. Can we make sure she takes more of her money home so she can take care of her two kids? The answer is yes, and we should do that  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cotton).

Federal employees on the island now are doing important and vital work, but we need more boots on the ground. This funding provides them with the resources needed to do that in the short term.  But to succeed, there needs to be a commitment from the highest levels of government to ensure the recovery of all areas that are part of our Nation, including its territories. Unfortunately, given the President's latest Twitter rant this morning, it seems unlikely that we have that focus and commitment.  So it is up to us in Congress to make sure that the Federal Government doesn't forget about Puerto Rico, and that is what I intend to do in the days and months ahead.

The first two are informed, or two of these speeches are informed. The first and the third are informed by my 20 years of experience on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and the second speech I will deliver is informed by 40 years as a CPA in the world of taxation.  Mr.Speaker, I am the ranking member on the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee and the founder of the Sindh In those two roles, I have focused on human rights and the rule of law in Pakistan, and particularly in its perhaps largest province, Sindh, comprising most of southern  We have dedicated ourselves in the Sindh Caucus to efforts to preserve the culture and the language of the Sindhi people, and particularly their dedication to religious tolerance. Unfortunately, the human rights picture in Pakistan and in Sindh are not good.  I would like to say a few words about the disappearance of Punhal Sario, the leader of the Voice for Missing Persons of Sindh movement, and about the very serious problem of disappearances in Sindh in southern  Just this past summer, Punhal Sario led a march between Sindh's two major cities, Hyderabad to Karachi, demanding accountability for Sindhi activists who have been abducted by Pakistani security forces or simply disappeared.  Where is Punhal now? It appears that he, too, has fallen victim to the very serious forces that he marched against.                              {time}  1730  Punhal's case is hardly an isolated one. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that over 700 people disappeared, were kidnapped, and never heard of again in Pakistan in the year 2016 alone.  In the past year, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the State Department's own Report on Human Rights have all noted serious concerns about extrajudicial and targeted killings and disappearances in Pakistan and, particularly, in  Elements of the government or military see an opportunity to simply make their opponents disappear. Here are a few particulars. In 2016, Amnesty International reported that the Pakistani security forces had, and these are their words, ``committed human rights violations with almost total impunity.''  While Human Rights Watch observed that, ``law enforcement and security agencies remained unaccountable for human rights violations.''  The State Department itself noted in Pakistan, ``the most serious human rights problems were extrajudicial and targeted killings disappearances, torture, the lack of the rule of law.''  Two years ago, in 2015, Sindhi leader Anwar Laghari was brutally murdered in Days before his death, he had sent a memorandum to President Barack Obama about human rights violations by the Pakistani military and its ISI, the Inter-Services Intelligence, agency, an important part of the Pakistani military.  I attended a memorial service for Laghari here in Washington and have come to know of his work for human rights for the Sindhi people of southern The Pakistani Government has not been responsive to numerous inquiries into the reason for Laghari's death and for why his perpetrators have not been brought to justice.  Two months ago, on August 18, I sent a letter to the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs and the U.Ambassador to Pakistan expressing strong concerns about human rights violations of the Pakistani Government in Six of my House colleagues--three Democrats and three Republicans--joined me in that effort.  There are other human rights concerns in Pakistan that I should also bring to the attention of this The people of Sindh face religious extremist attacks. ISIS, for example, claimed responsibility for an attack on a Sufi shrine in Sindh that killed 80 people. Yet the government has not acted to protect religious minorities and, in general, has not acted to protect the people of Sindh from Islamic extremism.  In addition, in Sindh, there are forced conversions of Sindhi girls belonging to minority communities.[[Page H8024]]While the numbers are unclear, reports suggest that every year perhaps 1,000 girls and young women in Pakistan, including many in Sindh, are forcibly converted upon a marriage, not of their choice, to Muslim men. The Pakistani Government has not done enough to stop this practice, and reform measures have been circumvented and not enforced.  Human rights abuses of this type cannot go unanswered. Activists disappear under suspicious circumstances. It is our obligation to speak out and demand accountability. These disappearances and other violations of human rights should be a major topic of conversation in all bilateral discussions between our government and the government in                    Tax Proposal Deletes Deductions  ",CREC-2017-10-12-pt1-PgH8023.txt,1526,REAUTHORIZING CHIP FUNDING,2017.0,12.0,October
1059,topic-id,1282,"Now, Mr.Speaker I would like to move on to a second speech, one dealing with the tax proposal of the Trump administration.  The provisions I would like to focus on chiefly are those involving taking away the deductions, the itemized deductions that so many Americans take to reduce their tax liability.  Now, these deductions are eliminated on the theory that, oh, they just go to the wealthy, and, for those purposes, they define the wealthy as the wealthiest 30 percent or so of the American people--say a family with an income of $100,000 or $150,000. We are told that is the same thing as increasing taxes on the top one-tenth of 1 percent, say a family with an income of $1 million or $2 million a year.  There is a difference in the ability to pay of those two typical families, typifying their income brackets. The fact is, that taxing hardworking families with incomes of $100,000 or $150,000, in order to provide reduced tax rates for those with incomes of $1 million or $2 million, makes our tax system more regressive. You cannot put the entire top 30 percent in one category for these income calculations.  That is why, and that is only one reason why, I oppose the elimination of the home mortgage deduction. Another reason that I oppose it is elimination of the home mortgage deduction and reduction for local property taxes will probably decrease the value of homes by 20 percent, is the best estimate I have seen.  Well, if you lose 20 percent of the value of your home, you may very well lose all of the equity in your home. How is that going to affect the economy? How is that going to affect the ability of homeowners to go and spend money in their communities and support the economy of their communities?  What does it do to the Federal budget when we are responsible through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for underwriting home mortgages? We know that if you wipe out the equity of many homeowners in their homes, this can lead to defaults and cost the Federal Government perhaps more than we give up by having a home mortgage deduction.  Another element to keep in mind is that the entire idea of an income tax is that we tax people based on their ability to pay. If you are in a State with high income taxes, high property taxes, that diminishes your ability to pay. If you make a certain salary and money is taken out by your State government before you ever see it, your ability to pay is only on that net paycheck.  It is simply wrong to take away the deduction for State and local taxes. But make no mistake about it, the purpose of removing that deduction is not just to hurt the top 30, or 40 percent, or 50 percent of the American people who itemize their deductions, it is designed to punish those who are dependent on State and local government.  All the conservative theorists say: If we can just eliminate the deduction for State and local taxes, we will cut the size of State and local governments. We will create a political atmosphere in which they slash money for local schools, slash money for local health programs for the poor, slash money for police.  Who will be hurt from those cuts? Not just the top 30 percent or 50 percent, but everyone in America, most particularly, the poor.  Finally, I want to focus on the medical deduction. They take away the medical deduction in this program, this proposal of the Trump administration. Now, keep in mind that we already have severe limits on deducting medical expenses. You can deduct medical expenses only if they exceed 10 percent of your family's income. So medical expenses are itemized and deducted only by those families including someone with very significant health costs.  Now, we have worked hard in this House to make sure that people have health insurance. But even with health insurance, there are copays; there are deductibles. These can be absorbed in a family budget where no one has a particular strong medical need. But what if there is some member of the family who needs experimental treatments that are not covered, therapies that are not covered?  Under the present system, at least they get to deduct these extraordinary--not the first 10 percent of AGI, of adjusted gross income--but when they start spending out-of-pocket costs in excess of 10 percent income, they can take a tax deduction--a tax deduction taken away in the Trump tax proposal.  I speak not just as someone who spent a lot of time as a tax expert who headed the second largest tax agency in the country, but as the father of a child with special needs. What does this tax proposal mean for such a family? Well, first, there is a cut in Federal revenue under this proposal of between $150 billion and $200 billion a year. Deficit hawks will demand that these revenue cuts be matched by cuts to Federal spending.  What does that do to the $13 billion the Federal Government dedicates to the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, also known as special education? And what do these cuts in our Federal expenditures mean to the $293 million that are spent by the National Institutes of Health on research designed to prevent and treat autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD?  So the first impact on a family with special needs is a slashing of the money the Federal Government spends for special education and medical research. But second, I talked about those out-of-pocket medical expenses. Parents with special-needs children know that health insurance pays only a portion of what is needed, or perhaps none of what is needed, for behavioral therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, developmental pediatricians, neuropsychological services, et cetera.  Medical insurance will pay nothing toward anything branded an experimental treatment, and, of course, medical insurance does not cover special schools required to meet the needs of some special-needs children.  Under current law, a special school designed to meet those with a physical or mental handicap are considered medical expenses. All of these tax deductions are taken away from a family whose ability to pay is diminished by the costs of providing these therapies to a special-needs child.  In addition, right now, the tax law provides a personal exemption of $4,050 for each dependent child. The Trump administration proposal takes that away. It does say, in some vague language, that there will be a child tax credit to compensate parents who are losing the personal exemption. But this credit will be limited to children 16 years of age and younger.  So what about parents supporting children in their teenage years, and older? Remember, some special-needs children will need parental support for a lifetime. Those parents lose the exemption and are ineligible for this credit available only to parents of younger children.  But perhaps parents of children with special needs should support the Trump tax program. While it will tremendously increase their taxes, while it will cut Federal expenditures on special education and on health research and medical research, parents of children with special needs can take solace in knowing that this plan will reduce taxes for the Trump family by over $1 billion in estate taxes and by tens of millions of dollars in income tax.  Perhaps we should tell parents of special-needs children that they should stop worrying so much about their children and start worrying about Donald Trump's children. If they did, they would support the Trump tax proposal.                       Iran Nuclear Control Deal  ",CREC-2017-10-12-pt1-PgH8023.txt,1526,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,12.0,October
1060,topic-id,1498,"Finally, Mr.Speaker, I would like to address the issue of[[Page H8025]]Iran and the nuclear deal, nuclear control deal that we signed with  First, a little background. In 1997, I said at the Foreign Affairs Committee that Iran and its nuclear program were the number one threat to American national security.                              {time}  1745  For the last 20 years, I have supported every effort to impose sanctions on the Iranian regime. When the Iran nuclear deal was finalized and published, I was the first of either party to come to this floor and say that Congress should not vote to endorse that deal.  But the question before us now is: Should we renounce the deal?  Now, it would be one thing if Iran decides that we are so tough on them on other issues that they choose to renounce the deal, but that is not the issue before us today. The issue before us today is whether America should renounce the deal, and the resounding and clear answer is that is not something we should do at this time.  Now, I will give you an example. Let's say you bought a flawed automobile. In some jurisdictions, you take back the automobile and you get back your money. But what opponents--what some are proposing now is that we renounce the deal. Imagine you are in a jurisdiction where you have to take back the car and the dealer keeps your money, too. Taking back the car doesn't look like such a good idea anymore.  Now, like a flawed automobile, the Iran nuclear deal is liable to not be working next decade. But that doesn't mean you take back the car and the dealer keeps the money.  What happens if we renounce the deal?  Iran keeps the money. We unfroze very roughly $100 billion of their money. If we renounce the deal, they keep the money. We delivered over $1 billion in currency on big pallets. If we renounce the deal, Iran keeps the money. If we renounce the deal, Iran is liberated from all of the restrictions that it agreed to on its nuclear program.  I opposed the deal because the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in the deal were temporary. I believe we need to extend and enforce those limitations on their nuclear program. If you listen to the Prime Minister of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu, he has identified the fact that we have not been able to extend and make permanent the limitations on Iran's nuclear program as the chief flaw in the deal and the chief thing to correct to turn it into a better deal.  But if we renounce the deal, we don't extend and enforce the limitations on Iran's nuclear program, we end and eliminate immediately the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. I cannot think of a worse result.  Now, there are two mechanisms that we could use as a nation to renounce the deal, give Iran all the benefits, and liberate them from all their obligations. The first of these is on our mind now because it could be triggered on October 15. That is the day on which the President could, in effect, decertify this deal under the Iran Nuclear Review I hope that, if he does that, the press will not overplay it, because a decertification does nothing more than focus Congress' attention on whether we want to reinstitute the exact sanctions that were waived as part of the nuclear deal. A decertification does nothing more than focus our attention and, over in the Senate, provide for a reinstitution of the old sanctions.  Now, I don't think that Congress would be stupid enough to do that because, as I have explained, if we renounce the deal, Iran keeps the benefits and is liberated from its obligations.  But the President should not decertify the deal and focus the world's attention on whether America will stand with the deal at this time.  The second way that America could renounce the deal will occur next January because the basic element of the deal--the basic thing Iran got from the United States--was an agreement that the President would, every 4 months to 6 months, it depends on the exact statute, waive particular identified sanctions. As it happens, the existing waivers all expire in the middle of next If the President were to fail to issue those waivers, that would be an American renunciation of the deal. So it does not meet our national security objectives to renounce the deal.  What meets our national security objectives is to impose tough sanctions on Iran, draft those sanctions carefully, and explain them to the world not as a renunciation of the deal, but as appropriate sanctions given Iran's non-nuclear, outside-the-deal, wrongful behavior.  Now, the question is: Can we have sanctions on Iran and continue to force them to abide by the deal?  The answer is clearly yes.  In July of 2015, Secretary Kerry came before our committee, and I raised this very issue: If we adopt the deal, can we impose sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran to deter terrorism? Or would that violate this agreement?  I specifically asked: Are Congress and the United States free under the agreement to adopt new sanctions legislation that will remain in force as long as Iran holds American hostages or supports the murderous Assad regime?  Secretary Kerry's answers were clear. He stated: We are free to adopt additional sanctions as long as they are not a phony excuse for just taking the whole pot of past ones and putting them back.  So we can and should impose new sanctions on Iran to the extent justified by Iran's behavior outside the area of nuclear research and uranium enrichment. Look at that as an opportunity because you could make a list of every sanction any one of us here on this floor has thought of. And add in the creativity of the United States Senate and make a list of every sanction we could impose, I assure you that those sanctions and more are justified by the non-nuclear evil committed by the regime in  Iran is more responsible than Russia for the hundreds of thousands of deaths in The lifeline of Assad's murderous regime is a lifeline to the aid, money, weapons, thugs, and training that Iran has provided--hundreds of thousands of deaths, an immoral responsibility of the Islamic Republic of  Turn to Yemen, where tens of thousands of people have died because of Look at worldwide terrorism, and Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism year after year, according to our State Look at the treatment by Iran of its own people, the murders by the state of anyone they identify as being part of the LGBT community, the murders by the state of women--it is usually women--accused of adultery.  The evil that comes from the Islamic Republic far exceeds the ability of this House to identify sanction points. That is why the proper policy for the United States is to impose the maximum sanctions and to explain to the world that this is not a phony renunciation of the nuclear deal, but it is the appropriate response to Iran's actions that are outside of the nuclear deal.  If we do that, we will have substantial support from Europe, Asia, and elsewhere first for demanding that Iran continue to be subject to all the nuclear limitations and inspections that they agreed to under the deal and which continue to be enforced well in the next decade.  What we shall do next decade, well, I will come back here and give another speech next decade. But at least many years deep in the next decade, this deal provides us with valuable limitations and valuable inspections of the Iran nuclear program, and Europe will insist that those be adhered to.  Second, Europe may join us in the sanctions when we sanction Iran for its actions in Syria, its actions to its own people, its actions in One more I should add, and that is Iran's violation of U.Security Council resolutions by testing and developing missiles and exporting weapons.  So if we stick with the deal and we sanction Iran, they may choose--if those sanctions are as effective as I think they can be--to walk away from the deal. But if they do, we will have the whole world with us enforcing sanctions against  Now, there is one part of the policy I put forward that may not meet the psychological needs of the President of the United States, for he has shown an uncontrollable personal need to pour disgusting liquids on anything associated with President Maybe it[[Page H8026]]meets his psychological needs to say he is renouncing the nuclear deal. But the fact is we don't have to renounce the nuclear deal and liberate Iran from its obligations in order to impose the toughest imaginable sanctions on this regime that is doing so much evil.

669,topic-id,337,"Mr.President, first, let me say that the people of Michigan and our country deserve a better deal than what is in this budget. There are a number of concerns I have, but I want to mention three big ones, and I am proud to join with colleagues on amendments that would address them in votes that will be coming up.  The first is the fact that this budget would take $473 billion out of I offered an amendment in committee to make sure that would include privatizing Medicare, but that was voted down. That is certainly something that could happen.  There is $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts as well. In Michigan, three out of five seniors in nursing homes are there with the help of Medicaid health insurance. This is children, families, and senior citizens. There will be an amendment offered that Senator Nelson, Senator Sanders, and I offered to take out this cut from There will be one offered for Medicaid, with Senator Sanders, Senator Casey, and me, to strike that.  Second, 80 percent of the tax cuts built into the assumptions of the budget go to the top 1 percent. What does that mean? Well, it is $1.5 trillion that goes to folks making $700,000 or more. That is at least a $200,000 tax cut per person. We commonly call this trickle-down economics. So far it has never worked. People in my State are still waiting for it to trickle down.  We have an amendment, as well, to remove this provision and to put the tax cuts into the pockets of middle-class taxpayers.  Finally, this plan overall increases the deficit. Even though it cuts Medicare and Medicaid, it also increases and explodes the deficit by $2.4 trillion. We also will be addressing that as well.  Overall, unfortunately, in terms of the big tax cuts, this budget proposal is paid for by our senior citizens and single parents who are affected and middle-class families. I urge a ``no'' vote.

703,topic-id,1360,"Mr.President, I know we are in the middle of a discussion and certainly a debate right now about a budget resolution, and, obviously, I participated in discussions of how concerned I am about the priorities in the budget resolution. I think the people of Michigan and the country deserve a better deal.  But while we are doing that, the clock is ticking on some very, very important programs where we actually have bipartisan support in committee. I want to thank Chairman Hatch and the Finance Committee, working with me and working with our ranking member, Senator Wyden, for moving forward last week on a 5-year reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or what we call The problem is this. Even though we passed it with only one negative vote and we had a strong bipartisan vote coming to the floor, my concern is that we have gone on to tax cuts. We are going on to a bill that includes Medicaid cuts and Medicare cuts and other debates. Yet we have this bipartisan effort that needs to get done because the funding ended September 30. It has been 18 days and counting. We will be counting these days because it has been 18 days since the Children's Health Insurance Program was stopped being funded.  I am very concerned about this. I assumed that once we had agreement, we would be able to move something very quickly. It is deeply concerning to me that we are now in a situation where it is 18 days. Tomorrow it will be 19 days, and then we go into the weekend, and yet we are not seeing the Children's Health Insurance Program funded.  There are 9 million children in our country. These are low-income working families who are not able to have the confidence of knowing that health insurance will be there for them. CHIP has been an extremely successful program. In Michigan we call it MIChild, and we have about 100,000 children who are able to get health services because of This means moms and dads go to bed at night and don't have to say a little prayer--please, God, don't let the kids get sick--because they know they are going to be able to take them to the doctor.  This has traditionally been a bipartisan bill. As I have said, we have had great support on both sides of the aisle, but it is now out of committee, and we need to move it, and we need to make space on the calendar to be able to get this done.  We also have something else that ended on September 30, and that is funding for our community health centers. This is something else that has bipartisan support. I want to thank my friend Senator Roy He and I joined together. We have 70 Members of this body who have signed a letter to continue the funding for community health centers. The problem is, the funding ran out on September 30. The Federal funding ended on September 30. We are talking about 25 million families, children, 300,000 veterans, 7.5 million children all across the country. In many parts of rural Michigan, that is the primary way people are getting their healthcare, as well as in urban settings.  Again, we have an agreement. We have talked about, now that the children's health insurance bill is out of committee, having it on the floor and then having an amendment for health centers, moving that together, which is something we have done in the past. We have strong bipartisan support to do it, but it has been put to the side in favor of what is a very divisive process on a budget resolution and tax cuts and other issues.  So I am imploring the leadership in the Senate to focus on something on which we all agree--at least the majority of us agree, the overwhelming majority of us agree--and that is making sure the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers get funded as quickly as possible. This is something done through the States, this is locally driven, it meets all the tests that people talk about, and both of these programs are extremely effective.  In 2016 alone, Michigan's community health centers diagnosed coronary heart disease in more than 21,000 people. There were 21,000 people who, if they hadn't gotten that diagnosis, probably would have ended up in the emergency room--if they had been able to get to an emergency room before something fatal happened. Because we have community health centers from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to our urban areas, people were able to get the diagnosis and the help they needed. Nearly 34,000 Michigan residents learned that they had asthma and could treat that asthma, and children could get the treatment they need. Nearly 140,000 people were diagnosed with diabetes and could begin to manage that so it didn't become something incredibly serious and life-threatening.  Health centers play a very important role. If we aren't treating these kinds of things, they can be deadly if undiagnosed or untreated, so it is very important.  I am worried that there is not the sense of urgency there needs to be here to continue the Children's Health Insurance Program and the community health centers. I know that my Democratic colleagues feel that we are ready and willing to, at any moment, stop the debate on a divisive budget resolution, focus on something that has bipartisan leadership and bipartisan support, and let's get that done.  In Michigan, our 100,000 children who are able to see the doctor through MIChild get the medical care and dental and vision care that they need to be successful--to be successful in school, to be able to see the blackboard, to be able to read, to be able to hear, because they are getting the basic healthcare they need.  Children shouldn't have to strain to see the blackboard and get bad grades because they can't get a simple eye exam, and that is what MIChild helps make happen. Children shouldn't have to struggle to ignore a painful tooth because the family can't afford to see a dentist. We have heard of horrible situations where, because of abscesses, children have actually lost their lives. It is not necessary. This is something that is preventible, and we have a bipartisan program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, created with bipartisan leadership years ago, that can be continued and needs to be continued.  Mr.President, I understand the debate on the floor about the budget. I understand the debate on tax reform. I want to see tax reform that simplifies the code and puts money in the pockets of hard-working families and small businesses and creates jobs. I mean, that is what I want to see happen. I also want to make sure, as we are debating right now how to do that and the differences in doing that--I would argue that what is in this budget bill does not do that, and I want to work on something that does.  We have the clock ticking on 9 million children and their families whose health insurance funding stopped 18 days ago and community health centers from small towns in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the city of Detroit whose health center funding stopped 18 days ago.  So I am going to keep counting. I hope I don't have to count too high before we can get this done because I know there is support here. I know there is support to do it, but it has to be a priority. There has to be a sense of urgency. Just like a parent who is up at 3 o'clock in the morning with a sick child has a sense of urgency about what they need to care for their child, we need to have that same sense of urgency here and do what I know we can do if we would just take the time, just take a few minutes to get it done.  Mr.President, I hope that will happen very soon. Thank you very much.  I yield the floor.

Whether it is leading-edge manufacturing, lifesaving advances in medical science, or groundbreaking leaps in technology, the University of Michigan is a world leader in innovation and creativity. I can tell you that there is no group of students or alumni in America that is more passionate and committed than our Michigan fans.  Founded on August 26, 1817, in Detroit, the University of Michigan was the first public university in the Northwest Territory, moving to Ann Arbor in 1837. With 63,000 students on three campuses and more than 572,000 living graduates, including my son, the university has one of the largest alumni bodies in the world. They include artists, astronauts, athletes, entrepreneurs, humanitarians, business and government leaders, and Nobel Laureates in economics, medicine, and science.  The university is known for many firsts that make it among, as its fight song states, the ``leaders and best.'' Michigan was the Nation's first university to build a chemical laboratory, open and operate its own hospital, and teach science-based medicine. In 1879, the university created the chair of the science and the art of teaching, the first permanent professorial chair at an American college or university devoted to teacher preparation. Michigan offered the Nation's first collegiate aeronautics classes in 1914. In 1949, it established the Institute of Social Research, now one of the oldest and largest academic survey organizations.  Michigan is one of the world's leading research universities, spending $1.39 billion on research in 2016. It produces, on average, 400 new inventions each year and launches a new startup every 4 weeks. Faculty and graduates have played a leadership role in developing the polio vaccine, identifying the gene for cystic fibrosis, creating the worldwide computing backbone that led to the internet, protecting the Great Lakes, and exploring space.

It is a very important document for the country, for the Senate, and for the There are a lot of big issues that we are all focused on, but there is one I wish to talk about this morning that relates to the budget document. Actually, to be perfectly frank, it relates to a number of the speeches made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They have been coming down to the floor and talking about issues related to energy, which is really important for America, the environment, which is also very important to America, and--a little bit to my surprise, from all of these experts coming to the floor--Alaska, which is my  I am going to say a little bit more about what some of my colleagues have been talking about--my There seems to be a few experts on Alaska from States like Massachusetts and I just want to put things in perspective from a Senator who is actually from the State and not these other Senators who, to be honest, don't know much about what they are talking about.  The one thing you are seeing is that it is for sure that you know there is kind of an issue in the debate on the floor when you see talking points that are just stale--talking points that, if you took a speech from 30 or 40 years ago, are the same talking points. They are stale talking points from the other side of the aisle that have been used for decades, that haven't been updated or that don't reflect what has really been happening in the country in terms of technological advances, environmental standards, and one of the most important things that has happened in America over the last decade, and that is the American energy renaissance--the American energy renaissance.  I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't even like to talk about it. They don't like to acknowledge it: As to energy, we don't produce that in Yes, we do. Yes, we do. We are doing it really, really well, and it is benefiting millions and millions and millions of Americans in every State in the country.  The budget resolution that we are debating has a provision in it that is really simple. I bet if you polled it with every American--Democrat, Republican, people watching on TV--it probably has a 90-percent approval.  There is a simple instruction in the budget resolution that says that Congress needs to look at ways to increase Federal revenues by increasing American energy production. What could be wrong with increasing American energy production?  That provision that we are actually debating right now should be very bipartisan. Who is against that? Who could be against that? Why is this so important? Why is the American energy renaissance so important?  Well, as the Presiding Officer knows, because his State is certainly involved in it, the energy renaissance that is happening in the United States right now is a win, win, win, win, win on almost every category you can imagine.  What do I mean by the energy renaissance? Right now in our great Nation with our resources, we are producing more oil, more natural gas, and more renewables than any other place in the world. That is really good for the country. That is the renaissance. That is really a revolution in energy production. It is something that you would think on the Senate floor should be completely bipartisan. Unfortunately, it isn't.  Let me talk a little bit about how this energy renaissance and what is in the budget resolution will produce more energy for America by Americans, which is good for the country. Let's count the ways. When I said win, win, win, win, win, I wasn't joking. The wins are all on the board.  First, there is energy security. For our Nation, it is lower cost energy. With the increase in natural gas, we are seeing the drop in the prices of natural gas for homes and manufacturers and increasing manufacturing. These are enormously important for our  There is economic growth and jobs. In the energy sector, these are good jobs. The Presiding Officer has a lot of these jobs in his I have a lot of these jobs in my These are really important jobs. When you look at[[Page S6597]]the weak economic growth in the United States over the last 10 years, the one sector that is actually driving growth has been the energy sector.  How about the trade deficit? It is a big problem. Everybody has talked about it. The President is very focused on it. We are now starting to export oil and export natural gas. My State has been exporting natural gas for over four decades. That helps our trade deficit.  Then, when you look at the Federal budget deficit, energy is a huge positive impact on the Federal budget deficit. That is what the budget resolution asks Congress to do in terms of policy: Let's produce more energy so we can produce more revenue for the Federal That is a good idea. Nobody should be opposed to that.  Mr.President, as you know, when we are the world's energy superpower, as we are, that really helps our national security. It really helps our foreign policy. A lot of Americans have been concerned for decades that we have troops in the Middle East, that we have troops in areas where energy is really important. Well, let's produce it here.  I was in a meeting last year at the Munich Security Conference with the great Senator from Arizona and many of my colleagues. It was bipartisan. Senator McCain led that codel to the Munich Security Conference in We met with a very prominent Russian dissident who has been fighting and battling with Vladimir At the very end of the meeting, we asked a simple question: What more can we do in the United States to help somebody like you, who is battling against a dictator who doesn't have our interest at heart? Do you know what this very smart Russian official, a courageous man, said? He said: America needs to produce more energy. That is how you take down the leadership in the Kremlin--more energy.  This is national security.  Let me say one more thing that doesn't get talked about a lot. It is not just helpful in all of these areas. When the United States of America is producing energy, it helps the global environment. Some people say: Well, wait a minute. A lot of the colleagues on the other side of the aisle come to the floor and kind of insinuate that when our country produces energy, it actually hurts the environment. That is not the case. When the United States produces energy, it actually helps the global environment.  Why is that the case? Let me just pause for a minute because, like I said, a lot of my colleagues are coming to the floor and talking about Alaska, energy, and the environment. Again, it is not with a lot of knowledge. They are stale talking points, yes. They have been using them for 40 years. Literally, I think one of my colleagues has been in the Congress plus or minus 40 years and has been using the same talking points on this.  As somebody who came to the Senate previously from a job as attorney general and a commissioner of natural resources and energy in Alaska, I know a little bit about this topic. I can tell you two important points.  My colleagues talk a little bit about Alaska, the environment, and energy. First, Senator Murkowski and I care a lot more about the environment, the wildlife, the pristine wilderness in our great, amazing State than any other Member in this body. I don't need Senators coming down from places like Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington, Vermont, and Rhode Island talking about Alaska's environment. OK? I don't need it. I care way more than any of them. With all due respect, I know a heck of a lot more about it than any of them.  I also know this. In my State--and, I believe, in most of the country, but particularly in Alaska--Democrats, Republicans, Alaskan Natives, and non-Natives certainly support the highest standards on the environment, but we also support responsible resource development. Here is the key issue: We know we can do both. You can protect the pristine, amazing Alaskan environment, and you can responsibly develop our resources.  Let's talk about how we do this. Let's talk about how this applies to Alaska and how this applies to the rest of the country in general.  As I mentioned, this is a really important point. We have the highest standards on developing our resources and our energy than anywhere in the world, and we have some of the most technologically advanced and sustainable ways to develop resources in the energy sector. That allows us to do what I just mentioned, which is to protect the environment and to develop our resources.  Here is a really important point that a lot of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle miss. They come down here, and this is what they talk about--by the way, they were in alliance with the last administration: How do we shut down energy development? How do we make it harder? How do we delay it?  As I mentioned, I was attorney general and the DNR commissioner in Alaska for almost 6 years of the Obama administration. It was all about how to shut it down in Alaska, how to delay it in Alaska, and how to shut it down in This is not what the country wants. This is not what the country needs, and, certainly, it is one issue that is often overlooked. This doesn't help the global environment, as they claim. It doesn't. Why is that? Because when you chase away investment in places like Alaska, with the highest standards on the environment in the world, what does that do? That drives capital and that drives investment to places like Russia, Iran, and Brazil, whose standards are so much lower than ours.  Russians on the tundra in the Arctic don't care anything about their environment. In my State and in the rest of America, we do.  I don't need to remind people that Russia and Iran right now are certainly our adversaries. Yet the policies that some of my colleagues like to promote, and certainly the last administration promoted, are to drive away investment, drive away energy production in America, with the highest standards in the world, so the Russians and the Iranians can take the capital and produce energy. They do not have high standards on the environment, and they are our adversaries. It makes no sense--no sense.  So how do we do this in Alaska? What are the environmental standards that almost no other place in the world--maybe Norway, maybe, to some degree, Canada--uses? What is the technology that enables us to produce American energy, with American jobs, with the American people, with the highest standards in the world? Let me provide a few examples. First, what I want everybody here to be aware of is, do not believe these doomsday scenarios. Don't believe the misinformed commentary. When my Democratic colleagues come to the floor, with very little knowledge about what is really happening in this sector, don't believe it. When they come to the floor and talk about a State like mine--Alaska--about which they know next to nothing, don't believe it.  Let me give one infamous example. In the 1970s, we were debating in the Senate--and I think one of my colleagues was maybe here then, probably using the same talking points--the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, one of the greatest energy infrastructure projects in the history of the world: 800 miles, 16 billion barrels of oil; at one point, 2 million barrels a day, from Americans, in  The people who were against it came to the floor and said: Oh, no. The Central Arctic caribou herd is going to be decimated if you do this--these beautiful animals that we care so much about in Those were the arguments right on this floor. So what happened to the Central Arctic caribou? Again, we care about these animals way more than anybody else does in this body. In 1975, we had about 5,000 caribou; today, 66,000. I don't think the herd was decimated. We haven't heard that from anybody because they don't know, but that is the kind of doomsday scenario we heard from people with no knowledge, and then, when it doesn't happen, we don't hear them on the Senate floor saying: Oh, we were wrong about that.  Let me talk just briefly about some of what we do to make sure we do this in the most responsible way in the world. First, in the energy business, one thing we do is we explore. Again, in Alaska we have the highest standards in the world. A lot of other places in the United States have these standards. In the Arctic, we have what is called no impact exploration. What does that mean? It means we literally do everything to make sure there is no[[Page S6598]]impact on these great species like the polar bear. Again, we care a lot more about our animals than my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  What does no impact exploration mean? Well, we undertake exploration required by State standards--these are not Federal standards--where we essentially have what are called ice roads and ice pads. Let me show my colleagues what that means. We only allow for exploration in the winter on the tundra. When an exploration crew comes out, they have to build an ice road--it is a road made of ice--over the tundra. This photograph is an example of an ice road. Then they do exploration on an ice pad. They have drills, and they do all this work on the ice, on the tundra. They have about 4 months to do it and then they are done and then they leave.  What does the tundra look like after that exploration on ice? Right here. This is just one capped exploration well. It is as though nobody was even there--literally zero impact. These are Alaska standards, the highest in the world. They are expensive, yes, but we do it because we care so much about the environment. That is the exploration phase.  How about the production phase? What has happened in the production phase? The innovations in technology, many of which have occurred in my State, have made it so the surface footprint--when we actually put together a production pad--has shrunk dramatically. When we look at this chart, we see Prudhoe Bay in the 1970s. The other developments in Alaska include Kuparuk, Alpine, and What happens is, the surface footprint has shrunk dramatically to 11, 12 acres now. Yet the ability to horizontally drill extends the reach of these wells underneath the ground, where we can reach resources in an incredibly vast manner without impacting the environment at all.  If a rig was placed right here on the Capitol Building, in terms of horizontal drilling, it could extend out to Andrews Air Force Base in Southeast, Silver Spring, MD, to the north, and well into Fairfax County--miles and miles and miles. Yet the surface footprint--the impact on the environment--is minimal.  That is what we do. We don't hear about it from the other side of the aisle, but it is really important, as we debate these issues, that all Americans know this. More energy for the country is really positive.  In conclusion, tonight the budget resolution is not just going to be a vehicle for tax reform, but there is also, as I mentioned, going to be an instruction for increased revenues for the country for more American energy production. It is a simple instruction.  As I mentioned, this should be very noncontroversial. What could be wrong with more energy production, particularly in a State like mine, where the standards are the highest in the world, and the technology is the most advanced in the world. What could be controversial about more energy production? More energy production means more American jobs, more American economic growth, more American national security, more American energy security, decreased Federal budgets and trade deficits, and a more sustainable global environment because no one in the world produces energy more responsibly than Americans, especially  Nevertheless, some of my Democratic colleagues will be putting forth an amendment that does just the opposite. Think about that, an amendment that says let's kill energy production, thereby undermining American job growth, good jobs, American economic growth, American national security and energy security, while increasing our budget and trade deficits and harming the global environment. That is a lose-lose-lose scenario to me, but that is what is at stake tonight.  Later this afternoon, when we debate that amendment--and I certainly ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject any attempts to not take advantage of this incredible opportunity in America--the American energy renaissance that we need to continue--and this afternoon we are going to have an opportunity to do that.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

1046,topic-id,633,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding and for bringing up this very important issue.  I just want to make a few comments, and I just want to say, what makes the United States exceptional among all nations is the moral courage and leadership we have displayed throughout our history.  So many times, in the face of great terror and significant moral crisis, the United States has acted as a force for good. We have supported our allies to restore order where there was once chaos. Where people have been suffering famine and drought, we have stepped up to provide food and water. Time and again, the world has faced crises, and the United States has stepped up to defend the moral good.  The crisis in Myanmar presents yet another challenge for the global community, but in this moral crisis is yet another opportunity for our Nation to once again lead.  As we speak, the Rohingya people are suffering undue hardship and violence under a government that has failed to uphold the values inherent to a vibrant democracy.  It has been reported that an average of 2,000 Rohingya are fleeing the country each day. Denied basic rights for decades, the Rohingya people have been subject to systematic discrimination as a religious minority in a predominantly Buddhist country. The state has gone so far as to completely deny citizenship to the Rohingya people since 1982.  Serious accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide have been leveled against the government, which has failed to respond appropriately to the calls for calm and peace.  While the government has the right to defend itself against any form of insurgency, common, agreed-upon rules of warfare dictate that all civilians be protected. This rule is sacred and must not be broken. Despite this, reports of abuse against civilians are running rampant in  More than 200 villages have been destroyed, many burned to the ground by government forces. Communities are being wiped away as hundreds, possibly even thousands, of civilians are slaughtered. The crisis demands our immediate attention.  Just recently, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing, and Chairman Royce stated plainly: ``This is ethnic cleansing.''  Mr.Speaker, I must agree.  Every conflict is complex, and this one is no different, but it must be made clear that under no conditions should the rights of innocent civilians be abridged. To the Government of Myanmar, we must make it equally as clear that their behavior will not be tolerated.  I recently met with constituents from Myanmar in my district office. Utica, the largest city in New York's 22nd Congressional District, is home to a vibrant refugee community. We are home to the largest Bosnian refugee population in the Nation, a population that was also fleeing ethnic cleansing in their own home country of the former  My constituents shared with me their personal stories and deep despair over the violence in their home country.

Mr.Speaker, when our Nation faces moral challenges, it is in our nature not to back down. I must insist that this time be no different. I call on my colleagues to stand up and speak out and to act on this important issue.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas and my colleague for highlighting this very important issue.

He worked hard alongside his older brother, where he remembers driving the tractor and looking up into the big blue Montana sky.  Also, like many Montanans, he did not back down from answering the call to serve his Nation when we needed him most.  In 1943, George enlisted in the Army, making him the first in his family to serve in the military.  He spent over 2 years fighting in the jungles and on the beaches of the Philippines and New Guinea as a proud member of the 32nd Infantry  He braved the mud. He braved the rain. He braved the bugs, and he braved the bullets.  He saw the unimaginable, as Japanese kamikaze pilots slammed their airplanes into American ships.  He did the unbelievable, driving Army bulldozers into the unknown, making sure our soldiers got the supplies and food they desperately needed.  He served our Nation with bravery, courage, and dignity, working his way up to the rank of  After America's victory, George came home, and returned to those same Montana fields and skies.  After seeing the war's destruction firsthand, he knew that the world needed to be rebuilt, and he knew he was the person for the job. He took what he learned on the battlefield and spent his next years doing construction work.  He married the love of his life, Vivian, who we remember today, and they had two children Roland and  At the time, he did not receive the recognition that he was due for his service to our Nation, but we are here today to make that right.  Now, a proud father, grandfather of two, and great-grandfather of seven, he will get that long overdue acknowledgement.  I have the proud honor of presenting him with the following: Bronze Star Medal with one Bronze Service Star, Good Conduct Medal--Army, American Campaign Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Ribbon with one Bronze Service Star, and Honorable Service Lapel Pin-- George, you are a Montana farmer through and through, whether feeding Americans at home or soldiers in the field.  I am proud to call myself a farmer, if only because it means I have something in common with a man like George  George, you have spent your life providing for Montanans at home and protecting Americans overseas.  These medals serve as a small token of our Nation's appreciation for your service and your sacrifice. You are an American hero and one of Montana's best. Thank you for your service.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-16-pt1-PgS6397.txt,1829,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018",2017.0,16.0,October

269,topic-id,419,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise against the motion to instruct. I believe this is the first motion to instruct that the House has voted on so far this year and this Congress, so not all Members may not realize that, as the House and the Senate are about to go to conference committee to work out differences in the House and Senate versions of whatever bill they are focused on, procedurally it is possible to have a motion to instruct conferees, such as the gentleman from Rhode Island has offered.  That motion is not binding on the conferees, but it is an attempt to have a vote on an issue that a Member or group of Members think is important or that they can make a point upon.  The subject of this motion to instruct is the disposal of excess weapons, as the gentleman from Rhode Island mentioned.  I would just say, Mr.Speaker, I know of no evidence that--as the government has over the years disposed of these weapons, there is no evidence that any of them have been improperly used. They must be disposed of fully consistent with the law, and that includes background checks and the rest, and the proceeds support safety programs, which I would suspect that all of us think is a worthwhile endeavor.  I would also say, Mr.Speaker, the House has regularly expressed its opinion and its will with amendment votes both on the floor and in committee over the years. We have voted on this program a number of times and it has consistently been the will of the House that this program should continue. As a matter of fact, in this year's bill, we had a vote in committee and the amendment to provide for this program was adopted.  So, to me, Mr.Speaker, the most important point to make is this: the bill before us is one that helps this Congress fulfill the first responsibilities of the Federal Government, and that is to defend our citizens.  It also provides the support that the men and women who serve our Nation in the military must have if they are to carry out the missions to which they are assigned.  That is the purpose of this bill, that is the focus of this bill: to defend the country and to support our troops. That will continue to be the focus as the House and Senate move into conference.

284,topic-id,867,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, first, I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Rhode As he said, we make every effort to ensure that the support for the men and women who serve in the military is on a bipartisan basis. The gentleman from Rhode Island is a key leader on a number of those issues, whether it is cyber, directed energy, and a host of others.  I appreciate all of the Members on both sides of the aisle who have spoken. That bipartisan support is what helped lead us to pass the House version of this bill by the biggest majority in 8 years. That does not mean we agree on everything, obviously, but when it comes to supporting the military, their interests are first, and I think we need to keep it that way.  The subject of this motion to instruct is a long-running program designed to support safety programs. While we have had votes on this on the floor and in committee over the years, it has never been a particularly controversial program, even though the gentleman from Rhode Island has consistently been against it from the start. But the point is that in both the House and the Senate bills this year, there are provisions dealing with these programs. We come to some resolution every year, and for 55 straight years the conference report has gotten signed into law.  I would like to correct one point, Mr.I do not believe that the Army is opposed to this program. As a matter of fact, both Mr.Rogers and I have talked to the Army about this, and they have not expressed in any sense that they are opposed to it. They were waiting to see what direction they are given, and they are happy to go implement that.  Mr.Speaker, in recent weeks, our country has been buffeted by a number of tragedies: hurricanes; of course, wildfires going on now in the And the horrible, horrific murders in Las Vegas are much on our minds, as are the victims and the whole communities.  It is important to take time and to learn what that investigation yields so that we can, hopefully, prevent it from happening in the future.  I just want to point out that there is nothing, whether these provisions stay or go, that is going to have any effect on an event like we just saw in Las As a matter of fact, in the history of this program, I know of no single instance where one of these weapons that has been disposed of for gun safety programs has been used improperly. As a matter of fact, most of these weapons go up on a mantle somewhere. They are collectors items. So it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to try to tie that horrible tragedy in Las Vegas, or others, to these particular programs.  That leads me to the last point I would like to make, Mr.Speaker, and it is similar to the first. On a bipartisan basis, this House and, indeed, this Congress, come together to support the men and women who risk their lives to defend us. The world is getting more dangerous, and, unfortunately--the fault of both parties in both the executive and legislative branches of government--we cut our military too much. We are seeing the effects of that through declining readiness, through increasing accidents, and a whole variety of things where the fruits of that neglect is becoming more apparent.  But I think it is crucial, as we begin to rebuild and repair our military, that we not let other agendas, other issues, impair our ability to do so. I am concerned, for example, that some Republicans say: Oh, yeah, I will increase funding for defense, as long as you can cut that money in other parts of the budget.  I am concerned when Democrats say: Oh, I am for increasing defense, as long as you increase other parts of the budget.  I am concerned when anybody brings any other agenda, any other issue, that impedes our ability to support the men and women who serve our We ought to do our best to support them on the basis of those issues alone and let other debates, whatever they may be, stand on their own as well.  As I mentioned, Mr.Speaker, motions to instruct are, of course, nonbinding. I think, in this case, the better vote is to vote ``no.'' There are provisions dealing with this in both the House and the Senate bill. I hope that we can come to a reasonable conclusion on these provisions and the whole bill. But the goal is to defend the country and to support the men and women who serve. We can never be distracted from that goal.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to instruct.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to instruct.  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.

699,topic-id,1302,"Mr.President, it is probably not surprising but, unfortunately, so far Democrats have shown little disposition to work with Republicans on tax reform legislation, despite the fact that parts of our plan, like lowering corporate tax rates and switching to a territorial tax system, have been supported by Democrats as well as  One particular aspect of the Republican plan that Democrats have been taking aim at lately is our plan to repeal the death tax. They complain that it is not something to really worry about, since, they claim, relatively few estates actually have to pay the tax.  One of my Democratic colleagues released a report detailing some of the ways people try to avoid the death tax. From the tone of the press release and report, one would think that anyone trying to avoid the estate tax was a multibillionaire and a tax cheat--and greedy, to boot. But I can tell you, the actual situation is very different.  Of course there are wealthy individuals who try to reduce or eliminate their death tax liability. After all, who wants to be taxed a second or third time on money they have earned during their lifetime that they could be passing down to their children or grandchildren?  There are also a lot of small business owners and owners of family farms and ranches who have to spend tens of thousands of dollars a year trying to avoid the death tax in order to preserve their family business for another generation. Many of the farmers and ranchers in my State know that without careful and costly planning, the[[Page S6526]]Federal Government will come around after their death demanding a staggering 40 percent of their estate and that their children won't have the money to pay without risking the farm or ranch.  How does that work? Well, farming and ranching is a cash-poor business. Farmers and ranchers may own valuable land, but they are only earning cash on the crops they grow or the livestock they raise on that land. Thus, while their overall farm or ranch may have a substantial value, the amount of money they have coming in is relatively small and subject to the swings in the market from year to year.  Frequently, when farmers and ranchers die, the vast portion of their estate is made up of their land, while actual cash or liquid assets are a very small part of it. If they don't take measures to avoid having their family hit by the death tax, the family will have no choice but to sell off the land to pay the government, which means losing income-generating property or the family's farm or ranch overall.  Family-owned businesses across the country face the same situation, where the value of the estate is tied up in the business.  The threat of the death tax is a constant burden hanging over the heads of farmers and ranchers in my State who want nothing more than to be able to pass on the family farm or ranch to the next generation.  That brings me to a larger point--the need to simplify our current Tax Code, which is one of the five principles guiding Republicans' tax reform efforts.  Our Tax Code is long, and it is complicated. It is almost twice as long as it was in 1985 and nearly six times as long as it was in 1955. The instructions for the basic 1040 form alone are more than 100 pages long, and it is no surprise. The Tax Code is full of deductions, exemptions, and special rules, all of which amount to unnecessary complication and, too often, confusion.  Take education tax benefits, an area of concern for middle-class families. Currently, there are more than a dozen separate tax provisions relating to education, from the American opportunity tax credit to 529 savings accounts. Of course, these provisions come with approximately 100 pages of IRS instructions, special forms, and schedules, not to mention the professional tax preparer whom too many families have to hire to figure it all out.  Then there are small businesses, which have to navigate a bewildering mass of tax provisions and regulations but often don't have the money to hire the professional help they need. I think it is fair to say that a big reason some small businesses fail to get off the ground is because they lack the resources that would enable them to deal with the Tax Code,  Then, of course, as I mentioned before, there is that other bane of small businesses and family farms and ranches; that is, again, the death tax. The death tax forces farmers and ranchers to invest a significant amount of time and money in complex estate plans, insurance, and expensive tax professionals so they can preserve their farm or ranch for their children.  According to a recent survey by Family Enterprise USA, of those indicating that they undertook estate-planning efforts, the average planning cost in 2016 was more than $170,000, and that doesn't include the average cost of insurance to pay for the death tax, which was $75,000 a year. Those are simply wasted resources that could be used to reinvest back into the business, create new jobs, and increase wages--all of which would help us achieve the kind of economic growth we have been lacking for the past 8 years.  Republicans don't think farmers and ranchers should have to spend tens of thousands of dollars a year to preserve their farm or ranch for their children. We don't think families should have to hire a tax preparer to file a basic income tax form. We don't think it should cost small businesses between $15 billion and $16 billion each year to comply with the Tax We don't think you should have to be an accountant to figure out what tax deductions, exemptions, or credits you qualify for. We don't think the Tax Code should prevent Americans from starting a small business or expanding an existing business to provide more jobs or higher wages for their employees. So the comprehensive tax reform bill we are currently drafting will simplify the Tax It will eliminate loopholes and special rules and dedicate those savings to easing the tax burden on hard-working families and small businesses. It will drastically ease the tax return process, with the hope of making it as easy for Americans to file their taxes as it is to fill out a postcard. It will eliminate the death tax so that family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches in my home State of South Dakota and around the country can focus their dollars on growing their businesses, not paying for tax professionals to preserve it.  Our bill will simplify and streamline tax benefits so that you don't need to hire a tax professional to figure out which education or home ownership or other tax benefits you qualify for. So it is disappointing that our Democratic colleagues are so hostile to the idea of working with Republicans that they are passing on the chance to join us to provide the American people with unprecedented relief from our antiquated and overgrown Tax  The single most important thing we can do for Americans struggling with stagnant wages and a dearth of opportunities is to pass comprehensive tax reform. By reforming our Tax Code, we can provide the American people with more and better paying jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks. Most importantly, we can do this for the long term.  I hope Democrats will rethink their opposition and join us as we work to provide the American people with the relief that they have been waiting for and that they deserve.

665,topic-id,1302,"Mr.President, while Senator Enzi is on the floor, I want to thank him for his leadership in the Budget Committee and taking us through this very important vote today.  I want to talk a little bit in terms that maybe people can understand what is going on here and what will be going on over the next few days.  What we are doing right now is passing a budget. Our budget is no different than your household budget, when you sit down and you figure out, over some period of time, how much money you have and how much money you need to spend, where maybe you need to spend more and maybe you need to spend less. That is all we are doing with this budget.  This budget is not the tax reform bill. That will come after we pass a budget, but if we don't pass this budget, there is no possible way we can actually pass tax reform. That is why I support this budget. That is why I will work to defeat any amendments that will prevent this budget from being passed. Then we can start having an honest discussion about what we need to do around tax reform.  I know the Senator from South Carolina did a great job, as he always does on the floor, talking about why he supports tax reform. He is somebody we should really listen to. He is somebody who came up through truly humble means. You have people come on this floor and they talk about how the people who are supporting tax reform are just doing this for the billionaires and the rich.  I would encourage you to go out to the internet and take a look at Senator Scott's story and tell me if that is somebody predisposed to helping the rich. He is here to help the little guy. He is here to get the economy going so people can get back to work. He is here to actually create opportunities for wages to go up. He is here to actually do what we have been promising for 20 years and haven't done--almost 30 years.  Over that span of time, America has lost traction as the greatest economy that has ever existed. This tax reform measure, after we pass the budget, is to really get to a point to where States like West Virginia--you heard Senator Capito talk about 95 percent of the jobs created in West Virginia are small businesses. How could anybody sincerely come to this floor and say Senator Capito is only supporting this for the wealthy corporations? They just don't exist in any large number in West  In my State, 80 percent of the jobs that are created are small businesses as well. So how anybody could suggest that there are those of us coming to the floor just talking about tax breaks for the rich and for corporations really need to go back and look at our Look at who is struggling and whom we are here trying to help. We get to the tax reform bill after we pass the budget. That is why I am going to support the budget.  Now, to some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, the Founding Fathers did strive to create a more perfect Union, but they created an imperfect democratic process. This is the sausage factory we call democracy. It is not intended to be perfect, nor does it ever produce anything that is perfect legislation--something that is done and you never come back to it.  Those who come to this floor and say: Unless I can have that perfect, I am not willing to support the good, they really need to go back and rethink why they are here. We are here to start fulfilling promises. You don't do it by coming onto this floor and saying: I really want to do tax reform but only if it is my perfect solution. You start by making progress. Then you build on that progress. You start getting the economy to grow, and you use those resources to better fund the most challenged people we have in this Nation, use those resources to grow the economy and give younger people an opportunity to realize the American dream the way I did back in the 1980s.  That is why we have to pass this budget. That is why we have to set aside our personal preferences for something far better than probably will ever come out of this Chamber but something good that begins to fulfill the promises we made to the American people.  When we get past the budget, we are going to do something called vote-arama tomorrow. Vote-arama is an interesting process, mainly because it is a bunch of votes that don't mean anything. There are going to be people who come up here, and they will file a bill. It will go up or down. Even if it goes up, it doesn't have the force of law.  Tomorrow, if you are here, it is a lot like going to good theater. At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is the final vote, and that is the vote on the budget. That is something every single person in this Chamber should support. Then we need to move on to tax reform that has a meaningful, lasting impact for the poorest, most challenged people in this country. It is not about tax breaks for the rich. It is not about tax breaks for corporations. It is about small businesses in West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina or across this Nation that need help. It is about those employees that, if we do this right, will be making more money. They will have more money to pay their bills. It is about making a conscious decision about how much money we can spend on Medicaid and to be absolutely certain we can fulfill the promise to people challenged by it. It is about fulfilling the promise to people on Social Security and Medicare, to make sure those programs can fulfill the promises we made.  This isn't about absolute cuts to This is about how much it should grow every single year to be absolutely certain those programs are going to be there 10, 15, and 20 years from now. If you have an opportunity to sit up in the Gallery and pay attention to these words, go back and really fact check some of what is being said. Go back and look at the backgrounds of some of the Members on this side of the aisle who support tax reform. They grew up as the little guy. They grew up in challenged situations. They represent States where the vast majority of the people in those States are, themselves, challenged. Anybody who can sincerely come down here and say this is about the rich, this is about the corporations, come spend time in North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee, States across this I come from the Southeast, but they are the ones that come out of my mouth.  I worry about all those little businesses. I worry about all those challenged people. This budget lays the groundwork for us to actually put meaningful policy in place for the first time in about 30 years that is sincerely attempting to fulfill the promises the politicians make in this Chamber every single day.  I hope all of our Members will come down here and accept the fact that perfect doesn't happen, but some good can happen. Good begins by passing this budget, and it continues by passing tax reform that will help the most challenged among us.  I yield the floor.[[Page S6521]]  The PRESIDING The Senator from                           Amendment 1120  ",CREC-2017-10-18-pt1-PgS6492-3.txt,2291,ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR DISASTER RELIEF REQUIREMENTS,2017.0,18.0,October

Reauthorizing the SBIR and STTR programs are critical to supporting our Nation's most forward-thinking entrepreneurs and innovators. I am relieved that we are preserving the critical parts of the programs and continuing to improve upon the programs themselves.  These programs have proven to be one of the most successful Federal programs for technological innovation in United States history, delivering more than 70,000 patents and valuable innovations in agriculture, defense, energy, health sciences, homeland security, space, transportation, and other fields.  Through Phase I and Phase II SBIR, countless jobs have been created in the capital region of New It is through programs such as SBIR that our region has developed the underpinnings of support for a boom in high technology innovation and economic development.  One of many examples of this is Ecovative Design located within my congressional district in Green Island, New York, which has benefitted from the SBIR program over a number of years. These efforts will allow the company to continue its work on a replacement of engineered wood resins that will be economically competitive and nontoxic.  The resin system represents cost and energy savings, and is capable of leveraging existing manufacturing equipment in production today. This funding will help them deliver on the promise of this innovative technology.  Gavin McIntyre, cofounder and chief scientist at Ecovative said: ``We're very excited to bring our new material technology to market and displace toxic formaldehyde-based resins. The SBIR/STTR program was fundamental to how Ecovative got its start and has enabled us to continue to take risks and develop game-changing technology.''  While this bill is a positive step forward towards helping more small businesses, we must do more to help other small businesses develop these types of game-changing technologies.  I recognize the value of research and I will fight to see more funding for all these agencies and, in turn, more funding for the SBIR and STTR programs.

641,topic-id,3024,"Mr.President, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  I want to say some words about our Budget resolution, which I hope we will be passing this week, and how important it is that we do, in fact, pass this. I want to clarify a few issues because the tax reform legislation continues to be a work in progress, and many elements have been mischaracterized, while others have been made up out of the clear blue sky.  Let me start with the budget resolution and start by thanking Chairman Enzi for the very hard work he has done and the very great work he has[[Page S6495]]done in bringing together the Republican conference around a budget resolution that I think is very likely to pass.  Let's be candid about what this is about. The budget resolution is about giving us the tools to pass tax reform later this year. That is what this budget resolution is about. It is a misnomer, really, when you think about it. The most important substantive item in the budget resolution, by far, is the procedural tools it will give us to pass tax reform with a simple majority vote in the Senate, so that a minority of the body is not able to block tax reform by filibuster. That is what this is about. That is what we are endeavoring to accomplish here.  Why is it important? The main reason it is so important is because for so long we--our entire country--have been laboring with such feeble economic growth. For the last 60 years, prior to the Obama administration, annual economic growth in America was 3.4 percent. During the entire 8-year administration of President Obama, we never once had a single year where we reached even 3 percent. The Congressional Budget Office believes that we are now locked into the indefinite future of sub-2 percent economic growth, and that is what we just have to accept. We have to settle for the fact that we are no longer a booming economy. We are not capable of being a booming economy.  There are a lot of problems with this. I think it is completely unacceptable to believe that, somehow, because a calendar year turned on a page or because Obama was elected President some years ago, it is not possible for America to have the robust economic growth that used to be ordinary. It is not true that we are somehow consigned to feeble growth, and it matters if our economy is growing at 2 percent. It takes 36 years to double the standard of living for the average family. If we just managed to get the growth to 3 percent, and that is less than the historical average, then we can double our standard of living in just over 20 years. It is a big difference in the standard of living of the people who I represent. That is what this is about.  If we get this budget resolution passed this week, the tax reform that many of us are working very hard on has two big goals, certainly for me. I have had many discussions with my colleagues on the Finance Committee and outside the Finance Committee, and I think these goals are widely shared.  The first is that it absolutely has to provide tax relief for hard-working Americans--middle income, lower income, people of modest means, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck. There has to be a direct tax benefit for those Pennsylvanians, those Arkansans, and those people all across  How are we going to do that? It is very clear. There is no question. There will be a reduction in the tax rates that are applied to income for hard-working There is going to be an increase in the standard deduction that they can take, which means a bigger chunk of their income that doesn't get taxed at all. That is absolutely going to be a feature of this tax reform. We are going to increase the child tax credit, so that people who have the cost of raising a family with kids are going to get a credit toward that cost.  The combined effect of these things are absolutely going to lower the tax rates for hard-working Americans, for lower income and middle-income families. If it didn't accomplish that, it wouldn't even get out of the Finance Committee, much less pass a vote on this floor. That is 1. There are still dials to be turned and rates to be set--exactly where the various brackets begin and end. These details are still a work in progress, but that goal is going to be achieved. That is item 1.  But the other item is really important too, and that is the process by which all of these very same families get an indirect pay raise. They get a pay raise. It will happen over time, and it will happen in different ways. That happens by creating incentives to maximize economic growth and to get away from this sub-2 percent, barely growing economy we have been tolerating and to get back to something closer to what is normal for America--an economy that is growing at least 3 percent.  What happens if we have stronger economic growth? I mentioned before that we increase the standard of living much more quickly. People get to see their kids have a better life and a better standard of living than they had. They can see that trend is going to continue. It happens because new businesses start to get launched again. It happens because existing businesses expand. Both new businesses and expanding businesses hire more workers. When you hire more workers, especially at a time when most economists think we are at something close to what they consider full employment, it puts direct, immediate, and upward pressure on wages, which is what we have been waiting for.  So not only will a working family discover they owe less money to Uncle Sam, but they are very likely to quickly be in a position where they are getting a pay raise because their employer has to pay them more to keep them because we are going to create more demand for workers. How do we do that? One of the ways we are going to do that, I hope--and this is, again, a work in progress; it is underway--is that we ought to make our business tax regime, our big business Tax Code competitive. Anyone who looks at this honestly knows that our Tax Code is not competitive today. American workers and businesses lose out to competition from overseas because other countries have much more competitive tax codes. It is entirely possible, and I think you could make the case, that the American Tax Code is the worst in the world. It is that bad, and when it is that bad, that means our workers and our businesses are much less able to compete. So we are going to try to fix that. That means lowering the rate on income tax for our businesses to something that is comparable to what the rest of the world pays, rather than the extremely high outlier rate that we have today.  It also means that we ought to allow our businesses to expense capital when they put it to work. What does that mean? That means that when a company says we are going to buy a new piece of equipment, a new piece of machinery, a new vehicle, or a new backhoe--whatever it might be--you allow the company to recognize that expense when the expense occurs for tax purposes. That might just seems like common sense. Why wouldn't you do that? We don't do that today. For a large category of new equipment that businesses go out and purchase, even though they have to buy it in the year in which they put it into service and they have to come up with the cash, they don't get to reduce their income accordingly, except over many years. What that means is that it makes it effectively more expensive to buy that equipment. They have to pay tax on money they don't have. That means they buy less equipment.  What difference does this make? It makes a lot of difference. Again, there is a direct effect and an indirect effect. A direct effect is that by allowing businesses to fully expense the capital they put to work, we are going to encourage them to buy more items. That means more work, more production for the kind of machinery and equipment that these businesses are likely to buy. But it gets better than that because when businesses deploy that capital--when they buy a new piece of equipment, a new piece of machinery, when they upgrade their software, or whatever they are doing with this capital expenditure--they are making their workforce more productive. They are making their employees able to produce more in a given hour in a given day, and when workers are more productive, that is when a business can afford to pay them more, and in fact, has to pay them more. That is where pay raises come from. They come from productivity growth. Productivity growth comes when capital gets put to work. We are going to encourage more of that, and that is going to result in higher wages and higher income for the people we all represent.  The third point I want to make about this tax reform is that it is very important that we fix a broken part of our code that deals with overseas subsidiaries of American firms and foreign firms that operate in the United That part of our Tax Code is a disaster. We have all read about the corporate inversions, for instance,[[Page S6496]]where an American-based company seeks to be acquired by a foreign company for the sole purpose of lowering its tax burden. That happens. It happens because our Tax Code drives it.  We have all heard about the $2 to $3 trillion of profits that American companies have earned in overseas subsidiaries. They will not bring the money home because if they were to do so, they would have to pay another huge tax on top of what they already paid in the jurisdiction of whatever country their subsidiary operates in. Why would we tolerate a system like that? We have an opportunity to fix that. If we fix that, then huge sums of money will come flooding back into the United That is going to get invested here. That is going to mean more businesses, new expansion, and more hiring. That is going to be tremendously constructive for our economy, and, going forward, we will eliminate this perverse incentive to have multinational companies headquartered anywhere but in the United States, which is the case today.  In short, this is our opportunity to begin to achieve the growth we have been waiting for. Ever since the great recession, we have not had the kind of economic growth that used to be normal for A completely archaic, terribly unfair, ridiculously complicated Tax Code is part of the reason why.  You might ask: How did we used to have such strong growth with this Tax Code? The fact is that most of the rest of the world has been about the business of improving their tax code while we have not. This is our moment and our opportunity to begin to catch up. We can do it in a big way, as long as we pass this budget and give ourselves the tools to do so.  This budget resolution creates the opportunity to do tax reform. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have criticized the fact that we are setting up a process and using the budget resolution so that the subsequent tax reform can be passed with a simple majority vote in the They have criticized that. They suggested, in varying degrees, that somehow that leaves them out of the process. Let me be very clear. That is categorically untrue. As to the tax reform bill, we are working on the ideas for this now, and when we actually get to drafting the specifics, it is going to happen in the Finance Committee in the It is going to happen in the Ways and Means Committee in the It is going to be public. The documents are going to be disclosed before the markups begin, and it is going to be open to amendments.  My Democratic colleagues on the Finance Committee are going to be able to offer whatever amendments they like. They can work with us on shaping this, and I hope they will join us in voting for it. It is much better if we could end up passing this with a big bipartisan vote. A tax bill that absolutely does lower the direct tax burden on lower income and middle-income families and encourages more economic growth ought to be something that could be broadly supported. They will have every opportunity to weigh in. They will have every opportunity to amend it. There is nothing about this procedure that in any way excludes Democratic participation.  What it does do, though, is that it says that we will not be held hostage by a minority that wishes to thwart this. If we can persuade at least 50 Senators and a Vice President who is so inclined in the Chair, we will have the ability to pass tax reform. I think it would be malpractice for us not to create the opportunity to do tax reform with a simple majority since we have that vehicle available to us. I believe we are going to pass it today.  Another point I would like to address is the discussion that somehow we are going to blow a hole in the deficit with this. It couldn't be further from the truth, in my view. The budget resolution allows the Finance Committee to report back a tax reform package that will, by a very particular and very precisely defined process, be deemed to forego $1.5 trillion in Federal revenue over the next 10 years. But when you start to unpack that, you realize that, in all likelihood, if we do this tax reform right, we are going to reduce the size of the deficit over this 10-year period. We are not going to increase it.  Why do I say that? First of all, the $1.5 trillion in foregone revenue contemplated by the budget resolution is very misleading because it pretends that the current policy we have of a number of temporary tax relief measures is going to go away. It pretends we are not going to continue those or extend them. In all likelihood, Congress routinely extends them. They will probably be extended. That is worth about $500 billion of that $1.5 trillion. What we are really talking about is $1 trillion of less revenue over the next 10 years. You have to keep in mind, that is on a base of about $43 trillion. It is something on the order of recalling 2.5 percent of projected Federal revenue.  I think the question to ask is, How much extra economic growth will it take to fully offset $1 trillion worth of forgone revenue? Well, that math is pretty easy because the joint tax plan and the Congressional Budget Office have quantified this many times. The answer is something like approximately four-tenths of 1 percent. Four-tenths of 1 percent of extra economic growth, in response to the tremendously pro-growth incentives that we want to put into this Tax Code, will fully offset that.  The Congressional Budget Office is projecting, on average, for the next 10 years, our economy is going to continue at this feeble 1.9 percent--1.9 percent is their number. If getting these reforms right, if lowering the tax burden on working families, if allowing business to expand, making our international and business Tax Codes competitive, if we do that right, I have absolutely no doubt we can generate much more than an additional four-tenths of 1 percent of growth.  When we get the specifics, we will have an opportunity and we will have many analyses that we will be able to look at to address this question of just how much economic growth we will have. In my view, it is extremely likely that we will significantly surpass this very modest hurdle of four-tenths of 1 percent of growth.  Finally, the minority leader made reference to this being a big tax cut for the wealthy. I will remind my colleagues, we can have differences of opinions. We can have a debate here, and we will, but let's remember, this tax reform bill is not written yet.  The two big goals I mentioned I think are universally shared on our side of the aisle, tax relief for middle-income working families and pro-growth policies. We haven't written the details yet. We haven't established exactly what the brackets will be, exactly what the rates will be, where they will kick in, how the passthrough rates apply. There are a lot of important details that are going to be worked out in committee, which is exactly what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle insisted we should be doing, and that is what we should be doing. It also means, since that product is not yet finished, it is not possible for anyone to pull out a number and say X percent of this bill is going to go to this category of people. That is not knowable because the bill is not finished yet.  I am thrilled about this opportunity that we are going to create this week to pass the tax reform later this year that will allow us to achieve the growth we have been waiting for, and that means allowing my constituents, Pennsylvanians, and people all across America to achieve the standard of living they deserve, that they are working hard to achieve, and that they will be able to enjoy.

858,topic-id,2299,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the GAO opinion letter dated October 19, 2017, related to the Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending of March 22, 2013, Federal Register citation 78 FR 17766.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   U.Government                                        Accountability Office,                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 2017.     Subject: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of          Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit          Insurance Corporation--Applicability of the Congressional          Review Act to Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending     Pat Toomey,     U.      Dear Senator Toomey: You asked whether the final      Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending (Interagency      Guidance or Guidance), issued jointly on March 22, 2013, by      the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the      Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board),      and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is a      rule for purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA). CRA      establishes a process for congressional review of agency      rules and establishes special expedited procedures under      which Congress may pass a joint resolution of disapproval      that, if enacted into law, overturns the rule. Congressional      review is assisted by CRA's requirement that all federal      agencies, including independent regulatory agencies, submit      each rule to both Houses of Congress and to the Government      Accountability Office (GAO) before it can take effect. For      the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the Interagency      Guidance is a general statement of policy and is a rule under      the                               BACKGROUND                        Congressional Review Act       CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight      of agency rulemaking, requires all federal agencies,      including independent regulatory agencies, to submit a report      on each new rule to both Houses of Congress and to the      Comptroller General before it can take effect. The report      must contain a copy of the rule, ``a concise general      statement relating to the rule,'' and the rule's proposed      effective date. In addition, the agency must submit to the      Comptroller General a complete copy of the cost-benefit      analysis of the rule, if any, and information concerning the      agency's actions relevant to specific procedural rulemaking      requirements set forth in various statutes and executive      orders governing the regulatory process.       CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative      Procedure Act (APA), which states in relevant part that a      rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of      general or particular applicability and future effect      designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy      or describing the organization, procedure, or practice      requirements of an agency.'' CRA excludes three categories of      rules from coverage: (1) rules of particular applicability;      (2) rules relating to agency management or personnel; and (3)      rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do      not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-     agency parties. The Agencies did not send a report on the      Interagency Guidance to Congress or the Comptroller General      because, as they stated in their letters to our Office, in      their opinion the Guidance is not a rule under the               Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending       On March 22, 2013, OCC, the Board, and FDIC (referred to      collectively as the Agencies) issued the Interagency      Guidance, which forms the basis of the Agencies' review of      the leveraged lending activities of supervised financial      institutions. Leveraged lending generally encompasses large      loans to corporate borrowers for the purposes of ``mergers      and acquisitions, business recapitalization and financing,      equity buyouts, and business . . . expansions.'' Leveraged      loans raise risk concerns because of the size of the loans      relative to the borrower's cash flow, and are generally used      to finance one-time business transactions rather than a      company's ordinary course of business activities. The      Guidance outlines the Agencies' minimum expectations on a      wide range of topics related to leveraged lending, including      underwriting standards, valuation standards, the risk rating      of leveraged loans, and problem credit management.       The Interagency Guidance is ``designed to assist financial      institutions in providing leveraged lending to creditworthy      borrowers in a safe-and-sound manner.'' It does so by      describing expectations for the sound risk management of      leveraged lending activities and lists a number of      considerations for financial institutions: (1) the ratio of a      borrower's debt to the company's earnings before interest,      taxes, amortization and depreciation; (2) the ability of the      borrower to amortize its secured debt, and (3) the level of      due diligence performed in evaluating the loan. The Guidance      explains the types of actions that concern the Agencies and      that might motivate them to initiate a supervisory action      that would require an independent finding that an unsafe or      unsound action has occurred.                                ANALYSIS       As an initial matter, one argument raised by the Agencies      is that since the Guidance explicitly states that it is not a      rule or a rulemaking action, it should not be considered a      rule under However, although an agency's      characterization should be considered in deciding whether its      action is a rule under APA (and whether, for example, it is      subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements), ``an      agency's own label . . . is not dispositive.'' Similarly, an      agency's characterization is not determinative of whether it      is a rule under       The focus of the arguments made by the Agencies is that the      Interagency Guidance is a general statement of policy and is      not subject to the They assert that the Guidance is a      statement that explains how they will exercise their broad      enforcement discretion. They maintain that it does not      establish legally binding standards, is not certain or final,      and does not substantially affect the rights or obligations      of third parties. As a result, they claim, the Interagency      Guidance is not a rule under       The Supreme Court has described ``general statements of      policy'' as ``statements issued by an agency to advise the      public prospectively of the manner in which the agency      proposes to exercise a discretionary power.'' In other words,      a statement of policy announces the agency's tentative      intentions for the future:       ``A general statement of policy . . . does not establish a      'binding norm.' It is not finally determinative of the issues      or rights to which it is addressed. The agency cannot apply      or rely upon a general statement of policy as law because a      general statement of policy only announces what the agency      seeks to establish as policy.''       The Interagency Guidance provides information on the manner      in which the Agencies[[Page S6637]]     will exercise their enforcement authority regarding leveraged      lending activities, does not establish a ``binding norm,''      and does not determine the outcome of any Agency examination      of a financial institution. Rather, the Guidance expresses      the regulators' expectations regarding the sound risk      management of leveraged lending activities. We agree with the      Agencies that the Guidance is a general statement of policy.      However, the issue presented here is whether this general      statement of policy is a rule under       GAO has previously held that general statements of policy      are rules under For example, in B-287557, May 14, 2001,      we decided whether a ``record of decision'' (ROD) issued by      the Fish and Wildlife Service in connection with a federal      irrigation project was a rule under We found that the      ROD was a general statement of policy regarding water flow      and ecosystems issues in both the Trinity and Sacramento      The ROD modified prior policy in an attempt, in part,      to restore fish habitat.       We cited to the APA definition of ``rule,'' which includes      ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or      particular applicability and future effect designed to      implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or      describing the organization, procedure, or practice      requirements of an agency.'' This definition includes three      key components: (1) an agency statement, (2) of future      effect, and (3) designed to implement, interpret, or      prescribe law or policy. We stated that this definition is      broad, and includes both rules requiring notice and comment      rulemaking and those that do not, such as general statements      of policy.       We noted that, since CRA adopts the definition of ``rule''      from APA, it too covers both those requiring notice and      comment and general statements of policy, which do not. We      decided that the ROD fell squarely within CRA as an agency      action that constituted a ``statement of general . . .      applicability and future effect designed to implement,      interpret or prescribe law or policy.'' We also noted that      Congress intended CRA to cover, not only formal rulemaking,      but also rules requiring notice and comment under 5 U.S.     553(c), rules that are not subject to notice and comment      requirements, including rules that must be published in the      Federal Register before taking effect (5 U S 552(a)(1) and      (2)), and other guidance documents. Since a general statement      of policy is specifically included among the types of agency      actions subject to the requirements of Sections 552(a)(1) (D)      and (a)(2)(B), it is clear that CRA covers general statements      of policy.       Additionally, in B-316048, April 17, 2008, we considered      whether a letter issued by the Centers for Medicare and      Medicaid Services (CMS) to state health officials concerning      the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was a      rule under We concluded that the letter was subject to      CRA because it was, in fact, a rule subject to notice and      comment rulemaking requirements. However, in that decision we      also discussed general statements of policy under CMS      had argued that the letter was a general statement of policy      ``announcing the course which the agency intends to follow''      in future adjudications, i.e., what the agency seeks to      establish as policy. We explained that the definition of      ``rule'' under both APA and CRA includes ``a statement of      general or particular applicability and future effect      designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or      policy.'' As a device that provides information on the manner      in which an agency will exercise its authority or what the      agency will seek to propose as policy, we noted that a      general statement of policy would appear to fit squarely      within this definition of a rule subject to       In deciding that a general statement of policy is a rule      for CRA purposes, our prior decisions cite to the legislative      history of CRA, which confirms that rules subject to CRA      requirements include general statements of policy. A      principal sponsor of the legislation that became CRA made      clear that general statements of policy are covered by CRA,      stating that ``[t]he committees intend [CRA] to be      interpreted broadly with regard to the type and scope of      rules that are subject to congressional review.'' The sponsor      added that documents covered by CRA include ``statements of      general policy, interpretations of general applicability, and      administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that      affect a member of the public.''       Additionally, in a floor statement during final      consideration of the bill that became CRA, another principal      sponsor of the legislation pointed out that rules subject to      CRA include agency general statements of policy.       ``Although agency interpretive rules, general statements of      policy, guideline documents, and agency policy and procedure      manuals may not be subject to the notice and comment      provisions of section 553(c) of title 5, United States Code,      these types of documents are covered under the congressional      review provisions of the new chapter 8 of title 5.       ``Under section 801(a) [CRA], covered rules, with very few      exceptions, may not go into effect until the relevant agency      submits a copy of the rule and an accompanying report to both      Houses of Interpretive rules, general statements of      policy, and analogous agency policy guidelines are covered      without qualification because they meet the definition of a      'rule' borrowed from section 551 of title 5, and are not      excluded from the definition of a rule.''       We note that legal commentators also support the conclusion      that CRA's requirements are applicable to general statements      of policy. They have pointed out that federal agency actions      fitting CRA's definition of a rule include ``such items as .      . . general statements of policy,'' and that ``the      legislative history of the Act . . . makes clear that this      scope was understood and intended.''       Nonetheless, the Agencies assert that because the Guidance      does not establish legally binding standards, is not certain      or final, and does not substantially affect the rights or      obligations of third parties, it is not a rule under      They cite to our decisions in which we found that agency      actions that imposed binding requirements that were ``both      certain and final'' were rules for CRA purposes. However,      while our decisions recognize those characteristics as      indicative of certain types of rules subject to CRA      requirements, they do not suggest that the absence of those      characteristics requires a determination that an agency      action is not a rule under Moreover, when GAO has      examined the issue whether an agency's action substantially      affects the rights or obligations of third parties, it has      been in the context of analyzing whether the action falls      within the CRA exception for agency rules of practice or      procedure, not in deciding whether it meets the definition of      rule.       The Agencies also cite to language in certain court      decisions to suggest that policy statements are not rules      under However, those decisions do not support such a      conclusion. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that      rules under the APA include ``'substantive [legislative]      rules' on the one hand'' as well as ``general statements of      policy'' and other non-legislative rules on the other.       We can readily conclude that the Guidance does not fall      within any of the three exceptions in We note here that      the Interagency Guidance is of general and not particular      applicability, does not relate to agency management or      personnel, and is not a rule of agency organization,      procedure, or practice.                               CONCLUSION       The Interagency Guidance is a general statement of policy      designed to assist financial institutions in providing      leveraged lending to creditworthy borrowers in a sound      manner. As such, it is a rule subject to the requirements of                Sincerely yours,                                                  Susan Poling,     General                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-19-pt1-PgS6636-2.txt,1594,1900,2017.0,19.0,October

655,topic-id,1375,"Thank you, Madam President, for the recognition.  Madam President, today I wish to talk a little bit about something very obscure that is buried in this budget bill, but it is something that is very, very important to me. First, before I talk about the specific policy issues, I just want to talk about a personal exploration I had. This is with regard to[[Page S6510]]the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and this special area up here called the 1002 area.  I had the opportunity in the 1980s to take a raft trip down across this Arctic Coastal Plain and down to the sea, and part of the reason was that many of the Alaska Senators at the time used to say: If you are going to make policy in Alaska, you ought to see that part of So I took the opportunity to see it. I took a raft trip down a river called the Hula Hula River, which flows out of the Brooks Range, a large mountain range, into the Beaufort  I can say that from my personal experience, this is one of the wildest, most magnificent places on the  I would like to talk a little bit about the creatures and critters we saw there. We saw the beginning of the caribou migration, which occurs over in Canada to this area in Alaska, where they calf on the 1002 area. It is one of the biggest migrations in the world of a mammal species. We saw grizzly bears. One grizzly bear actually came into our camp, and we had to retreat and watch whatever it was going to do until it moved along. We saw musk oxen. We saw polar bears. We saw what a marvelous and incredible area this was and what a rich, rich ecosystem it was.  I was reminded of my Uncle Mo, Congressman Morris Udall, who was the author in 1980 of legislative protections for this area. He required congressional action to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and this 1002 area. He did that because he realized how significant and how magnificent it was.  One of the things we have to realize is what we are protecting here. People travel all over the world to go to the Serengeti and see the migration of the animals on the Serengeti plains. This same caribou migration is very much like the In fact, it is our Serengeti, when you have animals migrate from Canada all the way into Alaska and back. This is our It is a special place. It is a real treasure, and I don't have any doubt in my mind that we should save it.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge represents one of the world's wildest and more biodiverse places. Its Coastal Plain or the 1002 area is the biological heart of the refuge. There is no other place like it on the planet. Congress showed remarkable restraint and forethought when it put the Refuge under Federal protection, and I am proud my Uncle Mo Udall was instrumental in passing legislation that doubled the size of the Under that law, only Congress can open up the 1002 area for drilling.  Today I rise in strong opposition to the Republican proposal to drill for oil in this remarkable place. I will fight their plan tooth and nail. The only reason they are doing this is to pay for tax cuts for big corporations and tax cuts for the richest  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain is an environmental time machine. It is a rare place on this Earth, where almost everything has been preserved as it was over 10,000 years ago. Oil and gas development would change its delicate ecosystem forever. We could never get it back.  This Refuge is the largest Arctic conservation area on the globe. It is part of our national heritage. It is part of the world's heritage. That is why I compare it to the Serengeti, where people travel from all over the world to see that migration. The same thing is true here. It would be wrong to plunder this magnificent area for short-term gain, especially when that gain is speculative.  The 1002 area is home to 37 species of land mammals, 8 species of marine mammals, 42 fish species, and over 200 species of birds. Migratory birds fly in and out of this area from every State and every continent. The coastal plain in the Refuge is only 20 to 30 miles wide. No other equivalent slice of Alaska's North Slope is as biologically diverse.  Let me share a few examples of the wildlife that depend on this area. Here is a photograph of a caribou and its young during the spring calving time. The 1002 area hosts the largest and most concentrated herd of Porcupine caribou in the world: 197,000 caribou make the longest land migration of any animal--2,700 miles--to give birth there on the coastal plain in the 1002 area. Their numbers are strong now, but even a small change in reproductive rates could threaten the herd's existence.  Here is a picture of a polar bear. Nine hundred Beaufort Sea polar bears den on- and offshore in this area. The magnificent polar bear is threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and with climate change causing sea ice to melt rapidly, more bears are expected to den on shore.  Here is a photo of the musk oxen. About 250 musk oxen live there year-round. This impressive mammal survived the last ice age, but forcing them from their habitat now could threaten their survival.  People also depend on the The Gwich'in have lived there for thousands of years. They call themselves people of the caribou because their culture and way of life are intertwined with the Porcupine caribou herd. Caribou represents about 80 percent of the Gwich'in people's diet. They use caribou skins for clothing, bedding, and shelter. They make fish hooks, skin scrapers, and other tools from Caribou bones.  Gwich'in are spiritually tied to the caribou as well. They have a saying: ``Every caribou has a bit of the human heart in them; and every human has a bit of caribou heart.'' The Gwich'in people depend on the caribou for their material and spiritual survival. Oil development in caribou calving grounds would threaten their very future.  The Republicans' budget resolution instructs the Senate Energy Committee to identify at least $1 billion in deficit savings over the next 10 years. The Republicans have their sights on the 1002 area to produce that $10 billion. As I said, this estimate is highly speculative, but, for the sake of argument, let's assume the number of $1 billion is correct. It still doesn't even scratch the surface of the $1.5 trillion deficit the Republicans recklessly propose. It is not even one one-thousandth of the money the Republicans need to raise to pay for the megadeficit they will rack up to pay for a tax break for the superwealthy.  Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not necessary for U.energy independence. We are now an oil exporter, and oil prices are low. Low prices are forcing companies to stop drilling in areas that are much more accessible and less sensitive to development. Opening the Refuge now makes even less sense as more and more people are demanding fuel-efficient and electric cars.  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the last truly wild places in The decision to protect the Refuge from drilling was done carefully and thoughtfully. The decision to undo that protection should be given the same care and thought.  We haven't held hearings. We haven't even been able to hear from and question experts. Directing the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to draft legislation to raise funds without a public process is premature. The American people will have to live with our decision. This rushed proposal shortchanges them and it shortchanges future generations.  There are few places left in the world where the Arctic coastal plains, foothills and mountains and the wildlife they support are wild and free. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of those places. This unique, grand, and biologically rich place deserves full protection in perpetuity.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, the people of Puerto Rico, 3.5 million of our fellow citizens, are suffering.

More than 85 percent of the island is without electricity. One-third of Puerto Ricans lack access to drinkable water, which will surge the number of bacterial infections and mosquito-borne illnesses.  As Puerto Rico faces this humanitarian crisis, the President of the United States is tweeting out threats to withdraw assistance. That is an outrage. It is an insult. It is an abdication of the President's solemn duty to protect the safety and security of the American people. American citizens everywhere deserve better.  Where the President is failing to lead, Congress must act, and act now.  The legislation we are debating today is far from sufficient. It is not enough, but it is a start. It is a downpayment in helping the response process. It will keep FEMA operating, removing debris and distributing food and water.  It also helps Puerto Rico's Government address a looming cash shortfall. With the government running out of money by November 1, vital services could be suspended when residents can least afford it.  This bill would provide a short-term cash infusion for the government to keep going.

They were tired of being crushed by rising healthcare costs due to They wanted America's economy to prosper again. They wanted a secure border.  During the months that followed, Congress worked with President Trump to sign over 50 bills into law. On top of that, the House passed over 270 laws that now sit in the Senate awaiting action.  Despite this legislation, there is a unified voice that is loud and clear arriving daily from our base, saying, ``Get something done.'' The reason for that call is because Americans continue to be crushed by government policies, something that is very evident. These are the same policies that drove them to vote for us in the first place.  Americans are scarred by the broken promises of the former administration. They could not keep their doctor, even though they were told by the former President they could. Their premiums did not go down $2,500, and their exchanges did not work.  ObamaCare resulted in fewer options and increased costs for many Out-of-pocket costs continue to soar, with overage deductibles for bronze plans topping $6,000 in 2017.  Some States, like Arizona, faced premium increases of 116 percent; Oklahoma, 69 percent. Tennessee faced a 63 percent increase. And one-third of counties have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Some entire States like Wyoming, right below me, South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Alaska only have one insurer.  Think about that. This trend is predicted to worsen, with half of American counties only having one insurer in 2018.  As we have come to almost 8 years with the ACA, or ObamaCare, we run a risk of thinking that it is normal. Our healthcare system was not perfect before. We are not making that case. But ObamaCare made what was already bad even worse.  We cannot think of these stats as mere numbers. Americans are really suffering under this law. Just because Senate Majority Leader McConnell gave up on repealing ObamaCare in the Senate does not mean Americans will give Congress and Republicans a pass. We cannot and we must not give up on this important promise.  The burden of ObamaCare is only made worse by the lackluster growth of the economy in recent years. During the Obama administration years, the economy failed to grow even once at the historic goal of 3 percent a year, something we just saw in our last quarter.  Americans are as industrious and innovative as ever. Americans' work ethic is not the problem. It is our antiquated tax system that has been bogged down over the years by regulators and lobbyists.  Since our last major rewrite of the Tax Code 31 years ago, the same year that ``Top Gun'' was number one in the box office, 1986, our Tax Code has added over 35,000 pages. Think about that--35,000 pages. That is about three changes per day. Each page is another carve-out or a loophole for the well connected, leaving the rest of the economy behind.  Our companies are at a disadvantage internationally, as our tax rate stands at 35 percent, the highest, as we know now, in the industrialized world.  Families continue to be punished with a marriage penalty.  Our Tax Code should be a competitive advantage for our companies competing with the world. It should encourage innovators to push the boundaries and find success.  The call to get something done that we hear loud and clear from Americans is also coupled with a call to make sure that we are doing our very best to secure the border. Perhaps there is no more vocal call from the past year than to build that wall.  In 2016, the United States saw a surge in illegal border crossings, with 46,000 illegals apprehended in that October alone. This is both a fiscal and a security issue.  Border security is more than just the border, though. Visa overstays are responsible for up to 40 percent of illegal immigration. We need a solution, and we need an action to this problem if we are truly to secure the border.  To add to these problems, more than 100 sanctuary jurisdictions have enacted policies which restrict cooperation with ICE, allowing potentially dangerous illegal immigrant criminals to remain in our country.  I am confident that the American people will deliver their final grade on Republicans over the next 3 months simply based on the three issues, the three promises that I am speaking about today: number one, continuing to work and replace and repeal ObamaCare; number two, reforming the Tax Code; and, number three, securing the border. In short, repeal, reform, secure; repeal, reform, secure. We need to fulfill these promises in the next 3 months. The urgency and the time is now.  As I said before, the status quo on these policies is literally crushing Americans, and this is why they elected In fact, since 1913, when Republicans expanded, or when the House expanded the 387 Members to 435, this is the only time in history when back-to-back Congresses, the Americans have elected 240 or more Republicans, and it is time we did our job. We need to keep our promises to the American people.  I am pleased to be joined by members of the Republican Study Committee today to talk about the importance of keeping these promises. That is why it is my privilege to introduce one of our newer members from Kansas, Representative Ron  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.Estes).

Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.DeSantis), a colleague and one of the sharpest, most intellectual Members of  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from North Carolina for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, if you were trying to do damage to the United States and you wanted to design a Tax Code that hindered economic growth, that diverted a lot of productive energy, that basically kept America from reaching its economic potential, you probably couldn't do much worse than designing the code that we have.  It is enormously complex--70,000 plus pages. I confess, there is no way I can do my own taxes, and I think that is true for millions and millions of There is a frustration with that, but it also costs massive amounts of money and diverts energy. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars that get diverted to complying with the Tax Code, and that is not optimal for economic growth.  It repels capital and incentivizes companies to relocate overseas and take jobs overseas. You see companies reincorporating in Ireland or That is because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. We are almost trying to send businesses overseas.[[Page H7963]]  It doesn't allow middle class families to keep enough of the money they earn. If you look over the past decade or so, family income really hasn't risen by that much, yet the cost of living has gone up. So by taking more and more from taxes, it makes it harder for middle class families to make ends meet.  So reforming the Tax Code, doing a nice, big tax cut, I think is long overdue. It would be a boon to our economy. You would have a simple system--no more 70,000 pages. Fill out your taxes on a postcard. That not only is more economically efficient, it gives people a lot of peace of mind to know they can do their taxes themselves. It is going to incentivize us to bring all of the trillions of dollars in overseas profits, and bring it back to the United States so that we can invest it here through our companies and create more jobs here.  It will make our American businesses more competitive. Our business tax system is outdated. It is uncompetitive. This, I think, will change a lot of that by having a competitive business tax rate, and I think that that will mean more economic growth.  So I think all that is pretty obvious to most people who look at this in a fair way. The question for us now is, we have to produce this bill. We have been talking about tax reform for a long time this year, and I think that is great, but it is time right now for us to produce this bill, debate it here in the House, pass it, and send it over to the United States  I am not encouraged when, given the urgency of this, we are going on a recess next week. The House is not going to be here. You are not going to have a tax bill marked up in the Ways and Means Committee or unveiled to the public. Members are not going to be debating that. I think it is time that we do that, and I think there should be a sense of urgency with that.  We have got to get our job done. I think the bill should have been passed by now, but let's get it done. Send it to the I don't think you would probably have very smart money to bet that the Senate is going to come through in the clutch. They haven't shown they can do that yet. But this is going to be a big question for them: Can you get anything done in the U.Senate? This is something that we know we need to do. It will be good for our economy.  All of the Republicans have said that our Tax Code is a disaster. So if we send them a good bill, this is going to be a major test. Can you apply the majority that the voters gave us? Can you honor your promises and do something good for taxpayers? I hope the answer is yes. But I think in this body we have got to be focusing on, let's put the Senate to the test. Let's draft, debate, and pass a strong, bold, tax cut and tax reform.  ",CREC-2017-10-11-pt1-PgH7961-2.txt,2255,PROUD OF VIRGINIA'S ASSISTANCE TO DISASTERS,2017.0,11.0,October

765,topic-id,1362,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Sanford; I appreciate the gentleman's good words, experience, and knowledge.  Mr.Speaker, speaking of Congress as a whole, it is well past time to make sure that tax reform and tax relief gets across to the American people.  A lot of times we talk about classes. The truth is it is probably better terminology to talk about income levels, lower, middle and higher income levels. That is one of the reasons that we are pushing forward the Charitable Giving Act, which is something that impacts both the lower and middle income levels.  We believe that is something that needs to be connected to tax reform to make sure that those folks who come from a background of teachers and truck drivers as we just heard about, but also other areas of the middle class and maybe lower income levels, something that they have a way where they are able to make sure that every dollar and every sacrifice they give back to a charitable organization--whether it is a local church or whether it is to the United Way--to make sure that every dollar is counted.  This is something that has been going on way too long. As we know, there are 75,000 pages right now of IRS Tax Code regulations. If the IRS wants to come after a private citizen, the private citizen doesn't have much of a resource ability to fight back whether it is in the legal or whether it is extended wealth. This is a machine that has been building, and the bureaucracy has been growing well past time.  It is time to neuter the One of the ways we can do that is reducing it from seven tax brackets down to three. It was erroneously shared by somebody across the aisle recently that we are driving up the lowest bracket from 10 percent to 12 percent. The truth is this: we are condensing it right now to three tax brackets--35 percent, 25 percent, and 12 percent--and doubling the standard deduction from $12,000 to $24,000. This is something that we are looking forward to doing to benefit the American people.  We talk much in these Halls about bipartisan support or bipartisan this or that. When did it become an issue, when did it become a problem, and when did it become a point of contention to allow the American people to keep more of the money from the hard work they put in day in and day out, week in and week out? That is something that we must do. That is something that should not even be a place of argument or a place of debate when it comes back allowing these folks to continue.  For some, we can get past the tax credit language. We can move on beyond the charitable deductions and all the different political and accounting words. What about just the family of four that needs another car, that needs to be able to afford a car payment to get a mom or a dad back and forth to work, or maybe a teenager in the house? We have been through that twice now. We had more claims than we probably should, but we get it. But also, maybe it is a few more times out to eat or to the movies, the things that[[Page H7965]]make you want to get up every day and continue to pursue that American  But not only from the individual side of this--certainly very important--but what about this corporate tax rate, this business rate that we talk constantly about that almost has become Washington jargon talking points? Why is that so important?  Over the years since the 1930s and 1940s, our corporate business rate has climbed to the highest in the industrial world.  Why is that? Why would we make it tougher on our manufacturers and our companies to have a higher tax rate? What incentive is it to stay here? We could track company after company.  I come from the State of North Carolina where textiles and furniture used to be two of our top three job providers. A lot of those companies now you will find in Vietnam or other places.  That corporate tax rate that literally has gone through the roof, why wouldn't we want to reduce that business rate? Why wouldn't we want to incentivize companies to begin to bring those jobs back to the United States?  I think it is crucial, and I think it is something that all of us should have the energy and the ability to be able to get behind and really push forward.  We have been promising this for how long? Since 1986? I was a junior in high school. Thirty-one years this has been on the docket, and the moment is now for us to deliver. If it is not now, as Reagan used to say, then when? Then how?  What should we be doing if it is not fulfilling the very promise that we have made to the American people, and that is that we are going to provide genuine--not some kind of phony legislation, not some kind of showboat, but genuine tax reform and tax relief for the American people?  Now, you may hear sometimes that, hey, the Republican plan is only for the most wealthy. Let's look at the numbers. Let's put a little math equation up, if we could, please.  Let's say that the most wealthy--if you are talking about somebody who makes $1 million, let's say we reduce their taxes by 1 percent. My math that I am doing here in my mind, that comes to about $10,000.  Let's say, if you go to that middle-income family, two parents working as hard as they can, they are bringing about $50,000 a year annually, yet their tax break, their tax benefit is 10 percent. Now, math tells me that is only $5,000 compared to the $10,000.  So you may hear the spin from time to time, well, the wealthier are getting the higher tax break, the wealthier are getting the higher tax credit. Listen, when it comes to dollar for dollar, the impact that that makes to the middle and lower income families is drastic. I will tell you this. Every time we turn around, every time that each Member goes back and forth to his district, he is hearing the same message: ``Get something done.''  Tax reform is one of those areas where, specifically, we are being compelled, we are being urged, and we are being called. My fellow Members in the House, please hear those urgent voices right now. Even if Members want to move past the tax relief and the humanitarian component, is it not politically strategic for us to do what we have promised to do on behalf of the American people?  As I said in my opening, I am confident that the American people will deliver the final grade over the next 3 months. The 115th Congress, what kind of grade will we have over the next 3 months if we do not deliver on these three promises?  I am hoping that that urgency is resonating. Repealing and replacing, continuing to fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to make sure that we are continuing to reform and do everything that we can to reform the Tax Finally, the promise that we have been making year after year is to make sure that we are protecting the American people by securing our border.  I understand that each of these items is a major legislative item in its own right. To be frank, we should have been delivering on them throughout the year. It is October, the 10th month of year. It is high past time.

We worked for years to set it up--to hold the hearings necessary, to get the information together, to make it work. When we did, it passed this body with a massive bipartisan expression of support.  It makes no sense to nominate somebody to this position who does not understand what we understand, which is[[Page S6391]]that the drug epidemic is, at its heart, a public health emergency and an illness. A reversion to law enforcement harshness in dealing with this problem will simply not be effective.                             Climate Change  Mr.President, now, if I may, I turn to my 182nd appearance to remind us of the global crisis of climate change, which has recently come so perilously close to our American shores.  This recent graphic from NOAA shows above-average temperatures in our oceans. Anything that is pink is above average; if it is reddish, it is much warmer than average; and if it is really red, like here, that is a record. That is the warmest record.  As one can see, from 2015, 2016, and 2017, the oceans have warmed significantly, and warmer oceans mean stronger storms. It is as simple as that. In this hurricane season, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have all struck the United It is the first time ever that the United States has been hit by three category 4 Atlantic storms in 1 year. Hurricane Ophelia, now out in the Atlantic, has become the 10th consecutive hurricane-strength storm. That ties a record that was set way back in the 1800s. We have gone more than a century without having this kind of storm activity. It is a rarity, but it is going to be less and less of a rarity because the oceans are warmer. That powers up those big storms, and those big storms bring damage to property and infrastructure. They destroy businesses and homes.  Away from the coastline, other aspects of climate change bring an array of other harms, like longer and fiercer wildfire seasons, as California is experiencing; depleted fish stocks, as our Rhode Island fishermen are experiencing; decreased agricultural yields, as the Midwest is experiencing; acidifying seas, as the northwest coast is experiencing; and risks to human health from new disease vectors and hotter heat waves felt across our country. All of these harms carry costs. Together, these costs are known as the social cost of carbon pollution. It is the cost to people and to communities of carbon pollution and climate change.  During the Obama administration, by scientists and economists from across the Federal Government who relied on scientific literature and well-vetted models, the social cost of carbon was put at around $50 per ton of carbon dioxide. There is a new book out by a number of conservative economists and scientists that looks at the climate change problem and recommends a revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon fee as a solution. In that book, the exemplar carbon price also runs at about $50 per ton of emitted carbon. It tracks from the Obama administration to conservative analysts as well.  This social cost of carbon is well established. Over and over, courts have instructed Federal agencies to factor the social cost of carbon into their permits and regulations. States are using a social cost of carbon in their policymaking. Major American corporations--even ExxonMobil--factor a social cost of carbon into their planning and accounting, and the social cost of carbon is at the heart of the International Monetary Fund's calculation that the fossil fuel industry gets an annual subsidy in the United States of $700 billion--that is ``billion'' with a ``b.''  The point of this particular speech is that a new calculation has emerged, not just of the harm of carbon pollution, but of how individual fossil fuel companies have contributed to that harm. This was not just some op-ed, nor was it the phony hack science that the fossil fuel industry cranks out to propagate climate denial on the talk show circuit. This is a peer-reviewed study that was published in the scientific journal Climatic  The study tells us that major fossil fuel producers are responsible for as much as half of the recorded global surface temperature increase. Then it dives down into the data for individual companies and demonstrates a method for attributing the real, observable effects of climate change to the likes of Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Devon Energy, among about 50 investor-owned, carbon-producing companies.  The history here is telling. More than half of all emissions that were traced to carbon producers from 1880 to 2010--across a span of 130 years--were produced after 1986, which was just in the last 24 years. This was when the climate risks of fossil fuel combustion were well established. Those were the years in which we knew. Many of these companies knew the harm of their fossil fuel products; yet they carried out a decades-long campaign to deceive the public about the risks of fossil fuel energy production and to bring influence to bear on this institution.  These companies knew that their products posed a threat to the global environment. They could have taken steps to reduce emissions. They could have invested in new technologies and emissions reduction technologies and renewable energy. They could have communicated honestly with their shareholders and with the public. They chose not to--an infamous decision that has kept carbon pollution dumping into the atmosphere, where it will affect the chemistry, the physics, and the biology of our planet for centuries to come. This is this generation's sad and sordid legacy.  This study shows that we can trace those harms back to individual companies, to their boards of directors, and to their managers. We can use the emissions data from this study. In using those established social cost of carbon estimates, we can estimate individual corporate accountability. This is new.  In using the study's emissions data and the social cost of carbon, we can calculate, for instance, the carbon pollution cost for which ExxonMobil is accountable. If one does this for 2010--just that 1-year's worth--the cost to the rest of us was over $22 billion. For Chevron, in 2010, it was $14.5 billion. For BP, it was $18.8 billion just for the harm that they caused in 2010. What about some of the major coal companies, like Peabody and Arch? Pollution attributable to Peabody Energy had a cost of $17.8 billion just for 2010. For Arch Coal, it was $11.7 billion. For Devon Energy, it was $3 billion. Devon, one may remember, is the company whose lobbying letter EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt put on his official Oklahoma attorney general letterhead, in the masquerade of official duty on behalf of special interests, which is still his hallmark now that he is at the If we add up all of this, we are looking at $88 billion in attributable damages--attributable to ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Peabody, Arch, and Devon--just for 2010. That is a 1-year cost that we all bear for allowing these polluters to pollute our air and oceans for free. That is why the IMF said that the subsidy was $700 billion.  As nature has so powerfully shown us this year, taxpayers, communities, and local businesses, especially those in vulnerable coastal areas, bear the cost of the irresponsible choices these big polluters have made. This is the cost these companies transferred to us by spending millions of dollars in deceiving the public about climate science and in using millions more in political spending in order to block sensible limits on carbon emissions. They spent millions to dodge billions, and we let them get away with it.  Perhaps judges and juries will be less manipulable. After all, one of the reasons that the Founding Fathers set up an independent judiciary and independent juries is that, in their being experienced politicians, they had seen that the political branches of government could be captured by special interests--what the Founders would have called factions--just as we now are captured by the fossil fuel industry here in  The average number of billion-dollar weather disasters is about five per year. That is the average in any given year, about five over the long term. Here we are, and it is only October, and 2017 has already seen 15 billion-dollar weather disasters--15 of them just this year, so far.  But the real multibillion-dollar disaster is a captured We actually have a remedy right before us that ought to be a bipartisan remedy: a carbon fee like the one Senator Schatz and I introduced in our American Opportunity Carbon Fee Virtually every Republican who has thought the climate change problem through to a solution comes to the same place. They all come to the same place: Put a price on carbon emissions, let the market work, avoid what is called the negative externality of the carbon polluters not having to pay for their harm, make the[[Page S6392]]economics correct by virtually everybody's economic principles, and take the revenue that is collected from that price on carbon and return it all to the American people. It is a border-adjustable, revenue-neutral carbon fee. Former Republican Treasury Secretaries Baker, Schultz, and Paulson, and former Republican EPA Administrators Ruckelshaus, Thomas, Reilly, and Whitman and leading Republican conservative economists and former Republican Presidential advisers Arthur Laffer, Gregory Mankiw, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, among many, many others, support a revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon fee. It is the market approach of properly pricing this pollution to eliminate that negative externality and to put the cost into the price of the product in the way that Economics 101 suggests it should be to avoid giving this industry this massive subsidy. That is where the Republicans who thought this through want us to be.  On my side, our answer is yes, but here in Congress, are we there yet? We just will not do it. We just will not do it because the shadow of the fossil fuel industry's millions of dollars in deception and political muscle power falls too darkly on this supposedly august institution.

643,topic-id,599,"Mr.President, I will be brief, but I want to point out a matter of real concern, and it should be a matter of concern to all  When new Presidents are elected, they have always been given the opportunity to put their team in place in short order. Regrettably, this has not been allowed to happen for this new President in this Here are the facts.  Now 9 months in office, President Trump has had only 182 of his nominees confirmed. That is an unacceptable, unprecedented 39 percent. It is a grossly low statistic by historical standards.  At this point in President Obama's administration, 65 percent of his nominees had been confirmed. At this point in George Bush's administration, 53 percent had been confirmed. Under Bill Clinton, 76 percent had been confirmed. And under President George H.Bush, 70 percent had been confirmed. Yet, because of delaying tactics by our colleagues across the aisle, this President, who needs a team in place, as does every President, has only 39 percent of his nominees in office.  This has been done through an abuse of the process by our friends across the aisle--a distortion of the rules requiring cloture on noncontroversial nominees, requiring well-qualified nominees to be subjected to a 30-hour debating period for a motion to proceed and another 30-hour debating period, typically where there is only silence on the floor of the Senate, for the actual confirmation.  This is inconvenient to the administration, but it is injurious to the American people. With more than 1,000 executive positions needing confirmation, we need these people in place. The American people need these people in place. These vacancies need to be filled to work for the American people, to provide hurricane relief, for instance. There are people who would have been part of the administration working on that, had we not had these delaying tactics. People in critical national security positions, people who are fighting against ISIS, are waiting for confirmation, and people who would be a key part of the counterterrorism efforts have been waiting for months to get to work.  We had a spate of this in July, and I was one of several Senators who called on the leadership to just keep us in session in August to take care of some of these nominations. We demonstrated, by the action of the majority leader, that by canceling part of the August break, we could break logjams. As of the end of July, we had confirmed only 56 Trump nominees. By keeping us in session for one extra week and shortening our work period back home, we confirmed 76 nominees in one week, as opposed to 56 the previous 6 months of this year. We can do that again.  I would simply say to the Presiding Officer and to my colleagues on this side of the aisle and on the other side of the aisle: I am among those calling on the majority leader to once again adopt an aggressive schedule that includes working all night, that includes working weekends, that includes canceling some breaks.

110,topic-id,1969,"Mr.President and colleagues, later this morning, the Senate will be voting on the amendment I am offering to strike what are known as reconciliation instructions from the budget proposal.  The reason I will be focused this morning on that is that it is absolutely key that we pass this amendment in order to get bipartisan tax reform. The fact is that reconciliation is an on-ramp to the most partisan process around, and the history of successful tax reform is in our working in a bipartisan way. For example, that is what the late President Reagan worked to do in 1986 with a whole host of Democrats, and they came up with a lot of very important, bold, progressive ideas. They chose to actually treat income from a wage in the same way as one would treat income from investments so as to send, in one fell swoop, a message that working-class people would get a fair shake, that the tax law was not about the 1 percent back then but that it was about working-class people. The middle class drives 70 percent of the American economy. They were not talking about massive tax handouts to big corporations and the wealthy; they were talking about the fact that, in our country, economic success is built around a thriving middle class--a middle class that can buy homes and cars and educate kids and pay for essentials.  What troubles me so much about these reconciliation instructions that would allow for a $1.5 trillion net tax cut is that it is just the opposite of the kind of approach that Ronald Reagan and the Democrats used in 1986. It is going to polarize us rather than bring us together.  I think that is particularly important right now, given the meeting that was held at the White House yesterday that I attended along with a number of Democratic colleagues on the Finance Committee, because at that meeting Democrats made it very clear to the President of the United States that we think that the Tax Code is broken, that it is a broken, dysfunctional mess. We described the letter we sent that lays out our principles that tax reform should focus not on the 1 percent but on the middle class and not savage Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, which are our essential retirement programs.  What was striking about the discussion was that the President said: I agree with you on all of those things. He said: Tax cuts should not go for people like me. I want help for the middle class, and I don't want to cut Medicare and Social I made the point--I hope respectfully, Mr.I said: Unfortunately, there is a big gap between the administration's rhetoric on this and the reality of what is really on paper. That is why it is so important that we strike these reconciliation instructions and make it clear from the get-go that we are going to get tax reform right, that we are not just going to kind of utter these sort of sound bites and rhetorical plights and speeches, as the discussions go out from various administration officials, and we actually focus on what it is going to take to do bipartisan tax reform.  The President agreed with the principles that Democrats talked about yesterday. It is very different when you see it on paper, and I want to talk a little bit about what is actually on paper.  First, the Trump tax plan creates a massive new loophole, the Grand Canyon of all loopholes, by twisting and abusing what is known as tax passthroughs. It used to be that the tax passthrough was for a store or a restaurant or a garage. You see them all over You see them all over Those are the people for whom we ought to be working together to give a boost to. That is not what is on paper. What is on paper is very different, and it is very different than what the President said yesterday he wanted.  For example, on paper is a new loophole that would allow tax cheats to self-declare as passthroughs, rake in income, and pay a much lower rate. It is a tax change that is deeply slanted toward what I call the top of the top--not just the 1 percent but the top of the top. Eighty-eight percent of the benefits of this kind of passthrough rate cut would go to those at the very top, according to recent analyses, the top 1 percent and those even more affluent. It opens the door for tax cheats to dodge paying into Social Security and Medicare like every hard-working wage earner in This would leave a lot of those programs that are lifelines for working families a lot worse off than they are today and that, too, is something the President said he didn't want.  Next, apropos again of the most affluent the President said he didn't want to help, is the estate tax. Here, there is a proposal in the administration's plan to abolish the estate tax. Let's make sure everybody understands who is affected by that. The tax today touches estates worth more than $11 million, $5.5 million for a single individual--a tiny fraction of all the estates in the country. Eliminating the estate tax isn't a policy change that has anything to do with helping the middle class. It is entirely about helping the megawealthy--exactly the people the President told us yesterday he didn't want to help.  The Finance Committee Democratic staff put out a report last week that looked at some of the worst schemes and dodges that are used by the megawealthy to avoid paying estate tax. There is a cottage industry of crafty lawyers and accountants who have made careers out of gutting the estate tax by engineering billion-dollar tax shelters for the 1 percent. So the estate tax is already full of loopholes, but this administration isn't interested in closing them even after the Treasury Secretary, Mr.Mnuchin, admitted just the other day that it goes mostly to the people at the very top.  So there is a common thread in these proposals. There is a common thread in this debate that is driven by partisanship and reconciliation, which is why I want to strike those instructions. What is actually on paper--not what is said in the speeches or in sound bites and the like--is that the Republican plan doesn't close the most egregious loopholes. It enshrines them as permanent features in our tax law. That is contrary to what the President said he wanted to do, and it certainly isn't a tax recipe focused on the middle class.  One of the individuals who has been most out in front of the cameras selling the Trump tax plan to the public is the Treasury A few weeks ago, the Secretary doubled down on the failed experiment that tax cuts pay for themselves. Forget the history that shows that isn't true. Secretary Mnuchin said the Trump tax cuts will not just pay for themselves, they will raise an additional trillion dollars in revenue on top of their own costs. The fact is, there is no magical growth fairy, no unicorns, no kind of growth fairies that are going to somehow spring to life if this tax cut plan becomes law, but Secretary Mnuchin, our Treasury Secretary, keeps going back to the unicorns, keeps going back to rainbow economics.  What is striking is, I asked the Republican economist--the economist chosen by our friend and distinguished chairman Orrin Hatch--who came before the Finance Committee the other day about whether tax cuts pay for themselves, and the Republican economist chosen by the Republicans on the Finance Committee, those Republicans' economist acknowledged that tax cuts don't pay for themselves.  There have been some other whoppers about the Republican plan, at least what is again written down on paper. Secretary Mnuchin said it is very hard not to give tax cuts to the wealthy with tax cuts to the middle class. That is one stunner of a statement: It is very hard not to give tax[[Page S6595]]cuts to the wealthy. In the same interview, he delivered what sounded like a real ultimatum; that if the Congress doesn't pass this plan so tilted to the megawealthy, oh, boy, it is going to be tough times on Wall You have to appreciate the eye-popping honesty, but the ideas behind what the Treasury Secretary is talking about on tax reform pretty much leave your jaw on the floor. If that is where the administration has trained its focus, as far as tax reform is concerned, the middle class is in tough straits.  In my judgment, this is yet another reason the Senate should reject using reconciliation for taxes and support my amendment. The fact is, the Congress has never used reconciliation to write a comprehensive tax reform bill. There is a template for comprehensive tax reform that has been proven to work, and I have mentioned it already. It is the one initiated by President Reagan, a big group of Democrats, a culmination of years of bipartisan work. What we saw was real bipartisanship, which I define as not taking each other's bad ideas but taking each other's good ideas. The bill was considered under regular order, it was debated in the Finance Committee and on the Senate floor for months, and it was open to unlimited amendments and passed the Senate by a vote of 97 to 3. That is the kind of bipartisan process we would like to see.  Democrats have made it clear, and we made it clear again yesterday, that we think the Tax Code is broken, that we have heard the President's comments about how he wants to help the middle class and not the wealthy, that he understands how strongly we feel about protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but the fact is--and this is the heart of the challenge--there is a big gap right now between what the President says his priorities are and what is actually written down on paper. That is the challenge, and we are not going to be able to address that challenge, in my view, by signing up for more partisanship, for taking the most partisan route on tax reform.  What we ought to be doing is saying that we all agree the Tax Code is broken; we all understand the key is helping the middle class, not more handouts for the top of the top, the 1 percent; that we are sensitive to long-term costs because we don't want to pass those off to our children. Doing that is best going to be accomplished by saying that as we move now to the actual consideration of tax reform, we reject partisan approaches like reconciliation, and we come together. I know we can do it.  The fact is, what the President says when he speaks about this subject is in line with the principles in the Democrats' letter. What we have talked about doesn't even go as far as what President Reagan did in 1986. What is in the Democrats' letter tracks a bipartisan piece of legislation that several colleagues here have been part of, including one in the President's Cabinet now.  We can do bipartisan tax reform that is good for our country. We shouldn't make it a lot harder to accomplish that goal by including these partisan reconciliation instructions in the budget proposal. That is why I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to strip these reconciliation instructions when we vote on my amendment later in the morning.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

The President talked to us about wanting help for the middle class. He said that this is not supposed to be about people like him, and he said that he doesn't want to shred the safety net.  Unfortunately, as I have indicated, there are gaps as wide as Crater Lake among all of the administration's statements, the rhetoric about taxes, and the reality of what is actually written down on paper about its tax cut plan.

230,topic-id,149,"Mr.President, this amendment provides reconciliation instructions to three Senate committees for the purpose of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act; in effect, rerunning the same bad movie the Senate has now seen three times. By now, Americans understand what these partisan Republican healthcare bills have in store for the middle class: higher premiums, worse healthcare, and a safety net in tatters.  I will close by saying that there is now a desire on both sides of the aisle to set aside this my-way-or-the-highway approach to governing. Bipartisanship is about taking each other's good ideas, and I believe the Senate can work together to lower people's premiums.  This amendment is a vote to look for more partisan ideological trophies when the Senate ought to be working together to find common ground.  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.

666,topic-id,682,"Mr.President, some of our Republican colleagues said in the past days, the budget debate is all about getting the tax reform. The fact is, this is a fast lane to a partisan process for dealing with taxes. When it comes to the Republican plan, you get a lot of rhetoric and a lot of happy talk. You hear it is the biggest tax cut ever. You hear it is about the middle class.  Just this morning, the President tweeted the Democrats will only vote for tax increases, but that rhetoric is just out of touch with reality. For example, our 2015 bill, of which I was the lead Democratic sponsor, cut taxes $650 billion. It went to the heart of the needs of young people in this country with the American opportunity tax credit, the earned-income tax credit, but it also helped farmers--farmers who are concerned about expensing the research and development credit for our innovators.  That is the kind of approach we ought to take that is bipartisan, that helps people in this country. Everybody has a chance to get ahead. The fact is, the Tax Code on the books is now a tale of two systems. There is a strict mandatory system for a cop or a nurse. Their taxes come right out of every paycheck. It is mandatory. There are no special Cayman Island deals for them.  Then there is another set of rules for the highfliers, the most fortunate. They can, with good lawyers and good accountants, decide what they want to pay and when they want to pay it. That is the rotting source of unfairness that is at the heart of the American Tax That is why so many hard-working Americans think they are getting a rotten deal every April 15. That is the brand of unfairness Ronald Reagan was interested in going after, but somehow we can't get that same kind of spirit from Republicans at this point on this tax bill.  The Trump tax cut doubles down on the rotten unfairness in the Tax It is a multitrillion-dollar handout to those who are the most powerful, and it is very generous to those at the top of the top, which is why this amendment with Senator Sanders is so important. The Trump tax plan, at this point, doesn't just fail to close the most egregious loopholes, but it enshrines them for good.  The amendment that Senator Sanders and I are putting forward is pretty simple. It says that in this tax bill we are going to put the focus on the middle class. We are not just going to focus on people at the top. That is why the amendment creates a point of order against the plan that gives a tax handout to the top of the top of the income spectrum in our country.  If you are a middle-class family, according to what is offered now, the Republican plan giveth with one hand and taketh away with another. The standard deduction might be doubled, but you are going to lose personal exemptions, and if you come from a State with a significant State and local tax structure, you are going to find it very hard to get ahead.  That is what we want to change. We will not want a scheme that hides the true multitrillion-dollar cost of the tax giveaways to those at the top. We want relief to go to those at the middle.  I close by saying that the Sanders-Wyden amendment is based on a simple principle, and that is that we want to expand the winners' circle for working Americans--those without lobbyists, those without clout--to have a chance to get ahead. They have been left out of the economic winners' circle for too long. We want to put a focus on those people who have felt the panic of seeing the costs of rent, college, and medicine go up and up and up. Tax reform should be about helping them. That is what the Sanders-Wyden amendment proposes.  I yield the floor.

The point of this is, this is an amendment that does what the President says he wants to do, which is not give relief to the people at the top, but the reality is, when you look at their proposal, it really does drive much of the wealth in America to those at the very top.

762,topic-id,582,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's leadership on this.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the three promises, 3-month initiative that you have outlined here, and I think it is so important that we follow through with this.  I want to start with tax reform. Members can say: Why do we need tax reform? I think it is self-evident. Our Tax Code, as you heard, is the most burdensome in the world. It stifles economic growth, entrepreneurship, and it creates noncompliance. So we need to simplify it. We have told the American people we were going to do that if we get in charge.  I think the repeal of ObamaCare--and some people get offended if we call it ObamaCare, so I will refer to it as the Affordable Care It has disrupted over 20 percent of our economy, and I think it is not affordable. We can talk to so many different people. I know our premiums went up $11,000 since I have come to In fact, our policy got canceled when I came to Congress because of  Then I think the third part of that is we promised the American people that we would repeal this in its entirety and fix healthcare so that people have access to healthcare, it is affordable, and that it is quality care is the part that gets left out.  Then I want to touch on border security. This is something that we have all run on. Any nation needs a secure border. A sovereign nation has to have a secure border, and they have to have control over their border. However, due to the failures of politicians past and present, the U.southern border, in particular, remains porous.[[Page H7964]]  I applaud President Trump for releasing a set of principles which I fully endorse and his priorities that are focused on making our borders more secure. President Trump's consistent message calling for better enforcement of our immigration laws and improving border security is one of the main reasons he won the  President Trump is sticking to his campaign promises, which is refreshing to see in Washington, D.C., these days, a town where too many times there is an aversion to making tough decisions in fear of how that will be viewed in the next election. So it is refreshing to see President Trump do what he said he was going to do.  Protecting our borders, ending sanctuary cities, and facilitating State and local cooperation in immigration enforcement are commonsense ideas that will protect national security, promote public safety, and deter future illegal immigration. We are hard at work on solving these problems of illegal immigration in the  Just three real quick facts:  From November 2013 to July 2014, officials apprehended 143 individuals listed on the U.terrorist watch list trying to cross the Mexican border and enter the U.illegally. So many times I hear people say that this is not true and that this does not happen, but we know better.  As of 2014, illegal immigrants were convicted and sentenced for about 13 percent of the crimes in the United  Then, lastly, border security should also focus on maritime domain. Our Coast Guard, a hardworking branch of our military service, has set a new record for cocaine seizures at sea for the second consecutive year, seizing more than 455,000 pounds of cocaine in 2017 that was destined for the homeland.  So I am proud to join the Republican Study Committee in recognizing the necessity of border security today.
