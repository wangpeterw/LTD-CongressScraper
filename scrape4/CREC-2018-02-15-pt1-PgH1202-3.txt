                WORKING WITH ASIA DURING YEAR OF THE DOG

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, this week commences the Lunar New Year, a 
time of thankfulness and new beginnings for the United States and many 
of our Asian partners.
  Reflecting upon last year's Year of the Rooster, we have enjoyed 
tremendous political, social, and economic achievements. Filled with 
enthusiasm for diplomacy and cooperation, we continue to look to our 
partners in Asia to promote peaceful international relations.
  During the Year of the Dog, I believe that our friends will continue 
to embody loyalty, honesty, and integrity, working with us to craft 
mutually beneficial international policies. In turn, the United States 
will encourage effective diplomatic behaviors among all of our Asian 
counterparts.
  As lawmakers, we have an obligation to protect the interests of the 
United States, as well as those of our strong allies around the globe, 
especially in the Asia-Pacific region.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue to work toward 
policies that will positively shape strong, multinational Asian foreign 
relations in 2018.
