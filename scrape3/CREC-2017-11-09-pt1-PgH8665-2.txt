                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Bless the Members of this assembly as they return to their districts 
to listen to and communicate with their constituents about the issues 
and affairs currently being considered in Congress.
  It is the weekend our Nation remembers its veterans, upon whom we ask 
Your blessing. May our Nation be faithful to those still with us, 
providing whatever their needs may be after they gave years of their 
lives in service to our country rather than dedicated to personal gain. 
They are an inspiration to us, and we should not forget nor neglect our 
responsibility to them.
  As the Nation pauses to show its respect, may we be forever grateful 
for the blessings You have bestowed upon the United States of America. 
May our Nation continue to be a beacon of hope for the world, and may 
all we do be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
