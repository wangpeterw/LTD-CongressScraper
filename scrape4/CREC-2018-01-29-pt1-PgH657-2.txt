                    HONORING THE LIFE OF TIM NELSON

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life of Tim Nelson, a beloved father, husband, community leader, and 
football coach who passed away on January 16, after a courageous battle 
against colorectal cancer since 2013.
  Despite spending weeks receiving treatment in the hospital and going 
in and out of remission, Tim's resolve and bravery in his battle 
against this disease never wavered.
  The support he and his family received in the Metro East and the 
River Bend never wavered either. A member of the Calhoun High School's 
1992 State championship football team, Tim served as head football 
coach at Marquette Catholic High School in Alton and Dupo High School 
before returning to his home school, Calhoun High School, as an 
assistant in 2013.
  Each of these communities and the entire region never stopped 
rallying around Tim and his family. I am proud to honor him and his 
life in this Chamber, and I ask you to join me in keeping his wife, 
Casey; and young son, Crew, in your thoughts and prayers.
