     RECOGNIZING THE CALVARY CHRISTIAN WARRIORS BOYS BASEBALL TEAM

  (Mr. CRIST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Clearwater, 
Florida's Calvary Christian High School Warriors boys baseball team on 
their impressive State championship win. Coach Greg Olsen and the 
Warriors clinched an 11-1 victory against Pensacola Catholic High 
School to lead them to the Class 4A title, clinching the school's first 
State championship and capping off a perfect season of 30 wins and no 
losses.
  Such an achievement takes more than skill and talent. It takes steely 
determination, unwavering focus, and perhaps, most importantly, the 
ability to work together. These skills are invaluable both on and off 
the field. What they have learned as teammates will enable their 
success not just as athletes, but as good citizens. Our entire 
community is proud of their outstanding sportsmanship and achievements.
  On behalf of Pinellas County, congratulations Warriors.
