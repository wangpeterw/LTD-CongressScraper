                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, on a day 
when schoolchildren should be thinking about baseball tryouts, prom, 
and college selections, again they head to school living the reality 
that a gun may strike them down at any moment.
  Today 17 children will never again return to their school in Florida, 
casualties in America's 18th shooting in 44 days. Once again parents 
and counselors will have to bring the comfort and security that this 
Congress refuses to offer.
  This week in Chicago, a decorated police commander, Paul Bauer, was 
shot and killed, another officer lost in a disturbing trend of police 
shootings that we have not addressed either.
  Mr. Speaker, Melissa Falkowski, a teacher in that school, asked when 
Congress will do something. A student said, The country needs to look 
in the mirror. He said, We cannot get used to this. This cannot become 
the norm.
  Do you remember the terror you felt as grown men on that baseball 
field?
  Well, imagine those young people in that school, in our 
neighborhoods, at a concert, in a park.
  Despite your words, your prayers, you have proven over and over you 
don't care about anyone but yourselves and your contributions. It is 
sickening, and shame on you.
