				<h1>What's Our Mission?</h1>

				<p>
					Congress appears to be a "black-box" of sorts nowadays. With the especially heated political climate
					throughout the past few years, it's critical that there be transparency between the work thats being done
					in Congress to the average citizen.

					</br>
					</br>

					There are public, government-provided online records of almost every word spoken by representatives, witnesses, and senators on a daily basis.
					However, to make use of this information, one has navigate through many pages, find a specific days' discourse
					to view, and then sift through thousands of lines of a single .txt file to find any information of use.

					</br>
					</br>

					To the average citizen and especially researchers interested in this dataset, this is far too time-consuming and inaccessible to
					yield any meaningful results or analysis of what's actually going on behind the scenes in Congress.

					</br>
					</br>

					That's where our team comes in with Searchlight, a liberating textual data project, sponsored by Goodly Labs. Our mission was to create an
					accessible database of information for citizens and researchers alike, where one can simply query for speeches within Congress, sifting through
					our scraped and parsed congressional data to get information that best matches their needs.
