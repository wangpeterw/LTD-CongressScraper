                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia--155mm M109A6 Paladin Medium Self-Propelled 
                            Howitzer System

       The Government of Saudi Arabia has requested a possible 
     sale of one hundred and eighty (180) 155mm M109A5/A6 Medium 
     Self-Propelled Howitzer structures for conversion to one 
     hundred and seventy-seven (177) 155mm M109A6 Paladin Medium 
     Self-Propelled Howitzer systems; three (3) Fire Support 
     Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (FSCATT) static training 
     devices; one hundred and eighty (180) M2 HB .50 Cal Machine 
     Guns; and eight (8) Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data 
     Systems (AFATDS). Also included are M109A5/A6 overhaul, 
     conversion and refurbishment services; Special Tools and Test 
     Equipment; Basic Issue Items (BII); Driver's Vision Enhancer 
     (DVE) Wide system; Program Management Support; Verification 
     Testing; System Technical Support; Transportation; spare and 
     repair parts; communications equipment; personnel training 
     and training equipment; tool and test equipment; repair and 
     return; publications and technical documentation; Quality 
     Assurance Team (QAT); U.S. Government and contractor 
     engineering; technical and logistics support services; and 
     other related elements of logistics and program support. The 
     estimated cost is $1.31 billion.
       This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy 
     and national security of the United States by helping to 
     improve-the security of an important partner which has been 
     and continues to be a leading contributor of political 
     stability and economic progress in the Middle East. This sale 
     will increase the Royal Saudi Land Force's (RSLF) 
     interoperability with U.S. forces and conveys U.S. commitment 
     to Saudi Arabia's security and armed forces modernization.
       The proposed sale will improve Saudi Arabia's capability to 
     meet current and future threats and provide greater security 
     for its border regions and critical infrastructure. The RSLF 
     currently has M109A2, A3 and A5 howitzers in its inventory. 
     These additional modernized howitzers will enhance Saudi 
     Arabia's ability to support its deployed forces and defend 
     its borders. Saudi Arabia will have no difficulty absorbing 
     these vehicles into its armed forces.
       The prime contractor for this requirement is unknown at 
     this time. There are no known offset agreements in connection 
     with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the 
     assignment of any additional U.S. or contractor 
     representatives to Saudi Arabia. Support teams will travel to 
     the country on a temporary basis.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.


                         Transmittal No. 16-48

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. This sale will involve the release of sensitive 
     technology to Saudi Arabia. The RSLF seeks to purchase the 
     155mm M109A6 Paladin Medium Self-Propelled Howitzer system. 
     The Paladin M109A6 howitzer is the fourth product improvement 
     to the original M109 self-propelled howitzer. It features 
     improvements in the areas of survivability, reliability, 
     availability, maintainability, responsiveness, and terminal 
     effects. The M109A6 is an armored, full tracked howitzer 
     carrying 37 complete conventional rounds and two Copperhead 
     projectiles and operated by a crew of four. It is designed 
     with a new turret structure that facilitates integration of 
     the various turret improvements and vulnerability reduction 
     measures. It improves overall crew compartment layout and 
     space. The howitzer can travel at a maximum speed of 38 miles 
     per hour and has a maximum cruising range of 186 miles. The 
     M109A6 can operate independently, from on the move, it can 
     receive a fire mission, compute firing data, select and take 
     up its firing position, automatically unlock and point its 
     cannon, fire and move--all without external technical 
     assistance. Firing the first round following a move in under 
     60 seconds, a ``shoot and scoot'' capability protects the 
     crew from counterbattery fire. The M109A6 is capable of 
     firing up to four rounds per minute to ranges of 30 
     kilometers. The M109A6 features increased survivability 
     characteristics such as day/night operability and Nuclear, 
     Biological, Chemical (NBC) protection with climate control 
     and secure voice and digital communications. The crew remains 
     in the vehicle throughout the mission.
       2. The Electronic Fire Control System (EFCS). Commonly 
     referred to as the Paladin Fire Control System (PFCS), it is 
     the major change for the Paladin M109A6 Howitzer from the 
     manual fire control system used on the M109A5. The integrated 
     electronic digital Fire Control System includes an Embedded 
     Trainer. It gives the howitzer the ability to operate over a 
     widely dispersed area and to move and emplace using the 
     onboard fire control system (Dynamic Reference Unit Hybrid 
     Replacement Inertial Navigation System) and a plug-in AN/PCN-
     13A Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver with 
     a Selective Availability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM). The 
     M109A6 can move and position within an assigned position 
     area, process technical firing data, and fire a mission 
     without relying on aiming circles and wire lines. The M109A6 
     can change position more frequently, an advantage against 
     enemy fire.
       3. The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System 
     (AFATDS) provides the multiservice automated Fire Support 
     Command, Control and Communications portion of the Army 
     Battle Command System (ABCS). AFATDS enables the maneuver 
     commander to plan and execute attacks on the right target, at 
     the right time, with the right weapons system, and the right 
     munitions. It provides for maximum utilization of the fire 
     support assets available on an expanding battlefield. It 
     supports the close, deep, and rear battle fire support 
     requirements of land and littoral doctrine. AFATDS is 
     designed for full interoperability with the other ABCS 
     Battlefield Functional Areas as well as with the Fire Support 
     capabilities of the Navy's Joint Maritime Command Information 
     System (JMCIS) and the Air Force's Theater Battle Management 
     Core System (TBMCS).
       4. The Driver's Vision Enhancer Wide (DVE Wide) improves 
     survivability and mission capability by providing drivers 
     with wider fields of view as well as the elimination of blind 
     spots to safely navigate through dust, sand, haze, smoke, 
     light fog and the blackest night. The front facing DVE Wide 
     integrates three state-of-the-art 640 480, 17 m 
     uncooled infrared sensors, which output a stitched video of a 
     107 30 field of view (POV). The DVE Wide can receive, manage

[[Page S2005]]

     and display video from multiple external cameras on the 
     vehicle. The driver can electronically pan through the 
     107 deg. total horizontal field of view allowing the driver 
     the ability to see both sides of the road. The vehicle wheel 
     track indicators aid the driver in clearly identifying any 
     potential impediments to safe operation. The DVE Wide is 
     fully backwards compatible with all fielded DVE units, which 
     means that any vehicle currently equipped with a DVE system 
     can be readily upgraded. It is also forward compatible with 
     new, high resolution, touch-screen displays. The DVE Wide is 
     an UNCLASSIFIED system.
       5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements of 
     the M109A6, the information could be used to develop 
     countermeasures or equivalent systems which might reduce 
     weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of 
     a system with similar or advanced capabilities.
       6. A determination has been made that Saudi Arabia can 
     provide the same degree of protection for the sensitive 
     technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale 
     is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
     national security objectives outlined in the Policy 
     Justification.
       7. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

       This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy 
     and national security of the United States by helping to 
     improve the security of a NATO ally which has been, and 
     continues to be, an important force for political and 
     economic stability in Europe.
       Germany is one of the major political and economic powers 
     in Europe and NATO and a key partner of the United States in 
     ensuring global peace and stability. The proposed sale of the 
     MQ-4C Triton will support legitimate national security 
     requirements and significantly enhance Germany's 
     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) 
     capabilities and the overall collective security of the 
     European Union and NATO.
       The proposed sale of the MQ-4C Triton will close a crucial 
     capability gap and will enhance bilateral and NATO 
     interoperability and will help ensure that Germany is able to 
     continue to monitor and deter regional threats. This proposed 
     MQ-4C UAS sale will be a modified version of the United 
     States Navy (USN) Triton configuration. The German Armed 
     Forces will have no difficulty absorbing these systems into 
     its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       The prime contractor will be Northrop Grumman Corporation 
     Rancho Bernardo, CA, responsible for integration, 
     installation and functional platform compatibility testing of 
     the payload. Airbus Defence and Space, located in Germany, 
     will be the prime contractor to Germany for the development 
     and manufacturing, and will be responsible for the functional 
     test, end-to-end test and installed performance. There are no 
     known offset agreements in connection with this potential 
     sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will require the 
     assignment of contractor representatives to Germany to 
     perform contractor logistics support and to support 
     establishment of required security infrastructure.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

      Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The MQ-4C Triton hardware and software procured for this 
     potential sale are UNCLASSIFIED. The MQ-4C is optimized for 
     long range and prolonged flight endurance. The MQ-4C Triton 
     will be a forward deployed, land-based, autonomously operated 
     system that provides a persistent maritime Intelligence, 
     Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability to include 
     data collection, analysis, and situational reporting. 
     Aircraft system, sensor, and navigational status are provided 
     continuously to the ground operators through a health and 
     status downlink for mission monitoring. Navigation is via 
     inertial navigation with integrated global positioning system 
     (GPS) updates. The vehicle is capable of operating from a 
     standard paved runway. Real time missions are flown under the 
     control of a pilot in a Mission Control Station (MCS). It is 
     designed to carry a non-weapons maximum internal payload of 
     3,200 lbs, maximum external payload of 2,400 lbs, consisting 
     primarily of sensors and avionics. The MQ-4C will include the 
     Mission Control Station (MCS) which consists of the following 
     components:
       a. The Mission Control Station (MCS) is the MQ-4C Triton 
     UAS ground control station required to operate the MQ-4C 
     Triton UAS. The MOB MCS (MD-3A) provides MQ-4C Triton 
     Aircraft Command & Control (C2). The MOB MCS consists of a 
     primary and backup system, an embedded training capability, 
     requisite data links, communication systems, antennas, 
     computer work-stations and hardware/software for air vehicle, 
     and tactical coordinator. The MOB MCS communications consists 
     of both Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) 
     capabilities to control the Triton Unmanned Aircraft 
     worldwide. The MOB technical data and documentation are 
     UNCLASSIFIED.
       b. The MQ-4C Triton UAS Forward Operating Base (FOB) (MD-
     3B) is used for aircraft launch and recovery and is 
     physically located at the same location as the MQ-4C Triton 
     aircraft. The FOB MCS is similar to the MOB MCS, but the FOB 
     MCS does not process or control any payload information. The 
     FOB MCS is manned by air vehicle operators only and used for 
     line of sight Aircraft C2 while beyond line of sight control 
     is used as a back-up communication line. The FOB MCS consists 
     of requisite data links, communication systems, antennas, 
     computer work-stations and hardware/software for air vehicle 
     operator control. The FOB technical data and documentation 
     are UNCLASSIFIED.
       c. The MQ-4C employs a quad-redundant Inertial Navigation 
     System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) configuration. The 
     system utilizes two different INS/GPS systems for greater 
     redundancy. The system consists of two LN-251 units and two 
     Kearfott KN-4074E INS/GPS Units. The LN-251 is a fully 
     integrated, non-dithered navigation system with an embedded 
     Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), P(Y) 
     code or Standard Positioning Service (SPS) GPS. It utilizes a 
     Fiber-Optic Gyro (FOG) and includes three independent 
     navigation solutions: blended INS/GPS, INS-only, and GPS-
     only. The Kearfott KN-4074E features a Monolithic Ring Laser 
     Gyro (MRLG) and accelerometer. The inertial sensors are 
     tightly coupled with an embedded SAASM P(Y) code GPS. Both 
     systems employ crypto graphic technology that can be 
     classified up to SECRET.
       2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of specific hardware, the information could be used 
     to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapons system 
     effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with 
     similar or advanced capabilities.
       3. A determination has been made that Germany can provide 
     substantially the same degree of protection for sensitive 
     technology being released as the U.S. Government. This 
     proposed sustainment program is necessary to the furtherance 
     of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives 
     outlined in the policy justification.
       4. All defense articles and services listed on this 
     transmittal are authorized for release and export to the 
     Government of Germany.

       This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and 
     national security of the United States by helping to improve 
     the security of a NATO partner that is an important force for 
     ensuring peace and stability in Europe. The proposed sale 
     will support Slovakia's needs for its own self-defense and 
     support NATO defense goals. Slovakia intends to use these F-
     16s to modernize its Air Force and strengthen its homeland 
     defense.
       Slovakia intends for these aircraft to replace its current 
     fleet of MiG-29s. Slovakia's current fighters are not 
     interoperable with U.S. forces or regional allies. Purchase 
     of the F-16V will provide Slovakia with fourth generation 
     fighter aircraft capability that is interoperable with the 
     United States and NATO.
       The proposed sale of new F-16V's to Slovakia will not 
     impact the regional balance of power.
       The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin, headquartered 
     in Bethesda, Maryland. There are no known offset agreements 
     in conjunction with this sale, however, we expect Slovakia to 
     request some amount of industrial participation. Any offset 
     agreement will be defined in negotiations between the 
     purchaser and the contractor.
       Implementation of this proposed sale may require assignment 
     of a small number of U.S. Government representatives (less 
     than 10) and a modest number of contractor representatives 
     (less than 50) to Slovakia. It is likely that no permanent 
     U.S. persons will actually be required in country.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.
