                             MEDICAID CUTS

  (Mr. O'HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep 
misgivings about the recent healthcare proposals put forth by the 
Senate. This bill, like the American Health Care Act, proposes drastic 
cuts to Medicaid and would saddle my constituents and Americans with 
skyrocketing premiums and deductibles.
  We are placing our hardworking families and young children, our 
elderly, veterans, and Native Americans in harm's way by making 
coverage unaffordable and unattainable.
  The cost of this legislation will be paid by those who can least 
afford it. Recent reports show that the cost of Medicaid cuts in this 
bill would cost Arizonans more than $7 billion. This means hundreds of 
thousands of people, including nursing home patients who rely on 
affordable, lifesaving coverage, will be kicked off their Medicaid 
coverage.
  From the beginning, these pieces of legislation have been crafted 
behind closed doors without input from doctors, nurses, and healthcare 
leaders.
  While we play partisan games, the health and well-being of our 
families, friends, and neighbors are at risk. If we want to get serious 
about fixing our healthcare system and bringing down costs, we must 
work together on bipartisan legislation.
