                                  DACA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, DACA must be fixed for the good of these 
young immigrants and for the good of our Nation.
  In September, Leaders Pelosi and Schumer and President Trump agreed 
to protect DACA recipients and improve border security. Since that 
time, I have worked in the 48-Member, bipartisan House Problem Solvers 
Caucus to come up with a plan that would do just that.
  I thank Senators Durbin, Graham, Bennet, Gardner, Menendez, and 
Flake, who have put together a compromise bill in the Senate, which is 
gaining momentum. After working on this for 5 months, I know just how 
hard it is to come up with a compromise, so I just want to thank these 
Senators for what they have done.
  The Problem Solvers Caucus continues to work on a plan, and I am 
hopeful that we will have one imminently because time is running short.
  I was very happy to hear Congressman Gutierrez right here from this 
podium a few minutes ago endorse the idea of a compromise even though 
it is not what he wants, but we need to protect these DACA recipients.
  We have to break the status quo in Washington--the bickering and the 
gridlock--which gets in the way of good solutions for our country. This 
solution on DACA can and should get done if only we can get away from 
the rhetoric and use some common sense.

                              {time}  1100

  Unfortunately, common sense is not common in Washington. I call on my 
colleagues to get past the bickering and the rhetoric. Do what is right 
for the American people. Fix DACA, and let's move on and do great 
things together for our Nation.
