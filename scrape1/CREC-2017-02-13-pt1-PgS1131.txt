SENATE RESOLUTION 60--DESIGNATING MAY 5, 2017, AS THE ``NATIONAL DAY OF 
      AWARENESS FOR MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE WOMEN AND GIRLS''

  Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Tester, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Gardner, Mr. 
Franken, Mr. Hoeven, and Mr. Udall) submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                               S. Res. 60

       Whereas, according to a study commissioned by the 
     Department of Justice, in some tribal communities, American 
     Indian women face murder rates that are more than 10 times 
     the national average murder rate;
       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention, homicide was the third-leading cause of death 
     among American Indian and Alaska Native women between 10 and 
     24 years of age and the fifth-leading cause of death for 
     American Indian and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 
     years of age;
       Whereas little data exist on the number of missing American 
     Indian and Alaska Native women in the United States;
       Whereas, on July 5, 2013, Hanna Harris, a member of the 
     Northern Cheyenne Tribe, was reported missing by her family 
     in Lame Deer, Montana;
       Whereas the body of Hanna Harris was found 5 days after she 
     went missing;
       Whereas Hanna Harris was determined to have been raped and 
     murdered, and the individuals accused of committing those 
     crimes were convicted;
       Whereas the case of Hanna Harris is an example of many 
     similar cases; and
       Whereas Hanna Harris was born on May 5, 1992: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates May 5, 2017, as the ``National Day of 
     Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls''; 
     and
       (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
     groups--
       (A) to commemorate the lives of missing and murdered 
     American Indian and Alaska Native women whose cases are 
     documented and undocumented in public records and the media; 
     and
       (B) to demonstrate solidarity with the families of victims 
     in light of those tragedies.
