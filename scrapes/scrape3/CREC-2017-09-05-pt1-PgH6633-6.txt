                                  DACA

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I take to the floor of the House today to 
support President Trump's decision as it relates to DACA.
  America must be a nation of laws, and those laws must be passed by 
the Congress. This is the promise made in our Constitution and ensured 
by our enduring liberty. President Obama was incorrect to unilaterally 
act in this program; President Trump is correct to put the power back 
in the hands of the people's representatives.
  America must also be a nation of borders, and we erode the virtue and 
value of those borders when we draw people across those borders 
illegally. There is nothing compassionate about telling the rest of the 
world that, so long as a child arrives here, that child will be treated 
as if they have the same virtues and values of American citizens, if 
they committed the criminal offense of unlawful entry into the country.
  Challenges we have seen with undocumented minors being sent has 
created humanitarian crises, and I believe that DACA and other programs 
that draw those across our borders illegally have contributed to those 
crises. I support the President. We should end DACA.
