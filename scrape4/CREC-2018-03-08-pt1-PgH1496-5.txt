                    HONORING THE LIFE OF KERI GALVAN

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Keri 
Galvan.
  Keri attended the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas on October 1. 
She was a mother of three and a wife to her husband, Justin Galvan. She 
worked as a cocktail server at Mastro's Steakhouse, where she worked 
for almost a decade.
  She was known by her friends as supermom, and was always there for 
anybody. Keri never forgot anybody's special occasion and constantly 
made sure everybody was okay. She is remembered for being a devoted 
wife and mother who put others before herself.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Keri Galvan's family and 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.

                          ____________________
