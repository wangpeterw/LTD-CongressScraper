                          THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support President Trump's 
plan to tackle the opioid epidemic, a crisis that has plagued 
communities and devastated families all across Indiana.
  In Indiana, roughly 40 percent more people die from drug overdoses 
than they do from car accidents. Since 2010, opioid-related deaths have 
nearly tripled in my State.
  It is past time to address the opioid epidemic and get serious about 
saving lives.
  Growing up in the 1980s, Nancy Reagan's Just Say No campaign had a 
real impact on my life, and I applaud President Trump's plan to do more 
to educate young people about the horrific effects of drug use.
  I also support the President's plan to address the opioid crisis by 
securing our border, stopping the flow of drugs pouring into our 
country, and reducing rampant prescription drug abuse. The President is 
right. For the worst drug traffickers, the death penalty should be an 
option.
  Today we took a big step in the right direction, but more must be 
done to help families dealing with the devastating effects of opioid 
abuse.
