5390,topic-id,1096,"Mr.President, last Wednesday at the White House, President Trump invited Republican Senators there, and he recommended to us that we repeal and replace ObamaCare at the same time, simultaneously. He said that before in his interview on ``60 Minutes'' in January--we should repeal and replace ObamaCare simultaneously, which means, to me, at the same time.  That is one reason I voted yes on Tuesday for us to proceed to the House of Representatives' bill, because it would replace and repeal ObamaCare at the same time. That is one reason I voted on Tuesday for the Senate healthcare bill, which would have replaced and repealed ObamaCare at the same time. I agree with the President--we should replace and repeal ObamaCare at the same time. The House voted to do that, the President recommended we do it, and I agree we should repeal and replace at the same time.  Why would I say it needs to be done at the same time? There was a time in the past where we might have just repealed it and said: In 2 years, we may come up with an answer. But we can't do that now. Conditions have changed in Our State insurance commissioner, Julie McPeak, says our individual insurance market is ``very near collapse.'' That means that up to 350,000 individuals in our State--songwriters, workers, farmers--who buy their insurance on the individual market are sitting there worrying in July and in August whether they will have any option to buy insurance in 2018.  So I don't think we can wait 2 years to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which is why I voted twice on Tuesday to do it now and why I voted against an amendment yesterday that said: Repeal it now and replace it in 2 years, if you can. I don't think Tennesseans would be very comfortable canceling insurance for 22 million Americans now and saying: Trust Congress to find a replacement in 2 years. Pilots like to know where they are going to land when they take off, and so should we.  We are proceeding ahead with our debate on the healthcare bill. It may be a little convoluted for people watching from the outside, but it is fairly straightforward. The House of Representatives has gone through a series of processes in committees and votes, and it passed a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare now, to do both now. The Senate has been working for 6 months not just to repeal ObamaCare but to repeal and replace it now.  There is some urgency about this. We have millions of Americans who are worrying they may not be able to buy insurance in 2018. That is a very personal worry for millions of They want us to address it now, not 2 years from now.  How do we do that? Well, later today we will have an opportunity to vote for a bill which will take us to the place called a conference committee with the House of Representatives, where we can get a solution to our goal of repealing and replacing ObamaCare now. It is being called a skinny bill because it won't have much in it. It is not a solution to the Affordable Care Act problems, but it is a solution to how we get to a place where we can write the solution to the Affordable Care Act problems. And it is wide open. For those who want to watch late into the night or early into the morning, we are here. We will be offering amendments. People can see that. When we move to the conference committee with the House of Representatives, historically those deliberations have been open. People can watch that. They can see that. That will take place over the next several weeks.  After the conference committee agrees--if it does--on a bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act now, not in 2 years, then it goes back to the House and back to the Senate for debate and approval on an up-or-down vote.  That is the process. I want to make it clear to the American people that insofar as I am concerned, I am not interested in telling you we are going to repeal something now, and trust us--trust the Congress--to come up with some answer in 2 years. I don't want to say that to the American people.  What I do want to say is, we have major problems with the Affordable Care We can't repeal all of it in the budget process, but the House of Representatives showed we can make major changes and major improvements, and the Senate bill, which I voted for on Tuesday, to repeal and replace ObamaCare, shows that we can make major changes and major improvements.  I am convinced that if we can move this process to a conference committee today, between the House of Representatives and the United States Senate--which is part of our regular procedure--we will be able to agree on a way to improve the Affordable Care What that means is that we will repeal major parts of it, and we will replace those parts with parts that work better, parts that give Americans more choices of insurance, that give 350,000 Tennesseans in the individual market some peace of mind to know they will actually be able to buy insurance next year, whereas if we don't act, many of them won't be able to, just like millions of Americans may not be able to.  If we do not act, there will be counties in the United States where some of the most vulnerable Americans will have zero insurance options in 2018, no support to buy insurance, and if they don't get a subsidy from the Federal Government, a hard-working American who might be earning $50,000 or $60,000 a year--no Federal subsidy--that person will have insurance so expensive, with such high deductibles, they won't be able to buy insurance either.  So I think we are on a path toward a solution, and the solution means, 1, that we move the debate out of the Senate this afternoon on to the conference committee and that our goal when we get there is to repeal major parts of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, and replace those parts with provisions that transfer responsibilities to the States to make decisions that give consumers more choices of health insurance at lower costs. That is a noble goal, one we are pursuing, and one in which I hope we succeed.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

5725,topic-id,657,"Mr.President, today I rise to recognize the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company on their 150th anniversary. I am so pleased to honor this great Wisconsin company.  Throughout its history, family has always been at the core of the Leinenkugel business. The family's brewing tradition began well before they came to Jacob's father, Mathais, was a brewer and brandymaker from Meckenheim, Germany, who settled with his family in Sauk City, Mathais passed his craft on to his four sons who, in turn, opened their own breweries throughout Their passion for brewing quality beer remains at the heart of the Leinenkugel family 150 years later.  While it is now the fourth-largest craft brewer in the United States, the nascent company had only two employees: Jacob Leinenkugel and his partner, John Jacob brewed the beer, and John delivered it. Their German brewing methods, combined with excellent grains grown in rich Wisconsin soil and the State's pure water, made Leinenkugel's small brewery an instant success. The hard-working lumberjacks in the logging town of Chippewa Falls were Jacob's first loyal customers. Word of Leinenkugel's beer spread quickly, and its popularity expanded rapidly throughout Northern  When Jacob passed away in 1899, running the company fell to his son-in-law, Henry Casper, and then to his eldest son, Matt, in 1907. Working alongside his sisters and brothers-in-law, the second generation of Leinenkugel's leadership quickly took the company to new heights.  The brewery experienced its first major test with the passage of Prohibition in 1919. While many American breweries cut their losses and closed shop during this period, Leinenkugel's adapted to the new American reality and began brewing Leino, a nonalcoholic version of their popular beer. Unfortunately, Leino was no match for the real thing and was soon discontinued. Thanks to quick thinking, they pivoted once again and began bottling soda water. By the end of Prohibition, Leinenkugel's was the largest bottler of soda water in the area.  After the repeal of Prohibition, Matt Leinkugel's wife, Katherine, and his sister, Rose, mortgaged their homes to finance updates to the brewery's equipment to save the company. Thanks to the resourcefulness of these women, the Leinenkugel family was able to restore the brewery to its pre-Prohibition glory. Leinenkugel's expanded yet again in the mid-20th century to the greater Midwest area and developed new varieties of beer that would meet the diverse needs of its newest customers.  In 1988, the Miller Brewing Company purchased Leinenkugel's, allowing the brewery to distribute products across the country. Today the brewery is an industry leader that produces 25 different styles of beer. For every 10 shandy-style beers consumed in the United States, nine are produced by Leinenkugel's.  Despite their national success, the Leinenkugels have never forgotten their Wisconsin roots or their commitment to their hometown of Chippewa Falls, Jake Leinenkugel, who led the company until his retirement in 2015, said he and his wife, Peg, will always live in Chippewa The couple was named ``Chippewa Valley Philanthropists of the Year'' in 2007 for their ongoing contributions of time and money to local causes.  The Leinenkugel family has also maintained a strong commitment to the conservation of natural resources, particularly the freshwater that is a key component in Leinenkugel's products. The family created Canoes for a Cause, a stewardship program aimed at preserving waterways by removing trash, debris, and invasive plant species. They have held Canoes for a Cause events in Milwaukee, Madison, Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis, and Cleveland, often collecting more than 1,000 pounds of trash in a single day.  Today, C.J., Ellie, Matt, and Kirk Leinenkugel carry on the Leinenkugel's legacy. They are the sixth generation of Leinenkugels to continue Jacob's tradition of excellence, taking a small, local brewery and turning it into one of the most successful breweries in the No matter how many employees or distributors join the team, Leinenkugel's will always remain a family company that, to its core, defines what it means to be kind, hard-working Wisconsinites and genuine                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4758-3.txt,1558,ENHANCING DETECTION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING ACT,2017.0,2.0,July

5591,topic-id,307,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2664, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act, a bill to assist the U.Department of Labor in identifying and preventing cases of human trafficking.  Human trafficking is a global and domestic threat to basic human rights and humanity as we know it. However, the injustice of human trafficking is not just a global program. Human rights abuses are happening right here in the United States every day and in every region across the country.  Polaris, a nonprofit that operates the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline here in the U.received reports of over 8,000 cases of human trafficking in our country last year, an increase of 35 percent over the year before.  Government agencies must continue to work together to identify and eradicate all cases of human trafficking. We can and must do better to prevent cases of abuse before they happen. That is the purpose of this bill, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking  H.2664 directs the Department of Labor to train appropriate Department staff on how to detect human trafficking and ensure that all personnel at the Department of Labor are provided with regular screening tools to identify and detect trafficking activity.  This bill establishes training for a clear course of action, including referring cases of suspected human trafficking to the Department of Justice and other appropriate authorities to properly investigate and prosecute offenders.  This bill also requires the Department of Labor to report back to Congress within a year on the progress that is being made by such efforts.  Mr.Speaker, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act supports current efforts to combat human trafficking by providing the Department of Labor the tools and resources it needs to identify and properly respond to human rights abuses.  I ask my colleagues for a vote in favor of this bill.  ",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5486-2.txt,1996,U.S. TERRITORIES INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,12.0,July

It is an honor to serve with him on the House Judiciary And I am grateful to Representative King as well for producing Sarah's  Today, the House of Representatives can pass a crucial piece of legislation to codify the tenets of two of President Trump's executive orders on immigration enforcement.  H.3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, will finally hold accountable States, cities, and local law enforcement agencies that provide safe haven to criminally violent illegal immigrants by refusing to cooperate with U.Immigration and Customs  You know what is astonishing and you know what is shocking, is that there are jurisdictions in this country that blatantly choose to endanger their communities by providing protection to criminals. Passage of H.3003 ensures that these communities will no longer be given rewards for their dereliction of duty.  Importantly, this bill also contains a section entitled Sarah and Grant's Law, which recognizes two young Americans who were murdered by criminally violent illegal aliens who had no right to be on our streets.  In January 2015, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and constituent of mine, Grant Ronnebeck, was working the graveyard shift at QuickTrip in Mesa, Just before 4 a.m., an illegal alien with a long criminal record, awaiting deportation proceedings, walked in and demanded a pack of cigarettes. When Grant tried to count the money before handing them over, the man shot him and left him to die.  Sarah and Grant are far from the only Americans who have been impacted by illegal immigration. In 2014, Mesa, Arizona, police officer Brandon Mendoza was killed in a wrong-way car crash by an illegal immigrant driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol.  Despite tragic stories like these, the Obama administration continued to promote policies that circumvented many of our immigration laws, allowing thousands of criminals to return to our communities. It is time for these reckless policies to end.  H.3003 specifically targets illegals who commit serious crimes by preventing them from being released onto our streets during their deportation proceedings.  After 8 years of policies that have placed a priority on protecting all illegal aliens, including those who are violent criminals, over the rights and safety of Americans, it is refreshing to have a President who is willing to follow regular law and order.

5679,topic-id,302,"Mr.Speaker, across the country, more than 300 municipalities have adopted policies to limit local law enforcement cooperation with Federal authorities, making it harder to keep our families and communities safe.  Back in my home State of Tennessee, the Nashville City Council has recently been advancing legislation to become one of these sanctuary cities. Giving Federal funds to sanctuary cities defies logic and it demands attention.  Yesterday, I offered an amendment to expand the bill before us today so that sanctuary cities would no longer have access to Community Development Block Grants and certain other economic development grants, as well, that send more than about 300 billion taxpayer dollars a year to local communities.  On its website, the Community Development Block Grant program says its purpose is to provide services to vulnerable communities and address issues that ``pose an immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community.''  What population is more vulnerable than a 6-year-old girl in Lebanon, Tennessee, who was sexually molested while she was sleeping? Just last month, charges were brought against a criminal illegal immigrant for repeatedly breaking into her room at night and making videos while he assaulted her. The evil individual had been in police custody before.  For Kate Steinle, who has been talked about many times on the floor, her killer had a criminal record of not one, two, or three, but seven felonies. He had been deported not once, twice, or three times, but five times. Is that who liberal legislators around the country want to give ``sanctuary''?  We need more communication and cooperation between local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers who are trying to keep our communities safe, not less. It is time to stop giving taxpayer dollars to these cities. I am voting for this bill today to do just that.

5620,topic-id,1538,"Mr.President, I know that later this afternoon, we are going to vote on the nomination of Christopher I am proud to support him, as I was during the Judiciary Committee, voting for him, as did every other member of the Judiciary The reason is quite simply that he is a professional, as nonpolitically associated as anyone can be going into this position.  Like the FBI itself, he is known for his independence and integrity. There are two qualities needed today for the FBI and its Director, and those are independence and integrity. The FBI is[[Page S4646]]one of the most important law enforcement agencies and certainly one of the most important in the country.  The FBI Director doesn't serve the He serves the Constitution and the people of the United He must be independent of political interference, and his or her integrity must be unquestioned. The FBI deserves a leader with the integrity and strength necessary for that solemn mission, and Mr.Wray has shown himself to be that kind of leader. Those qualities are especially important because never before have the rule of law and our law enforcement been so threatened by political interference, and it begins at the very top.  The reason Christopher Wray has been nominated to serve as FBI Director is that the vacancy was created by the firing of Jim Comey for reasons that have led to an aspect of the ongoing investigation by the special counsel.  The reason that position is vacant is because 3 months ago Jim Comey was fired by the President because of ``the Russia thing.'' The Russia thing was very much on the President's mind, more so than any of the reasons given in the memos done by Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, according to the President himself.  ``The Russia thing'' is the FBI and special counsel investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian Government to influence our election.  There is no question that there was a campaign of interference and meddling through cyber attacks, disinformation, propaganda, and other means, and there is no question that the Russians will do it again unless they are made to pay a price. Others may well collude or conspire with them--Americans--unless they are compelled to pay a price.  We have only to look at the morning headlines to see how far-reaching and significant this investigation may be. The news that the President himself wrote a statement to be issued in the name of his son about a meeting with the Russian who promised ``dirt'' on Hillary Clinton and directly misled about that meeting shows what is at stake.  The misleading words put into the President's son's mouth by Donald Trump himself are potential pieces of evidence relating to criminal intent fitting the mosaic that the special counsel has assembled. They add weight and color to that mosaic; they are not alone proof.  The report today is proof that certainly describes a pattern of conduct--pieces of a pattern that fit together into a mosaic providing evidence of intent concerning potential obstruction of justice.  So the likelihood of a threat is increasing--the threat of political interference, the threat of firing Bob Mueller, the threat that Attorney General Jeff Sessions may be used as a vehicle to lead to Bob Mueller's firing.  Even before Jim Comey's dismissal, I called for an independent special prosecutor at the Department of In fact, I was the only member of the Judiciary Committee to vote against Rod Rosenstein's nomination as Deputy Attorney General because he failed to commit to appoint a special prosecutor, and I believed a special prosecutor was necessary not only to determine the full extent of Russia's meddling in our democracy but also to protect that investigation from the President's efforts to shut it down. This belief was brought into stark relief by Jim Comey's firing, and it precipitated the appointment of Bob  The firing of Special Counsel Mueller would precipitate a firestorm on both sides of the aisle. It would put the President over a precipice that likely could lead to the most drastic action possible in this democracy. That precipice can be avoided, and Congress must play a role in avoiding it. We are in talks across the aisle about action that can be taken to provide a check and a firewall against that kind of firing--drastic action that would put the President over that precipice politically and morally and legally. Also, my hope is that the new Chief of Staff, General Kelly, will add a voice of reason and wisdom, perhaps, to check some of the more rash and impulsive action that might otherwise be taken by the  The special counsel was given a clear mandate to follow the evidence wherever it may lead. I believe that Special Counsel Mueller has the guts and backbone, as well as the expertise, to uncover the truth, to follow that evidence, and to bring charges if they are appropriate and necessary, if he is assured the resources and independence to do the job.  That is why Christopher Wray's nomination is so critically important. He will be a key decision maker in providing those resources and investigative agents necessary to do the legwork and the review of documents and other hard work--challenging work--that is necessary so that the special counsel may have the facts and the evidence. The FBI Director is also going to be important in assuring the independence of that special counsel. As an ally and a source of support, the FBI Director will be critical.  The most important priority, in fact, for Christopher Wray will be to protect the independence and integrity of that special counsel investigation just as he must protect the FBI's, because they are intertwined and identified at the core. They involve the rule of law--the essence of our democracy--and the belief and trust that wrongdoing will be investigated and prosecuted no matter how powerful the target and no matter how wealthy or powerful the wrongdoer. That investigation has expanded appropriately to include financial dealings on the part of the President of the United Any attempt by the President to set limits on that investigation is inappropriate and potentially illegal and further evidence of criminal intent.  In short, the mandate for both Director Wray and Special Counsel Mueller must be unconditional. There must be no limits set by political interference. The nominee whom we vote to confirm today must sustain and secure that ongoing independent investigation from any interference no matter how powerful the source, including the President of the United No one can set limits, because no one is above the law, and the special counsel must have the freedom to decide where the investigation will lead because he will follow the facts where they lead.  The FBI Director has a broad and inclusive mandate. In addition to protecting the United States against corruption and wrongdoing involving misuse and abuse of power, he must also protect the United States against terrorism and foreign intelligence threats. He is charged with providing leadership services to State, Federal, and municipal agencies and partners, and he is responsible for protecting civil rights.  On Friday, July 28, 2017, President Trump gave a speech in Selden, NY, in effect encouraging law enforcement to use or misuse excessive force. More specifically, he directed law enforcement not to be ``too nice,'' and he described, graphically, how officers should potentially allow arrestees to be banged on the head or otherwise mistreated. With his comments, President Trump did a disservice to countless law enforcement officers who work hard to keep our neighborhoods safe while maintaining good relationships with the communities they serve.  I will be joining with colleagues and working with the very distinguished senior Senator of California, who has joined us on the floor, in asking that our law enforcement leadership take action to express its disapproval of that kind of misconduct, and my hope is that, specifically, the Department of Justice will express its disapproval of such misconduct.  The FBI has a special obligation to condemn such violations of standards and laws, and I hope that the new Director, Mr.Wray, will join dozens of law enforcement leaders across the country in making clear that the President's remarks have no place at the I believe that Christopher Wray has the experience and credibility and the expertise to lead the FBI in that effort, as well as in protecting the special counsel.  Based on his career and his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, I believe that he will bring that leadership to the I regret that he will be the FBI Director only because it is the result of an abusive and improper firing of James The special counsel's investigation of that firing as a potential obstruction of justice is well warranted, and I know that Mr.Wray will do everything possible to enable it to be fair and effective, comprehensive[[Page S4647]]and thorough, and to do justice.

The LRAFB Community Council, comprised of dedicated local civic leaders, has passionately championed the base's mission, while fostering partnership efforts between the military and civilian communities. Furthermore, as the Department of Defense and U.Air Force have faced an unprecedented 8 years of fiscal uncertainty, the community council has remained a steadfast leader and staunch advocate for the Team Little Rock mission, its airmen, and their families.  The LRAFB Community Council long ago established an enduring relationship with its Arkansas congressional delegation to ensure a sustained awareness of base needs, successes, and challenges. This outstanding example of leadership demonstrates the community council's commitment to building a dedicated and resilient community network around Little Rock's sole Air Force installation.  The level of collaboration between the community council and Team Little Rock is simply unprecedented. For example, Jacksonville and Little Rock have adopted ordinances and regulations preventing civilian encroachment that would impede aircraft operations, while many military-civilian initiatives have been formulated to offer mutual services, thus improving quality of life on both sides of the fence. Moreover, the Jacksonville fire department and emergency services team regularly participate in both exercises and real-world scenarios with their military counterparts. Finally, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson appointed past community council president Brad Hegeman to chair the Governor's military affairs committee in order to address the assets, economic impact, benefits, and needs of military installations and military-related businesses throughout  Throughout my time in Congress, I have consistently witnessed the extraordinary and tireless support received by Team Little Rock on behalf of the Little Rock Air Force Base Community The entire community council team is very deserving of this incredible honor, and I am thrilled to officially recognize them as the 2017 Association of Defense Communities Member of the Congratulations, Team Little                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgS3681.txt,1687,CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL PRACTICE SHOOTING,2017.0,21.0,June

Mr.Chair, I rise in support of H.1695, the Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act of 2017.  I represent the San Fernando Valley, which is in the Los Angeles area. For my constituents, for the families in my district, copyright protections are not an abstract philosophical issue, ladies and gentlemen. The families in my district depend on strong copyright protections in order to earn a living, to feed their family. They work in film and television studios and in music publishing. They are artists, set designers, producers, union drivers; they work on lots, and they work in every aspect supporting this incredible industry.  There are 127,000 film and television production jobs in Los Angeles According to a recent report, the core copyright industries--film, television, music, video games, and publishing--make possible 5.5 million jobs and bring in $1.2 trillion of gross domestic product to the American economy.  Good copyright laws and regulations mean jobs and whether or not a family can put food on the table and a roof over their heads. We need to give the Copyright Office the respect and authority it deserves as the overseer of 5.5 million American jobs.  I have heard from my constituents for years about the need to empower the Copyright Office to keep up with[[Page H2871]]the industry and the technology changes.

5382,topic-id,3561,"Mr.President, I spent many years of my life in Navy airplanes. I am a retired Navy captain. Senator Alexander said something the other day about the fact that a pilot doesn't start up and take off in an airplane unless he or she knows what the destination is. I thought that was pretty interesting. It is true.  With respect to healthcare in this country, we have actually known for a long time what the destination is, and the destination is a combination of three things: better healthcare coverage for less money--and cover everyone. That is really our destination. It is not just the destination this year in this Congress; it has been our destination really since Harry Truman was  For some years, we have argued and disagreed about how to get to the destination. I don't think anyone would argue about the need to get to that destination, but the question is how.  In 1993--I mentioned yesterday in my remarks on the floor--Hillary Clinton was a brandnew First Lady and worked on something called In response, Republicans came up with something that really has its roots and origin from the Heritage They had more of a market-based approach, which called for every State having their own exchange, where people without coverage could get healthcare coverage. There would be a sliding scale tax credit that would help buy down the cost of premiums for folks who got the coverage in their State's exchange. Low-income people got a bigger tax credit. Higher income people had a smaller tax credit that would eventually fade away.  The third piece of the Republican alternative to HillaryCare was the idea of an individual mandate, which basically said that everybody has to get coverage. If you don't, we can't make you, but you have to pay a fine. Over time the fine would go up.  The fourth piece of the Republican proposal in 1993 was that employers of a certain size with a certain number of employees would have to make sure they provided coverage for their employees. I don't remember a lot of specificity of what that coverage would include, but if they had quite a few employees, they would have to provide coverage for them, make it available.  The last piece was the idea that health insurance companies would say at that time: If you have a preexisting condition, sorry, we are just not going to cover you. The Republican proposal said: That is verboten. You can't do that, insurance companies.  So that was their idea that was introduced here. There were, I think, about 23 cosponsors, led by John Chafee, who was a former marine, former Governor of Rhode Island, U.Senator, and highly regarded. The legislation he introduced in 1993 had 20, 22 cosponsors, I think, including some people who are still here--Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, and a number of others. That idea became  In 2006, Governor Romney sought to cover everybody in the State of Massachusetts before running for It was a pretty good idea. It was such a good idea that when we worked on the Affordable Care Act, that idea was one of the major principles, one of the major pillars of the Affordable Care  Now--I said this yesterday--Barack Obama gets credit for coming up with that approach to provide healthcare. He is a smart guy, but that wasn't his deal. He didn't come up with that. I didn't come up with that. Governor Romney didn't come up with that. I don't think Senator John Chafee, beloved Senator from Rhode Island--neither he nor Senator Hatch nor Senator Grassley came up with that. I think it was an idea from the Heritage It is probably heresy, as a Democrat, to say this, but it was a good idea. It was a good idea in 1993. It was a good idea in 2006 in Massachusetts, and it was a good idea when we folded it into the Affordable Care Act as one of the major pillars.  I want to go back and revisit 2009 just for a little bit. There are those who believe that there was no bipartisan involvement and the ACA was just hustled through without a lot of thought or debate. As it turns out, I think we spent 80 days all total in the U.Senate in that Congress in 2009, debating the bill in committees--the two committees of jurisdiction. I served then and I serve now on the Finance We spent a heck of a lot of time in debates and markups where people had a chance to offer amendments, debate them. The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee spent a lot of time that year, 2009, similarly in bipartisan hearings, with bipartisan amendments, debate.  All totaled, I believe, over 300 amendments were offered in Senate committees of jurisdiction, and I am told that 160 amendments offered by Republican Senators were adopted and made part of the legislation.  I know our Republican colleagues believe that they were shut out of the process, but I think a closer review of that process in history would suggest that just wasn't so. Was it a perfect process? Could it have been better? You can always do things better. But it was a process that we went through in order to address this concern.  In 2008, during that year's election, one of the things I learned was that we were spending in this country, as a percentage of GDP for healthcare, 18 percent of I have a friend who, when I ask him how he is doing, says: Compared to what?  I would just say: Well, what were the Japanese spending in 2008 as a percentage of GDP for healthcare? It was 8 percent. Think about that. Well, maybe we got better results; maybe people live longer in this country or we have lower rates of infant mortality than the No, it is not true. They got better results. They spent half as much, and they got better results.  Well, maybe a lot of people in that country didn't have coverage and we covered everyone. Actually, just the opposite is true. They covered everyone. We had 40 million people who went to bed in 2008 without any healthcare coverage, and for a lot of them, access to healthcare coverage was the emergency room of a hospital.  As you all know, as we know, when people get sick enough, they will get care in this country. It may not be cost-effective care. It may be expensive care because it is not just an emergency room visit. In many instances, it is the admission to the hospital and a stay that could last for days or even weeks. We do have some idea how much it costs to stay in the hospital. It is hugely expensive. Eventually, people would get healthcare coverage or healthcare attention, but a lot of times it costs an arm and a leg, literally and figuratively. So the question was, could we do better than that?  What we came up with is a multifaceted approach, which includes that Heritage Foundation idea of the exchanges where people didn't have access to coverage. And the focus would be not just on spending money on people when they were sick, but to save us--not to have so much a sick care system, but to have a healthcare delivery system that focuses more on helping people to stay healthy and well, with a much bigger focus on prevention and wellness and frankly a focus on, for example, making sure people, when they reach the age of 50, get a colonoscopy and they don't have to pay a whole lot of money to get it because it would be part of their health insurance coverage.  I have a friend whose mom died several years ago. My friend and I work out at the YMCA in Wilmington from time to time. She just turned 50, and I said: Well, how old are your parents? My friend is really fit, and I said: How old are your parents now?  She said: They are both deceased.  I said: Really? What happened?  She said: My mom died of colon cancer a number of years ago.  I said: Didn't she get the colon screening--the colorectal screening and all?[[Page S4351]]  She said: No, no, no. She didn't like that, didn't want to do that. It costs a lot of money, and so she just didn't do it.  We have other people who, over the years, have not had prostate screenings for prostate cancer, and we have had people who didn't have breast cancer screenings because, in some cases, it is unpleasant and, in some cases, just because it can cost a lot of money, and a lot of that was out of pocket, so people would forego that. We have changed that. We want people to get the screenings and to be able to get those screenings and find out and make sure that they are not going to get sick and cost a lot of money.  My friend's mother was sick for many months. I can't imagine how much it cost--and all that for maybe a $1,000 colorectal screening that was not taken.  We don't do that stuff in this country much anymore. We actually offer the screenings. They are free. With our focus on wellness and prevention and things like annual physicals, we want to catch problems when they are small.  One of the reasons healthcare coverage in Japan--as a Naval flight officer, I flew a lot of missions in and out of Japan during the Vietnam war, and one of the things I learned about Japan is that, one, the people are very slender. In this country, about one-third of our people now are obese or on their way to being obese. Obesity is a great precursor, which says that this person is going to have healthcare problems and costly healthcare problems. There are a lot of people in this country who still smoke--not as many as before--but that is another predictor of people on whom we are going to have to spend a whole lot of money.  The other thing that caught my eye in Japan was the access to primary healthcare close to where people live. In almost every neighborhood of any consequence, people had access to a clinic where they could go for a checkup, for a physical to catch problems when they are small and to address them when they are small. As we looked around the world at things that were working, that would seem to be something that worked, we tried to make sure that was part of our approach in the Affordable Care  Another thing we found that worked is, in some countries and literally here in this country--the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, and places like that--one of the secrets of their success, better results for less money, is the idea of coordinating the delivery of healthcare--coordinating the delivery of healthcare.  My mom, now deceased, lived until she was 82. She had dementia. She had arthritis. She had congestive heart failure. She had any number of ailments. My dad had passed away several years earlier. She lived near Clearwater, We had people--my sister had people living with her to take care of her until later in her life. At one time, my mom was seeing five or six doctors. They were prescribing a total of 15 medicines for her. I remember we had in her home something that looked like a fishing tackle box--my dad's fishing tackle box. You may have seen one of these. If you open it up, it has all these medicines in it to take before breakfast, with breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, all the way to bedtime, and they are all set up and arranged. Fifteen different medicines she was taking from five or six doctors who never talked to each other. Nobody had any idea what was being prescribed for my mom. Nobody was coordinating that care. That is foolish. I know a lot of those medicines probably interacted badly with each other and hastened my mom's decline and death.  The focus we had on the Affordable Care Act, with coordinated delivery of healthcare among different doctors and different specialties and with hospitals, nursing homes, federally qualified community health centers, and the VA, we do a much better job at coordinating delivery of healthcare.  In Delaware, we just don't have electronic health records for healthcare--we have those all over the country now. One thing that came out of the Affordable Care Act was we put the pedal to the metal and said we want a whole lot more electronic health records being used that talk to each other for coordinated delivery of healthcare--better care. Delaware took it a step further. In Delaware, we have something called the Delaware Information Network, which I signed into law, authorizing it in my last term as I had no idea really what the potential was of what we were doing, but with some help from the Federal Government, we have now just a terrific utility, a terrific mechanism to help us take this idea of coordinating delivery of healthcare and put it on steroids and further improve the quality of healthcare.  I have been approaching this day with real concern. I am an optimistic guy. I am a glass half-full guy, but I have been troubled a lot more than not. I went home last night and my wife met me at the door and she said: You don't seem yourself. I said: I am troubled, and she said she was too. She had been watching too much There are a lot of concerning things going on in this city, at the White House, and even in this building.  We are at our best when we work together. We Democrats didn't create Social Security by ourselves. The GI bill--I was a beneficiary of the GI bill at the end of the Vietnam war, and so was my father at the end of World War There have been good ideas like Democrats didn't create them by themselves, Republicans didn't create them by themselves. We worked together to create those landmark pieces of legislation and programs that all of us would agree are good for this Nation and good for our people.  When you are dealing with a subject that involves maybe everybody in the country and perhaps one-sixth of our population, this is one we ought to do together. We ought to do this together.  John McCain and I served during the Vietnam war. We came to the House of Representatives together, and we worked on normalizing relations with He was a Senator with John Kerry, and I was a House Member with a bunch of my colleagues over there.  John McCain stood right over here a couple days ago. We were all happy to see him back. We welcomed him back because we need him and his leadership. He said a number of times during his remarks that what we need is regular order.  I guess people who might have been watching on C-SPAN are wondering what is regular order.  We have a new crop of pages here. Let me just say to our pages who are rising juniors and coming from States all over America and actually do a great job of helping make sure this place doesn't get too messed up in more ways than one, regular order is when people have a good idea, whether it is in healthcare, defense, or agriculture, and actually take their good idea and introduce legislation. I try to introduce legislation most times with bipartisan support. I have learned you get better results in the end if you do that.  The idea of regular order is introducing legislation that reflects and addresses a need or an issue. That bill is introduced here in this It is assigned by the Parliamentarian to the committee of jurisdiction. The sponsor or sponsors of the bill go see the chair of the committee where the bill is assigned and ask for a hearing. If they convince the chair of the committee it is a good bill, with a good idea, then there is a good chance they will have a hearing. At that hearing will be witnesses--expert witnesses, stakeholders. Those witnesses will say: I like this about that bill or I see a problem with that bill, and there are changes that should be made to the bill. In some cases, we invite the Congressional Budget Office, sometimes Senators or House Members to come in and testify as well.  On an issue that is this important, we need regular order because whatever the Republican ideas are--and hopefully we will find out what their ideas are today--we need to check the tires, take the time to find out what is good about it and what is not and fix it in committee, where Democrats and Republicans can offer amendments, debate them. That would be done in the Finance Committee and also in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  That is what we ought to do. If we take that approach, we will end up with a better final result; rather than being a country that looks at other countries around the world, asking: Why does Japan get better results than[[Page S4352]]we do, spending half as much money and they can cover everybody--why is that?  I am proud of much of what we do in this country with respect to healthcare; in many ways, we are on the right track, but as I said, in everything I do, I know I can do better. We can sure do a better job on healthcare.  Last thought. I see we have been joined by the Democratic leader, and I will say a few words before yielding the floor. I was fortunate enough to visit Tanzania with my wife. We met our sons over there two summers ago. After going to a seminar, we went out across the country, had a chance to just see an amazing--for those who have never been there, and I never spent much time in Africa, it was an incredible experience, all the life and animals and nature and it was beautiful and incredibly exciting. One of the many things I learned there was this proverb, and it goes something like this:  African proverb: If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.  If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.  We need to hit the pause button. We need to fix the exchanges in every State to stabilize the exchanges. There are three easy ways to do it: make clear that the individual mandate is going to be maintained or replaced by something that is at least as effective; a doctor reinsurance program that will help stabilize the program, much as reinsurance was used as a mechanism to stabilize and make successful the Medicare Part D Program; and, finally, we should make clear that the cost-sharing arrangements we have, the subsidies that help reduce the costs, the copays and deductibles for people getting their coverage in the exchanges, just make it clear they are not going to go away. The insurance companies tell us, if we would do those three things--secure the individual mandate or something as good as the individual mandate, reinsurance, and address the cost-sharing arrangements, that they are not going away--if we do those three things, they tell us the cost of premiums across the country would drop by as much as 25 percent to 35 percent.  Think about that. What you would have is the insurance companies not fearing they are going to lose their shirts because of not having a pool of people they can insure. They are fearful of having a pool of people to insure in the exchanges that are sick, crippled, and there are not a lot of young, healthy people who create a mix that can actually, effectively and predictably, be insured by insurance companies. The great thing about reducing premiums by 25 to 35 percent in the exchanges is this. People who get the coverage in the exchanges benefit. They save money.  Do you know who else saves money? Uncle Sam, because we are paying a significant amount of support to help make sure the exchanges envisioned all those years ago by the Heritage Foundation--to make sure they work.  That sounds like a pretty good step: hit the pause button; stabilize the exchanges; make sure we have coverage for people in every State through the exchanges in every county and bring down the premiums by 25 percent to 35 percent; provide certainty and predictability for the insurance companies. With that predictability and certainty, we have more competition. The insurance companies get into the game, and they say we are going to offer policies as well.  After we have done that, let's pivot and address, as Democrats and Republicans working together, fixing those parts of the Affordable Care Act that need to be fixed and preserve the parts that need to be preserved. Let's do that together.  With that, I yield the floor.                   Recognition of the Minority Leader  The PRESIDING The minority leader is recognized.

Unfortunately, sanctuary cities that fail to comply with Federal law and deliberately refuse to cooperate with Federal authorities become safe havens for undocumented criminal immigrants, because criminals know they are less likely to be detained in those cities, which are, by definition, sanctuary cities.  Far too many innocent lives are put at risk when a criminal alien convicted, for example, of drunk driving or charged with another serious offense is not detained so they could be appropriately dealt with and, if warranted, deported from our country according to the law.  That is why it is essential that we pass this resolution, which will strengthen our Nation's immigration laws, hold sanctuary cities accountable, and enhance public safety by requiring detention of criminal aliens.  The bottom line is, if we expect our Federal immigration authorities to enforce our Nation's immigration laws and protect the American people, State and local officials need to cooperate, not defy Federal immigration laws. And those local officials who refuse to do so and instead give so-called sanctuary to those that have come to our country illegally and then committed crimes here, they are putting the very people who they were sworn to serve and to protect at risk. And unfortunately, this has been happening all over the country, where literally people come here illegally, commit crimes, and local entities decide not to enforce the law.

We all have different ideas, objectives, and goals. I respect this institution and the  In the 5 months I have been here, I have advocated for a balanced budget and term limits; and I will continue to fight to see that those two items of my agenda become law.  I have also worked hard to see that some badly needed projects in my district receive funding. I am proud to say that the following projects are funded in this bill: $270 million for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant deactivation process, which will keep 1,200 West Kentuckians working in good-paying jobs and continue to prevent illness and environmental issues in McCracken and Ballard  I am proud to represent Fort The bill provides a pay increase for our troops and fully funds health and benefits for them and their families while providing the funding to begin rebuilding our military; language to redesignate the Pennyrile Parkway as I-169 from south of Madisonville to Hopkinsville; funding for much-needed dredging of the Hickman-Fulton Riverport, which is located just off the Mississippi River; language which prohibits the Army Corps of Engineers[[Page H3074]]from charging the residents of Russell and Clinton Counties for water from Lake Cumberland; and a permanent fix to ensure healthcare benefits for retired coal miners.  Though I am disappointed in many parts of the overall bill and the appropriations process as a whole, I am very happy with the badly needed items successfully addressed for my district in this short-term funding bill. For that reason and because I do not ever want to see a government shutdown, I will vote ``yes'' on the short-term omnibus.  I will continue to work hard for conservative principles and fiscal discipline. I will continue to demand transparency through the appropriations process. I came here to get things done for the people of my district. I am sure I will never get 100 percent of what I want, but I will always try. At the end of the day, I will try to build consensus and do the things that Congress is supposed to get done, whether it be tax reform, healthcare reform, or to fund the government.  We have many responsibilities in this great body, and I pledge to be one Representative who works with our President and every Member of this body to make America great again.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgH3073-3.txt,99999999999999,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,3.0,August

Case in point, one cannot talk about the U.commitment to article 5 in 2017 without mentioning President Trump's failure to embrace it in full view of our NATO allies when he was in Brussels earlier this year. It has been widely reported that even the President's own national security team was blindsided by the omission.  I welcome this resolution, but it would have made a stronger statement to bring it to the floor immediately after the President's disconcerting speech in This resolution maybe is less a profile in courage as it is a sigh of relief.  Since the House failed the leadership test on this account, let's redeem ourselves by taking up the Engel-Connolly bill on Russian's sanctions, and the Iran-Russia sanctions package recently passed in the Senate by 98-2, and send it to the President's desk for signature.  Any delay only furthers the trend of obsequiousness to the executive branch and enables this administration's disastrous retreat from global leadership.

5409,topic-id,491,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, I rise in strong support of H.1695, the Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability As lead Democratic cosponsor of this bipartisan, bicameral legislation, I am pleased that this bill passed out of our Judiciary Committee--thanks to Chairman Goodlatte and many others--by a vote of 27-1.  This legislation represents sound public policy that will strengthen the copyright system. To begin with, it has evolved directly from the bipartisan copyright review process that Chairman Goodlatte initiated way back in 2013. Over the course of that highly deliberative process, the Judiciary Committee held no less than 20 hearings and heard from over 100 witnesses on how to update the copyright laws for the 21st century.  H.1695 is the product of more than 4 years of outreach efforts with a wide range of interested parties who very much want to see, like all of us, a Copyright Office that is responsible to all stakeholders in the copyright ecosystem.  This bill is also the product of bicameral collaboration with our Senate colleagues, including the Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley, the Ranking Member Feinstein, and Senator As a result of this inclusive process, the strong bipartisan consensus emerged from the Copyright Office that needs to be more accountable to Congress, and that it should have greater independence.  That Office has a long and distinguished history of serving as an adviser to Congress on copyright measures, and it is only reasonable that Congress play a significant role in deciding who leads that important agency.  H.1695 also elevates the stature of the Register and makes the position directly accountable to Congress, which will help ensure a strong and vibrant copyright system that fuels our economy, creates jobs, and promotes a diverse range of views.  Today, core copyright businesses annually contribute more than $1.2 trillion to our Nation's economy and generate foreign sales of almost $180 billion. These businesses are also tremendous job creators, creating more than 5 million workers.  That is why the bill is strongly supported by several unions, including the AFL-CIO, the Screen Actors Guild, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, as well as the Directors Guild of  H.1695 is also supported by a broad range of other stakeholders, including: the American Intellectual Property Law Association; the Intellectual Property Owners Association; and various coalitions of creators, such as the Content Creators Coalition (c3), CreativeFuture, and the Copyright  Individual creators like Jeff Friday, the founder and CEO of Film Life and the producer of the American Black Film Festival also are in strong support of the bill.

5655,topic-id,385,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to be clear at the outset of this debate that this legislation does nothing to make our communities safer, and it does nothing to improve our immigration system. Instead, H.3003 will trample the rights of States and localities to determine what is in the best interest of their public safety, and it will conscript law enforcement to enforce Federal immigration law.  The ultimate experts on community safety are communities themselves, and hundreds of them have determined that, as community trust increases, crime decreases. This is because immigrants will come out of the shadows and report crimes to local law enforcement when they are not threatened with deportation. In fact, a recent study found that community trust jurisdictions are actually safer than their counterparts.  Against this considered judgment, H.3003 forces localities to abandon community trust principles and mandates the conscription of local offices into Federal immigration enforcement. Some localities, of course, would rightfully resist this conscription. As punishment, H.3003 would rob them of vital law enforcement funding that they depend on to prevent crime, prosecute criminals, and boost community policing ranks.  Localities, therefore, would face a losing choice: they can abandon community trust policies and leave their communities in danger, or they can leave community trust policies in place but forgo law enforcement funding, leaving their community in danger.  It is important that we consider that this is more than just bad policy. It is also likely unconstitutional for multiple reasons. First, H.3003 likely violates the 10th Amendment by commandeering States to comply with detainer requests that drain their resources.  In addition, the bill's changes to the Department of Homeland Security's detainer authority exacerbate the current Fourth Amendment concerns associated with immigration detainers. The bill does not require any particularized finding about the individual that may form the basis of a probable cause determination and fails to provide for a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.  The bill further compounds constitutional concerns by eliminating the ability for a detained individual to obtain an independent, individualized review of his or her bond determination by a neutral decisionmaker.  For these reasons--and there are others--I urge my colleagues to please oppose this dangerous, mean-spirited, and constitutionally suspect legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

5480,topic-id,3210,"Mr.President, we continue to make progress on legislation to clean up the mess left by the meltdown of ObamaCare, at least insofar as it affects the lives of millions of people who buy their insurance on the individual markets. These are individuals and small businesses that don't have the benefit of large employer healthcare plans, and they have been devastated by  This is a rescue mission. ObamaCare is collapsing for millions of people, and we have to act in the interest of countless families and small businesses that are suffering tremendous harm.  I have told the stories myself; others have likewise told the stories. We have seen those reported in the media. For many people, healthcare costs, their insurance premiums are skyrocketing. We also know that because of the distortion in the insurance markets, many insurance companies are simply pulling out of counties and States around the country, so people have no choices when it comes to purchasing their healthcare on the exchanges. Of course, many people continue to lose access to their doctors.  We need to contrast this with what was promised when ObamaCare was passed. I know it sounds repetitive, but I am afraid that if we lose sight of what the promises were with ObamaCare, we can't actually calculate the tremendous harm and the deception that was involved in actually delivering on that promise.  President Obama said that if you liked your policy, you could keep it--not true. He said if you liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor--also not true. He also said that a family of four could see an average decrease in premiums of $2,500 a year--also not true.  What is the response of our Democratic friends? We saw last night that they took to the Senate floor, and they gave impassioned speeches.  First of all, they criticized the Republicans for coming forward to try to rescue the people who were being hurt by the failures of They criticized us for that. Then they said that it was a secret bill after they had rejected every entreaty--every request--for them to work with us on a bipartisan basis to rescue the people who are being hurt by the failures of They rejected that.  What did they do? They came to the Senate floor. They said that they hate the bill that they have not seen yet. Then they said: Oh, it is secret. So I guess it should be one or the other. Either they hate it because they know what is in it or it is secret. It cannot be both.  The fact is that we are working hard to meet our own internal deadline because we want to make sure that the people who will be hurt in 2018, when the insurance companies raise their premiums by digits--and they are in the process of getting those approved. It will occur in the July-August timeframe when insurance companies will have to calculate what the premium is that they will have to charge. Then they will have to go to the State regulators and get approval for that premium increase. What we are being told is that the 105-percent increase in premiums on the exchanges since 2013--that is right, a 105-percent increase--is going to go up 20 percent or more next year unless we come to the rescue of those who are being harmed by  We would say to our Democratic colleagues: Please do not wear yourselves out by doing something that is going to accomplish nothing. Channel all of that energy and that passion into trying to do something that will actually help the people who are being hurt today by the failures of  They went even further. They said, well, they may decide just to obstruct the Senate's business on other matters that are not healthcare related until they can see the bill, which they will get to see soon.  As soon as we see the final product, we will get it scored by the Congressional Budget Then we will have, literally, a vote-arama, where there will be an opportunity to debate in a fulsome and comprehensive sort of way and an opportunity to offer dozens--if not hundreds--of amendments to the bill, and we will vote. We will vote, as that is what we do.  There is nothing happening in secret here. In the fullness of time, we will all see the product we have been working on. As a result of their refusal to work with us, we have been working on it the best we can to try to accomplish something better than the failed status quo of  We are told that they may obstruct the Senate's other business, including committee work. That is unrelated to the healthcare debate but, I guess, is just their lashing out in trying to find some way that they can make life a little more difficult here in the Senate with regard to our accomplishing other important work as well.  I happen to serve on the Senate Intelligence One of the things that we are doing is a comprehensive investigation of Russia's active measures undertaken during the last election. We have a committee meeting this afternoon.  Are Democrats really going to obstruct the Senate Intelligence Committee's work in conducting and completing its investigation into Russian activities in the 2016 election? Are they really going to do that? It strikes me as nuts.  On Thursday, for example, we also have a Judiciary Committee meeting that is scheduled to consider a critically important bill that I introduced with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, to help fight human trafficking.  Are Democrats going to obstruct our ability to conduct our business and block our consideration of bills involving human trafficking and providing relief for the victims?  This bill reauthorizes key programs that support survivors, and it provides[[Page S3617]]additional resources to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials who are on the frontlines of fighting this heinous crime.  Will the Democratic leader from New York jeopardize the committee's ability to actually consider and pass this law? Does he plan to block a Member of his own political party from advancing her bill to fight human trafficking as well?  This strikes me as wrong for a number of reasons, and I think it would actually be appalling if our Democratic colleagues, out of their frustration--frankly, borne out of their failure to do their job and work with us to find a solution to the meltdown of ObamaCare--lashed out in a way that affected victims of human trafficking and affected the Senate's ability to conduct its investigation into the Russian activities involved in our election.  Now is not the time to grandstand and make damaging, symbolic gestures like this because, while our Democratic colleagues talked a lot last night, we did not hear anything from them about the current realities of ObamaCare and how it has failed the American people. They seem to be whistling by the graveyard. We did not hear anything about rising costs or the lack of choices.  I talked to one of my Democratic colleagues this morning. He told me that his own son was looking at $7,500 premiums a year and at a $5,000 deductible. This friend, a Democrat--and I will not reveal his name because I do not think it would be appropriate to do so--told me that his own son had to spend $12,500 out of pocket before his insurance actually kicked in. That is a disaster, not just for his son but for millions of people who are negatively affected by Yet our friends across the aisle want to flail about and threaten to block trafficking legislation or an investigation into the Russian involvement in the election.  The only thing they have not done is offer a constructive alternative. That is the only thing they have not done. They have tried about everything else. You know why, of course. It is that we know what the alternative is.  Basically, they did ObamaCare all by themselves. I remember. I was here on the Senate floor, in 2010, on Christmas I think it was at about 7:30 in the morning when we had the vote out of the Senate that passed It was a pure party-line vote. So the Democrats have had it all to themselves--the ability to design a healthcare system that they thought America should have. It has failed time and again.  Do you know what their current proposal is right now? It is a single-payer option that puts our country even more in debt and that we know does not work.  The reason we know it does not work is that it will, no doubt, emulate things like the British National Health Service, which has resulted in two-tiered healthcare--healthcare for people who cannot otherwise afford to pay out of their pockets to get better healthcare, with all of the problems of government-run healthcare added to it, but far-left elements of the Democratic Party want a plan that goes even further than That, I believe, could ultimately be their goal--one that would increase government spending on healthcare by $518.9 billion just this year, ballooning to $6.6 trillion between 2017 and 2026, according to the Urban  Take a look at the State of California, where a similar proposal--a single-payer system--was pushed at the State level there to enact a single-payer system that would add $400 billion each year to the California State budget. I think that is roughly double the amount of the whole budget for the State of California--$400 billion each year.  It strikes me that at least one conclusion you might draw from this is that our Democratic friends' solution, rather than trying to work with us in a bipartisan way to save people who are being hurt from the failures of ObamaCare, is to say: Let's throw more money at it. That is not going to work. What it will do is add to our national debt without solving the healthcare problem, and it will further burden future generations who will have to pay that money back at some point.  We already have about $20 trillion in national debt. These young people up here who are serving as pages are going to have to deal with that, I guess, unless we have the courage to do it ourselves. It strikes me as profoundly immoral for us to spend the money today and say: Well, our kids and grandkids are going to have to pay it back later. That is immoral.  If we thought ObamaCare crushed any semblance of competition in the healthcare marketplace, the single-payer plan from our friend Senator Bernie Sanders, from Vermont, who is the chief spokesman for the Democrats in the Senate on what an alternative might look like, removes competition completely because it is a government takeover. It takes away even more authority from State and local governments, and it takes away choices from individuals. Forget ``if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.'' Forget all of that because it is the opposite of what American families have repeatedly asked for.  This is what the extreme factions in the Democratic Party want. They want to expand government. They want an even larger takeover of healthcare, and they want to simply throw more money at it--as if we are not spending enough money already. Throwing more money at the problem certainly will not fix it. I suggest that it will only make things worse.  We need to be realistic about what it will take to rework our healthcare system and put patients first. I am under no illusion as to what Republicans are going to be able to come up with on our own, given the constraints of the fact that the Democrats will not work with us at all and appear not to be in the business of lifting a finger to help the millions of people who are being hurt. I am not under any illusion that what we are going to be able to come up with--and it is an interim step--is going to be perfect, as no legislation ever is, but I think we are obligated to do our best. The fact that our Democratic friends will not help at all makes it a lot harder, but I do not think we can say: It is too hard. We cannot do it. We give up.  We are committed on this side of the aisle and invite our colleagues on that side of the aisle to work with us to fix the problems that are caused by ObamaCare and to implement real healthcare reforms that will work.  First of all, we need to stabilize the market--I mentioned this earlier--and rescue millions of folks who are losing all of their access to coverage because insurance companies are simply quitting because they are bleeding money. They cannot charge a high enough premium that somebody will actually pay, so they leave the market. In Texas, alone, there are dozens of counties that have only one insurance marketplace option. If we do nothing, I fear there will be no choices. When there is only one choice, the economic backlash is pretty simple. There is no competition to drive down costs and improve the quality of coverage.  I think this is, really, in some ways, a test of our convictions. If you really do believe that competition in the marketplace improves quality and cost for the consumer, as I do, then going to a single-payer system or even trying to repair ObamaCare is the opposite of what we should do. We need to return the market to a competitive one so that families can have the ability to make choices about their healthcare, what suits their needs, not what government is going to force you to buy, and if you do not buy the government-approved plan, it is going to punish you by fining you. That is what the status quo is like under  ObamaCare is so bad that, currently, we have almost 30 million people who are still uninsured. About 6.5 million of them simply pay the penalty--I think it is $695 a year now--instead of buying the government-approved healthcare plan. They figure that paying the penalty is better than buying the insurance for them. Then there are others--millions more--who simply opt out because of hardship. If the goal of ObamaCare were universal coverage, it has failed that goal as well. So we need to stabilize the market.  Secondly, we need to address ObamaCare's skyrocketing premium increases. We all know that if ObamaCare stays in place, premiums will stand only to rise for consumers. That is something I think our friends across the aisle are missing as well. [[Page S3618]]Doing nothing is not an option because people are going to be even more priced out of the marketplace, assuming they can find an insurance company to sell them healthcare.  In Texas, a Houston-area insurer has asked for a 16-percent annual rate hike for its 2018 ObamaCare coverage--a 16-percent increase over this year they want for next year. That is what doing nothing will do. It warns it might even need a greater increase just to cover its costs.  Private businesses can't actually operate in the red like the Federal Government does. Private businesses can't just print more money or run up $20 trillion in debt. So when they can't make money, they simply have to raise premiums or they have to quit the market.  The third thing we need to do is this. Remember, the first thing I said is stabilize the market. The second is attack premiums to bring them down, and the third thing we need to do is make sure we continue to protect American citizens from preexisting conditions. This is something I think everybody believes that needs to happen, without regard to political or ideological affiliation. No one should be denied basic healthcare because they have a preexisting condition, and we want to preserve those protections. That is the third goal.  The fourth goal is to make Medicaid, which is the medical safety net for millions of people, sustainable into the future. Right now we know it is not sustainable, like our other entitlement programs. The way we want to do that is by giving States more flexibility. We want to make sure that those who rely on the program don't have the rug pulled out from under them, and we want to make sure that it continues to grow year after year, but at a sustainable rate.  Right now, there is no cap, no rate of increase provided. So it is an unlimited entitlement. One of the suggestions from the House bill is to grow it each year at the rate of the consumer price index for medical costs; that is, medical inflation plus 1 percent. In other words, more money would be spent next year than this year. Even more money than next year will be spent the following year and so on, but it will be done at a sustainable rate.  Finally, we want to free the American people from the onerous ObamaCare mandates that require them to purchase insurance they don't want and can't afford. It shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that if you take the penalty away and don't force the American people to buy insurance they don't want, many of them--the younger, healthy ones, in particular--will decide not to buy it. That is called freedom of choice. That is not what ObamaCare did. ObamaCare forced people to buy something they didn't want and penalized them if they didn't. So many people will choose not to purchase it and decide to handle their healthcare in other ways--perhaps, at the emergency room, where under Federal law everybody who comes in as a medical emergency is entitled to be treated. It is not what I would tell my daughters. It is not what I would recommend for anybody, but if somebody wants to make that choice, it is certainly their right.  So I would just conclude by observing that it is shameful that Members on the other side of the aisle sit on their hands and do nothing to fix a law that continues to hurt American families. We know that regardless of who won the last election--whether it was Hillary Clinton or whether it was Donald Trump--we would have to take steps to address this failed law. So I would implore our Democratic friends to listen to their own stories, which some have recounted to me in confidence. So I won't repeat their names here, but they know this is a problem. They have heard from their constituents just like we have. So we would implore them to work with us to try to help us help our constituents. That is what I thought we were here for.  Americans are ready for healthcare reform that actually works, and it is our responsibility to do our very best to provide that to them, and that is what we intend to do.  I yield the floor.

5522,topic-id,829,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding me this time.  I also want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee here in the House of Representatives for moving this bill and helping to put this bill on the floor today in a bipartisan spirit. I would also like to acknowledge the majority and minority staff who have been very helpful to my office in this effort.  True, this is not the first time this measure has been considered. It passed the House during the last Congress, but the session ended before it could be moved forward in the Senate and into law. It was then, as it is now, a bipartisan bill. I would like to acknowledge all of the Members who are cosponsors. In substance, the bill would, as has been said, name a small parcel of the land in Washington, D.C., as Robert Emmet  Emmet was honored by the United States over 100 years ago when a statue of his likeness was donated to the Smithsonian That statue was welcomed by no less than President Woodrow Wilson himself.  After 50 years, the museum moved the statue to the land where it rests now, an unnamed parcel of land. The rededication committee counted many key leaders, including then-Speaker of the House John McCormack, Senator Everett Dirksen, and Senator Mike Even President Lyndon Johnson conveyed his pride in Emmet, stating: ``We Americans are proud to accord a place of honor here in the Nation's Capital to Robert Emmet, whose struggles and sacrifices bespeak the yearnings of mankind throughout the ages.''[[Page H5206]]  So it is clear that, on a bipartisan basis, Congress has long recognized the significance of this statue and its role in keeping alive not only the memory of Robert Emmet, but the ideals for which he stood.  At present, the statue of Emmet is the only statue on this small piece of land. This bill would take the next logical step by naming the land for It is a fitting tribute since, for generations, many American schoolchildren learned the words of Emmet's famous speech, which became known as the ``Speech from the Dock.''  I often wonder what Abraham Lincoln was taught as a boy. We all learned the Gettysburg Address, but, in fact, Abraham Lincoln could recite the ``Speech from the Dock'' by memory. It couldn't have been an easy speech for Emmet to give when one considers that he was expected to be executed after giving that speech.  Emmet had been an Irish independence leader who was deeply influenced by George Washington and the struggle for American independence. He was inspired by the American fight for democracy and self-determination. But after a failed effort to achieve independence, he was captured by the British, as were many others over centuries of struggle.  In his speech, Emmet said:       Let no man write my epitaph; for as no man who knows my      motives dare now vindicate them, let not prejudice or      ignorance asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and      peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, and my memory in      oblivion, until other times and other men can do justice to      my character. When my country takes her place among the      nations of the Earth, then, and not till then, let my      epitaph be written.  Shortly after giving that speech on September 20, 1803, Robert Emmet was hanged, drawn, and quartered. But Emmet's words lived on. In fact, groups named the Emmet Monument Association were founded in the United Their stated purpose was to build a burial monument to Emmet, one that would, of course, include an epitaph.  But because Emmet called for Ireland to be free before his epitaph was written, these groups were actually Fenian freedom organizations. They and other American groups were quite active in the United States for many years all across our They came before subsequent American roles in the struggle for Irish independence, and their presence played a major role in American political life for many decades.  So I respectfully urge the passage of this bill. It does not require spending funds, and it does not alter the park or the park system. It would basically include the name Robert Emmet Park to a small piece of land where the Emmet statue rests.  Many Americans, as well as our government, have long recognized the significance of the park and statue in keeping alive not just the history of Robert Emmet, but what he stood for. I am glad that continues today.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to once again thank the majority and the minority members of the Natural Resources Committee as well as their staffs. Their support made it possible for this measure to once again be on the floor today.  I would like to thank the hardworking staffs of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Park Service who have taken care of the Emmet statue and park for these many, many years.

These vital positions afforded him the opportunity to interact with and provide useful help to many in his local community. Bill developed a reputation for accuracy and customer service in his professional work.

5713,topic-id,539,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, I stand here today not just as a Member of Congress, but as a 27-year veteran of law enforcement and as a former police chief. As such, I am compelled to warn of the harm this bill, in its current form, will cause for our law enforcement agencies.  As a police chief, it was my responsibility to reduce crime and maintain livable neighborhoods; neighborhoods where families can live in peace, and enjoy local parks, community centers, restaurants, and shopping; neighborhoods where children can walk to school and play in their front yard and backyard without fear.  That is the kind of community that everyone in America deserves--one where they feel safe and secure.  H.3003 impedes on law enforcement's ability to effectively do its job. It will create an environment that will erode the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.  The local police are the first ones to respond. They are the thin blue line that stands between those who are in this country, who are trying to live in peace, and those that would do them harm. We want our neighbors--immigrants--to call the police to report crimes without fear or hesitation. When they do not, Mr.Speaker, our community is at the mercy of the criminals.  This does not make our communities more safe, yet that is what is at stake with the bill before us. Supporters of the bill claim that it has an exemption for victims and witnesses, but it is not a complete exemption.  Law enforcement officers investigate and interview witnesses. Their goal is to solve crimes, regardless of the immigration status of victims and witnesses, including victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.  I filed an amendment with the Rules Committee that would have exempted victims and witnesses from all of the bill's intrusive requirements. The Rules Committee blocked me from offering that amendment, but the bill, in its current form, would undermine law enforcement's ability to do its job, therefore, making our communities less safe.  Mr.Speaker, don't just take my word for it. The National Fraternal Order of Police stands against the bill. They represent over 330,000 law enforcement officers across the These officers are not responsible for creating laws, and eliminating Federal grant funding for political reasons impedes their ability to solve crimes.  As the FOP writes:       Withholding assistance to law enforcement agencies, which      have no policymaking rule, will hurt public safety efforts.  No one knows our communities better than the law enforcement officials sworn to protect their communities, which is why I have offered this motion which would exempt from the mandates and penalties in the bill those jurisdictions in which local law enforcement officials conclude that the mandates in this bill would endanger public safety.

It reflects the general consensus that Congress needs to step in to increase the autonomy of the Copyright Office, while still respecting its historic connection to the  This bill is an important first step in reforming the Copyright Office, but it can't be the only step. Through the hearings this committee has held over the past few years, we have learned how truly behind the curve the Copyright Office is.  I have worked with colleagues to find a bipartisan and consensus-driven set of reforms for the Copyright Office that would go beyond just this step in the process of selecting a Register, as have the chairman and Ranking Member Conyers and others on the committee.  It should be obvious that, to bring the Office into the 21st century, we need to do more than just change the selection process for the Register of It requires a massive overhaul of the IT system of the Office to create both a smoother process for creators seeking to protect their work and a system to enable the public to search the broad catalog of American creativity.  It requires increased accountability and consultation with both the creative and the user communities so that we ensure that the improvements and investments meet the needs of all those who rely on the Copyright Office to do its job well.  Establishing the Register of Copyrights with authority outside of the Library of Congress is not a reflection on the Librarian of It is a recognition of the reality that the Library and the Copyright Office have two fundamentally different missions, and they deserve to be empowered to pursue those missions. It is a recognition that success for both of these important entities means allowing them to maintain their historic connection but operate on a day-to-day basis with greater autonomy.  I am glad that the chairman has taken up this first step, and I look forward to working with him and Ranking Member Conyers and others on the next steps as well.  This piece of legislation supports strong copyright laws in our country. Having strong copyright means the ability for creators to be able to do their work. It means the creation of jobs.  The reason that this piece of legislation has such strong bipartisan support, the reason that it is supported by the thousands and thousands of people who earn their living every day as a result of the creativity that strong copyright laws protect, the reason they are supporting this legislation is because it is an important first step.  I am glad to participate in this debate, and I look forward to passing this bill, H.1695, in order to take that first step to promote stronger copyright, to provide the kind of autonomy that the Copyright Office needs so that it can move forward rapidly with modernization, and, most importantly, at this moment in our Nation's history, to ensure that we have the strongest possible avenue to create even more good jobs, well-paying jobs. That is what this legislation is about.  Mr.Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.

I also support the additional congressional oversight that will be necessary to ensure that the Register is accountable to the American people.  I agree with Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and my other colleagues on the Judiciary Committee that it is important that this bill move forward now. Making this improvement to the selection process for the next Register is an important first step before the committee advances broader Copyright Office modernization.  Even as we take this initial modest step to improve the appointment process, we can do more to strengthen the Copyright Office for today's economy. The Copyright Office's mission is to administer our Nation's copyright laws for the public good.  Securing Americans' rights to their intellectual property fosters creativity and benefits all Americans by advancing the arts and the sciences. In recent decades, this mission has been undermined by comically outdated information technology systems at the Copyright  My amendment makes a simple change to the underlying bill to ensure that technology is always a part of the equation when selecting a new Register of My amendment would require the Register of Copyrights to be capable of identifying and supervising a chief information officer.

One would assume that any qualified candidate for the Register of Copyrights has the skills and experiences necessary to guide the Office's technology office.  Why leave this vital aspect of the Copyright Office to assumptions?  Requiring the head of the Copyright Office to be ready to make this vital selection is not an overly burdensome obligation. For practical purposes, this capability is a necessity, and that is why my amendment would make technology an explicit part of the selection process.[[Page H2875]]  My amendment merely requires that the person who will serve as the Register be capable of supervising the Office's chief information officer. Whatever happens next as we move forward with modernization, IT systems of the Copyright Office must keep pace with new advancements in technology.

The American people overwhelmingly oppose sanctuary cities and believe that we should be doing more to enforce our Federal immigration laws.  The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act clarifies the authority of the Department of Homeland Security to order the detainment of illegal immigrants arrested for crimes until they can be processed for deportation.  It also cuts off certain Federal grants to cities and States that violate Federal immigration law. It is simple: If you don't comply with the Federal immigration law, you are not eligible for certain Federal grants.  It is time for us to enforce our immigration laws.  National attention was brought to the consequences of the sanctuary city policies by the death of Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had previously been convicted of seven felonies and deported five times. If the city of San Francisco had worked with the Federal Government to enforce the Federal immigration law instead of releasing this criminal, Kate Steinle would be alive today.  Our current system of laws failed Kate and all those who have died at the hands of convicted felons in this country illegally. The people who I am honored to represent do not understand why some American cities get to flout the law and not cooperate with Federal officials.

I believe he is well qualified and that he is sensitive to the fact that the FBI Director needs to be independent from this President and this  We are at a perilous moment in our history. Director Comey was fired by President Trump after he refused to pledge his loyalty to President Trump and after he publicly acknowledged that the FBI was investigating links between the Trump campaign and In the 109-year history of the FBI, only one FBI Director had ever been fired before. That director, William Sessions, was dismissed for serious ethical violations--not because the FBI was investigating the administration. Not since Watergate and the Saturday Night Massacre of October 20, 1973, has a President dismissed the head of an ongoing investigation into his administration.  From his own statements to NBC News and to Russian officials in the Oval Office, we know that President Trump wanted FBI Director Comey gone because of the Russia investigation. Let's be clear--Russia attacked our democracy last year. Almost every day, there is a new revelation about Russian contacts with the Trump campaign and administration. We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of what happened.  Fortunately, we now have a special counsel, Bob Mueller, who is investigating whether any crimes were committed. We also need to make sure no foreign adversary can interfere with our elections again. It is imperative that the next FBI Director allow Special Counsel Mueller to conduct his investigation without interference and that the FBI provide Mueller with access to the information and resources he needs.  It is also imperative that we have an FBI Director who will carry out the functions of the office with independence, integrity, and a firm commitment to the rule of law.  I appreciate that Mr.Wray shares my view that the FBI Director should avoid meeting with President Trump one-on-one and that the FBI Director would be well-advised to make contemporaneous written records of any substantive conversations with President  Mr.Wray also told me he has no reason to doubt the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in our election. I look forward to hearing more from Mr.Wray on this subject after he is confirmed and has reviewed the classified intelligence.  He also committed to work with me to address the scourge of illicit gun trafficking coming into the city of Chicago and to work with me on efforts to reduce youth exposure to violent trauma.  I asked Mr.Wray about the criminal division's involvement in a 2004 memo by the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel on torture. He said he was not involved in reviewing or approving this memo or any CIA interrogation techniques and that he agrees with former FBI Director Mueller that interrogation techniques such as painful stress positions and waterboarding are ``abusive under all circumstances.'' I appreciate his commitment to ensuring that FBI personnel never use or participate in abusive interrogation techniques. Mr.Wray also committed to me that, if confirmed, he would review the Senate Intelligence Committee's torture report, and I look forward to hearing his reflections on it.  Mr.Wray told me that he agrees with former Director Comey that Federal courts and Federa1 prosecutors are effective in prosecuting terrorists and obtaining valuable intelligence, which is clear when you compare our courts' record in convicting more than 500 terrorists since 9/11. In contrast, military commissions have only produced eight convictions, four of which have been overturned.  I appreciate Mr.Wray's commitment to ``seek to maintain and build trust with all Americans, including Muslim Americans.''  The next FBI Director will be under incredible scrutiny. We need an FBI Director who will face that pressure with integrity, independence, and a firm commitment to the rule of law. He may also have to stand up to this President if the interests of justice call for it. I believe Mr.Wray can do that, so I will support his nomination, and I hope I will be joined by my colleagues in closely monitoring the FBI to ensure Mr.Wray is effectively serving the American people and the rule of law.

5740,topic-id,2029,"Mr.President, I was necessarily absent for the vote on the motion to concur in the House message to accompany H.244.  On vote 121, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the motion to concur in the House message to accompany H.244.  I want to take a few minutes to acknowledge today's bipartisan passage of the Omnibus appropriations bill to fund the government through the end of the 2017 fiscal year. While I am disappointed that the bill's passage comes more than halfway through the fiscal year, the bill that was sent to the President today is the product of months of bipartisan work by the appropriations committees on both sides of Capitol Hill and represents how Congress should and can work together to provide the American people with critical investments that will create jobs and grow our Nation's economy. It is my hope that the bipartisan cooperation that made this bill possible will continue as Congress begins its work on appropriations for fiscal year 2018.  This bill includes critical investments in the middle class, our Nation's infrastructure, medical and scientific research, and our national security. I am proud to report that much of the funding in this bill will benefit my home State of Illinois, funding a wide variety of Illinois projects and priorities. Most importantly, it takes the threat of a government shutdown, which would have hurt our economy, off the table.  This bill fully rejects President Trump's proposed assault on medical research and instead includes a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, bringing the agency's funding level to $34.1 billion. This 6 percent increase in NIH funding matches the steady, predictable growth called for in legislation I have introduced over the past several years, the American Cures  Thanks to the NIH, we have cut the cancer death rate by 11 percent in women and 19 percent in men. HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence. Polio and smallpox are all but eradicated in this country. We are closer than ever to developing a universal influenza vaccine, to rebuilding parts of the human heart without needing to rely on transplants, and to finding new and effective therapies to delay the onset of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These medical breakthroughs will not happen without sustained, robust Federal funding for medical research supported by the  President Trump's disastrous budget proposals for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 would have slashed NIH's budget by nearly 20 percent, bringing NIH to its lowest funding level in 15 years. I am pleased that Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to protect the NIH, and I want to thank my colleague Senator Blunt, chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee, for his efforts to provide this vital funding. I will be working hard to ensure that NIH gets another significant funding increase for fiscal year 2018.  While I am encouraged that this bill includes $7.3 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, it is my hope that Congress will find a way to work together on a bipartisan basis to provide the CDC with even greater funding increases in the years to come.  The CDC has so many important responsibilities--from combating prescription drug abuse and fighting infectious disease outbreaks globally to preventing diabetes and protecting patients from antibiotic resistant superbugs. It is imperative that we provide this agency with the funding necessary to protect the public health.  Chairman Cole is a strong champion of CDC funding, and it is my hope that we can work together on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to plus-up overall CDC funding in the coming years.  I am pleased that harmful tobacco riders that would have severely undermined the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA's, ability to protect our Nation's youth from harmful, addictive tobacco products were not included in this bill. By omitting these terrible policy riders, the FDA can continue to regulate cigars and ecigarettes. I have said it before and I will say it again: I remain troubled that Big Tobacco continues to market and develop products aimed at getting youth addicted to tobacco.  This bill includes more than $1 billion to help combat our Nation's prescription opioid and heroin epidemic. This funding will be available to States and local communities to help with prevention, enforcement, treatment, and recovery. In 2015, more than 33,000 people in the United States died from an opioid overdose. To combat this epidemic, we must commit proper funding and resources toward solving the problem. This bill begins to do that.  I am proud that this bill increases funding to support critical transportation infrastructure projects in Illinois, despite President Trump's calls to eliminate funding for some of our most important transportation programs The capital investment grant program, which President Trump has proposed to eliminate, allows communities to compete for funding to build and improve subway, commuter rail, light rail, bus rapid transit projects through New Starts, Small Starts, and Core Capacity grants. This program was increased by $236 million in this bill to $2.4 billion with $100 million in Core Capacity funds specifically allocated to help fund the Chicago Transit Authority's modernization of the red and purple lines.  The Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, TIGER, grant program, which Illinois has relied on repeatedly to help fund transit, highway, and bridge projects throughout our State, was also protected from elimination in this bill. As a result of bipartisan support for this program, Illinois will now be able to compete for the $500 million in TIGER funds included in this bill.  Funding for federal highway and transit formula grants to States was increased in this bill to the full funding levels authorized in the 2015 bipartisan FAST As a result, $43.2 billion in highway funding, a $905 million increase, and $9.3 billion in transit funding, a $753 million increase, will be provided to States around the country to improve and maintain their roads and public transportation. Federal funding comprises 80 percent of the funds included in the Illinois Department of Transportation's multiyear highway improvement program.  This bill also includes critical funding to improve freight and passenger rail around the country. Nowhere is this more important than in Illinois, our Nation's rail hub. And $98 million in newly authorized rail safety and state of good repair grants was included in the bill, as well as $1.495 billion in nationwide funding for Amtrak, which commuters in both Chicago and downstate Illinois rely on every day to get to their schools and jobs. By providing adequate funding to Amtrak, more than 500 communities in 46 States across the country will continue to see improved passenger rail service.  The bill allocates $150 million in funding to provide rural areas with reliable air service through the Essential Air Service program. This funding supports critical air service in Quincy, Decatur, and Marion,  This agreement provides $1.3 billion to permanently extend the health benefits of more than 22,000 retired coal miners and widows, including nearly 2,000 in Coal mining is difficult and dangerous work, and these men and women who spent decades working in these mines risked their lives, health, and personal safety to ensure that our country had power. I heard[[Page S2769]]countless heartbreaking stories from Illinois coal miners and their families about the fear and uncertainty they were facing if they lose their health benefits. While this bill does not provide relief for the miners' failing pension fund, they can find comfort in knowing they will have health care for life.  As vice chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I am particularly proud of the bipartisan work that was done in the subcommittee to provide critical equipment and training for our troops, as well as funds to continue the fight against terrorist threats like I want to thank Chairman Thad Cochran and his staff for working with my staff and me on a bipartisan basis to finalize this section of the bill.  The bill provides a pay raise for military and civilian personnel, including those in It continues the subcommittee's track record of providing 5 percent real growth in lifesaving medical research and makes critical boosts in broader science and technology research.  It also provides important defense funding with particular impact in It supports well-paying manufacturing jobs by adding $110 million to extend the Humvee production line at Rock Island Arsenal and $979 million to extend the F-18 production line in Louis for downstate It also provides $140 million to stabilize rates at all three Army arsenals. Finally, it adds $9.9 million not requested in the budget to ensure National Guard cyber protection teams in Illinois and across the country are fully funded.  The omnibus bill does not include any funding for a wall on our southern border. Mexico will not pay for a border wall as the President promised during last year's campaign, and it is absurd to suggest that the American people should now be stuck with the bill. Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district covers 800 miles of the southwest border, has described the wall as ``the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border.'' Senate Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee estimate this wall will cost nearly $70 billion to build and $150 million a year to maintain. Even the Trump administration acknowledges the wall will cost $21.6 billion, not including maintenance.  While the Trump administration demanded $3 billion in additional funding for immigration enforcement, congressional Democrats succeeded in cutting this amount in half. I am pleased that the omnibus does not include any funding for President Trump's plan to triple the number of immigration agents. This unnecessary and prohibitively expensive goal would help the administration target 8 million undocumented immigrants who are now priorities for deportation under Trump administration policy. This ignores the reality that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants in our country are law-abiding individuals who make important economic contributions and have deep roots in our country.  Democrats also successfully resisted a rider that would have deprived communities around the country--including Chicago in my home State of Illinois--of billions of dollars in critical Federal funding if they refuse to take part in the Trump administration's mass deportation scheme.  The bill also includes important new oversight measures for U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention operations. While some additional detention funding may have been needed to address the surge in border crossings at the end of 2016, it appears that a reduction in ICE's detention budget will be appropriate in fiscal year 2018, given the sharp decline in border crossings this year.  I am disappointed that the bill includes a problematic rider that circumvents regular legislative order to permit the Trump administration to potentially double the number of foreign guest workers who could be admitted to the United States under the H-2B visa program without needed safeguards. I have long advocated for reform of the H-2B program, which in its current form harms both American and foreign workers. We should not increase the size of the H-2B program unless and until the program is reformed to protect workers from exploitation. I am particularly concerned that this rider gives the Trump administration the authority to determine how many additional H-2B visas will be issued since President Trump owns companies that have sought to import more than 900 H-2B guest workers, including 64 in fiscal year 2017 alone, while turning away hundreds of American workers. I will be closely monitoring the administration's implementation of this provision, which only permits additional visas to be issued if the Secretary of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Secretary of Labor, determines that the needs of American businesses cannot be met by qualified American workers.  While not perfect, this bill exemplifies what Congress can do if it puts politics aside to work together and come to a bipartisan consensus for the good of the American people. I support the passage of this Omnibus appropriations bill. While we now face a much shortened timeline to complete the appropriations process for the next fiscal year, I am hopeful that the bipartisan cooperation exemplified by this bill will continue.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-04-pt1-PgS2768-2.txt,326,NOMINATION OBJECTION,2017.0,4.0,August
5747,topic-id,421,"Mr.President, I am pleased that today the Senate is unanimously passing the Harry Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, known as the Forever GI Bill, which would make important improvements to the GI bill.  The bill removes time restrictions on using the GI bill, enabling future recipients to use benefits their entire lives as opposed to within the current 15-year timeline. It provides 100 percent GI bill eligibility to Purple Heart recipients. It also increases GI bill funding for Reservists, Guardsmen, dependents, surviving spouses, and surviving dependents.  While the bill includes many provisions I support, I also have ongoing concerns about institutions of higher education, especially for-profit colleges, which prey on veterans using GI bill benefits. I do not believe this bill goes far enough to provide the type of protections we owe to our servicemembers and the kind of institutional accountability that taxpayers deserve.  I am particularly concerned that the Forever GI Bill does not address the 90/10 loophole which incentivizes for-profit colleges to aggressively recruit and prey on veterans. Under current law, for-profit colleges are prohibited from receiving more than 90 percent of their revenue from Federal taxpayers, but due to a loophole in the law, such revenue does not count Department of Veterans Affairs GI bill or Department of Defense Tuition Assistance funding. This means that, by targeting veterans and servicemembers, for-profit colleges can actually receive 100 percent of their revenue directly from Federal taxpayers.  And many do. According to data released by the Department of Education in 2016, 193 institutions received more than 90 percent of their revenue from Federal taxpayers when Department of Education, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense funds were counted together.  I have long called for this loophole to be corrected and for the percentage of Federal revenue to be returned to the original 85 percent. I will soon reintroduce legislation, the Protecting Students and Taxpayers, POST, Act, to address this issue.  While not addressed in the Forever GI Bill we are passing today, I look forward to working with my colleagues--including Senator Carper who has authored another bill on this topic which I support--veterans service organizations, and others to consider this and other important accountability concerns.

It stood as a bulwark against communist aggression during the Cold Since the fall of the Soviet Union, it has played a critical role in building an integrated Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.[[Page H5212]]  At the heart of the alliance is the value enshrined in article 5: An attack on any ally is an attack on all allies. That commitment has been so strong across the decades, that the alliance never once invoked article 5 during the long standoff between East and West during the Cold  In fact, article 5 has only been invoked one time in NATO's history, when the ruins of the World Trade Center were smouldering in New York City as the world rallied around the United After the attacks of September 11, 2001, NATO allies did what we always knew they would: they said the attack on us was an attack on all of them as well. Since then, for nearly 16 years, American troops have fought and shed blood and died alongside men and women serving in the uniforms of our NATO allies.  Mr.Speaker, this isn't a commitment we as Americans can take lightly. While I am glad President Trump finally affirmed the commitment of the United States to article 5, I think it is important for Congress to do it as well.  The administration's hot-and-cold approach to the alliance caused a lot of unneeded heartburn for our allies and caused even the best of friends to question our commitment.  NATO is not a thing that can just be thrown in with everything else. It is very important to us, and we should allow our allies to meet their commitments laid out at the NATO summit in It is very important that we do that.

5621,topic-id,1043,"Mr.President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut for his remarks, and I would like to make a few remarks with respect to my position as ranking member on the Judiciary  As has been well described, shortly, we will vote on the nomination of Christopher Wray to be the next Director of the Federal Bureau of The Judiciary Committee has reviewed his record and held a full and complete hearing. His nomination was sent to the floor for consideration by a vote of 20 to 0--a very good vote. I am very satisfied that Mr.Wray has the qualifications and independence necessary to lead the FBI, so I will support Mr.Wray's nomination to be FBI  I wish to begin by saying just a few words about what I think, after 24 years in this place, is necessary in going forward.  First, it is really important that we have a strong FBI There can be no manipulation.  Second, Special Counsel Robert Mueller must be allowed to proceed with his investigation undisturbed.  Third, the FBI Director must manage and speak for the FBI on the basis of the Constitution and the laws of the United States, not at the dictates or requests or statements of any politically elected person in this country.  Fourth, the FBI Director must be independent from the White House and any political figure.  This is what the FBI and the American people need now.  As you and I know, the FBI is a critically important law enforcement agency. It must be able to move forward with its work and with its senior leadership in place. As I noted at Mr.Wray's hearing and just noted again, the FBI must be an independent law enforcement organization that is free from political influence.  During his hearing and in his written responses to followup questions, Mr.Wray stated that the FBI Director must maintain ``strict independence,'' and he committed to doing the job ``by the book'' and ``without regard to any partisan political influence.'' He also testified that his loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law, not to any ideology or any individual, including the He was believable to all of us in those statements.  Mr.Wray also testified that he would resist any efforts to interfere with FBI investigations and that he would not ``pull any punches.'' When asked what he would do if the President asked him to do something unlawful or unethical, Mr.Wray replied that he would first try to talk him out of it and that, if that failed, he would resign.  These commitments are important. Especially at this moment in history, we need an FBI Director who has the strength and fortitude to stand up and do what is right by the law when tested.  Mr.Wray has received bipartisan support from more than 100 former U.attorneys, who enthusiastically endorsed his nomination and stated their belief that Mr.Wray ``is a strong and effective leader with unassailable integrity, judgment and courage.'' According to this group, which included former Bush administration Justice Department officials like Larry Thompson and Ken Wainstein, as well as Eric Holder and Sally Yates, Mr.Wray will discharge the duties of FBI Director ``with honor, independence, and a tireless commitment to the rule of law.''  Earlier this year, when we considered other nominees for the Justice Department, I pointed out that we need leaders with steel spines, not weak knees. I believe that Mr.Wray will be such a leader.  The issue of torture is very important to me. On this issue, I was encouraged by Mr.Wray's acknowledgment that torture is wrong, unacceptable, illegal, and ineffective. He testified under oath that he did not participate in the drafting of the so-called torture memos that were issued by the Office of Legal Counsel some time ago. Mr.Wray has further testified that interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, painful stress positions, threatening detainees with dogs, forced nudity, and mock execution, are ``abusive under all circumstances.''  Importantly, for me, he has committed that the FBI, under his leadership, will never engage in such techniques or other forms of torture and that it will adhere to the policy of using the Informed Interrogation Approach as outlined in the Army Field Manual, which, thanks to John McCain, was added as a new law to last year's military authorization bill. Mr.Wray also committed to me that he will read the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's detention and interrogation program under a former administration.  On the issue of torture, as well as his independence and integrity, I take Mr.Wray at his word. As we discussed when Mr.Wray and I met in my office, I believe the next FBI Director's independence, integrity, and commitment to the rule of law, sadly, will likely be tested by this administration.  One early test may come in relation to the investigations being conducted by Special Counsel Mueller, this committee, and other committees in Mr.Wray has committed to supporting and protecting the investigation being conducted by Special Counsel Mueller, and I trust Mr.Wray will keep the Judiciary Committee of our House informed of any attempts to interfere with that investigation.  Now, he has a tough job ahead of him. The FBI is our premier law enforcement agency. It faces new criminal terrorism threats every day. I remember FBI Director Comey telling us the FBI had a counterterrorism investigation going on in virtually every State in the That was last year, but I assume many are still going on. On top of that, his predecessor was, as we all know, suddenly fired by the President for reasons that are questionable, and that is the subject of ongoing investigations. Lately, we have seen the President attempt to bully his own Attorney General, but even in the light of these challenging circumstances, I believe Mr.Wray is up to the task.  Based on his testimony and the commitments he has made to me and other members of our Judiciary Committee, I believe we on the committee will all vote to support his nomination, and, if he is confirmed, I commit to working with him to support the FBI, its mission, and the some 30-plus thousand FBI agents and employees who work every day to help protect our  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

5674,topic-id,370,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  While we have heard a good amount of inflammatory rhetoric, my remarks will speak solely to the facts.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of keeping America safe. In less than 2 years, over 8,000 undocumented immigrants, all subject to ICE detainment, were released because of local noncooperation policies.  Sixty-three percent of those illegal aliens had prior convictions or had been marked a public safety concern. After being released, they went on to be rearrested nearly 4,300 times, committing nearly 7,500 new offenses.  The facts are clear: States and local governments that do not comply with our immigration laws are putting American citizens at risk.  The U.Sentencing Commission found that, in 2014, 75 percent of all criminal defendants who were convicted and sentenced for Federal drug offenses were illegal immigrants. As of 2014, illegal immigrants made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population but committed over 10 percent of all murders.  Refusing to turn over criminal illegal immigrants poses a threat to our society, our safety, and our economy. American citizens pay nearly $19 million a day to house and care for the 450,000 criminal immigrants in jails and prisons who are all eligible for deportation.  When cities ignore Federal immigration laws, the results are often tragic.  The sheriff of Travis County, Texas, decided she would only turn over illegal aliens who have committed a narrow list of crimes. Her policy allowed one illegal alien to be released on bail despite sexually abusing his girlfriend's 9-year-old daughter.  A Cook County sheriff released an illegal immigrant after he served a brief domestic assault sentence, despite an ICE detainer. Soon after, he went on to kill a 15-year-old girl.  America wept as 32-year-old Kate Steinle was killed by a stray bullet. The illegal immigrant who shot that gun had seven previous felony convictions.

5460,topic-id,2769,"Mr.Speaker, the good news is this will probably be about 15--maybe 20--minutes, but it is a subject that is very, very important to all of us.  Actually, I am going to start on a slightly different subject, and that is what is wrong with this picture. A master sergeant at one of the air bases in the United States who has served for some almost 30 years, married the last 18 years to a young woman with three children. She attempted to return from deployment in the United Kingdom, had her passport removed, and she was deported to Her children are in the United She served for 18 years alongside her husband as he built and maintained America's fleet of spy planes.  What is wrong with this picture, America, that a wife of a servicemember who served for 18 years alongside her husband, a master sergeant, cannot come back into the United States because of an error that was made years and years ago?  We are going to follow this up. When our generals talk about taking care of their troops, may I suggest they also take care of their spouses. We have got work to do here.  But the subject matter for tonight is a little different, although that issue is much on my mind. Some of you may have seen this on the news a month and a half ago. That is the Oroville Dam spillway. A maintenance problem not paid attention to over the years resulted in a massive failure of the spillway and put 188,000 of my constituents and Mr.LaMalfa's constituents at risk.  This is the Interstate 5 bridge in Washington State connecting the United States to It collapsed. We could put up pictures of other bridges in Minnesota, et cetera. What we are talking about tonight is infrastructure, not just about infrastructure. The President wants a trillion-dollar infrastructure program, and we await his proposal. It would be good. We would put millions of Americans to work if we were to have that infrastructure program.  But there is more to it than just infrastructure. In the last 5-year transportation bill, I was successful in working with other Members here to insert into that bill that at least 70 percent of the value in our transit systems be American made. So tonight's subject matter is really about the failing infrastructure, but it is also about making it in  This is a subject matter that, for 7 years, I have talked about on the floor here: Make It In Our President wants to talk about this and, in fact, recently issued an executive order that says we ought to make it in He instructed his administration, as few as they are, to make sure that, in every effort, the Buy American provisions be honored. That has not been the case in the past. What we need to do is make certain that we make it in[[Page H2843]]America, that we spend the American taxpayer money on American-made products.  Let me give you an example of what it means when you actually do that--or maybe an example of what it means when you don't do that.  Now, Californians take great pride in their We have the Golden Gate We have We have the great industries of southern California--the entertainment, the movie industries and the rest--and we have San We also have major policy problems. Make It In America: I want to give you two different examples.  The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, now completed. It is a beautiful bridge, and it replaces an old bridge that was built in the 1930s that was seriously deficient. However, it was made with a large, large input of Chinese steel. It actually came in $3.9 billion over budget, but we did provide some 3,000 jobs in China, and we allowed the Chinese steel industry to build a new steel mill to be able to produce the very high-quality steel that was supposed to be in the bridge. However, the steel that they shipped wasn't exactly high quality, the welds weren't exactly good, and we wound up seriously over budget for that as well as other reasons.  So maybe Californians don't always have the position of taking pride in all that is done. This I take no pride in. This was a serious mistake by the State government, a serious mistake by the agency that ran and put this bridge into process. What would it mean if, for example, instead of trying to save 10 percent on the cost of steel, our Californian colleagues would have actually said, well, maybe those jobs should be in America and that new steel mill should be in America? Could have, should have, but it didn't happen.  Now, on the other side of the continent we have New Now, we Californians don't much like to talk about New York but, hey, here is something to talk about. Here is something that really worked out well.  It seems as though New York wanted a new bridge over the Hudson River, the new Tappan Zee Bridge in New York, and they made a decision: it was going to be built with American steel. Wow, what a noble thought. And all of that from New York, as opposed to California that said: Oh, let's go with  So what happened? The steel arrived. The steel was quality. The bridge was built, $3.9 billion, on budget, on time, and there was some 7,700-plus American jobs. It makes a difference when you make it in America and when your tax dollars--State, local, and Federal--are spent on American-made equipment and supplies: American steel, American jobs, an American bridge.  The Oakland Bay Bridge, San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge: Chinese steel, Chinese jobs, over budget, bad quality, and the story is not a good one.  So the issue of the day is: Buy Yes, indeed, we should and we could. Let me give you an example of what happens.  My Republican colleagues like to take on the bailout. They like to talk about how bad the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was. It wasn't bad. It was actually very good. It could have been better if there had been more infrastructure and more Buy American, but there is one provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that really made a difference.                              {time}  1945  It was for the Amtrak systems. Basically, the systems here on the East Coast, the electrification. New locomotives for the East Coast corridor. Some $700 million. I think it was 80, maybe 90 new locomotives to be built.  American companies looked at this and said: We don't build locomotives anymore. We certainly don't build diesel electric or all electric locomotives, so we will let this one go.  Well, there is that German company called  They said: $700 million, 80 or so locomotives.  We have a manufacturing plant out in Sacramento, We make light rail cars out there and transit cars.  You say: 100 percent American made? Everything from the electric motors to the brakes, to the wheels, to the paint, 100 percent American made?  The German company said: We can do that. We could make it in  And they did. The last train has been produced. This is the first train.  Don't tell me we can't make it in Don't tell me that our American taxpayer dollars should be spent in China, Japan, or someplace else. Build it in Buy And we will put thousands--in fact, tens of thousands of people to work.  I want to give you another example. The American maritime industry has been in a very steep decline for the last 4 decades. Following World War II, we had over 1,500 American ships. A decade ago we had over 200 ships on the ocean. Our shipyards were making LNG tankers 20 years ago, and they were American flagged. There were American mariners on those ships. Today, we have less than 80 American flagships, and we don't make large commercial ships in the United States, except on rare occasions.  The maritime industry is absolutely critical for national defense.  How do you think our men, women, and equipment get to the troubled spots of the world?  You don't fly the M1 tank on an airplane. You put it on a ship. You put the trucks on a ship. You put the artillery on a ship.  But where are the American ships?  Oh, I know. We will call China and they will deliver our goods to the South China I doubt it. I don't think so.  If you are concerned about national security, you had better be thinking about the American maritime industry.  Are you thinking about it? Are you thinking what is really possible if we were to write 16 lines of law this year?  It has to do with the export of two strategic national resources: oil and natural gas.  Now operating in Texas is an LNG--liquefied natural gas--facility exporting American natural gas. They liquefy it, put it on a ship, and off it goes to somewhere in the world like That is okay.  It will take 100 or more LNG tank ships to meet the full export potential of that one facility when it comes fully on line. There are five other LNG export facilities licensed in the United States, one which is being built near the Washington Capital, in  Perhaps 250--225 new liquefied natural gas tank ships are going to be needed in the next decade or so.  Are any of them to be built in America?  No, nada, none, unless we pass a piece of legislation that we call energizing American shipbuilding. There are 16 lines of law that say it is a strategic national security issue to be able to build commercial ships in the United The export of an equally strategic national asset--LNG and crude oil--should be on those ships.  This is not new policy. When the North Slope of Alaska opened nearly 50 years ago, it was American steel in the pipeline, it was American ships that were taking that crude oil out of Valdez, Over the years, we kind of forgot about that and the law disappeared. Now it is not American ships and not American sailors.  We can do this. The energizing American shipbuilding piece of legislation will be introduced this week. We have some 20 or more coauthors. We want to follow what our President says about: Buy American, build it in  How many jobs are we talking about?  Well over a couple hundred thousand in the shipyards. And if that bill passes as we have written it, that would require that the engines, the compressors, the pumps, the anchors, and the electronic equipment be American made also. We are talking about a whole supply train throughout most every State and businesses that are as reflective as the American manufacturing sector used to be.  There is enormous potential in public policy that actually puts in place laws that build upon the strength of America, strengthening our national security, and at the same time strengthening a critical industry in America: the shipbuilding industry.  And, of course, American ships will be American flagged with American mariners.  This is a good thing for This is a very good thing for our national security. It is a very good thing for jobs.[[Page H2844]]  For our taxpayers, what does it mean?  Well, these are commercial ships, so no direct. However, if the American shipyards are able to reconstitute their ability to build large commercial vessels, they will also be able to compete for the naval vessels and begin to give America naval construction competition in the shipyards. It is not a bad thing to have competition. That is one.  Number two. For more than 3 decades we have had the School Lunch Program, which is also the School Breakfast Program, which is a critical program that provides nutritious meals to students in our schools who would not otherwise be fed.  Now, there is one genius here that said: Well, hungry kids can learn.  Really?  I know a lot of my colleagues that can't think if they are hungry. At least that is a good reason to assume what they are actually talking about in policy. But a hungry kid will not be able to learn. They are thinking about their stomach. They are thinking about that ache. We have had the school nutrition program for some time--lunches and breakfasts.  The law says that the food should be produced in America, but the practice is different. The practice is: We will buy wherever we can.  Now, I will give you an example. A school district in Sacramento, California, whose name actually happens to be similar to the city, decided that they should purchase Chinese peaches in big cans. Yet, within 10 miles of that school there were three packing plants that produced California-grown peaches.  It turns out that the Chinese peaches have some label on it that says organic. Now, there is a label you can believe. It turns out that they are really not too organic at all.  So in terms of quality, in terms of food that is produced domestically and locally, the Buy American provisions that have been in the law for the School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program need to be observed by school districts across this  So we have introduced another bill called American Food for American It doesn't change the basic requirement that the food be American-produced food by our farmers and by our packing houses and by the facilities that take that food and bring that nutritious meal to the schools. It simply says that school districts can no longer ignore the law. That they are going to be required to follow the law, to report and to seek a waiver if the cost of domestically-grown peaches, peaches grown within 10 miles of the Sacramento school district, are too expensive compared to peaches that are imported from California or some other part of the world. They could seek a waiver. They could prove that those peaches are nutritious and that they are not somehow contaminated.  We have done the studies, and there is some question about whether there is or is not contamination. But I know that in California, we have the strictest laws concerning the quality of the food, both on the tree and in the can.  I want our students to have the best. If the cost is way out of line, a waiver can be sought and granted. But no more willy-nilly not paying attention to the law, which says: American food for American schools. And now there will be somebody watching to make sure that that law is followed.  I would also add that a similar bill is now being pushed through the California legislature.  So, once again, it comes back to this issue: Do you want to grow the American economy? Do you want to use our taxpayer money to support American jobs and American manufacturing? Or are you willing to just not worry about it and let the jobs go wherever they may?  I am still trying to find who it was; maybe one of my colleagues here in the House of Representatives or a Senator, but quite probably some staff person that when they wrote the American Recovery Act, they said: Great, we need new electric locomotives on the Eastern corridor. And they said: 100 percent American made. Hundreds of jobs in Sacramento building these. And the electric engines, the brakes, the steel, all the rest of it, all gathered from America, 100 percent American made.  So don't let anybody tell you it can't be done. If we write the law, it will be done. Those LNG ships, those oil tankers that will take our crude oil and ship it around the world, those can be built in America, in the American shipyards with American welders and plumbers and boilermakers and naval architects and American businesses providing the jobs here in the United It is possible.  But, colleagues, it takes a law. That is our business: to pass laws that support the American jobs, that support American businesses, just like the American Recovery Sixteen lines of law. The export of crude oil, the export of LNG, starting with 5 percent in the first year, and then building up to 25 percent over the next 7 years. American ships will be built, American sailors will be on it, and American jobs will be here in the United We can do it if we want to.

5408,topic-id,849,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Intellectual property is a critical and growing part of our Nation's economy, and the Register of Copyrights has a crucial role in the numerous copyright policy issues that impact it.  Four years ago, the Judiciary Committee began considering how to modernize our Nation's copyright laws, including how the Copyright Office is structured. Making the Register position subject to the nomination and consent process with potential candidates identified by a congressional selection panel was among the many issues considered by the House Judiciary  Because the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office, who has an equally important voice on patent and trademark issues, is already subject to the nomination and consent process, it provided a precedent for this approach.  However, unlike the Patent and Trademark Office, the Copyright Office is part of the legislative branch. Thus, it is appropriate to also follow the precedent set for other legislative branch agencies, which gives Congress a greater say in selecting candidates for the heads of legislative branch entities to ensure those agencies are more accountable to  Because the Register position is now vacant, filled on an acting capacity by a well-regarded Acting Register, Ranking Member Conyers and I introduced this bipartisan legislation to update the Register selection process. To mirror a recent change to the Librarian of Congress position that is now subject to a 10-year term limit, the legislation also makes the Register of Copyrights position subject to a 10-year term limit.  The selection panel would be bipartisan and would consist of leaders of the majorities and minorities of the House and Senate, and would also include the Librarian of  In the past, the authority of the Register of Copyrights to issue rulemakings has not been challenged in the courts because the Register is not subject to the nomination and consent process.                              {time}  1400  This legislation would remedy that question, once and for all. H.1695 was reported by the House Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote of 27-1. In addition to strong support from traditional copyright groups, such as the Copyright Alliance, and the publishing, movie, music, and software industries, the bill has been supported by a wide range of diverse groups, such as the American Conservative Union; the AFL-CIO; Heritage Foundation scholars; the Directors Guild of America; the U.Chamber of Commerce; MANA, A National Latina Organization; Americans for Tax Reform; and the Council for Citizens Against Government  With such strong support from a wide range of over 70 groups and a vacancy at the Register of Copyrights that needs to be quickly filled under the new process created by this legislation, I urge my colleagues to support H.1695.

5654,topic-id,892,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of the No Sanctuary for Criminals This simple, straightforward bill combats dangerous sanctuary policies that permit criminals to go free. We are all too familiar with how sanctuary policies have devastated families across the United States, and today we are taking action to prevent these senseless tragedies and save American lives.  For years, the lack of immigration enforcement and spread of sanctuary policies have cost too many lives. The Obama administration encouraged or, at the very least, turned a blind eye to jurisdictions nationwide that implemented sanctuary policies designed to prevent U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement from being able to effectively enforce Federal law. Foolhardy jurisdictions continue to pass legislation and implement policies aimed at stymieing and maligning Immigration and Customs  Earlier this year, a Baltimore City Council member introduced a resolution calling on ICE to arrest only those posing a ``serious risk.'' In discussing this initiative, the council member likened ICE officers to Nazis several times. Such rhetoric is reprehensible, creating a moral equivalent between genocide and a nation exercising a fundamental right and obligation of sovereignty.  In a deeply troubling move on the other coast, San Francisco announced that it would no longer participate in the Joint Terrorism Task Force because of concerns that the task force's duties may coincide with immigration enforcement.  Sanctuary policies often focus on flouting ICE detainers, notices issued by ICE to allow it to take custody of aliens in law enforcement custody in order to initiate removal proceedings.  These irresponsible policies have led to a sharp drop in ICE's intake of aliens from criminal detention facilities, which forces ICE agents to engage in the far more time-consuming and dangerous task of picking them up on the streets. This, among other factors, led to a drop in the number of criminal aliens removed from the interior of the United States from almost 87,000 in fiscal year 2014 to approximately 63,500 the following 2 fiscal years.  We must discourage, not encourage, sanctuary policies and practices. H.3003 addresses sanctuary policies and also takes great strides in clarifying Federal immigration detainer policy.  Since the 1990s, Federal law has barred jurisdictions from restricting communication with Federal immigration officials regarding immigration status; however, this provision has never been enforced. H.3003 amends current law and expands this prohibition against impeding Federal law enforcement. Instead of merely focussing on communication, the bill ensures that no jurisdiction may restrict assistance or compliance with immigration enforcement.  To be clear, this bill imposes no affirmative duty to act on the part of any jurisdiction. Should a jurisdiction not comply with this provision, the jurisdiction will not be eligible for certain grant programs administered by the Department of Justice and Homeland Eligibility for many of these grant programs is already predicated on compliance with this provision in the Immigration and Nationality  This section is also in line with a recent memo by Attorney General Sessions outlining compliance with this provision as the single factor that the Justice Department will use in identifying sanctuary jurisdictions.  Regarding detainer policy, Congress has long heard that jurisdictions will not comply with ICE requests to hold individuals due to a lack of probable cause inherent in the detainer. I am pleased that H.3003 provides the probable cause standards necessary to ensure that ICE only places detainers on aliens for whom they have probable cause and are deportable.  In addition, the bill mandates that ICE must take custody of the subject of a detainer within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays. Jurisdictions who comply in good faith with detainer requests will be immune from liability associated with that detainer, and if such an action does arise, the U.Government will substitute itself in as the defendant. This ensures that jurisdictions do not go bankrupt defending against never-ending litigation. And in those jurisdictions that refuse to honor a detainer resulting in an alien committing a crime, the victim or victim's family will be provided with the opportunity to bring a lawsuit against that jurisdiction.  The third section of H.3003 is named for Sarah Root and Grant Ronnebeck, two young people whose lives were suddenly taken by criminal aliens who remain at large today. This section was originally introduced as separate bills by Judiciary Committee[[Page H5319]]members Steve King and Andy Biggs, who worked tirelessly to bring these tragic cases to the attention of the committee and the  This section provides that aliens who are arrested or charged with serious crimes that result in death or serious bodily injury of another must be held without bond during the pendency of their removal proceedings.                              {time}  1415  In addition, aliens convicted of even one drunk driving offense will also be ineligible for bond during their removal proceedings. The latter would have prevented the August 2010 death of Sister Denise Mosier, a Catholic nun in Virginia, at the hands of a drunk driving illegal alien who was released from ICE custody on bond. These classes of individuals present a clear and present danger to society and should not be permitted to roam our communities during the pendency of their removal hearings.  The commonsense provisions of H.3003 will provide better immigration enforcement and the peace of mind that no criminal will be provided sanctuary from our immigration laws.

5709,topic-id,382,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  First, let me be clear: the only law enforcement agencies that risk losing any Federal grants because of this legislation are those agencies that, without any outside compulsion, deliberately choose to violate Federal law by outright prohibiting their law enforcement officers from voluntarily communicating with ICE and cooperating with it in the enforcement of Federal law.[[Page H5329]]  Second, let me also be clear that this bill does not require State and local law enforcement agencies to comply with ICE detainers, and it does not seek to cut off any Federal grants to jurisdictions that choose not to comply.  Finally, it is a long-settled principle of constitutional law. And let me remind you that all of these law enforcement officers vowed to defend the Constitution, and the Constitution grants supremacy to Federal immigration law.  When there is a conflict with Federal immigration law, State laws that are in conflict are invalid, preempted by Federal law under the 10th Under the 10th Amendment, State and local law enforcement agencies have no obligation to comply with unconstitutional provisions of State or local law that asks them to violate title 8, United States Code, section 1373.  Then, again, getting back to the amazing news that we have, the city of San Francisco has just agreed to pay $190,000 to an illegal alien because the San Francisco sheriff complied with an ICE detainer and turned the alien over to ICE, apparently in violation of San Francisco policy. That individual, under Federal law, because he was the victim of a crime, will be eligible to apply for a U visa.  Respect for the rule of law is the way to keep communities safe. Respect for the rule of law is the way to make sure that people like Kate Steinle are not murdered in the city of San Francisco, as we have heard of other murders all during the debate today, by people who are unlawfully present in the United Therefore, they are all preventable crimes.  Law enforcement in this country needs to cooperate. Most law enforcement officers want that to be done. Let's support them, let's support this legislation, and make sure that the rule of law is upheld.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

5715,topic-id,506,"Mr.Speaker, the gentlewoman is quite correct: everyone deserves to feel safe.  Kate Steinle deserved to feel safe when she was walking down the pier with her father in San Francisco, when she was killed.  Not enacting this legislation endangers public safety, not the opposite, as those on the other side have argued.  How would you trust local government officials, who have instructed their law enforcement officers to not cooperate with Federal law enforcement officers to take dangerous criminals off of our streets, when this motion to recommit would say: ``Oh, they will have to certify that such compliance would endanger public safety and then the law wouldn't apply?''[[Page H5333]]  It is circular reasoning.  The nonenforcement of immigration laws has led to the bolstering of sanctuary jurisdiction policies in communities throughout the United These policies hamper the enforcement of Federal law and do nothing to truly promote trust between law enforcement and U.citizens.  This bill provides a commonsense approach to fixing the damage caused by sanctuary policies without mandating any affirmative duty. In order to be in compliance with section 1373 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended in this bill, States and localities have no affirmative duties to act. They have no obligations to cooperate or communicate, or even engage with U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement at any level.                              {time}  1530  Instead, they simply may not affirmatively restrict a government entity, including law enforcement, from cooperating or communicating with  So I am shocked that so many on the other side of the aisle view compliance with this provision as a condition for eligibility for certain grant programs as outlandish. This is not a novel concept. And compliance with section 1373 is already a condition of eligibility for these grant programs.  As for detainers, H.3003 creates the probable cause standard that so many have argued was lacking for so long. Once enacted, States and localities can look to Federal law to receive clarification on what probable cause standard is employed before a detainer request is placed.  To further aid jurisdictions, the threat of expensive and time-consuming frivolous litigation is abated by providing immunity for jurisdictions that exercise good faith in honoring a detainer.  Finally, this bill ensures that dangerous criminal aliens convicted of drunk driving or not yet convicted of very serious crimes are prevented from freely walking the streets of our communities during their removal hearings. This bill is a strong first step in ensuring that our immigration laws are enforced.  I urge my colleagues to vote down this motion to recommit, to vote for the base bill, and to send a message that sanctuary policies will not be tolerated so that the rule of law will prevail.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit.  There was no objection.

Mr.Wray has an accomplished record as a lawyer. He was a Federal prosecutor for a number of years and went on to serve in various senior roles at the Department of Justice, including leading the criminal division at the  Mr.Wray earned the Department's highest award for public service and leadership. His prior record of service demonstrates his competence in leading within the Federal Government and demonstrates he will be able to lead effectively at the He has shown he has the expertise needed to address the wide range of policy issues currently facing the  Of course, my colleagues and I asked Mr.Wray about his positions on many such issues during his hearing. He answered those questions very well, but the most important thing we wanted to learn from him had to do with his view of the job and where his loyalties lie.[[Page S4648]]  As all of us in this body know, when we take the oath of office, we affirm that we will support and defend the Constitution of the United We don't pledge support to any member of the government or even to a political party. We pledge our loyalty to the Constitution and to the rule of law.  Many Members asked Mr.Wray very pointed questions about loyalty during his hearing. I was impressed with his plainspoken, candid answers, and I take him at his word when he says that his ``loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law'' and when he says that he will ``never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice. Period--full stop.''  Now, if he is confirmed, Mr.Wray will step into this role at a crucial moment, not only in the history of the FBI but in the history of this As we know, multiple investigations are underway, including by this body, to clearly lay out Russia's activities that attempted to influence the 2016 election. These are important and sensitive investigations, and they cannot be inappropriately influenced by people in powerful positions in any way whatsoever. This applies to the FBI  Mr.Wray was asked very directly what he would do if presented with the opportunity to influence these investigations in any way. He told the committee that he will not condone tampering with investigations and that he would resign rather than be unduly influenced in any manner.  Mr.Wray's record of service and his reputation give us no reason to doubt him. He was forthright when he was asked specific questions about the events leading up to his being offered the job of FBI Director by President He made no loyalty pledges then, and I expect him never to make such a pledge moving forward.  Mr.Wray will also face the challenge of running the FBI, motivating its staff, and ensuring that the FBI operates effectively and efficiently. My colleagues know I haven't been pleased with how the FBI has--or has not--replied to the Judiciary Committee's inquiries and requests for information, and this doesn't apply just to this Senator but all the Senators on the committee, and it doesn't matter whether Republican or They are entitled to ask questions, and they ought to get answers. That is the constitutional responsibility of oversight that all 535 Members of Congress have.  Not being satisfied with the FBI in the past, I asked Mr.Wray directly about the FBI's responsiveness to Members of this body. He promised me, and in turn other Members of this body, that he will prioritize responsiveness and transparency to this body. This will allow us to do our vitally important job of oversight over the Nation's top law enforcement agency. I am glad Mr.Wray is ready to work in partnership with the Senate to help us perform our role very effectively.  I expect to see improved responsiveness from Mr.Wray to our letters and to see enhanced protection for whistleblowers within the FBI who come forward--and they do that at great risk to themselves--to let this body know where abuses of power are going unnoticed. We owe it to these brave people we call whistleblowers, but they are patriotic people, to give them the protection they deserve. The culture for giving this protection starts at the top with the new FBI Director, Mr. As I mentioned before, Mr.Wray was voted out of our committee unanimously.

We can't ask for Mr.Wray to do anything more than that.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Christopher Wray as the next Director of the  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

By putting these principles in practice as chairman of the Finance Committee, I was able to pass more than 40 bills into law during the last Congress, and by working with my friends across the aisle over many decades of public service, I have been able to pass more legislation than anyone alive today.  I draw from these personal experiences to illustrate a simple point: In an era of endless gridlock and increasing polarization, there is no alternative to civility and healthy debate.

I know because I have seen the Senate at its best, and I have seen the Senate when regular order was the norm, when legislation was debated in committee, and when Members worked constructively with one another for the good of the country. I have seen the Senate when it truly lived up to its reputation as the world's greatest deliberative body.  I believe we can again see this body at its best, but restoring the Senate to its proper function requires real change on all sides. It begins by recognizing that all of us here, Democrats and Republicans alike, are to some extent culpable for the current dysfunction. If we want to break free of the current gridlock and if we want to show the American people we are serious about legislating, then we have to be honest with ourselves, and we have to recognize that laying all the blame on the other side is as counterproductive as it is disingenuous.  Most importantly, we must be willing to work in good faith with Members of the opposite party. All too often, we miss the opportunity to effect meaningful change by hiding behind partisan differences. We must take the opposite course by renewing our efforts to reach across the aisle to overcome division and forge consensus. There is no better template for effective, bipartisan legislating.  This is the model I have followed for decades for the betterment of Utah and the Nation, and it is the model I have followed most recently in working with my dear friend Senator Coons to introduce the International Communications Privacy Act, or what we affectionately refer to as  ICPA is more than just a commonsense proposal that updates law enforcement for the modern age; it is a symbol of what our two parties can accomplish when we lay aside petty differences and come together for the good of our In crafting this proposal, Senator Coons and I took great pains to strengthen international data privacy protections while also enhancing law enforcement's ability to access data across borders.  This issue has long been a priority of mine. I have spoken about it at length both here on the Senate floor and in other venues and have introduced legislation on the subject over multiple Most recently, I came to the Senate floor to explain how the rise of cloud and remote network computing has transformed the way we store data and to describe the implications of that transformation for our data privacy laws.  Until relatively recently, most electronic data was housed in personal computers or on servers located in offices or homes. This meant that in order to access data, a person could simply go to the relevant location and retrieve it. That is no longer the case. Nowadays, much of our data is stored not on home or office computers but in the cloud--a network of remote servers spread throughout the world that allows us to access data from literally anywhere. Data pertaining to a single individual or even to a single document may be stored at multiple sites spread across countries or even continents.  This has profound implications for data privacy. To begin with, our privacy laws require government officials to obtain a warrant before they can access many types of electronic communications. Warrants, however, traditionally have stopped at the warrant's edge. This means that if a law enforcement agent is investigating a crime here in the United States but a key piece of information is stored on a remote server outside the United States, the agent may have significant difficulty obtaining the information. Without a warrant or the ability to get a warrant, the agent may have to use diplomatic channels to obtain the information--a process that can be extremely slow and cumbersome.[[Page S4641]]  Our privacy laws also prohibit disclosure to foreign entities. This means that when a foreign government is investigating a crime within its borders and a key piece of information is stored in the United States, the foreign government must likewise work through diplomatic channels to obtain the information.  The growing prevalence of cloud and remote network computing has put law enforcement into increasing conflict with these sorts of restrictions. Crime knows no borders. A child pornographer in Bangalore may post photos of an American victim on a British server which can be accessed worldwide. A U.official investigating the crime may need information stored on the British server in order to track down the culprit. If the server was in the United States, the official could simply issue a warrant. But that tool isn't available in this scenario because the server is overseas.  Moreover, the United Kingdom may have a statute, similar to our own law, that prohibits British service providers from disclosing communications to foreign entities. Diplomatic channels exist for sharing such data, but these channels are exceptionally slow and can take months or even years to process requests. In the meantime, crimes go unpunished and perpetrators disappear.  This state of affairs is simply not tenable. We cannot allow outdated laws to hamstring law enforcement efforts in this way. At the same time, we must adequately protect Americans' privacy against unwarranted government intrusion.  Some have suggested that the answer is to simply extend the reach of U.warrants worldwide. This, however, is not a viable solution as foreign disclosure laws can and do conflict with U.laws. Extending the reach of U.warrants without reasonable limits would thus place service providers in the impossible position of having to choose which country's laws to violate--ours or the foreign jurisdiction's.  What we need is a sensible regime with clear rules that determine access based on factors that matter to the person whose data is being sought. At the same time, we need to take proper account of the laws and interests of other countries, especially our allies.  We ought to avoid, wherever possible, trampling on other nations' sovereignty or ignoring their own citizens' legitimate claims to privacy. Accordingly, ICPA sets clear rules for when and how U.law enforcement can access electronic data based on the location and nationality of the person whose data is being sought.  Here is what the bill says:  If a person is a U.national or is located in the United States, law enforcement may compel disclosure, regardless of where the data is stored, provided the data is accessible from a U.computer and law enforcement uses proper criminal process.  If a person is not a U.national, however, and is not located in the United States, then different rules apply. These rules are founded on three principles: respect, comity, and reciprocity.  First, respect. If U.law enforcement wishes to access data belonging to a non-U.national located outside the United States, then U.law enforcement must first notify the person's country of citizenship and provide that country an opportunity to object. This shows respect to the other country and gives it an opportunity to assert the privacy rights of its citizen.  Second, comity. If, after receiving notice, the other country lodges an objection, a U.court undertakes a comity analysis to determine whose interests should rightly prevail--the U.interests in obtaining the data or the foreign interests in safeguarding the privacy of its citizen. As a part of this analysis, the court considers such factors as the location of the crime, the seriousness of the crime, the importance of the data to the investigation, and the possibility of accessing the data through other means.  Third, reciprocity. In order to receive notice and an opportunity to object, the other country must provide reciprocal rights to the United This ensures that the U.provides its own citizens an equal or greater level of protection against foreign requests for data. It also offers incentives to foreign governments to properly safeguard the data of U.citizens within their borders.  Up to this point, I have been focusing on requests by U.law enforcement for data stored outside the United States, but there is another side to the problem, and that is what happens when foreign law enforcement requests data stored inside the United  As I have mentioned, our privacy laws prohibit disclosure to foreign entities. Suppose a British subject committed a crime in Britain but data relevant to the investigation is stored in the United Even if British law provides for extraterritorial process, a UK official investigating the crime will be unable to obtain the data because U.law prevents disclosure to foreign officials. As with U.requests for data in other countries, diplomatic channels exist for sharing such data, but these channels are slow and extremely cumbersome.  Accordingly, for the past several months, I have been working with Senator Graham and others to find a solution for this second part of the problem. Senator Graham, together with Senator Whitehouse, convened a hearing in May of this year that I believe highlighted the need for action. I have also met with Ambassadors and other high-ranking foreign officials who have impressed upon me the challenges they are facing under existing U.law.  I think we need to address this second side of the problem--foreign requests for data in the United States--as well. We need to address it in conjunction with the first side--U.requests for data in other countries.  It will not do to give foreign authorities readier access to data stored in the United States without likewise clarifying U.law enforcement's ability to obtain data stored abroad. Similarly, it is inconceivable to me that we would open our doors to foreign law enforcement requests while telling U.law enforcement that data in other countries is off-limits. Surely, we should not prefer foreign criminal investigations over domestic ones.  I believe these two issues--ICPA and the bilateral United States-United Kingdom agreement--are inextricably linked. I have worked in good faith with Senator Graham and with Senator Whitehouse to find a path forward on these issues. It is my firm belief that we need to move these two issues together. Everyone has a vested interest in privacy, and everyone has a vested interest in bringing criminals to justice. We are going to work together on this.  In closing, I would emphasize one additional point. The question of whether, when, and under what circumstances the United States should authorize law enforcement access to data stored abroad is a question for There have been suggestions in some corridors that this is a question for the courts to decide. I emphatically reject that question. This is a policy question for  We should not defer to the courts' interpretation of a statute that was passed 30 years ago with no thought or comprehension of the situation we face today. Subject to constitutional constraints, it is Congress's job to set the bounds of government's investigatory powers. We decide what government officials can and cannot do. We should not pass the buck to the judiciary merely because this is a complicated issue. We shouldn't do that.  The International Communications Privacy Act provides critical guidance to law enforcement while respecting the laws and interests of our allies. It brings a set of simple, straightforward rules to a chaotic area of the law and creates an example for other countries to follow. It is a balanced approach and a smart approach, and it deserves this body's full-throated support.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Today I rise in support of H.1366, the U.Territories Investor Protection Act, and I thank my friend and colleague from New York for her exceptional efforts in designing and bringing this bill to us today.  H.1366 repeals a provision in the Investment Company Act of 1940 that exempts investment companies in Puerto Rico, Guam, and other U.territories from registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, so that they have to play by the same rules as their mainland counterparts.  When Congress first enacted the Investment Company Act in the 1940s, a nonregistration exemption for investment companies in the noncontiguous territories made a lot of sense as it was extremely expensive and difficult for the SEC to send staff to travel to these territories and inspect the local companies. In fact, Mr.Speaker, back in the 1940s, Eastern Air Lines bragged of their 6-hour-and-10-minute service between New York and San Juan one way for $1,700 in today's money. So, in fact, it was challenging to get to the territories.  But with all the significant advances in technology and travel, these logistical barriers no longer exist. As such, this bill repeals this archaic exemption and provides a reasonable and safe harbor to allow those companies currently subject to the exemption to transition.  Similar legislation passed the House in the last Congress by voice vote, and, earlier this year, H.1366 passed the House Financial Services Committee by a unanimous vote.

5722,topic-id,904,"Mr.President, we are all one diagnosis away from having a serious illness. Lots of us believe that getting a serious illness is something that happens to other people. I was one of them.  My moment of reckoning came 2 months ago. During a routine physical, my doctor told me I have kidney cancer. It is a moment everyone dreads. Thankfully, I had health insurance. I was able to sit down with my doctors and decide how I would fight my cancer, not how I would pay for treatment.  No one should have to worry about whether they can afford the healthcare that one day might save their life. Healthcare is personal, and it is a right, not a privilege reserved only for those who can afford it. It is why we are fighting so hard against  Thirteen of our male colleagues spent weeks sequestered away, literally plotting how to deny millions of people in our country the healthcare they deserve. They spent these weeks figuring out how to squeeze as much as they could out of the poorest, sickest, and oldest members of our society so they could give the richest people in our country a huge tax cut. This is not a healthcare bill. This is a tax cut for the rich bill.  Last week, the majority whip looked the American people in the eye from his desk and accused us of denouncing TrumpCare before we had a chance to read it. Well, read it we did, and it is as bad as we thought.  The Congressional Budget Office is estimating that 22 million people will lose their insurance under Its draconian cuts to Medicaid would have a devastating impact on our seniors--our kupuna, as we refer to them[[Page S3751]]in Hawaii--who depend on the program for long-term nursing care. It imposes an age tax on people 50 to 64 that allows insurance companies to charge them five times more for insurance. It fulfills the Republican Party's cherished goal of defunding Planned It undermines protections for Americans living with serious and chronic diseases who could face the reimposition of yearly and lifetime caps on their care.  For millions of people in our country, TrumpCare is not some abstract proposal that has no relevance to their lives. Last week, Senator Murray, Senator Van Hollen, and I joined three advocates--Ian, Marques, and Jill--who told us their stories about how TrumpCare would impact them.  Ian grew up in Fond du Lac, During his sophomore year in high school, Ian discovered he had bone cancer after suffering an injury playing football. He has been cancer-free for 6 years and is now pursuing a career in medical research, in large part, because of his experience in fighting this cancer. Although Ian has been cancer-free for some time now, he is very concerned about what TrumpCare could mean for him if his disease comes back. He has a preexisting condition.  Marques lives in Richmond, He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when he was only 27 years old. He has three young daughters and faces a lifetime of extensive treatment for his disease. Because of the Affordable Care Act and the guarantee of coverage it affords every American, Marques did what he never thought he would be able to do with MS, he started his own business.  Jill is from Hillard, Her daughter Alison was born with cystic fibrosis. Alison endured a lot at a very young age. When she was only 7, Alison had part of her lung removed because of the damage her disease caused. Because she has health insurance, which makes paying for expensive CF drugs more affordable, Alison is a happy teenager planning eagerly for her future. Jill made clear what would happen if TrumpCare passes: Alison's CF medication would become prohibitively expensive. Under TrumpCare, Jill would have to make decisions about which drugs she could afford for Alison, not which would work best to fight her disease.  Annual or lifetime limits on healthcare coverage will mean constant worry about paying for the lifesaving care that Ian, Marques, Jill, and their families need--not starting a business, not living like a normal teenager or young adult with dreams for the future. They will spend practically every waking moment just worrying about how they are going to pay for the care they need to live.  TrumpCare would be a disaster for the American people, and we are going to fight against it tooth and nail, but I also want to be clear about what we are fighting for. We are fighting for universal healthcare that is a right, and not a privilege, for every  Tomorrow, I am going in for surgery to remove the lesion I have on my rib, but I am going to be back as quickly as I can to keep up the fight against this mean, ugly bill.

Mr.Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this resolution, which reaffirms our Nation's commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's article 5 and the common defense among our NATO allies.  For 70 years, as I said, NATO has kept the peace in Europe and around the world. Now, that does not mean that we have had peace everywhere in the world, but it does mean that we have not had world conflagration, as we saw in the last century.  From the Cuban Missile Crisis to the fall of the Iron Curtain, NATO's unity in the face of common threats has helped prevent a direct Soviet attack against America and against our allies.  Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has been adapting to meet threats new and old. Together, NATO members have served on the ground in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and enlargement has made the allegiance even stronger.  Now, with Russia once again putting forward an aggressive posture to its neighbors and the world--in addition to visiting Bosnia, we also went to Lithuania and to Estonia, and I visited Denmark, as well--there is no doubt that the neighbors of Russia feel a pressure that has, over the last 15 years, not been as present. NATO's common defense commitment is as vital to global security and America's security as it has ever been.  We know that Russia interfered with our elections and has used cyber attacks against our NATO allies to subvert their democratic institutions as well. Estonia, in particular, has developed, and is developing, defenses to cyber attacks.  We, the United States, the leader of the free world, must make it clear, unequivocally so, both to Vladimir Putin and to our NATO allies, that the United States stands firmly by its commitment to the alliance and its collective defense.  It has only been once that article 5 has been implicated, and that was after 9/11, when all of our European allies in NATO said that an attack on the United States was perceived as an attack on them, and they pledged their unity and alliance and action. An attack on one is an attack on all--an attack on democracy, on freedom, on the values that this country and our NATO allies stand for.  It is in that context, Mr.Speaker, that I urge my colleagues to join us in giving this resolution--it says here on this text--a strong vote of passage. More than that, I hope this is a unanimous vote of passage. This is the oppression of the leader of the free world that we will not only lead, but we will act.

5528,topic-id,450,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize Steve Schley who is stepping down as president of Pingree Associates after nearly three decades of leadership later this month. Eight generations after his descendant initiated this effort, Steve Schley has, in his 32 years of service both to Pingree Associates, of which he was president for 28 years, and to the State of Maine, continued a tradition of leadership in the development and fiscal health of Maine's forest products industry as well as the sustainability of Maine's forests. Steve's retirement provides an opportunity to honor his wide array of accomplishments and contributions to the State of Maine--all achieved in the spirit and essence of his lineage.  In the year 1820, Maine, as included in the the Missouri Compromise, was ushered into the Union as a new That same year, a prominent Massachusetts shipping merchant named David Pingree initiated what would become a historic and indispensable string of investments in Maine forestlands. Over the next nearly 200 years, sudden growth and advancement of Maine's forest product industry, and thus statewide economic development, blossomed from the easement agreements signed and purchases made of Maine forest land by the Pingree family.  Today Pingree Associates is in possession of close to 1 million acres of Maine forest land, bringing a great burden of responsibility upon the president of the association. In every respect, Steve has thrived under this burden. During his tenure as president, he has undertaken initiatives to revitalize Maine's struggling wood-products industry by collaborating with the University of Maine's Forest Bio-products Research Institute to help nurture the next generation of innovators and leaders in the bioproducts industry, setting the stage for the development and integration of sustainable, forward-thinking forest products. By ``paying it forward'' through the youth of Maine, he is ensuring that his integrity and hard work will continue to live on through these kids for generations to come. Steve's sustainability and conservation efforts were not limited to just ensuring a bright future. Back in 2001, when I was Governor, I announced Steve's success in closing the largest forestland conservation easement in the history of the United States between Pingree Associates and the New England Forestry Foundation, which independently protected 762,192 acres from development and opened up the land to recreation for Mainers and all U.S citizens for time immemorial.  Because of Steve's hard work and leadership as president of Pingree Associates, Mainers of all ages will continue to benefit from his successes in Maine's forest industry, as well as in conserving land for their recreation. Steve has honored our collective heritage as well as his own, and I thank him for his friendship and his many contributions towards bettering our State.[[Page S3486]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-06-14-pt1-PgS3485.txt,1724,HARRY W.

5617,topic-id,2468,"Mr.President, I rise today to recognize the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the I-35W bridge and to pay tribute to those who lost their lives on that tragic summer day, as well as all the first responders, healthcare workers, and ordinary citizens who did extraordinary things on this day 10 years ago.  First, I want to acknowledge one other topic; that is, this evening we will be voting on the nomination of Christopher Wray to serve as the FBI I was proud to join all of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee--now, it is not an ordinary thing to have happen on its own that we all agree on something--from both sides of the aisle to support Mr.Wray's nomination in committee on July 20 with a unanimous vote of support.  In his hearing, Mr.Wray showed that he has integrity, that he will follow the law, and that he believes in the importance of an independent Senators on both sides of the aisle asked him strong and tough questions. Given this important time in our Nation's history for law enforcement and for the FBI, I don't think you would expect anything less.  Mr.Wray handled the questions well. He was knowledgeable, but most importantly for me, he showed respect for the agents, and he showed respect for his predecessors, both Mr.Mueller and Mr.He showed respect for the law, and he understood the somber time in which he comes in to take this job.  In particular, Mr.Wray said that if he were asked to do something illegal or unethical, he would urge the President not to proceed with such a course of action, and he would resign if necessary. Mr.Wray also responded to Senator Graham that he did not consider Special Counsel Mueller to be on a witch hunt, and he agreed that anyone running for elected office should notify the FBI if a foreign government offers assistance on a political campaign.  Mr.Wray also agreed with the concerns I raised that are posed by organized criminals, including those from foreign governments or who work for foreign governments, hiding their money in shell companies. He said that we had to ``follow the money.'' With news reports that the eighth person in the meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, and a lawyer connected to the Russian Government was a Russian who has been linked to money laundering, this issue is as important as ever.  In addition, Mr.Wray pledged to continue the FBI's efforts to work with the Election Assistance Commission and to address cyber security threats to our election infrastructure, so it is not just investigating things backward. A lot of what fighting crime is about--and I certainly knew this in my time as county attorney in Hennepin County--is making sure you protect people going forward. The FBI has enormous responsibilities going forward with cyber security, not only for our elections but for our government and also for business and for individual citizens.  Importantly, Mr.Wray promised to be responsive to requests from the Judiciary Committee as it carries out its oversight responsibilities. Those were questions posed to him by the committee's chairman, Senator  This is a tough time to take this tough job. The previous FBI Director, as we know, was fired because of the Russia investigation. The former Acting Attorney General was fired, and we have had a slew of other firings throughout the government over the last few months.  Well, I believe Christopher Wray is someone who will come in there with the integrity that is needed to do the job for those brave agents who go to work every day, not wearing a political button. They just go to do their work to protect us. I also believe he is the right choice at this time for our country.  I am very proud of the work the FBI in Minnesota has done, especially in the past year, with the stabbing we had at the shopping mall. The police chief there often talks about how there was so much going on at that moment, and the FBI was able to come in and help with that investigation in a significant way, so the police chief could not only work on the investigation with his officers but also calm the community, work with them, and do the other work that had to be done in the aftermath of that tragic stabbing.  That is just one example of our FBI in Minnesota, but I think every Member in this Chamber has examples in their own communities, and that is why it is important to have someone of the caliber of Christopher Wray take charge. I look forward to voting for his confirmation this evening.                   I-35W Bridge Collapse Anniversary  Mr.President, I am here today to talk about the I-35W bridge, and, as I said earlier, this was a tragedy that captivated not only my State but the country and the world. It was 10 years ago to the day that the I-35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River, taking the lives of 13 people and injuring over 100. I will never forget the shock and horror of that day. Everyone in my State remembers where they were when they heard that the bridge had collapsed.  As I said that day, a bridge just shouldn't fall down in the middle of America--not an eight-lane highway, not a bridge just a few blocks from my house that I drive over every single day with my family. But it happened, and when something like that happens, a lot of it has to do with, yes, what caused it--you want to know that--but also you want to know how the community responded, and that gets to the part that I really wanted to focus on today.  In the minutes and the hours following the disaster, the response of Minnesota's firefighters, police, hospital personnel, emergency personnel, and ordinary citizens was nothing short of heroic. People did not run away from that disaster. They ran toward it.  Everyone remembers the video of the off-duty firefighter diving in, over and over again, looking for survivors, or they remember that school bus precariously hanging on the edge of that broken-down bridge, where ordinary people had come to help on this broken[[Page S4644]]bridge as the school bus rested on the side, ready to fall. To get the kids off the bridge--they were just going to a summer camp and coming home for the day--the driver was helping them out one by one by one, not leaving that bus until every single kid got off the bus. During the first 2 hours after the bridge fell down, the Minneapolis Emergency Communications Center received and processed over 500 calls, 51 of which came directly from the scene of the disaster.  The eyes of the Nation were on our State, and what they saw that day was the very best of That tremendous spirit of community is what carried us through the dark days after the bridge collapsed. I remember going there with then-Senator Coleman the next morning with the Transportation There were already, literally, billboards the morning after, directing people where to go because this involved a major highway and telling them what buses would be working and which way they should go. That is a community responding.  Senator Coleman and I pledged that day that we would work with Congressman Oberstar, who was a major force--who sadly is no longer with us--on the House Transportation Committee and then, of course, with Congressman Ellison, who is the Congressman for that district.  Senator Coleman and I pledged to get the money, and we secured $250 million in emergency bridge reconstruction funding in just the first few days. It was a bipartisan effort, and I was proud to have the support of so many people in this As a result of that--and maybe this is a lesson in light of what we heard in Senator McCain's beautiful speech and in light of what we know we still need to be doing with infrastructure in this country--with President Bush's help and with bipartisan support, we rebuilt that huge bridge in Minnesota in a little over a year. Literally 13 months later, I was driving over that bridge to my house.  It is a shining example of what we can accomplish when we put politics aside to get big things done. I believe the I-35W bridge can and should be a model, not just of a tragic disaster and of our declining infrastructure, which it certainly is, but also a model of how we can fix things--a Republican Senator working with a Democratic Senator, and we got it done.  We have made some progress in this Chamber when it comes to infrastructure. In 2015, Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act, led by Senator McConnell, the leader, with Senator They don't agree on much, but they worked hard to get that bill done. I have always loved that it was called the FAST It is kind of a scary thing to name a bill in Congress these days, but they named it that, and it got done. It was a long-term reauthorization bill that increased transportation funding from existing revenue streams and helped provide certainty for local governments planning critical projects.  Under the FAST Act, Minnesota is scheduled to receive more than $4 billion in funding over 5 years, which will help to ensure that our infrastructure is safe and efficient, and by the last year, it will be an increase of about $100 million just for our State over what we were getting the year before we passed the FAST But we still need to do more.  This year, the American Society of Civil Engineers, which every so often comes out with grades of the Nation's infrastructure, gave America's infrastructure a grade of D-plus. While other countries are running ahead with infrastructure investments, we are still standing still. Even with the FAST Act, it doesn't propel us into the future, where we want to be. As we know--and as the Presiding Officer knows from his own State of North Dakota--we are an export State; we are an export country. We have to bring goods to market, and we have to bring goods into the United We also have to bring people to their jobs, and we can't do that if we have infrastructure--roads, bridges, rails, locks, and dams--that was set up for the last century. Standing still means falling behind in this global economy. In Minnesota, we know the cost of neglecting our roads and bridges. Our country needs to build roads, bridges, airports, locks, dams, and rails that work.  While safety should always be our first priority, it shouldn't be our only expectation. Our infrastructure should help farmers from the Presiding Officer's home State of North Dakota and my State of Minnesota to get crops to market quickly. Small businesses have to grow, and workers have to get to their jobs.  Let's not forget about updating our energy grid, repairing and replacing our water infrastructure and sewers, and making sure all Americans have access to broadband--not just low-speed broadband but high-speed broadband. I don't want to hear about another farmer going to the McDonald's parking lot to do his business or a doctor in northern Minnesota going to look at his x rays. If he couldn't use the hospital, he couldn't look at x rays at home or anywhere except another coffee store parking lot. That makes no sense.  If our deteriorating infrastructure goes unaddressed, it will cost our economy nearly $4 trillion by 2025, leading to a loss of over 2 million jobs. If we address it, we can create millions of jobs.  Here are some ideas. Senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Roy Blunt of Missouri have a bipartisan bill that I am part of that would establish an infrastructure financing authority to complement existing funding and expand overall infrastructure investments by providing new incentives to increase private sector spending. Another idea is to reform our Tax Code--and we have to do a lot of work on that--to simplify it and to create incentives for businesses to invest right here in We can also provide incentives to bring back trillions of dollars of foreign earnings. But if we do that, we have to make sure a chunk of it goes into infrastructure.  Of course, these tools should supplement and not replace direct Federal funding because, especially when it comes to rural America, we are not going to see the same kind of public-private partnership that you might in other, more populated areas of the country. So it has to be a combination of funding sources to make this work for every State, especially for rural  I am committed to moving forward in a bipartisan way to address our infrastructure needs and to prevent another tragedy like the collapse of the I-35W bridge. It is time to work together to make this happen. I actually believe the Senate is a place where we can make this happen. We showed the ability to get through a major infrastructure bill just 2 years ago, and we can do it again.  Today, on this 10th anniversary, we honor the victims, and their families, of that I-35W bridge collapse. We recognize the bravery of the first responders, who were incredible, and the 911 operators, who did their duty and answered those calls and got the help where they were supposed to go, and the doctors, nurses, ER people, ambulance workers, and everyone else.  Today, we also--and I can't think of a better time, when we are going through a difficult period, as we are in our country--remember the actions of ordinary citizens who could have just said: Oh, this looks scary; I am going home. They didn't do that. They didn't run away from the disaster; they ran toward it. Ordinary citizens did extraordinary things. Why? Because they cared about their fellow citizens. Because they knew that while maybe they had crossed over that bridge 5 minutes before it collapsed and could see it in their rearview mirror, or maybe they were approaching the bridge and actually saw it collapse--if it weren't for a 5-minute or 1-minute or 30-second difference, it would have been them on that bridge, and they knew that, and that is why they helped.  That is what America is really all about. It is not just a lottery where only certain people win and certain people lose. You have to put yourselves in the shoes of other people and think, we are all on one team. That is what this democracy is about, and that is what we saw on this day 10 years ago, August 1, in  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-08-01-pt1-PgS4640-2.txt,1826,1500,2017.0,1.0,June

I have known my friend since our days in the Ohio General I remember when he was deployed for his service that he so unselfishly gave to his Nation in uniform.  With Steve, you can go back in history. It was 242 years ago last week, on April 18, 1775, that Paul Revere, Dawes, and Prescott rode across the countryside and said that the regulars were out.  It was on the morning of April 19 that men left their shops, left their plows, and went to that call. It was that citizen soldier that went out there to make sure that this Nation attained the freedom that we have today.  From the National Guard and all of our men and women that are serving in uniform across all the services, it is because of them that we have the right to stand here today.  I applaud Congressman Stivers on his promotion to brigadier. And we, along with our colleagues in the Senate, congratulate him. Mr.Speaker, I thank him very much for his service.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgH2858-2.txt,,MAKE IT IN AMERICA,2017.0,26.0,April

Proponents say that this would give greater transparency to the Congress and the operation of the Copyright I think this is a ridiculous statement.  Once a Presidential appointment is confirmed, there is no greater attention to the desires of Congress or transparency than for any other non-Presidential appointment. The conflicts that the Republican Congress had with President Obama's Environmental Protection Agency and IRS appointees are testimony to that truth.  There are vague claims of elevating the Register and modernizing the Office, but, in fact, the Library is finally making progress on modernizing the This bill would actually disrupt that progress.  When you talk about conflicts, the Library doesn't have a conflict with this, but who does have a conflict is President He holds 30 copyrights.

5658,topic-id,704,"Mr.Speaker, this bill isn't about fixing our immigration system. In fact, it makes the system more dysfunctional and puts communities in peril. This bill is about telling communities how to police themselves and protect their people. It says: We here in D.know better than you do, local police, across the United  Now, 600 or more local governments engaged in what they call community trust policies. These policies promote, among other things, allowing immigrant victims and witnesses to crime to report these offenses to local authorities without fear of immigration consequences. Years of locally informed experience have proven that this approach best ensures these communities' safety.  I think that is why we have received communications from the National Fraternal Order of Police in opposition to this bill, from the Law Enforcement Task Force--that is 36 sheriffs and chiefs across the country--in opposition to this bill, from the Major County Sheriffs of America in opposition to this bill, from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence against this bill, as well as the U.Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the National Association of  ICE is not prohibited from doing their job, but as the San Jose Police Department has told me, San Jose police are not enforcing the securities laws, they are not enforcing the Federal tax laws, and they are not enforcing the immigration laws of the United They are doing their job to protect their community against crime.  Now, because they are doing that, the threat is to remove funding from jurisdictions.  Now, what would that funding be?  It is grants against violent gangs. It is grants for the Anti-Heroin Task Force and the Anti-Methamphetamine Program, grants on port security to[[Page H5320]]prevent terrorists from getting into the United States, and grants for the BioWatch Program to prevent terrorists from getting biohazards and killing us all.  That is not smart to take those programs away from local governments that are working with us to help keep America safe.  Now, I always think, as I said earlier, we are not doing bumper stickers here. We are doing laws. It is important to take a look at the details of what is in this proposed bill. In addition to banning collaborative grants with localities, the remedies it has made available is if a community has a community trust policy, the Department of Homeland Security can refuse to honor warrants--legal warrants--that are issued by that jurisdiction.  That is astonishing. That is simply astonishing because what the local governments have said on the detainer policies is that the Fourth Amendment prevents them from holding people whose sentences have been served. In fact, there are a number of Federal courts that have made that determination, you can't hold somebody on a civil detainer request without violating the Fourth  There is a remedy to that: get a warrant like anybody else. The Fourth Amendment means something, and there is a remedy. Go get a warrant. I don't know why our Federal Government feels that they can upend constitutional law for their own convenience.  Now, there is a provision in this bill that I find shocking. What it says is that if local governments violate the law--violate a court order--that they cannot violate the Fourth Amendment, that they are immunized, the Federal Government is going to pay, go ahead and violate the law. I cannot remember a time when we had a bill before us that said to States and localities: go ahead, violate the law because we are going to indemnify you for the violation.  That is not the way our Federal system should work, and it is not the way those of us who believe in our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States think that things ought to work.  Now, finally, it creates something that I think is truly astonishing: a private cause of action against a State or locality if because the detainer cannot be honored because of the Federal Court cases and a person is released and, for any reason, commits a crime that it is the locality that bears the cost, not the criminal. This is a crazy provision.  We should oppose this bill.  ",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5316.txt,701,REGISTER OF COPYRIGHTS SELECTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,29.0,June

The      House will consider H.3003 on the floor this week and      Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program      administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing      Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance      Grant (Byrne-JAG) programs, as well as programs administered      by the U.Department of Homeland       The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly      believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should      cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said,      withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies--     which have no policymaking role--also hurts public safety      efforts.       Local police departments answer to local civilian      government and it is the local government which enacts      statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement      officers have no more say in these matters than any other      citizen and--with laws like the Hatch Act in place--it can be      argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to      pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out      lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the      civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to      penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because      Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with      respect to our nation's immigration laws.       The FOP issued a statement in January of this year      regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary      cities as outlined in President Trump's Executive The      President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law      enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the      political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.     Attorney General and Secretary of the U.Department of      Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the      public safety impact without an automatic suspension from      Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.3003, there is      no such discretion and it countermands the Administration's      existing policy.       The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress,      which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and      we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce      or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for      local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect      policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find      another way to do so.       On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.     3003's punitive approach and work with law enforcement to      find a better way to improve public safety in our      communities. Please feel free to contact me or my Senior      Advisor Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can be of any      further assistance.

Dear Member of Congress: As law enforcement leaders      dedicated to preserving the safety and security of our      communities, we have concerns about legislative proposals      that would attempt to impose punitive, ``one-size-fits-all''      policies on state and local law enforcement. Rather than      strengthening state and local law enforcement by providing us      with the tools to work with the Department of Homeland      Security (DHS) in a manner that is responsive to the needs of      our communities, these proposals would represent a step      backwards.       Attempts to defund so-called sanctuary cities regularly      sweep too broadly, punishing jurisdictions that engage in      well-established community policing practices or adhere to      federal court decisions that have found federal immigration      detainers to violate constitutional protections. We oppose      these approaches and urge Congress to work to encourage--     rather than compel--law enforcement agency cooperation within      our federal system.       We believe that law enforcement should not cut corners.      Multiple federal courts have questioned the legality and      constitutionality of federal immigration detainers that are      not accompanied by a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Even      though the legality of such immigration holds is doubtful,      some have proposed requiring states and localities to enforce      them, shielding them from lawsuits. While this approach would      reduce potential legal liability faced by some jurisdictions      and departments, we are concerned these proposals would still      require our agencies and officers carry out federal      directives that could violate the U.Constitution, which we      are sworn to follow.       Immigration enforcement is, first and foremost, a federal      responsibility. Making our communities safer means better      defining roles and improving relationships between local law      enforcement and federal immigration authorities. But in      attempting to defund ``sanctuary cities'' and require state      and local law enforcement agencies. Local control has been a      beneficial approach for law enforcement for decades--having      the federal government compel state and local law enforcement      to carry out new and sometimes problematic tasks undermines      the delicate federal balance and will harm locally-based      policing.       Rather than requiring state and local law enforcement      agencies to engage in additional immigration enforcement      activities, Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the      broken immigration system to allow state and local law      enforcement to focus their resources on true threats--     dangerous criminals and criminal organizations. We believe      that state and local law enforcement must work together with      federal authorities to protect our communities and that we      can best serve our communities by leaving the enforcement of      immigration laws to the federal government. Threatening the      removal of valuable grant funding that contributes to the      health and well-being of communities across the nation would      not make our communities safer and would not fix any part of      our broken immigraton system.       Our immigration problem is a national problem deserving of      a national approach, and we continue to recognize that what      our broken system truly needs is a permanent legislative      solution--broad-based immigration reform.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the 19,000 cities and      towns represented by the National League of Cities (NLC), I      am writing to express our strong opposition to the ``No      Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.3003). The bill, which      was made public just recently, completely bypassed the House      Judiciary Committee and includes provisions that will result      in violations of due process and the Fourth and Tenth      Amendments to the       We are very troubled by the fact that the bill--which      preempts local authority, jeopardizes public safety, and      exposes local governments to litigation and potential      liability--was drafted with no input from local officials.       NLC has consistently opposed federal legislation that would      impose harmful sanctions on local governments--sanctions that      prohibit or restrict compliance when a detainer request is      issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration      and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Specifically, NLC has      significant concerns with the provisions in H.3003 that:       1. Undermine local government's authority to govern their      public safety and local law enforcement programs. The bill      would prevent localities from establishing laws or policies      that prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance with or      cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. H.3003      would strip local governments ability to enact common-sense      crime prevention policies that ensure victims of crime will      seek protection and report crimes.       2. Penalize local governments that fail to comply with      federal immigration efforts with the denial of federal      funding for critical law enforcement, national security, drug      treatment, and crime victim initiatives, including the State      Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), Community Oriented      Policing Services (COPS), and Byrne JAG programs that provide      hundreds of millions of dollars to localities nationwide.[[Page H5327]]         3. Compel local governments to honor Immigration and      Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests, even though the      federal courts have determined the that ICE use of detainers      violates the Fourth Amendment, and that localities may be      held liable for honoring them.       4. Expand ICE's detainer authority requiring localities to      hold undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours, which is      twice what is currently allowed even if probable cause has      not been shown. The bill also does not provide any additional      funding to local governments to cover the costs associated      with detaining the undocumented immigrants. Requiring cities      to shoulder the financial burden being forced upon them with      no input impacts our ability to pay for essential      infrastructure and services such as roads, schools and      libraries.       5. Create a ``private right of action'' that would allow      crime victims or their family members to sue localities if      the crime was committed by someone who was released by the      locality that did not honor an ICE detainer request. This      provision could allow frivolous lawsuits against a local      government by anyone who alleges that they were a victim of a      crime committed by an immigrant.       6. Compel local governments to utilize their local law      enforcement resources to implement federal civil immigration      enforcement in violation of the Tenth Amendment's      ``commandeering'' principle. The Tenth Amendment does not      permit the federal government to force counties and cities to      allocate local resources, including police officers,      technology, and personnel, to enforce federal immigration      law. The federal government also cannot withhold funds from      localities refusing to participate in federal efforts if the      programs affected are unrelated to the purpose of the federal      program, or if the sanctions are punitive in nature.       Since the inception of the United States of America, lawful      immigrants and refugees have played a vital role in the      civic, economic and social life of cities. We recognize that      local governments address issues associated with federal      immigration laws in a variety of ways that best meet the      needs of all their residents. Some cities provide greater      leniency towards undocumented immigrants who do not violate      state and local laws by not dedicating municipal resources to      enforce federal immigration laws. Unfortunately, these cities      are wrongfully characterized as safe havens for undocumented      immigrants who violate state and local laws.       We believe the power to enforce federal immigration laws      remains exclusively a federal power and we strongly oppose      federal efforts to commandeer our local law enforcement to      take on the duties of federal immigration enforcement agents.       Our nation's local elected officials call on you to do the      right thing and vote against H.3003 when it is considered      on the floor. We urge you to move beyond punitive bills like      H.3003 and work with us to develop a positive legislation      that will fix our broken immigration system and make our      cities safer.       Thank you for your leadership and for willingness to stand      up for America's cities by voting against this legislation      that would impose harmful sanctions on local governments.           Sincerely,     Matt Zone,       President, National League of Cities, Ward 15                                  ____                                      The United States Conference                                                    of Mayors,                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.       Dear Representative: I write to register the strong      opposition of the nation's mayors to H.3003, a partisan      bill that seeks to punish so-called ``sanctuary cities,''      which is expected to be considered by the full House this      week.       The U.Conference of Mayors represents well over a      thousand mayors and nearly 150 million people. Today, we      concluded the 85th Annual Meeting of The U.Conference of      Mayors and adopted policy that reinforces and builds on      previous positions we have taken which oppose provisions in      this bill. Specifically, the nation's mayors:       urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that      attempts to cut local law enforcement funding necessary to      ensure the safety of our communities, indemnify conduct that      violates the constitutional rights afforded to both United      States citizens and immigrant populations, and further      criminalizes immigration and infringes on the rights of      immigrant;       oppose punitive policies that limit local control and      discretion, and urge instead that Congress and the      Administration pursue immigration enforcement policies that      recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources      and community trust is critical to local law enforcement and      the safety of our communities;       oppose federal policies that commandeer local law      enforcement or require local authorities to violate, or be      placed at risk of violating, a person's Fourth Amendment      rights; expend limited resources to act as immigration      agents; or otherwise assist federal immigration authorities      beyond what is determined by local policy.       H.3003 would do all of these things and more:       It would jeopardize public safety by withholding critical      public safety funding from jurisdictions that tell their      police officers not to ask an individual their immigration      status. Many departments have such policies to encourage      crime victims and witnesses to report crimes and to build      trust with immigrant communities.       It would put jurisdictions at risk of violating an      individual's Fourth Amendment rights by establishing probable      cause standards for ICE's issuance of detainers that do not      require a judicial determination of probable cause. Numerous      federal courts have found that continued detention under an      ICE detainer, absent probable cause, would state a claim for      a violation of the Fourth Amendment and subject the detaining      officer or jurisdiction to civil liability.       While it says it would provide immunity to jurisdictions      which comply with detainers and hold them harmless in any      suits filed against them, they would still be subject to      Fourth Amendment challenges.       Further compelling and expanding compliance with certain      enforcement provisions, such as immigration detainers, and      cutting off federal funding to jurisdictions which do not      comply with these provisions likely conflict with the Tenth            H.3003 is a bad bill for our cities and their residents      and for our nation. It would jeopardize public safety,      preempt local authority, and expose local governments to      litigation and potential findings of damages. America's      mayors call on you to do the right thing and vote against      H.3003 when it is considered on the floor.       The U.Conference of Mayors urges you instead to focus on      positive legislation that will fix our broken immigration      system and make our cities safer. The nation's mayors pledge      to work with you on bipartisan immigration reform legislation      that will fix our nation's broken immigration system. We need      to move beyond punitive bills like H.3003 and develop an      immigration system that works for our nation, our cities and      our people.       To make our cities safer we urge you to consider      legislation that will help us to fight crime and prevent      terrorism. The U.Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities      Chiefs Association agree that to make the streets of America      safe, Congress must act to strengthen bonds between      communities and police, expand homeland security grants,      invest in mental health and substance abuse services, reduce      gun violence, and reform the criminal justice system and      strengthen reentry services.           Sincerely,                                         Mitchell Landrieu,                                             Mayor of New Orleans,                                      ____         Major County Sheriffs of America and National Association            of Counties,                                                    June 29, 2017.

While we applaud measures to protect the      public from repeat, violent predators, we cannot support      further cuts in funding that weaken crime prevention efforts,      officer recruitment, and safety and wellness programs.       Most sheriffs want to cooperate with U.Immigration and      Customs Enforcement (ICE) so that it may remove criminal      illegal aliens from the United States, but sheriffs must      follow the law that has rendered current ICE requests      illegal. Without proper arrest authority, sheriffs cannot      willfully disregard an individual's 4th amendment rights as      articulated in these court cases. Make no mistake, the      American public has a right to know which jurisdictions are      blatantly ignoring the rule of law and are endangering      community safety and they should be held accountable. If a      jurisdiction is following the law of its state or a binding      court ruling, it is misguided for Congress to cut funding for      programs that support State and local law enforcement      agencies in nearly every jurisdiction in this country.       ICE's removal of illegal aliens who are committing crimes      in our communities is important to ensure public safety.      Their removal mitigates the drain on sheriffs' resources by      ensuring these criminals are not sitting in our jails and      that our deputies are not continually investigating their      crimes. As leaders in law enforcement, the MCSA been working      collaboratively with the Department of Homeland Security to      find an agreeable solution that is lawful, effects good      public safety policy, and allows ICE to effectively do its      job of removing criminal illegal aliens from our country.       We know Members of Congress believe that efforts to stop      violence in American cities[[Page H5328]]     must be strengthened, not weakened. While we appreciate      Congress' support for law enforcement, we strongly feel a law      enforcement grant penalty solution would not only negatively      impact law enforcement efforts across the country, but also      not achieve its intended purpose.

The chairman of the committee mentioned somebody in San Francisco who is suing the city. In a way, that shows the efficacy of the trust policies.  This man, Mr.Figueroa-Zarceno, was a victim of crime. His truck was stolen. He went into the police department to report that his truck was stolen. There was a removal order that was 10 or 20 years old. He has an American citizen child. He is a working person.

Because immigrants are afraid to report; and not just because they might be undocumented, but they might have a sister or a next-door neighbor or a spouse who is undocumented, even if they are a citizen. So what has happened is with these threats come an unwillingness of immigrants to report crime, to be witnesses to crime, to keep our communities safe.

5710,topic-id,4561,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the following additional letters in opposition to H.3003. These are additional letters of opposition that I mentioned earlier on H.3003.                                                    June 26, 2017.       Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on      Migration of the U.Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/     COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our      opposition to H.3003 and H.3004.       The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare      of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our      parishes include those with and without immigration status,      unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of      crime in the United States, including domestic violence,      armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of      fostering cooperation and information-sharing between      immigrant communities and local law enforcement.       We oppose H.3003 because it would impose obligations on      local governments that we fear--and that many of them have      warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law      enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local      law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure      public safety in all communities.       Furthermore, Section 2 of H.3003 would deny to      jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law      enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and      naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be non-     compliant with H.3003. The Catholic service network,      including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the      federal government on a number of Department of Justice and      Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including      disaster response and recovery, naturalization and      citizenship services, and services for the immigrant,      including victims of human trafficking, and domestic      violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the      protection and promotion of the human person and in some      instances life-saving. Cutting grants related to these      important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not      humane or just, nor is it in our national interest.       Also, we oppose H.3004 as it would lead to an expansion      of incarceration and does not include adequate protections      for people who re-enter the U.for humanitarian reasons or      seek protection at the border. While H.3004 makes notable      efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent      criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal      by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal      re-entry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in      these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that      important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to      prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent      crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry      or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does      not advance the common good nor will it ensure that      communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as      introduced, H.3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum      seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented      themselves repeatedly at the U.border in the flight from      violence), from being able to access protection, and instead      face fines, imprisonment or both.       We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of      a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration      reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family      unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs      and rights of immigrants with our nation's best interests and      security.       The United States has a long and proud history of      leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their      circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready      to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to      this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of      our views in this regard.           Sincerely,     Most Joe Vasquez,       Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on     Donna Markham, OP, PhD.,       President & CEO, Catholic Charities                                  ____                                       National Task Force to End,                                 Sexual and Domestic Violence,                                                    June 27, 2017.       The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence      (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations      advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence      victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the      country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence      receive the protections they deserve, write to express our      deep concerns about the impact that H.3003, the ``No      Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.3004, or ``Kate's      Law,'' will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual      assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on      communities at large.       This year is the twenty-third anniversary of the bipartisan      Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') which has, since it was      first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant      victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.3003 and H.     3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors      and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into      danger, undermining the very purpose of Specifically,      the nation's leading national organizations that address      domestic and sexual assault oppose H.3003 and H.3004      because:       Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing      community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal      immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine      the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA      and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant      victims into the shadows and undermining public safety.      Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that      supports local community policing and sustains community      trust in working with local law enforcement. H.3003 runs      contrary to community policing efforts and will deter      immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not      only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for      themselves and their children. While H.3003 does not      require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant      victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in      the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices.       Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse.      Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law      enforcement with U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement      (ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating      trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community,      which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and      traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a      tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to      call the police because of fear of deportation, they become      more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the      individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear      of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting      violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result,      dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished.       As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes      often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they      will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting      the police and HR 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal      immigration and local law enforcement systems will only      exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be      able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and U.     Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim      advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by      immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help      from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and      attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs      indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened      fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78      percent of advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are      describing fear of contacting the police; 75 percent[[Page H5330]]     of them reporting that victims are afraid of going to court;      and 43 percent reporting working with immigrant victims who      are choosing not to move forward with criminal charges or      obtaining protective orders.       In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie      Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among      Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to      concerns that police interaction could result in deportation.      According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have      dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles' Latino population since      the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop      among non-Latino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse      among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas      the decline among non-Latinos was four percent. The Houston      Police Department reported in April that the number of      Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year.      In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that      some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in      court. As of late February, the City Attorney's Office had      dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers      will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and      Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having      trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain      public safety and prosecute crime.       H.3003 Will Unfairly Punish Entire communities.       H.3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional      guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not      supported by due process mandates. H.3003 likely covers      more than 600 jurisdictions across the country, most of which      do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional      mandates as ``sanctuary'' policies. H.3003 penalizes      jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal      grants, including federal law enforcement grants, such as the      Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and      other federal grants related to law enforcement or      immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit      analysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would,      ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to      combat and prevent crime in their communities.       In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.3003 and H.     3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources      being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from      enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes,      including those protecting victims of domestic violence,      sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and      prosecution of many non-violent immigration law violaters.       H.3003 and H.3004 Will Unfairly Punish       By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding      criminal penalties for reentry, H.3003 and H.3004 will      have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of      human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are      often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition      of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when      police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may      be arrested or a survivor who acted in self-defense may be      wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English      better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural      barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the      survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor      faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty      (without being advised about the long-term consequences) in      order to be released from jail and reunited with her      children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often      arrested and convicted for prostitution-related offenses.      These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly      to be reunited with their children following their arrests or      pending trial. These factors--combined with poor legal      counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of      criminal pleas and convictions--have in the past and will      likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused      victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of      domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.3003      imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.3004 imposes      expanded bases for detention without consideration of      mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these      victims.       In addition, H.3004 expands the criminal consequences      for re-entry in the U.without recognizing the compelling      humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been      previously removed return for their safety. Victims of      domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence      in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking      protection from harm. In recent years, women and children      fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and      Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge.      Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal      representation, they are unable to establish their      eligibility for legal protections in the United States,      resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of      domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking      in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims      subsequently attempt to reenter the U.to protect      themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and      sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their      abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from      obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with      some victims having to leave their children behind in the      custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.3004,      these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for re-entry for      attempting to protect themselves and their children.       On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence,      sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human      trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote      against HR 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and spirit      of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law      enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for      public safety in general, and particularly essential for      domestic and sexual violence victims and their children.           Sincerely,       The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence      (www.4vawa.org).                                  ____                                                    June 28, 2017.     Re Vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.3003,          and Kate's Law, H.3004.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 407 undersigned      local, state, and national immigrant, civil rights, faith-     based, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No      Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.3003 and Kate's Law, H.     3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public      safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police and      its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and      incarceration of immigrants. H.3003 would strip badly      needed law enforcement funding for state and local      jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment,      and unnecessarily expands the government's detention      apparatus. H.3004 unwisely expands the federal      government's ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for      immigration-based offenses, excludes critical humanitarian      protections for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on      the failed experiment of incarceration for immigration      violations.       Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or      ordinances that disentangle their state and local law      enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law.      The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.3003, seeks to      attack so-called ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions (many of whom do      not consider themselves as such) by penalizing state and      local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Ameniment of the      U.Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally      infirm requests for detainers. H.3003 penalizes      jurisdictions by eliminating various federal grants,      including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the      Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and      any other federal grant related to law enforcement or      immigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding      federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely      runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on      commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law      professors.       ``Sanctuary'' policies are critical to promote public      safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.     Immigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of      crime are significantly less likely to communicate with local      law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have      repeatedly echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that      community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public      safety. Indeed, ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions have less crime      and more economic development than similarly situated non-     ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions. Withholding critically-needed      federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the      ability of state and local jurisdictions to satisfy the      public safety needs of their communities.       Kate's Law, H.3004, would further criminalize the      immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for      immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. Operation      Streamline encapsulates our nation's failed experiment with      employing criminal penalties to deter migration. Under      Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes      immigrants for reentry at significant rates. By all practical      measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration,      wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and unfairly punished      thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the      United States to reunite with their children and loved ones.      We fear that H.3004's increased penalties for reentry      would double down on this failed strategy, explode the prison      population, and cost billions of dollars.       Instead of passing discredited enforcement-only      legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just      immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to      citizenship for the nation's eleven million aspiring      Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation      programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation      that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic      processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns      represents an abdication of the Congress' responsibility to      enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of      the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for      Criminals Act, H.3003 and Kate's Law, H.3004.       Please contact Jose Magana-Salgado, of the Immigrant Legal      Resource Center, if you have any questions regarding this      letter. Thank you for your time and consideration.

5549,topic-id,1988,"Mr.President, we have now reached a point where the Senate majority, the Republicans, and President Trump, have been unable to put together the package that allows them to take Medicaid and try to successfully turn it into a shadow of what it once was in our country, to turn it into a debt-soaked relic of what it is today by taking out $770 billion that otherwise would have gone to the families of those in our country who need healthcare services, who need help in providing for those who need it the most within our country.  The same thing was true in the House of Representatives when they were moving through their bill over there. People said: Trump doesn't have the votes. The Republicans don't have the votes. They are not going to be able to be successful. However, this TrumpCare Hail Mary that they threw in the House, notwithstanding the remarkable defense put up by the American people--the millions of phone calls, protests, and rallies--they still were able to find the votes to ultimately pass this incredible attack upon the healthcare of tens of millions of  What they did in the House is what they are doing in the The GOP retreats; they wait for the defense to disperse, but then they plow through to get this bill over the finish line, hoping that a 2-week hiatus will be sufficient for the energy level of the defense against these cuts to so wane that then they can come back and finish off the job on their second try in the same way they did in the House of Right now it is only halftime.  It is halftime. They are coming back. The ball is in their court. They will attempt again to destroy the healthcare system of our country as we know it today. We have not defeated this bill yet.  Now is the time for those who oppose this bill to redouble their energy, to play even tougher defense against this Republican attempt to undermine Medicaid, to undermine access to care to everyone in our country. Their bill is now down, so let's keep it down for the count. Let's make sure this bill cannot get up and come back and haunt us in the middle of  The Senate proposal right now has $188 billion, which is now going to be within the hands of the Trump administration, in the hands of the Republican leadership as a slush fund to be used to get the votes they need in order to pass their bill. That $188 billion is right now being divided up in a way that will help them to get the votes.  What is the ultimate goal of the GOP? The ultimate goal is to take a machete to Medicaid because they harbor an ancient animosity toward Medicaid, and I will throw in Medicare and ObamaCare--all of it. They see this as the best opportunity they have had in two generations to be able to leave these programs as debt-soaked relics of what they are today. When they say: Well, we are going to cap the funding and send it back to the States with more flexibility--when they say ``cap'' the funding, they are talking about decapitating the funding, to cut it in half, send it back to the States, and then say to the States: You figure it out. You try to help those people who are poorest in your State whom you were never able to figure out how to help in the first place, which is why we put the Federal programs on the books in order to help those who are most in need in all of those  What is their real goal? It is pretty simple: Slash these programs and then turn them into one huge tax break for the richest people in That is what this program will do. One little example of that $770 billion--let's take $33 billion of it. That $33 billion gets divvied up by the 400 wealthiest families in America; 400 billionaires walk up and say: Can I please have my $7 million that I get as part of taking away coverage for cancer, coverage for Alzheimer's, coverage for opioid treatment? Can I now get my payoff for the success in your wealth-income transfer program? Because that is what you have. You don't have a healthcare program; you have a wealth care program. The wealth of the wealthiest--please make them even wealthier; that is what their entire plan is about.  By the way, that $33 billion would be enough to take care of the healthcare of 700,000 people in our country, but the Republican priority is to give all that money back to the wealthiest people in our country. That is immoral. That is inhumane. It is just plain wrong. The American public has to rise up and[[Page S3804]]fight against the greatest legislative injustice that has been perpetrated or attempted to be perpetrated on the American people in more than a generation.  This bill is ``the bill'' of my entire career in the U.Congress, which is now 41 years. This is the worst bill. It is the greatest attack upon the well-being of our This program is of the rich, for the rich, by the rich, and where are they going to take the money from? From the poor, from the sick, from the elderly, from the disabled. It is selfishness on stilts.  To think that there is a plan to take healthcare away from the poorest and sickest and most disabled people in our country in order to give a tax break to the wealthiest is the most indecent action that may have ever been perpetrated on the floor of the U. There are billions in tax breaks for those who don't need them or deserve them, paid for by people who cannot afford it. It is healthcare heartlessness; that is what it is. If you kicked these people in the heart, you would break your toe. There is no heart. There is no sense of decency toward those families who are going to see their loved ones' diseases get even worse or to see them ultimately die because of lack of coverage.  The Republicans say that their plan--at least they purport it as their plan--is to decrease the deficit by passing this bill, but what do they do with the money that they save? Ah, a tax break for the wealthy.  I thought that you were shedding tears about your concerns of subsequent generations having such huge deficits, but we know those are crocodile tears about future generations because you want to pay off this generation of billionaires and this generation of millionaires who need no additional wealth for their families today.  So there is no real concern about the deficit. This is, once again, just an attack on the programs that the Republicans have always opposed, and if they combine it as a tax break at the same time, all the better.  From my perspective, people are just going to wind up paying more for healthcare, and they are going to be getting less. They are going to be paying for a Cadillac but only getting a tricycle as the people go forward. For too many families, they will not be able to afford anything, and there will be no subsidy to help them get healthcare for their families. The anxiety of suffering from an illness will only be exacerbated by their families' understanding that they cannot even afford the care for their loved ones because of the financial insecurity in their own families.  This is going to be a historic 2 weeks in which we must raise our voices as they have never been raised before--in which we stand on the ramparts and let those Republicans know that they are in for the fight of their lives. Cassandra-like, we must warn of the dangers of complacency, of the misunderstanding of what is happening right now.  The Republicans have removed the healthcare bill from the Senate floor for consideration. They are not defeated. They are just at halftime. They are now trying to construct a plan that will bring it back as soon as we return and with the votes now secured, from their perspective, in order to pass this bill and send it over to the House of Representatives and then down to President Trump for his signature.  These next 2 weeks will be the most important 2 weeks for the healthcare of our Nation in two generations. This battle is the battle to ensure that they are not successful. From my perspective, this is a fight that each and every American has to be a part of because it is your families who are going to be harmed.  If we just take opioid addiction coverage in Massachusetts, 2,000 people died from opioid overdoses last year. We are only 2 percent of America's population. If that number were to multiply across the whole country, that would be 100,000 people overdosing and dying. That would be two Vietnam wars of deaths in one year from one disease--a disease that we could begin to reverse if there were the treatment for families and if the prevention were put in place. Yet, if there is no treatment, if there is no prevention, if there is no access, then people, who otherwise would have been able to live normal lives with treatment, will now die.  If you have Alzheimer's, if you are in a nursing home, there is a very high probability--since two-thirds of all grandmas and grandpas in nursing homes are on Medicaid, if you slash Medicaid, the care that loved one is now receiving in a nursing home is going to be slashed. Grandma and Grandpa in that nursing home are going to see the services that they otherwise would have been provided not being available to them. That is what this Republican plan is going to do.  It says to a kid--a family member--with opioid addiction problems, it says to Grandma and Grandpa in a nursing home, it says to a woman who has cancer, it says to a man who has diabetes: I am sorry. We no longer can afford in America to help you get the healthcare you need.  We are better than that. We are a better country than that, and we are definitely a better country than our saying that we are going to take away that healthcare from all of those people and then give it as a tax break to billionaires. We are better than that. That is just wrong. So this is the battle, the most important battle.  In 1967, Martin Luther King said that the most important civil right was access to healthcare because health is the first wealth. Without health, you have nothing. That is what we are fighting for right now. We are fighting for that fundamental civil right for everyone.  This slashes coverage for those who are disabled in our country. We have made progress over the last generation in reconfiguring how we view the disabled in our country. We have given them access to the help they need so that they can be fuller citizens in our society. This bill slashes the funding to help 20 million disabled in our country live fuller, more functioning lives in order to give a tax break to a billionaire.  It is wrong. It must be stopped. We must put up the defense against this bill's ever becoming law. For the next 2 weeks, while they sit and plot to try to find a way of camouflaging what they are doing, the American people must rise up and say: No, America is better than that. We will not allow this to happen. God help us in 2017 in the United States of  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Rounds).

5671,topic-id,375,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about two very honorable lives, Paul Besaw and Lahiri Garcia, who were both taken from us far too soon by the criminal acts of one who was illegally in our country.  A death of our innocent neighbors is especially devastating when it could have been prevented had our immigration laws been upheld and had they been working.  Paul and Lahiri were paramedics in my community, dedicated to saving lives, but on January 1, a man illegally in our country, driving drunk, collided with their ambulance and killed both of them.  Paul left behind his loving wife, Dawn, and his 6-year-old daughter, Allison, who you see here behind me. When I spoke with Paul's widow, she rightfully said that if our country wasn't ``too afraid or inept to enforce immigration law,'' her husband would still be with her today, and she is absolutely right.  Lahiri's wife, Julie Garcia, told me how hard it was for her four children to not have their father this Father's She expected to grow old with her husband, but because this man wasn't sent home the first three times he was pulled over, she will no longer have that opportunity.  Both wives, both mothers, expressed to me sincere disbelief. They don't understand why this was allowed to happen, and, for the life of me, I can't understand why it is allowed either.  The bottom line is that this should never happen to anyone. Sanctuary cities are a violation of the rule of law, they are absolutely unacceptable, they[[Page H5322]]cannot be tolerated. We must enforce this rule of law.  It is, in fact, the right of every American to be protected by this government. It is not the right of anybody to spend one day, one moment, in our country illegally or without invitation.  Today, Congress is addressing this epidemic. Our bills, they crack down on dangerous sanctuary policies that put these kind of innocent lives at risk.  So let us ensure that unlawful immigrants convicted of crimes are, in fact, detained and are, in fact, deported.  Mr.Speaker, let's pass these bills. More importantly, let us be convicted that what happened to Paul and what happened to Lahiri is never allowed to happen again.                              {time}  1445  ",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5316.txt,99999999999999,NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT,2017.0,29.0,June

5394,topic-id,2197,"Madam President, I come to speak about healthcare, and I begin by paying tribute to our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, on his return earlier this week. I wish him the very best as he begins a process of cure, treatment, and a bright future in his life. I appreciate the remarks he indicated that were so heartfelt to his colleagues here in the We welcome him back and thank him for his service to the Senate, to the people of Arizona, to the people of America, but I also thank him most especially for his service in the U.military.  Another great hero in my life and in our country's history is my predecessor in the Senate, Senator Bob Dole, who earlier this week celebrated his 94th birthday. Service to Kansans and all Americans exemplify Bob Dole's life. While I admire him for his time in the Senate, I respect him even more so for his service to our country during World War II and for his efforts ever since then to care for those who have come into harm's way as a result of their service. I often see him at the World War II Memorial when there is an Honor Flight from Kansas or across the country, and he is such a role model for so many people.  Again, I admire him for his commitment to other veterans and to making certain that veterans receive the care and the gratitude that they deserve.  Madam President, one of the most important ways we can demonstrate that we honor those who served our country is by making certain that we live up to our commitment--the commitment that was made to them--to provide the benefits that they deserve, including access to timely and quality healthcare. Unfortunately, today, we find ourselves in another crisis moment in regard to veterans' healthcare and, in particular, the Veterans Choice Program, which was designated to provide access to veterans who were in danger of an inability to access that care because the VA did not provide the service, could not provide it in a timely manner, or the service was so far from where the veteran lived that he was unable to obtain that service because of distance.  So, in 2014, this Congress passed and the President then signed what has been labeled the Choice It came about in the wake of a scandal, particularly in Phoenix but across the country, in which we saw fake waiting lists and the belief that there were veterans who died as a result of not obtaining the care that they were entitled to in the VA system.  The Choice Program has helped thousands of veterans across the country, especially those in rural communities, where distance remains a problem. I have heard from many veterans in my State as to how important the Choice Program is to them. Instead of driving for 4 hours to see a physician at the VA, they can drive 4 minutes to see a physician in their hometowns.  This Choice Program is set to expire on August 7 of this year. Just a few days from now, it is scheduled to come to an end. At the start of 2017, the VA estimated that there would be more than $1 billion remaining in the Choice account that the VA told us would last until January 2018. Rather than letting those funds expire, I joined Senator McCain, Senator Isakson, Senator Tester, and others in a Choice extension bill to remove that August 7 deadline and sunset the program until the funds expired, which, as I said, was believed to be in January of 2018.  The President signed that bill on April 19, but less than 6 weeks later, we learned from the VA that the VA had made unfortunate miscalculations. As a result of poor budgeting and finance, the dollars for the Choice Program are not going to last until January and are soon to expire, just within the next few days. Demand for the Choice Program is up 30 or 40 percent, and it is clear by that increase in demand that veterans need Choice, that they like Choice, that it is working for them, and we now owe it to those veterans to make certain that the Choice Program continues and that the funds are available to accomplish that goal.  With Choice, the funds that they had anticipated would last until January now will run out sometime in August--we think in the next couple of weeks. Those depleted funds will mean that Kansas veterans and veterans across the country who have been using the Choice Program will no longer be able to, and it means that those who could use the Choice Program into the future will be without that option. We run the real risk--the likelihood is almost a certainty--that the Choice Program will be discontinued in a matter of days.  I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Veterans Affairs, and when I learned of the budget miscalculations, we immediately contacted the Secretary of the Department to get his understanding of the circumstance that we were in. We only learned of the shortfall after we learned that veterans at home were being denied access to the Choice The Secretary had made a decision to reduce those veterans who are eligible. We asked him to withdraw that guidance to his regional officers across the country, and he did. However, when the Secretary then testified before our subcommittee, the subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, we learned that new guidance had been issued because of the fear of depleting those dollars. It again limited the access of veterans to the Choice  We now hear of veterans who are forced to drive hours to get appointments at VA facilities when, just 2 weeks ago, they were receiving that care in their hometowns and in their neighborhoods--nearby opportunities that no longer exist.  Shulkin of the VA recognized that their projections and budgeting were off and must be fixed. I hope that turns out to be the result and that we have a better ability at the Department of Veterans Affairs to make the calculations necessary for Congress and the Department to make wise decisions. The system has to be fixed, and it has to be fixed quickly. There is an immediate crisis.  One of the things that now happens as a result of reduced use of Choice is that the networks that were created to support Choice--the third-party administrators of the Choice Program--because of a lack of volume, are no longer financially viable to stay in the business of being the network to connect the VA, the private sector, and the veterans in a way that cares for those veterans, gets them their appointments, and establishes the payment process by which the provider--the physician or the hospital--is paid.  This is not just a circumstance in which the third-party administrators can leave the business and return if we get our work done here and the VA Choice Program is defunded. Those networks will disappear, and we will not be able to easily restart the Choice Program, so if we do not make a fix shortly--today, tomorrow, by the weekend--and pass legislation in a timely fashion, it is not as if we can come back in September and say: Let's appropriate the money now, and Choice can restart.  It will not happen. Choice will be gone.  There are big consequences at play for the future of community care. The funding crisis and the inability to sustain Choice risk shutting down--shuttering--the entire networks, and it will diminish the faith that veterans and our providers were slowly beginning to have in the Choice Program.[[Page S4361]]  Early in the Choice Program, many veterans were discouraged because of the bureaucracy and paperwork associated with Providers then were not often paid in a timely fashion, and they became discouraged by the program. In recent months, that confidence in the program had returned as veterans were beginning to get their care at home, and providers were being paid for the services that they provided veterans. Now, if the third-party administrators--the network--go away, we will send one more message to veterans and to those who wish to serve them--the healthcare community--that the program is not a viable or a valuable one.  Fortunately, both the House and Senate have been working to fix this situation. Since June, my colleagues on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee have joined me in working to find a solution that protects access to community care for veterans. The Choice Program is funded by mandatory spending. We have also been working with the House as they have tried to develop a solution that maintains Choice and that is fiscally responsible.  There has been a lot of back and forth, a lot of conversation, a lot of talk, and a lot of negotiations going on, and I support the efforts of our chairmen and ranking members of the Veterans' Affairs Committees, both in the House and Senate, who are trying to work on an agreement to come together for our Nation's veterans. I would hope and I expect that a bill will come from the House yet this week.  My point to my colleagues here today is that we do not have the luxury of then trying to figure out something different to do than what the House sends us. We need to have our plan in place, and we need to have something that can pass both the House and Senate in the next 2 days. I want to motivate my colleagues to do what is right for veterans and set aside the differences that have prevented the necessary cooperation to see that we have one bill that can pass both the House and Senate and save  I stood here in 2014 to implore my colleagues to support the passage of the Choice Act in the first place, and I stand here again today to implore my colleagues to come together and support the passage of this critical funding for the continuation of the Choice Program and community care for veterans. I am here to make certain that we end the delays and find a way to understand the differences and accept that we must act quickly on behalf of veterans. It has to happen immediately. We owe our veterans better than what we have been providing them.  I am, once again, partnering with the Senator whom I honored in my opening comments--Senator McCain--and others to introduce legislation that will put funds back into the Choice Program and make sure that our veterans do not experience a lapse of care at home or a termination of the program.  We are working hard with our colleagues across the aisle and in the House to determine the future of this program and what community care will look like. While we work to create that system that will serve future generations of veterans for years to come--how we make Choice better--we cannot allow the program to expire at this critical point in time. Taking care of veterans must be a priority above any one specific ``ask'' or ``must have'' in the funding. Not acting is not an option.  Upon his return to the Senate, Senator McCain's words remind us of the importance of this task and many others before us. I am honored to work with him on this effort to save Choice and to serve our veterans. I ask my colleagues to help us save this important program that benefits rural and urban veterans, that makes care more timely, that provides care in the circumstances in which the VA does not have the capabilities, either in a timely or a quality fashion, to provide the services to veterans.  This does not diminish the role or necessity of the Department of Veterans Affairs or their hospitals and clinics across the country. Veterans continue to use VA hospitals, and they continue to use our outpatient clinics, but we ought not allow for the elimination of the third opportunity for veterans' care--the Choice Program--that serves so many veterans in so many communities.  Again, I thank Senator McCain for his leadership and his bipartisan work that originally created this program--this opportunity--with Senator  We seek bipartisanship to put veterans first and to put their healthcare access above everything else. I am urging my colleagues today to know that this issue exists, not to walk away from it, to make certain that we accomplish our goals, and that this critical funding be provided before we depart for the weekend.  Preserving this important benefit honors our heroes--Senator Dole, Senator McCain, and the thousands of Americans who did not ask about whether it was Republicans who served the country or Democrats who served the country. They are those who believe that having served their country is what motivated them to see that their families were safe and secure and to see that America had a bright future. We ought not deny them that kind of service today.

5600,topic-id,1013,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this evening to talk about winter storms that hit Kansas and surrounding States over the weekend, destroying crops and killing livestock. We face many challenges, and the Senator from Utah just described a serious circumstance for many people in this country. I applaud his efforts to try to find the solution.  The challenges that we face in Kansas after this weekend are another vivid reminder of the difficulties that each day our farm families and ranchers face trying to produce a crop or raise cattle. A farm family's economic situation can change in a moment's notice. What happened over the weekend was 17, 18, 20 inches of snow and high winds with a devastating blizzard, and it was preceded by temperatures into the twenties. The consequence to the wheat crop is dramatic.  A weekend weather event like this is often just an inconvenience for most people. However, it is the difference between having a crop to harvest or having nothing to sell. It is the difference between earning a living and not earning a living. It is the difference between staying on the farm or ranch and not being able to.  While the extent of the damage is being assessed--and we don't know exactly what that will be--it is clear that many wheat producers will likely have lost their entire crop. We have about 7.5 million acres of wheat planted in Kansas, and many of those acres--perhaps up to about half--were harshly impacted by this snowstorm and winter conditions.  Having a bountiful production is especially important for farmers at times of low commodity prices. That is what we are in now. The price of wheat, and the price of cattle, the price of corn, they are historically low. These are already challenging times. While the overall farm income, as a result of that, has been cut in half since 2013, Kansas producers fortunately were able to overcome that, to some degree, because we had bountiful harvests, great crops, high yields. Yet the number of bushels these producers will have to sell now as a result of these storms is clearly in question.  With low prices, we need high yields and large harvests. We clearly will not[[Page S2729]]have that. Those of us from ag States often talk about the importance of crop insurance and farm programs for producers. This storm reminds us, once again, the importance of that safety net. A farmer who lost an entire wheat crop over one weekend cannot afford to continue to farm without crop insurance to help cover the losses.  These farmers in Kansas would either go out of business or require ad hoc disaster assistance, something that used to happen during my earlier days in Every time there was a snowstorm, a freeze, a drought that devastated a crop, Congress was asked to provide ad hoc disaster assistance to make up for that challenge.  Giving farmers the ability to purchase affordable crop insurance means they have the ability to survive, to farm for another year. It is critical that we continue to promote and protect crop insurance in the upcoming farm bill.  Cattle producers and feeders also experienced losses due to this storm. About 75 percent of the cattle on feed in the country--75 percent of the cattle that are being fed in this country, ultimately for consumption in the grocery stores or restaurants, are located in the area hit by this winter storm. Feed lots are reporting the loss will total into the thousands of head of cattle. This impact comes only weeks after wildfires in Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma destroyed ranches and killed thousands of cattle just a few weeks back.  Farmers and ranchers are some of the most resilient people. They remain optimistic in times of very difficult circumstances. Facing potential disaster and adversity every year, these men and women continue to bear the burden of producing food, fuel, and fiber for our country and for the world.  I would offer my prayers to those farmers and ranchers harmed by the snowstorms and these prairie fires, and I would, once again, express my commitment to making sure they have the tools necessary to survive this and future weather disasters.  In discussing the challenges currently being faced by farmers, I also want to take a moment to mention my disappointment that the budget-neutral cotton provision was left out of the omnibus legislation that was released earlier this week and we expect to vote on tomorrow or the next day. As a result of the 2014 farm bill, cotton farmers, including those cotton farmers in Kansas, were no longer eligible to participate in title I of the farm programs.  Without an effective safety net, cotton producers have especially felt the impact of the downturn in the farm economy due to those low prices. For over a year, the cotton industry has worked with both authorizers and appropriators to fix the issues stemming from the 2014 farm bill.  So it is really discouraging when their proposals met with resistance at the very last minute, not because of the merits of the proposals but because of unrelated issues with dairy policy that were not resolved. I, too, want to strengthen the protection provided for dairy producers in the farm bill. Kansas is one of the fastest growing dairy-producing States in the  Helping cotton farmers ought not be contingent on issues with dairy policy. I have heard from a number of Kansas cotton producers about the importance of this proposal, and my message to them remains the same: I understand the economic hardship that they are facing, and I am committed to working with the new Secretary of Agriculture to find a solution to the cotton problems and issues they face, as well as many others facing farmers and ranchers today.  I ask my colleagues to keep in their thoughts and prayers those farmers and ranchers across the Nation who, through no fault of their own, are struggling today because of weather and fire.

5412,topic-id,559,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Chair, I rise in strong support of H.1695. This legislation would strengthen the Copyright Office and make it more accountable to Congress by turning the Register of Copyrights into a Senate-confirmed position.  Since 2013, under the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers, the Judiciary Committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of the copyright laws and the Copyright Over the course of 20 hearings with 100 witnesses, as well as listening sessions across the country, and individual meetings with a broad range of stakeholders, we have heard one consistent message: that the Copyright Office must be modernized to meet the needs of the public in the copyright community.  This bill is an important first step in that process, and it is appropriate that we consider it today on World Intellectual Property Day when we recognize the tremendous contribution that intellectual property laws, including copyright, make to our economy and to our creativity. But maintaining this vibrant copyright ecosystem depends on having an effective Copyright Office to oversee it. Throughout the copyright review process, it became evident that the current structure of the Office has hindered its ability to serve the public and the copyright community effectively.  For historical reasons, the Copyright Office is located in the Library of Congress, and the Register of Copyrights answers solely to the Librarian of As an institutional matter, this creates a conflict. Libraries are a key stakeholder in the copyright community, but they are one among many stakeholders, each with different priorities and interests. To place the Copyright Office in the hands of one interested party does a disservice to the copyright system it is charged with administering.  H.1695 would remedy this problem by making the Register of Copyrights a Presidential appointment subject to Senate confirmation. It would establish an open and transparent process for publicly vetting a nominee for Register and would allow the broad range[[Page H2870]]of copyright stakeholders to provide input through their elected  It would also strengthen the ability of Congress to provide meaningful oversight of the Copyright Office, and, by establishing a 10-year term for the Register, it would insulate the Office from any improper political influence.  It is particularly important that Congress have the final say in who serves as Register because, by statute, the Copyright Office serves as an expert adviser to Congress on copyright matters. The Office has played an invaluable role throughout the Judiciary Committee's copyright review process, and this bill would ensure that we continue to rely on independent advice from the Register as we make further reforms to the copyright laws.  Under current law, the selection of the Register is left entirely to the And since the Librarian serves at the pleasure of the President, it is really the President who can dictate the choice of Register if the Librarian wishes to keep her job. And the Register can be dismissed at any time by the Librarian, possibly at the direction of the  This bill serves as an important check on the President's power by removing his unfettered ability to name a Register, by requiring Senate confirmation of the position instead, and by giving the Register a fixed 10-year term.

5669,topic-id,386,"I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.3003. This legislation would withhold needed law enforcement funding from cities that choose not to assist Federal authorities in enforcing the immigration laws.  Besides being constitutionally suspect, this bill is also highly counterproductive. Recognizing that good policing depends on building trust with their residents, many cities forbid their law enforcement officers from questioning victims of crime or witnesses to a crime about their immigration status, and they do not share immigration information with Federal authorities.  They believe that their communities are at greater risk when a victim of domestic violence is afraid to ask the police for protection from her abuser for fear of deportation, or when witnesses to a murder refuse to assist law enforcement in tracking down the perpetrator because they are afraid their immigration status will be discovered.  These cities have concluded that taking on themselves the Federal responsibility to enforce immigration laws would destroy trust between immigrants and local law enforcement, which would make everyone less safe.  Perversely, this bill would punish these cities by denying them the funds that they need to protect public safety. Funding to hire new police officers, grants to combat the opioid crisis, and money to reduce the rape kit backlog could all be taken away under this bill. Not only does this raise serious constitutional concerns, it is simply bad policy that will lead to more crime, not less.  As if this were not bad enough, the bill would also authorize mandatory indefinite detention of certain categories of immigrants without sufficient due process even if they present no danger to their communities.  Indefinite detention is repugnant to our values of fairness and individual liberty, but this bill perpetuates the ugly myth that immigrants are more dangerous and likely to commit more crimes than native-born Americans, and it erodes the fundamental protections that we guarantee to all who are present in this country.  Instead of taking positive steps to improve communication between Federal, State, and local authorities, this bill demonizes immigrants, punishes communities that seek to build trust between immigrants and law enforcement, and authorizes indefinite detention of certain immigrants, all while making us less safe.  For each of these reasons, this bill should be defeated, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''  ",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5316.txt,850,NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT,2017.0,29.0,June

As written, this bill would deny critical funding for our police departments.

Any decrease in any sort of funding would decrease the safety of our officers as they strive to protect and serve our communities. This law will not only affect our police officers' safety, but it will negatively affect the sense of security in our communities.

I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congresswoman Ros- Mr.Speaker, this bipartisan resolution reassures our friends, it rebuffs our foes, and it reminds the world that America's commitment to NATO's common defense pledge is ironclad.  When President Truman signed the NATO Treaty nearly 70 years ago, he called the alliance, ``a long step toward permanent peace in the whole world.''  NATO has guaranteed the security of the American people and our allies for decades. Now some people don't remember what those decades were like, fighting the threat of communism. Article 5, the collective defense provision, is the core of that security guarantee.  Article 5, as the gentlewoman just mentioned, was invoked only once: when America's allies joined in the fight against al-Qaida after the September 11 terrorist attacks on our country.  I, like many of my colleagues, have traveled to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places and seen that our NATO partners have shed blood in the name of article 5 in our common fight against terrorism.  Our commitment to article 5 is a commitment to brave men and women across the world who risk and give their lives for the NATO alliance. Previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have strongly and unambiguously stood by NATO and article 5.  I was very sad, I will be very honest with you, my colleagues, when meeting with NATO leaders at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, a building dedicated to the victims of the 9/11 attacks, President Trump refused to clearly and unequivocally reassure our NATO partners that he would honor article 5.  We in this Congress of the United States, acting in a bipartisan way, want to remove all doubt that the U.commitment to the principles of a mutual defense embodied by NATO are ironclad. I keep using that word. Every day, Putin searches for cracks in our NATO alliance. We must convey to him that this alliance is ironclad.  And now, just on another related subject, it is about our national security. While we are glad to be passing this resolution affirming America's commitment to article 5, the bipartisan bill sanctioning Russia languishes in the While the White House caters to Putin, Congress must hold Russia accountable for its actions by passing the Iran-Russia sanctions bill. It passed the Senate 98-2--98-2--strong bipartisan support for a bill that contained the Iran and Russia sanctions.  We can't go home for the Fourth of July without passing that legislation. It is my understanding it was just a blue slip problem that could be easily resolved. That is how it was characterized when the President of Ukraine said to us that they really need the Russian sanctions enforced and strengthened.  Let us have the courage to stand up to those who menace the free world and stand by our partners in support of a peaceful, democratic, and free future for all.  What we are doing today is very important. It is not just about a bill. It is not just about an agreement. It is about values. It is about security as a value, something we take an oath to protect and defend. This NATO agreement helps us do that, but we must also do what flows from it and say to the Russians, who are the point of NATO, you are going to have sanctions because of your aggression in Eastern Europe, and at the same time send that message to the Iranians.[[Page H5213]]  Mr.Speaker, I urge a very strong unanimous vote for this. This is something so bipartisan, so wonderful. It is a good day. It is a good bill. It gives us all hope.  I urge our colleagues to vote ``aye'' and call upon the Speaker to bring the other bill to the floor. I hope our distinguished chair and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee will be able to be part of bringing it to the floor very soon.

Mr.Speaker, I am registering my support for Kate's Law and H.3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals--for Criminals--I support these bills for the sake of Kate Steinle and every single one of those who share her tragic fate.  She was murdered in broad daylight by a violent, criminal illegal alien. This was an easily preventable and heartbreaking crime, and we simply cannot fail the American people by refusing to act on these bills.  The government's first responsibility is the security and protection of our homeland, a duty that should not be abdicated or yielded based on convenience.  In 2011--2011--a GAO study found that aliens committed more than 25,000 homicides, more than 69,000 sexual offenses, 14,000 kidnappings, 42,000 robberies, and 213,000 assaults, among other offenses. Every single one of these is too many.  Very few things in this world we can get at 100 percent, but these are 100 percent preventable if these people would not have been here. These are preventable crimes, completely preventable, and we must stop the willful neglect of complacency by government officials who refuse to enforce existing--this is not new. This is existing law we are asking them to enforce, we are requiring them to enforce.  According to a March 2017 Washington Times article, nearly 500 jurisdictions have sanctuary policies that block--that block--that limit ICE from apprehending criminal aliens.  A January 2017 article from the Washington Examiner reported that, from January 2014 to September 2015, sanctuary jurisdictions rejected 17,000 ICE detainers. Those are 17,000 criminals that are out on the street that we know about that we let go.  Adding insult to injury, these sanctuary jurisdictions seek Federal funds to help them defy Federal law enforcement efforts to remove the dangerous criminal aliens from the streets.  Mr.Speaker, it is time to put Americans first, and we support the restoration of law and order by supporting these proposals.

5391,topic-id,699,"Mr.President, life is at its core a series of votes. We forget the mundane choices: what we wore to work or what we had for lunch last week. We remember the momentous choices, however: taking a new job or starting a family.  My colleagues in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle are here because they chose to answer the call of public service, and folks in our States chose us to represent them. Week in and week out, we choose how we will vote in committees, on the floor, on nominees, as well as on legislation. We choose to cooperate when we find consensus, and we choose to resist when we don't. We cast hundreds of votes every Congress, year in and year out. Some are memorable, and some are not.  One of the most memorable choices of my career in public service was voting for the Affordable Care Act--a bill that, while imperfect, I knew would literally save thousands of lives and help millions of Americans afford the health insurance they need. In the months and years since, I have heard countless stories from Michiganders whose lives were changed for the better as a result of this law.  A few weeks ago, I shared the story of a fellow Michigander named Stefanie is from Livonia and worked her entire adult life in the retail and restaurant industry. Stefanie had never been offered health coverage by her previous employers but was able to purchase a plan because of the Affordable Care  In December 2015, Stefanie's third-floor apartment caught fire, and an unthinkable choice was forced on her: Stay and die in the fire, or leap from a third-floor window in order to save her[[Page S4356]]life. Stefanie chose to jump. She sustained serious injuries, including a broken back and a shattered foot. Her total treatment costs came close to $700,000--an amount which would surely bankrupt nearly all Americans if they did not have health insurance. Because of the Affordable Care Act, Stefanie was able to receive treatment for her injuries and have a second shot at life.  Last week, Stefanie traveled to Washington, DC, and I had the honor of meeting with her in my office. Her family, friends, and others in the community had actually pulled together funds to send her here to Washington, DC, so she could share her story with me and with others in Congress firsthand. I can't imagine how painful it is for Stefanie to relive this trauma, but she chooses to share because she wants others to have access to the same care she had.  Any mother, father, sister, son, or daughter could someday face an unexpected emergency, just like Nobody chooses to get sick, and nobody should be denied health insurance when they need it.  Having health coverage afforded Stefanie a new lease on life. Instead of filing for bankruptcy due to her medical bills, Stefanie now plans to go back to school and become a paralegal. Stefanie and others just like her--like you and me--deserve to know that when we get sick or when we get hurt, we still have a shot at life.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle face a very difficult choice of their own. They can choose to do what is politically expedient by passing legislation tonight to repeal parts of the Affordable Care This would cause millions more Americans to go without insurance, create chaos in our insurance markets, and risk skyrocketing premiums. But my Republican colleagues can still do the right thing: Vote no on whatever flawed bill they finally put forward tonight, start over, work across the aisle in a bipartisan manner, keep what works, and let's fix what doesn't work.  I urge my Republican colleagues to think about people like Stefanie who will be hurt by repealing the Affordable Care I urge them to choose to work with us on a bipartisan healthcare plan that helps people by lowering premiums while expanding access to care.

5744,topic-id,769,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to offer my full support for H.2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  For more than 30 years, Federal funding, known as Perkins funding, has helped support career and technical education programs at the State and local level. This legislation reauthorizes that funding and makes needed improvements to ensure Perkins dollars are spent efficiently and effectively.  Mr.Speaker, I am a big believer in career tech programs for three simple reasons: They help prepare students for rewarding careers; they ensure American workers have the tools necessary for skilled trades that are foundational to our society; and they boost our economy by providing a quality workforce.  When it comes to higher education, we all know that there has been a silent stigma attached to not completing an academic degree at a 4-year university. For years, we were afraid to say that college isn't for everybody, when the truth is, career tech programs can actually lead many Americans to better quality of life.  Thankfully, I believe those days are over. Efforts like Mike Rowe's ``Go Build Alabama'' campaign has been tremendously successful in raising awareness and dispelling myths about the jobs that exist in skilled trades. This rising generation is showing signs of being more entrepreneurial, with a[[Page H5055]]willingness to work outside the box. Our programs have greatly improved over the years to offer training for careers our students are actually interested in.  Mr.Speaker, my State of Alabama is blessed with a strong network of community colleges offering a wide array of career training. Alabama Community College System has more than 79,000 students enrolled in CTE programs, and over 70 public high schools in Alabama are now offering CTE courses. They are working hand in glove with industry to make sure that the training matches the jobs that will be waiting for students when they complete their courses.  I visited one such program recently in Tallassee, a small town in central Tallassee High School administrators have worked tirelessly to build a program that serves the growing needs of local students. The city and county are working together to improve facilities and make sure students have access to transportation.  Up until now, students in Tallassee have had to take a bus 30 minutes away to Wetumpka, or even an hour away to Montgomery to Trenholm State, to access these career tech courses. Now, thanks to the hard work of Tallassee's leaders and educators, students are beginning to access these programs right in their own hometown.  I visited another thriving career-type program a few months ago in Geneva, a small town in Alabama's Wiregrass region. Geneva High School has partnered with the Alabama National Guard, whose local armory serves as a training site for high-demand skills, such as automotive technology, welding, aviation maintenance, and health science. Students from city and county schools can get ahead on their college coursework via dual enrollment with Lurleen Wallace Community College or Enterprise  Geneva and Tallassee are not alone in their commitment to our students. Dothan's Wallace Community College offers training in 16 high-demand career fields. Wallace takes their programs to the next level by combining traditional study with hands-on experience. Their criminal justice program, for example, utilizes a virtual law enforcement training simulator, the only of its kind on an Alabama college campus.  These programs serve as a model, not only for the State of Alabama but for the Nation as a whole. Their successes demonstrate the potential career-type programs hold.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is so much more than just funding. It makes important improvements to our career tech policy, including: simplifying the application process that community and State leaders have to navigate in order to receive Federal funds; providing more flexibility to administrators so they can adjust to the needs of the students and the industry; improving accountability and transparency to ensure that the programs that we are funding actually deliver results; and, lastly, ensuring a limited Federal role in education, just as we did in the new K-12 law.  Mr.Speaker, with the modern workplace changing at a rapid pace, it is imperative that educators and facilities keep up. With this bill, these programs can continue to successfully connect today's students with the careers of tomorrow.  Mr.Speaker, we have an opportunity to take the next step in career and technical education today. The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act will help equip our students with skills, knowledge, and experience they need to start their careers.

5536,topic-id,5555,"Mr.Speaker, there is a lot of discussion as we gather to talk about the role of government and almost everything that we do day to day. I think most Americans, as they go to work and they look at how the government's role is in their lives, they don't really give the government a lot of thought. They want to be left alone.  They are willing to pay some measure of taxes to have things that we all agree on, like schools, roads, bridges, stoplights, national defense, other things. We like to see efficient government. We like to see it small. We like to see it without waste.  If there are things that other services can provide without it being done by government, we like choices. We like privatization. We like the private sector.  But there are certain things, Mr.Speaker, that the government does have a role in. This was recognized by perhaps the finest American we ever produced, Abraham Lincoln, when he said: ``The legitimate object of government is to do for the people what needs to be done, but which they can not, by individual effort, do at all, or do so well, for themselves.''  Mr.Speaker, there are three sectors in which the government does have a role; and we as conservatives might want limited government, efficiency, and lack of waste, and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would want similar things, but they might approach it a different way. We all, as Americans, have a moral obligation to protect the security of the United States of We have just seen that with the passage of the National Defense But what I would like to address today is a breach in one of our pillars of national security with a proposal with our aerospace.  The three areas that we must safeguard and protect are our national defense, our national intelligence, and our national aerospace.  We are considering now an AIRR Act, H.2997, which would take the Federal Aviation Administration's reauthorization, which we have to do, and it will pretty much remove Federal control of air traffic controllers and the control of our aerospace and put it into private industry. Many of us, in a bipartisan fashion, have grave concerns with this. I am one of them.  If you look at H.2997, what you will find is that the President has diminished authority. In the 1980s, when air traffic controllers, through their unions, went on strike and they said, ``We are not going to play; we are going to picket,'' and it put the United States at risk, Ronald Reagan warned them by saying, ``If you do that, you are fired.''  They said, ``Oh, he is not going to do that. How is he going to control the skies?''  The President, acting on his constitutional responsibilities, fired them. He took control, as he should have, and air traffic controllers, by the thousands, were removed, and others were put in their place.  H.2997 would remove this type of authority that the President of the United States would have. If this bill were to become law, President Reagan would not have been able to do what he did in the 1980s.  It also removes title 31 authority. What is that? Well, title 31 authority is how we, through the appropriations process and through the power of the purse, control and oversee government so that we, the people, and their duly-elected representatives are able to control the aspects and agencies of government; because without this, without this power of the purse and without this powerful oversight tool, you might have bureaucracies become an entity unto themselves.  So title I authority is vital that we have those hearings, controls, measures, and prohibitions so that even if something is decided on, money is not authorized, and, therefore, it gets shut down. Title 31 authority in H.2997 would be removed.  There are also no other oversight provisions that would be put in its place. Why? Because what it is doing is it will take the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic control system and it will put it into the hands of a private company.  Now, I am all about privatization in business and choices, and there are a lot of things. But going back to the Lincoln quote, there are certain collective things that we cannot do as individuals and that the government has a role.  If waste, inability to procure, inability to modernize, or inefficiencies were a condemnation to privatize everything, then why don't we just privatize national defense? They waste money. They have trouble procuring. They have trouble modernizing. Why don't we just turn over national defense to the private sector?  We would never do such a thing because it would place all of us at risk.[[Page H5873]]Yet we are going to take the national aerospace control of the skies, and as it stacks up--and there is a lot that goes on up there, as I will illustrate--we are going to put that into the hands of a private company.  This private company would have a board, but it will not have title I authority oversight, and under its current form, the President will have diminished authority only in time of war to take control of the aerospace system.  This is a bad idea.  It also transfers all DOD intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense intelligence agencies, Homeland Security support to this private entity.  Today, the FAA does a lot of things with their air traffic controllers. What do they do? At any given moment, and as many of you flew into Washington, D.C., to come and see your government at work, you flew on an airline. Sometimes there are delays. You get it. There is weather. There are different things. Other times, you are sitting there and it is clear as a bell and you are wondering what is the holdup.  Part of the reason, unknown to even the pilots on the tarmac, is that there are missions that our military performs. There are national intelligence missions that are being performed and surveillance missions that are being performed. There are homeland security and border security missions that are being performed.  When they take priority, they also take priority for air traffic control and the clearances, and many times things will have to be rerouted to accommodate it. The American public and even the pilots on the planes are none the wiser.  Now, under H.2997, the problem that you will have is that all of this authority will now be coordinated with a private entity. I will explain why this is a problem in a moment.  As a conservative, I am all about privatization where it makes sense, but when it comes to national security, as a combat infantryman, a veteran of three wars, someone who served my country in uniform for 21 years, we must protect this great Republic, and there is a role for the United States Government when it comes to our national security.  When we have strayed from this and tried to privatize certain sectors, our greatest embarrassments with national intelligence have been when we have contracted to private entities for that collection. Think Edward Think leaks in government with classified information getting out.  Where is that occurring? It is occurring with subcontractors and private entities who we were assured when we passed these laws: Oh, they will be under the same agencies, under the same systems, and everything will be fine. Trust us.  And then we in Congress have authorized that. And then what? We sit at our hearings and our committees with our bony fingers and our red faces, saying: Mr.Secretary or Mr.Agency Head, how did you let this happen?  All we have to do is look in the mirror. When we take these controls away on things that we must have a government role in--defense, intelligence, and aerospace--we are creating the very construct that causes these problems.  Our alliances were shaken. Our country was embarrassed. Our intelligence was placed at risk. Operators in the field were exposed, some even harmed, because contractors let it get out of hand.  Look at national defense. We see some of the same things. Some of the most embarrassing episodes that we have had have been with security contractors in national defense. We were told: Hey, you don't have time for that; we don't have the budget for that; we can do this more efficiently; you don't need to do this. Yet some of the most black-eyed moments have been with contractors.  Well, what about on the administrative side? That would make sense.  I see my colleague, Representative Ted Lieu here. He and I have been very frustrated in seeing some of these types of decisions being made with contracting. The Office of Personnel Management: Hey, let's take this away from the Department of Defense, and let's move all of these classified personnel records, and we will have a clearinghouse, and we can contract that. Everything will be good. You don't have to devote time and treasure to do this.  Yet 25 million exposed records later of those that held security clearances--Mr.Lieu and I both receiving a letter in the mail saying that we had been exposed because we held top secret clearances in the military. And yet when we made these decisions, we said this will be really good if we move this to contracting. It will be more efficient. It will save us money, and it will be just as good. Well, that was not the case.  So now that takes us to national aerospace. What are we talking about here? Tens of thousands of aircraft in the air in flights every single day.  And if it is so broken a system, when was the last time a major, fatal airline crash happened? Can't remember? You would have to go back a ways, which I will cover in a moment. But let's stick with these national security concerns.  H.2997 diminishes the power of the President, takes away title I authority, does not replace it with any other congressional controls. Sure, it has congressional review for fee changes or rulemaking, but nothing else.  It transfers Department of Defense, Intelligence, Homeland Security, Border Security, all of these things, and it places them under a coordination with a private entity. And they assure us, oh, it will be the same system we have now; everything is going to be just fine.  But the problem is that a private entity, unlike today--did you know every air traffic controller in an air traffic control tower takes an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States?  Most people didn't even know that, to include those that crafted H.2997.  They take an oath of office. They have to be a United States citizen. Why? Because it is vital to our national security.  Now we want to change that because it is efficient, and it is a broken, archaic system.  Well, we are all about modernizing. That is common ground we can all agree on. We need to modernize. But we do not need to go the direction that H.2997 has, this AIRR  My issues with the bill are purely on policy.  There are excellent people that have worked this issue for a number of years. They have the right motives and the right reasons for approaching this issue. But when it comes to national security, we also have a constitutional and moral requirement to support and defend our great Republic, and here is where some of that is put at risk. Let me enumerate a few of them for you.  Air traffic controllers and managers who work in air traffic control facilities across the country are routinely involved in operations that deal directly with the national security of the United How so? Well, most Americans, to include Members of Congress, are not even aware of this facet of their work.  For instance, prior to the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom--this is a true story--an FAA supervisor placed a number of flight plans in front of an air traffic controller in Kansas Those flight plans were for B-2 Stealth bombers that were about to depart from Whiteman Air Force Base, fly across the Atlantic and drop their bombs in Afghanistan, opening the rounds of our response to 9/11, and then they would come back to Whiteman Air Force Base in                              {time}  1230  Now, if you and I were sitting on the tarmac in the Kansas City airport and looking outside, we would say, ``Wow, what is the holdup?'' totally oblivious.  Yet this is important work. And their mission was obviously classified at that time, but it was FAA U.Government air traffic controllers--not private contractors, not private company citizens--controllers and managers working these aircraft in U.airspace many hours prior to the start of the armed conflict.  Every time Air Force One takes off from Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., carrying very important people, to include the President of the United States, it is an FAA U.Government air traffic controller clearing that aircraft for takeoff. Not just clearing it, then it is an FAA U.Government air traffic controller and manager who ensure the security of the airspace flown by the world's most famous symbol of freedom, the shiny[[Page H5874]]blue and white Boeing 747 used by Air Force One and Two as a secure way to transport our President, our Vice President, other officials, as they are called and closely monitored by the FAA and other air traffic controllers and managers anytime Air Force One or Marine One aircraft are airborne.  These are operations that go unseen. Many of them and the aspects of them are obviously classified and we could never go into here. But they are vital to our security. They should not be put in a private corporation's hands where there is no oversight and no control.  The FAA air traffic controllers and managers routinely provide airspace security, sometimes for hours on end, at locations across the country as the FBI or State and local law enforcement perform classified missions using government aircraft. In some cases, not even other aircraft know about those missions or what it is that they are conducting, depending upon the sensitivity of what it is that they are doing or is being performed.  U.air traffic controllers, government employees, and managers also participate in drug interdiction operations with the Drug Enforcement Administration as well as Customs and Border This might involve providing intercept vectors due to drug aircraft, drug lords trying to sneak things in or whatever it might be, and that has to alter flight plans and do very complicated things.  It might also involve protecting the airspace for drone operations. Many people are unaware that the FAA U.Government-Employed air traffic controllers and managers are also responsible for military flights, not just the kind that I described at our bases and airports, but this includes special-use airspace that maybe has been delegated to the United States in other countries, or to do flight training, refueling, attack and bombing missions. And these same government-employed air traffic controllers and managers are responsible for military aircraft on secret missions, to include drones and drone killers.  They are responsible for the aircraft of military uses to communicate with our nuclear infrastructure so that if we have to, God forbid, defend the Republic in that manner, they are right there in that loop of that system, not some private company.  They are also responsible for the airspace above the areas where our missile defense capacities occur and the testing systems that go on with that. You can see why handing these coordinations over to a private company might be a little problematic.  And then let's look at September 11, 2001. It was FAA U.Government air traffic controllers and managers who were responsible for putting over 4,000 aircraft on the ground almost immediately, in very short order, after America was attacked by terrorists using planes as weapons, killing 3,000 of our fellow citizens. But it was the rapidity of response because of the way the network is that they were able to make instant decisions, not having to coordinate through some private corporation, that they were able to do so. And I will speak more about that.  The airspace above this very Capitol and above the White House, the Supreme Court, and all the monuments that you have enjoyed as you have come to Washington, D.C., or as you work here, the symbols of our Republic, are closely watched over by the FAA, and they are air traffic controllers and managers who have sworn an oath, unlike people in private companies. They don't swear oaths. Employees of private corporations do not take oaths, nor do they promise to defend against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  Privatizing the U.air traffic control system will not enhance our country's national security.  Unfortunately, the national security role that FAA controllers and managers perform every day is not well known, even among Members here. But one could list a number of functions that our government performs where we do have a vested interest, the people, in saying we give this authority, we the people, to the government because we can't do this as individuals. The Federal Government does have a role.  So is it about modernization or is it about privatization? We are all in agreement on modernization, but privatization, I am afraid, Mr.Speaker, that a lot of us are like a pack of dogs lapping up antifreeze. It smells good, it might even taste good, but it is not without drastic consequence.  Just this week, we narrowly missed having to vote on this bill in its current form next week. This is why I am bringing these points out, so that we do not make this grave mistake that will breach our national security. Well-meaning people, friends, colleagues, people with just as much passion as I may have, but yet we the people have to take a step back and protect our national security.  There are also, in H.2997, no provisions to prohibit in this private corporation foreign nationals working in it. Today, if you are going to be an air traffic controller, you have to be a United States citizen. You have to take an oath of office. Under a private corporation or whom they subcontract with for air traffic control, this bill, were it to become law--and it cannot, we must prevent it--what would happen is there are no prohibitions in that law against foreign nationals guiding your skies or taking an oath of office where they are as committed to our Republic, Mr.Speaker, as any of us with the oaths that we have to take.  The national security concerns are paramount. Until we address them, we should not rush in. We want modernization.  I applaud the President of the United States for wanting to bring this issue to the light of the public. We need modernization. We agree with that. In fact, just knowing that we have his support to move towards a modernized plan gives us great comfort because we need that backing from the  But we have to address these national security issues, and right now, this bill does not do that. Even if it did address all of these, there is still a question that remains: Has the government demonstrated that it cannot control the skies and that the FAA's air traffic control system and its controllers are incapable of keeping us safe?  I can see if it is something that is broken and we have to intervene as government and make sure it is more efficient and we have to do the right thing, but in this case, where is all of this brokenness that we are hearing about? Sure, archaic equipment--been there and done that serving in the military. As you heard Chairman Thornberry say today, half of the Air Force's aircraft would qualify for antique license if they were civilian aircraft and registered in  As a soldier, I live by the motto, ``I will fight with what I have, and I will win where I fight.'' Whether it is with flintlocks, hatchets, modern rifles, or modern technology, poor is the workman who blames his tools. And our FAA air traffic controllers do a marvelous job with the systems they have.  That is why almost a decade ago we worked towards the next-generation system to modernize, and it is on track with procured funding like NASA has because it is expensive stuff and it takes time. You don't want that subject to funding problems.  The FAA, as a whole, has those funding problems. You have a continuing resolution or a government shutdown like in 2013, wow, that creates ripples. But if it is about modernization of our control towers, it is on track for the pilots that we might have.  And I know, Mr.Speaker, you have put yourself at the wheel of planes, and in this case there are a lot of things that we can see where the FAA does a marvelous job. It doesn't mean that we have to privatize it.  On 9/11, over 4,000 planes were grounded immediately and safely. What a lot of Americans don't know, Mr.Speaker, is that the FAA's national operations manager who made that unprecedented gutsy call, he was a government employee, you know, one of those bloated government employees we have got to fire and move out. His name was Ben And guess what? That was his first day on the job as the FAA's national operations manager. Wow, what a first day.  But he was good. He had taken an oath to the He made a gutsy call; 4,000 planes put on the ground, and it helped keep our Republic safer, because it could have been worse.  The FAA has clearly demonstrated through its air traffic control system that it can handle the job. When was the last time we can remember a fatal[[Page H5875]]accident with a major carrier? 2009, and that was a regional carrier.  But also in 2009 there was something else that happened. On the 15th of January, 1 month before the fatal accident in February in Buffalo, New York, with the regional carrier, which was the last time we had a major fatal accident, that was US Air Flight 1549, piloted by Captain Chesley Sullenberger and copiloted by Jeff  So what we have seen and what we all know is that the heroism of those two pilots that day put the plane down in the Hudson, saving all onboard. And we saw air traffic controllers doing everything with an emergency at one of the busiest airports, providing so many options.  Well, Mr.Sullenberger, like so many of us, has grave concerns with H.2997. This is not a man that has any government interest or privatization this or that or is up here lobbying or doing anything, yet he is somebody America trusts.  You might be interested in some of his comments, and I am quoting Captain Sully here.  He says: ``My real issue, and I think for many people, is that we have a wonderful and unique freedom in this country, this unfettered, wonderful aviation system that anyone can participate in safely and efficiently. In most countries, it's either too restrictive or too expensive for an average person to fly, and the only way you can go is on an airliner or military flight,'' meaning other nations. ``It's just prohibitively restrictive or expensive to do it any other way. That's something that we need to protect and preserve, and so why in the world would we give the keys of the kingdom to the largest airlines?''--under this H.2997 he is referring to. ``Because they definitely have their own agenda to lower their costs. Commercial aviation, airline aviation, has become an extraordinarily cost-competitive industry globally, and it becomes more so day by day.''  ``By removing oversight of the air traffic control system from the FAA and much of the oversight that Congress currently has,'' Mr.Sullenberger goes on to state, ``and giving it to a group of people, stakeholders basically controlled by the largest airlines, to control access to and pricing of access to the air traffic control system. That is an extreme solution to what's really a political budget problem.''  Captain Sully goes on to say, ``It means bad things for everyone who flies, but especially for people who fly in non-airline ways,'' meaning general aviation.                              {time}  1245  ``That is a big part of the system,'' he says. To continue his quote: ``I am worried about access. I am worried about equitability. I am worried about safety.'' Okay, to pause in his quotations here, Captain Sully was the guy on safety. He would go around and this was his job in the airlines. No man was better when it came to safety standards. And then he demonstrated it that day, that he knew what he was talking about.  For him to make these kinds of comments, I think we need to take pause, and take a step back, and listen. To continue his quote: ``There are other, better ways to solve this political budget problem--by giving the FAA, in running the air traffic control system and making capital improvements to the air traffic control system, more predictable multiyear funding--without giving away the keys to the kingdom to the largest airlines to control access and fees and pricing too.''  Mr.Speaker, I agree with Captain I think he knows something about it. That is an area we can all agree on. American aviation would suffer terribly without the benefit of the public structure of the air traffic control system, including its accountability to Congress, and the  Establishing a private air traffic control company, corporation, board, outside the purview of Congress, with the unilateral power to collect fees without controls from the government, and distribute service, would threaten our national security--as I have spoken to already--accessibility and affordability of flights, not maybe immediately in the transition, but, as you read H.2997, it goes on to say that they can do a lot of things in a couple of years.  Pilot generation. Look at general aviation in the examples that they use for comparisons. Many of the proponents of this bill say: Look at Look at  I love the Canadian people. I have traveled through most of I even lived in Germany as an exchange student.  Yes, in Germany today, a pilot can go from 35,000 feet in Lufthansa or an airliner, and he can glide all the way down to Tempelhof Airport in Why? Because he doesn't have Steve Russell, Mr.Speaker, out there in his Cessna 140 in the way. Guess what? In the United States, I have as much right to airspace as a U.citizen flying as that Lufthansa pilot, who is, by the way, just coming here to deliver passengers, or any other airline pilot.  That is the beauty of our system. What you won't find in Germany is general aviation. You won't find access. And as Captain Sully correctly stated, it is a wonderful thing. We have access to that. It is one of our hallmark freedoms in the United  Now, when he says that we will be handing over the keys to the kingdom, what he means is that it goes to this private corporation, this board, and then they will, for commercial interests, set up--what does that board look like? Well, here it is, right out of the bill.  It will have six of its board members who will be on the commercial side of aviation. Now, I have nothing against commercial aviation. American Airlines, love them, they brought me home from three wars. I will always have those memories.  Regional carriers probably brought many folks listening to this today. But they have commercial interests, as Captain Sully correctly stated. They will be concerned about those issues. That's fine. They run businesses. They don't have to protect our national security. They fly.  And so what we see with this board is six of them in the commercial side--commercial, regional jets. And then you have got one general aviation, and then one on the business side, which could support general aviation or not. But that clearly, as you lay out the board, two that will be appointed by the Secretary of Transportation--kind of his only say in a lot of this process--and then two that will be appointed by the board itself.  So what you will have is a two-thirds lopsided board that will favor the commercial interests rather than aviation as a whole. This is why Captain Sullenberger, and so many others, have had grave concerns about what it does to our freedoms for flying.  Now, much of my protest against this bill will have been because of the national security pieces. We could lay all of this other stuff aside. We have to solve these national security pieces in the bill, and right now, they are not there.  With modernization, we can get to some of that, but we have the safest airspace in the world. Where is this broken, archaic system that we hear people saying? Canada, love the I have driven the Alcan twice. I have been through so much of the country, driven 1,200, 1,300 miles on a dirt road in Canada, a wonderful place. I have lectured in many of their cities in a former life.  But Canada has the population of Texas, and if you were to look at the number of flights it handles each day, probably less flights than Yes, they have a modern system. We are having a modern system with What we need to do is solve the acquisition pieces, the modernization pieces--not the privatization pieces.  Why? We all know that much of North America's security is secured by the United States of They don't have to face the same things. That is why they can get away with such a small military. It is not an indictment. It is just the truth.  The bill in question, H.2997, strips oversight authority of our national airspace from the President, the Congress, and gives it to this unelected board of individuals, an action that would threaten the United States' ability to maintain the integrity of our airspace, as I spoke to earlier, Mr.Speaker, on what goes on at altitudes and in missions that most of us really have no clue.  It puts at risk thousands of missions that our military conducts in just[[Page H5876]]training and safety in our skies every day. It gives private contractors access to classified data.  Let's go back to what we were talking about with Edward Snowden with the leaks that we are seeing out of the intelligence services these days. Where is that coming from? It is coming from the private contractors. It goes lateral.  Do you think it is going to be any different because we here in Congress say: Oh, no, no, no? Hey, it is going to be great. This is going to be--rest assured, and I can already predict what is going to happen, Mr.The disasters will strike. We will sit in Oversight and Government Reform with bony fingers and red faces going: How did you let this happen? And all we have to do is look in the mirror, because we are much like dogs lapping up antifreeze, to lick up something that smells good, tastes good, with drastic consequences.  If we want to maintain the safest and best airspace in the world, we have to prevent the passage of H.2997. Now, this is hard for me to do. Why? Because I don't like opposing my own party. I don't like opposing my friends. I have done some terrible things in my life as a soldier. I don't like conflict anymore. I try to stay as far away from that as I can, and there are two veterans over here giving me thumbs up--combat veterans themselves.  But I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United I am not saying if you support this bill you are unconstitutional, or that you don't love your country, or that you don't want to protect the I am not suggesting that at all. I have too many friends who have a counterview to mine. But it is my responsibility to expose what is in this bill and why it is dangerous, and why we can't do it.  Mr.Speaker, we need to call on the American public and have them contact their Members of Congress and tell them to oppose H.2997, to not let privatization of our air traffic control system happen; to keep it into the role that, like Abraham Lincoln said, sometimes things that we can't do ourselves, we need to do collectively, and the government has a role in that. Mr.Lincoln obviously knew what he was talking about.  Modernization, we can all agree on that. Let's work on that. I applaud the President for bringing this issue to the fore. We need to deliver that win for him.  But breaching national security of our airspace and risking our safety on an unproven system is not a win. Mr.Speaker, it is not something that we need to support.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-14-pt1-PgH5872-3.txt,2265,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,14.0,June
5587,topic-id,556,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2664, a bill to assist the United States Department of Labor in identifying and preventing cases of human trafficking.  I thank Chairman Walberg for his leadership on this issue and for introducing this legislation of which I am an original cosponsor. As chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions of the Education and the Workforce Committee, Mr.Walberg and I have found common ground on a number of important issues facing the American people, and human trafficking is one of them.  We may think that human trafficking is something that occurs in far-off countries. And, yes, according to the International Labor Organization, there are 21 million men, women, and children around the world who are currently subjected to forced labor. Unfortunately, however, the injustice of human trafficking happens right here at home in the United States as well.  Polaris, a nonprofit that operates the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline here in the United States received reports of over 8,000 cases of human trafficking in our country last year, an increase of 35 percent over the year before.  I have seen cases of this terrible scourge firsthand in my own district, the Northern Mariana A number of construction companies lured foreign workers to come to the Marianas with false promises and misrepresentations about pay and conditions.[[Page H5487]]The companies then withheld the employees' wages and confiscated their passports. The workers were subjected to horrible working conditions, crowded unsanitary barracks with barely enough food and water. They were forced to work in unsafe conditions, suffering serious injuries without access to adequate medical care. There was even a workplace fatality.  To their credit, the Department of Labor's OSHA and Wage and Hour divisions have worked to address these injustices, issuing fines and citations, recovering back wages. But we need to identify human traffickers and prevent cases like this before they happen.  That is the purpose of our bill, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking H.2664 directs the Department of Labor to train appropriate Department staff on how to detect human trafficking, and ensure that these staff people get regular updates on how traffickers are adjusting to avoid detection.                              {time}  1515  Our bill establishes training for a clear course of action for referring cases of suspected human trafficking to the Department of Justice and other appropriate authorities so these offenders are prosecuted.  And the bill requires the Department to report back to Congress within a year on the progress that is being made because Congress needs to do more than simply enact programs with lofty goals. We also need to build in mechanisms to tell us whether our programs are working as intended.  Mr.Speaker, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act will, I believe, give the Department of Labor the tools and resources it needs to combat human trafficking. I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.  I would like to also thank the leadership of the House, especially Chairwoman Virginia Foxx and Ranking Member Bobby Scott of the Education and the Workforce Committee, for moving this bill to the floor. And again, I thank my friend, Chairman Walberg, for his leadership in this important area of public policy.  I reserve the balance of my time.

5393,topic-id,5463,"Mr.President, let me begin by taking a moment to kind of summarize for the American people where we are in this enormous discussion which is causing a great deal of anxiety all over Vermont and all over  Several months ago, the Republican-led House passed by, I believe, three votes legislation that would throw 23 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently have--23 million Americans, men, women, and children, people who are struggling with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and with other life-threatening illnesses. They would simply be thrown off of the health insurance they have.  That legislation also cut Medicaid by $800 billion over a 10-year period. That means children with disabilities in Alaska or Vermont who are now on Medicaid might no longer be able to get the help they need in order to survive or to live a dignified life. At a time when Medicaid provides two-thirds of the funding for nursing homes all over this country, it means that if the Republican legislation were to succeed, we don't know, but thousands and thousands of people all over this country with Alzheimer's, with terrible illnesses, who are now in nursing homes would be thrown out of their nursing homes.  Where would they go? Nobody really knows. When you cut Medicaid by $800 billion and Medicaid funds two-thirds of nursing home care, needless to say, people in nursing homes would be forced to leave, to go--nobody knows where.  Right now in my State of Vermont and across this country, we are dealing with a massive heroin and opioid crisis. Every day, people are dying from heroin, opioid overdoses. It turns out that Medicaid is the major source of funding in terms of treating heroin and opioid addiction.  If you make massive cuts to Medicaid, the impact in States like Vermont, West Virginia, Kentucky--States that are struggling with opioid and heroin addiction--would be horrendous. People would no longer be able to get the treatment they need.  I recall, during the campaign, Donald Trump said that he was a champion of working families; he was going to stand up for workers, take on the establishment. If the Republican House bill were to be passed, older workers--people who are 60, 62 years of age--would see, in many cases, at least a doubling of the premiums they pay. In many cases, they would go from $4,000 a year today to over $8,000 a year. That is not being a champion or a friend of the working class.  My Republican friends, and you hear them even today, talk about freedom, choice. They love choice. They love freedom. People in America should have the right to get healthcare anyplace they want. It should be a right to have any insurance policy they want.  Two and a half million women have made a choice. The choice they have made is they want to get quality healthcare through Planned If the Republican bill in the House were to pass, those 2.5 million women would be denied their choice.  You have a Republican bill in the House that throws 23 million people off of health insurance. How many of those people will die? My Republican friends get very nervous when I raise that issue because they say--and I understand it--nobody here wants to see anyone die unnecessarily. No Republican does, no Democrat, no American does.  According to study after study, including studies done at the Harvard School of Public Health, when you throw 23 million people off of health insurance--people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes, people with life-threatening illnesses--what do you think will happen? What these studies show is that thousands and thousands of Americans every year will die unnecessarily because they will not have the treatment they need to deal with their life-threatening illnesses. That is the reality. That is not Bernie Sanders talking. That is study after study. PolitiFact backed that up. They looked at all of the studies. They said: Yes, thousands of people will die. That is the result.  In the House bill, after you throw 23 million people off of health insurance, raise deductibles, defund Planned Parenthood, after you make older people pay more for healthcare, $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid, what else is in the bill?  Oh, there are some people who will do well in the bill--not the children, not the elderly, not the sick, not the poor. But there are some people--and we have to acknowledge that--who would do well under the Republican bill; that is, if you are in the top 1 percent. Republican legislation, after throwing disabled children off of healthcare, congratulations--you are going to get a massive tax break.  Who in America believes that it makes sense to throw disabled children off of health insurance and tell people with cancer that they can't continue to get the treatment they need in order to get $300 billion in tax breaks for the top 1 percent and hundreds of billions more in tax breaks for insurance companies and drug companies?  Do you know what? My Republican colleagues may think that is a good idea. That is not what the American people believe. The latest poll that I saw, the USA Today poll, had 12 percent of the American people thinking that was a good idea. I can only believe those 12 percent had not really looked at this issue. There is massive opposition from Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to this absurd Republican proposal.  It is not just the American people who think that it is absurd to give tax breaks to the rich and throw 23 million Americans off their health insurance. It is not just the American people. It is[[Page S4357]]those people who are most engaged in healthcare in America--the people who know the most.  It is important to understand that throughout this process, whether in the House or in the Senate, virtually every major healthcare organization in America--the people who treat us every single day are opposed to this Republican legislation.  One might think that maybe my Republican colleagues would say: Well, wait a second. What is going on when those in the American Medical Association--our doctors, the people who treat us--think this legislation is a mistake? Doctors say no. The American Hospital Association says no because they understand that when you make massive cuts to Medicaid, rural hospitals in Vermont and all over this country may go under. Then what happens to a rural community that no longer has its hospital?  The American Hospital Association is opposed to this legislation. The American Cancer Society is opposed to this legislation. They know what its impact will be for folks who are struggling with cancer. The American Heart Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Catholic Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National MS Society, and the American Nurses Association--one might think, when virtually every major national healthcare organization in this country is opposed to legislation, that maybe, just maybe, my Republican colleagues might think twice about going forward.  In this process, they have not had the opportunity, amazingly enough, to hear from doctors, to hear from hospital administrations, to hear from patient advocates. As you well know, despite the fact that we are dealing with an issue that impacts every single American--which is what healthcare does--an issue that impacts one-sixth of the American economy, over $3 trillion a year, there has not been one hearing, one public hearing on this bill. This bill has been written behind closed doors. Senator McCain the other day made that point.  How do you deal with one-sixth of the economy and their desire to transform the American healthcare system without listening to one doctor, without listening to one hospital administration, writing a bill with a few Republican Senators behind closed doors?  This is an unprecedented and disastrous process for healthcare. On those grounds alone, what every Member of this Senate should agree to--and Senator McCain made this point; this process has been awful. Kill it now. Go back to what is called regular process, regular order. Go back to the committee and start this discussion. Please do not throw 22, 23 million people off of health insurance without hearing from doctors, patient advocates, hospital administrators.  No, that is not where the Republicans are today. They want to rush this through behind closed doors and get a quick vote on it.  Interestingly enough, as I understand it, Senator Daines of Montana today is going to introduce legislation for a Medicare-for-all healthcare system. That is very interesting. I hope this is really a breakthrough on the part of my Republican colleagues. I very much hope they finally recognize that maybe the United States of America should join every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a right and not a privilege.  I hope that when Senator Daines comes down here, he will say: No, it does not make sense to throw 23 million more people off of healthcare, but, in fact, we have to move forward, do what Canada does, what Germany does, what the UK does, what France does, what every major country on Earth does, and guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. I hope very much that is what Senator Daines will be saying.  Do you know what? I kind of think that is not what he will be saying. I kind of think that in the midst of this discussion in which millions of Americans are wondering whether they are going to continue to have healthcare, what is going to happen to their kids, what is going to happen to their parents, I suspect what Senator Daines is doing is nothing more than an old political trick: trying to embarrass Will they support the Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Congressman John Conyers?  At a time when we are engaged in a very serious debate about the future of healthcare, I think this is not a time for political games. If Senator Daines is serious about a Medicare-for-all proposal, let's work together, but now is not the time for political games.  Senator Daines, as I understand it, is going to offer an amendment, but we don't know what he is amending because we don't even know what is in the legislation the Republicans will bring forward.  How do you amend something when we don't even have a base bill to amend? This is, I suspect--I hope I am wrong. I hope Senator Daines has seen the light, but I suspect not, and I suspect it is just a political game. I do hope, by the way, at some point within this debate, if we can--if not, certainly in the near future--to, in fact, be introducing a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. It will be somewhat different than my friend John Conyers' bill in the House, but what it will do is say that in America, if you are rich or if you are poor, if you are a man, woman, and child, yes, you are entitled to healthcare as a human right and not a privilege.  As you may or may not know, our current healthcare system is the most expensive, bureaucratic, and wasteful system in the entire world. While the healthcare industry makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year in profits--and in many ways what our healthcare system is about is not providing quality care to all of us but seeing how the insurance companies and the drug companies can rip us off. The truth is, even today, we have some 28 million people who have no health insurance so our goal should be to say to those 28 million: We are going to provide health insurance to you, to all Americans, and not throw 22, 23 million more people off of health insurance.  All of us recognize that the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. What the American people want us to do--and poll after poll suggests this--is they want us to improve the Affordable Care Act, not destroy it. The American people are paying deductibles that in many instances are far too high, keeping people from going to the doctor when they need to. Today, copayments are much too high; premiums, much too high. I do find it interesting that when Donald Trump campaigned for President, he talked about the high cost of prescription drugs. He is right. In this country--and I am going to get into that in a moment--we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That is what the American people want us to deal with in healthcare legislation, not throw 22 million people off of healthcare. They want us to lower the cost of prescription drugs. I have not heard one word from the Republicans about the need to lower the cost of prescription drugs.  The United States spends far more per capita on healthcare than any major country on We often have worse outcomes. If we go back to regular order, if we go back to committee process--which is what we should do--the very first question a Member of the Senate should ask is, How does it happen that here in America we spend far more per capita on healthcare than do the people of any other country? Here is the chart. The United States is spending $9,990 per person on healthcare, almost $10,000 per person on healthcare. What do they spend in Germany? Well, they spend $5,300, almost half of what we spend. What about Canada? I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border. It is a really nice country. They spend $4,533. How does it happen that we are spending more than double per person compared to the Canadians and almost double what the Germans do? The French spend less than half of what we do. Australians spend less than half of what we do. The Japanese spend less than half. The UK spends about 40 percent less.  Don't you think the very first question a Member of the Senate might ask is, Why do we spend so much compared to other countries? By the way, all of these other countries guarantee healthcare to all of their people. In many instances, the outcomes, the[[Page S4358]]health outcomes in those countries, are better than our country. They live longer. The life expectancy is longer. Their infant mortality rate is lower. In some particular diseases, they do better in treating their people. Here is a simple truth. The truth is, if we took a hard look at countries around the world--all of which have one form or another of national healthcare programs, all of which said healthcare is a right, whether you are rich or you are poor--maybe we might want to learn something, but, no, we have not had one hearing in order to discuss why we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare and why we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.  You know why we haven't had any hearings on that, fellow Americans? Because it might get the insurance companies a little bit nervous. Insurance companies pour hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions into the political process. The pharmaceutical industry spends a huge amount of money on campaign contributions and lobbying efforts.  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, maybe, just maybe, we might want to stand up for working people and the middle class rather than for the owners of the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry.  It is interesting. One never knows what to expect from the Every given day there is another adventure out there, but a couple of months ago, the President met with, I believe, the Australian Prime That was in President Trump said during that meeting: Australia has a ``better healthcare'' system than the United That is what Donald Trump said. To my Republican friends here who support President Trump, listen to what he said. On this one instance--he is not right very often--but I will confess on this issue, he is right. In Australia, everyone is guaranteed healthcare as a right. Australia has a universal healthcare program called, ironically, Medicare, that provides all Australians with affordable, accessible, and high-quality healthcare. While the United States has the most expensive, bureaucratic, wasteful, and ineffective healthcare system in the world, Australia, it turns out, has one of the most efficient.  President Trump was right. In 2014, Australia's healthcare system ranked sixth out of 55 countries in efficiency. The United States ranked 44. Not only does Australia guarantee universal healthcare coverage, it spends less than half what we spend on healthcare per capita. In 2015, they spent $4,500 while we spent almost $10,000. While the Australian Government spent 9 percent of its GDP on healthcare, the United States spent nearly double that, 17 percent. Further, many healthcare services are far cheaper in An MRI costs about $350 in Australia versus $1,100 in the United One day in a hospital costs about $1,300 in Australia versus $4,300 in the United An appendectomy costs about $5,200 in Australia versus roughly $14,000 in the United States, et cetera.  Not only does Australia guarantee universal healthcare, spend less on healthcare per capita, and pay less than we do for many health services, they have better health outcomes. In 2014, the average life expectancy in Australia was 82.4 years compared to 78.8 years in the United They live longer in For context, according to a 2014 report from the World Health Organization, Australian men have the third longest life expectancy and Australian women have the seventh longest life expectancy in the world. The United States doesn't even crack the top 10 for life expectancy, despite spending so much more than any other country on healthcare.  What all of this comes down to is the fact that America is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. The question we have to ask ourselves--and I hope Senator Daines will address that question as he introduces his Medicare-for-all bill--is how does it happen that in Canada, every man, woman, and child is guaranteed healthcare? The same is true in the UK, in Germany, France, Australia, Japan, and every other major country on How does it happen that every industrialized country understands that healthcare is a right of all people, because all of us get sick? All of us have accidents, not just the rich. How does every major country on Earth say healthcare is a right except the United States? How is it today we have 28 million without any health insurance--more who have high deductibles and high copayments, who are underinsured--and the response of our Republican friends is to say: Twenty-eight million uninsured? That is not enough. Let's throw another 22 million people off of health insurance.  Our response should be to move forward and guarantee healthcare to all people, not throw another 22 million people off of health insurance. I don't have the time to go into great detail as to why our wasteful and bureaucratic healthcare system ends up spending almost twice as much per capita as systems around the world. That is a subject for a lot of discussion, and I intend to play an active role in that discussion, but let me just give you some examples: because we have such a bureaucratic and complicated system; because hospitals in America have to deal with this person who has a $5,000 deductible, that person who has an $8,000 deductible; this person who has this, that person has that--they have to deal with dozens and dozens of different configurations for insurance. It requires an enormous amount of time, energy, and manpower to deal with those myriad of insurance companies. The result of that is, the United States spends far more on hospital administrative costs than most other countries. These costs accounted for one-quarter of total U.hospital spending from 2010 to 2011, more than $200 billion--over twice what was spent in Canada and in  What I would hope--if we don't sit around just worrying about the profits of the insurance companies--what I would hope is, all of us would agree that when we spend a dollar on healthcare, we want that dollar to go to doctors, to nurses, to medicine. We want that dollar to go to the provision of healthcare, not to advertising, not to profiteering, not to dividends, not to outlandish CEO insurance company salaries but to the actual provision of healthcare which keeps us well. Yet we do that worse than any other major country on  The large health insurance and drug companies are making hundreds of billions of dollars in profits every single year, and they are rewarding their executives with outrageous compensation packages. Once again, the function of healthcare, in my mind, is to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, not to make CEOs of insurance companies and drug companies even richer than they are today.  In 2015, the top 58 health insurance companies made $24 billion in profits. Should the function of healthcare in America be to allow insurance companies to make huge profits or should we make sure all of our people get quality healthcare? Not only do the insurance companies make huge profits, but their CEOs make outlandish salaries, while 28 million Americans have no health insurance at all, and others have very high deductibles. In 2015, Aetna's CEO made $17.2 million in compensation. Now, Aetna, like every other insurance company, spends half their life trying to tell people they are not covered for what they thought they were covered, but they do manage to find $17 million in salary compensation for their CIGNA's CEO made $17.3 million in compensation. UnitedHealth Group's CEO made $14.5 million in compensation. Anthem/Wellpoint's CEO made $13.6 million. Humana's CEO made $10.3 million. Is the function of healthcare in America to make CEOs of insurance companies outlandishly wealthy, or is it to provide healthcare to all people?  It is not just the insurance companies. If you ask people in my State of Vermont what their major concern is--and I think they would say the same in Iowa and probably any State in America--they would say: I am sick and tired of being ripped off by the drug companies. I go into my pharmacy, have a medicine I have been using for 10 years, and suddenly the price has doubled, tripled, for no particular reason other than the pharmaceutical industry could get away with it.  We are the only major country on Earth not to control the prices of the pharmaceutical industry. The result is--and this is an outrage, and it speaks to everything that should be discussed but which is not being discussed in the Republican bill--is that[[Page S4359]]today, one out of five patients under the age of 65 who gets a prescription from their doctor is unable to afford that prescription. How crazy is that? What kind of dysfunctional healthcare system allows somebody to go to a doctor because they are sick, the doctor writes a prescription, and one out of five Americans can't even afford to fill that prescription. What happens to that person? Well, the likelihood is they get even sicker, and then they end up in the emergency room at outrageous costs or, maybe even worse, they end up in the hospital. How crazy is that?  I have not heard one word--not one word--from our Republicans about addressing the absurdity of Americans paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. I have a chart over here that just deals with half a dozen drugs, but we can list many, many more.  Lantus, a diabetes drug, costs $186 in the United Diabetes is a very serious problem. Lantus costs $186 in the United States and $47 in It is the same drug.  This is a healthcare reform debate. I have yet to hear one Republican raise that issue, but I think the people in Iowa and the people in Vermont want us to raise that issue.  Crestor, a popular drug for high cholesterol, costs $86 in the United States and $29 in  Advair, which is used to treat asthma--another very serious problem--costs $155 in our country and $38 in  The list goes on and on and on. That is why millions of people, by the way, are now buying their medicine in Canada and other countries, because they are sick and tired of being ripped off by the pharmaceutical industry--an industry that spends billions of dollars over a period of time on lobbyists here and campaign contributions.  You might think--just might--that when we deal with healthcare reform, one Republican--just one--might stand up and say: Well, you know, maybe we might want to stand with the elderly and the sick in this country and not just with the pharmaceutical industry. I have not heard one Republican in this debate talk about that issue.  To give an example of the greed of the pharmaceutical industry--and I can go on and on. They are the greediest, maybe with the exception of Wall It is hard to determine which one of these institutions is more greedy, but the pharmaceutical industry certainly can make a claim for being the greediest industry in this country. Out in California a few months ago, there was an effort to lower the cost of prescription drugs in their It is called proposition 61. The big drug companies spent $131 million to defeat that ballot initiative--$131 million to defeat a ballot initiative in California that would have lowered the cost of prescription drugs. And all over this country, the American people cannot afford the medicine they need, but the drug companies had $131 million to spend just on one initiative.  Meanwhile, while the American people are getting sicker and sicker and sometimes dying because they cannot afford the medications they need, I have received--and I think every Member of the Senate has received--communications from oncologists, people who are dealing with patients who have cancer, who are saying: My patients cannot afford the high cost of cancer medicine. And it is not just cancer, of course.  While the American people are getting ripped off by the drug companies, in 2015 the five largest drug companies in America made over $50 billion in profits--five companies, $50 billion in profits. Yet one-fifth of the American people cannot afford to buy the prescriptions they need. How outrageous is that? And my Republican colleagues are telling us they are dealing with healthcare reform without mentioning one word about the high cost of prescription drugs. Give me a break. You are dealing with many things, but you are not dealing with healthcare reform.  Again, it is not just the pharmaceutical companies that are making huge profits; we are seeing executives from these large drug companies making outrageous compensation. In fact, in 2015, the top 10 pharmaceutical industry CEOs made $327 million in total compensation. Elderly people walking to the drugstore can't afford the prescription drugs they need, and yet CEOs of major drug companies are making $327 million in total compensation.  Former CEO of Gilead, John Martin, became a billionaire because his drug company charged $1,000 a pill for Sovaldi, a hepatitis C drug that costs $1 to manufacture and can be bought in India today for just $4. In this country, it sold for $1,000 a pill, and he became a billionaire as a result of it. That is a healthcare system out of control.  I know it is a radical idea here in the Senate, but maybe--just maybe--we might want to represent the American people and not the CEOs of the drug companies and the insurance companies.  Some of my Republican colleagues have been spending the last few days using words like ``freedom,'' ``choice,'' and ``opportunity'' to try to convince the American people about their abysmal healthcare legislation. This is the same language that rightwing ideologues, like the billionaire Koch brothers, use when they try to discredit government programs and move to privatize them. What the Koch brothers mean by ``freedom'' is their own freedom. And by the way, they are the second wealthiest family in America, worth some $80 billion. What they mean by ``freedom'' is their own freedom to profit off the misery of ordinary Americans who rely on a wide variety of government programs that make life bearable and, in some cases, even possible.  I want to say a word about freedom. This is a 203-foot yacht. This is a yacht owned by a billionaire that costs about $90 million to purchase. Like everybody else, I think, in this Chamber, I think the American people--every American should have the freedom to purchase this $90 million yacht, and I would urge all Americans to go on the internet, find out where the yacht stores are--wherever they sell yachts--and go out there and say: Hey, I got the freedom to buy this $90 million yacht. We all believe in that. You got the money; you buy it.  Here is a picture of a home, and this home is worth tens and tens of millions of dollars. It looks to me like it has 30 or 40 or 50 rooms, probably 5, 10 bathrooms. It is a very nice house, and it is owned by a billionaire.  You know, I think every American who wants to own a home worth tens and tens of millions of dollars, go to your local You go out and you buy that home.  What we are talking about today in terms of freedom is not freedom to buy a yacht or freedom to buy a mansion; we are talking about the freedom to stay alive, the freedom to be able to go to the doctor when you are sick, the freedom not to go bankrupt if you end up in the hospital with a serious disease.  So when my Republican friends talk about freedom of choice, fine, we all agree: You got the money, you go out and buy any big house you want or buy any big yacht you want. But where there is a serious disagreement is, we say that the children of this country who have serious illnesses have the freedom to stay alive even if their parents do not have a lot of money; that older people who are now in nursing homes should have the freedom to get dignified care in a nursing home even if they have Alzheimer's and even if they don't have a lot of money. Healthcare is not another commodity. Healthcare is not a mansion. Healthcare is not a yacht. Healthcare is whether we stay alive or whether we don't, whether we ease our suffering or whether we don't. And I believe--unlike, unfortunately, many of my Republicans--that right to get healthcare when you need it is something every American should be able to get.  Here in the Senate, we have good health insurance. Over the last 10 years, a number of Senators have had serious illnesses, and they have gotten some of the best care in the world. If it is good for the Senate, it is good for every Healthcare must be a right of all people, not a privilege. Quality care must be available to all, not just the wealthy.  Senator Daines is going to come down here in a while to offer a Medicare-for-all proposal. Again, I hope this is a breakthrough. I hope our Republican colleagues understand that we have to join the rest of the industrialized world. And if Senator Daines comes down here and is prepared to[[Page S4360]]vote for that legislation, prepared to get his other Republican Senators prepared to vote for that legislation, my God, we can win this vote overwhelmingly and move this country in a very different direction.  But I have a feeling that is not what Senator Daines has in mind. I think this is another joke, another game, another sham as part of a horrendous overall process. So I will not be supporting that amendment, unless Senator Daines and Republicans vote for it as well. But this I will do: Whether in this debate--and I hope I have the opportunity--or in the very near future, I will offer a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program which finally has the United States doing what every other major country on Earth does--guarantee healthcare to every man, woman, and child in a cost-effective way. And when we do that and when we eliminate the need for families to spend $15 or $20,000 a year for health insurance, we will save the average middle-class family substantial sums of money.

In jurisdictions within my district, Cook County, cities like Chicago, Evanston, and Skokie, which are immigrant rich, we have adopted sanctuary cities, sometimes called welcoming cities, ordinances in order to reassure immigrants that they can, with safety, talk to law enforcement within our jurisdictions.  Skokie Mayor George Van Dusen said: ``It has taken the Village of Skokie years--decades really--to form the bridges that we have of trust with our immigrant community.''  These policies work. A January study found that sanctuary cities tend to be safer and have stronger economies than not.  This bill would push communities to abandon sanctuary city policies, breaking down that hard-earned trust between immigrants and law enforcement. Turning law enforcement into immigration enforcement makes cities less safe.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

5550,topic-id,1978,"Mr.President, this is the beginning, not the end. Today, we claim an important victory because of thousands of people across the country. There are not enough Senators who support this Republican healthcare plan, so there will not be a vote this week. Because of all of the people who spoke up, the realities of this bill are delayed--the tens of millions of people without insurance, a decimated Medicaid Program, the closure of health clinics and hospitals. Yet that is the key word here--that this bill is delayed. This bill is not dead.  Everyone who spoke up about this bill should take a victory lap. Pat yourselves on the back tonight. It is an extraordinary moment in terms of what grassroots democracy can accomplish. You did what you had to do with what you could, and you succeeded but only for tonight. Tomorrow morning, we have to get ready because the minute that the Senate comes back from the July 4 recess, they will have 3 weeks to ram through a bill. They are not done.  I heard the Vice President say today that they are going to keep working until they get it done. They are not giving up, so we cannot rest either.  Most importantly, we cannot let them forget that we are watching, that we are waiting, and we will still be here when they try to come back and jam this bill through.  I really hope that the Republicans take another course. In setting aside the policy disagreements that we are having, there is really a better way. There is a way for the Senate to be a Senate, which is to empower two of the best Republican Senators whom we have seen in generations. They are Lamar Alexander and Orrin Hatch--two people whose conservative credentials nobody doubts. They are the chairmen of two of the biggest committees in the U.Senate--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Finance They have done bipartisan work--[[Page S3805]]Orrin Hatch for decades and Lamar Alexander for decades. Both of them, relatively recently, have done bipartisan work on tax extenders and on repealing No Child Left These are not easy issues. For these two chairmen, because they understand the committee hearing process and because they earned those gavels, I can only imagine their frustration.  Look, I am a Progressive, and I support the Affordable Care Act, but if I were sitting there as a Republican member of the HELP Committee or the Finance Committee and if these bills were going through and taking the country in a direction to which I objected and if I were the ranking member or were, maybe, a couple off from being the ranking member, I would be thinking to myself that I cannot wait until I get that gavel back.  I can tell you that I can have my own hearings, and I can listen to expert testimony, and I can craft a bill. That is what I want to do. The point of being a legislator is to actually work together on a bipartisan basis. Everybody knows that the chairman or the chairwoman has the lion's share of the authority, but it is still a collaborative process. It is politics. You try to accommodate people on both sides of the aisle, and you have quite an ideological spectrum, both on the D side and the R side, but that is the fun of it. That is the way the Senate is supposed to work.  You have a hearing, and the thing that we should remember about a hearing is that, generally speaking, if you have four testifiers--I do not know if it is a rule or just kind of an operating assumption--the majority party gets to pick three out of the four testifiers. So you are going to get three Republican witnesses and one Democratic witness if you have a normal hearing in HELP or Finance about the Affordable Care Act or what ought to happen with the American Health Care Act or whatever it may be. So it is not as if you cannot control the message, and it is not as if you cannot, in the end, do whatever bill you want to do. Isn't that the fun of being in the Senate?  Forget the Democrats for the moment. I mean, the Democrats were totally in the dark, and the public was totally in the dark. Even for the Republican Members, I mean, this has to irritate them that 13 people were sort of kept in the loop--some more than others, some less than others--but it was like these consecutive conversations: What will it take to get you to yes? We will consider that. We will let you know what we are able to do.  Why not just have a public hearing?  That is, literally, what we do for everything--for the Defense authorization, for appropriations bills. Of the 12 subcommittees, we have several hearings. Whether it is telecommunications or railroads or education or even other healthcare issues, we have public hearings, and we do so on a bipartisan basis.  As tough as we are on each other in the election context and as tough as we are sometimes with each other on the floor, the committee hearing process is rarely as partisan. The committee hearing process allows you to kind of get to the work of legislating.  All I am suggesting is that I understand what Leader McConnell is going to try to do. He is going to try to peel off votes. Senator Markey is exactly right in that he is going to try to peel off votes. Yet there is another way to go here, and that is to legislate. Let me just make the political argument for this on behalf of  The problem with being the majority party and trashing the healthcare system by not properly funding the exchanges right now and by creating all of this uncertainty is that prices go up, and everybody understands this. Barack Obama is not the He was river rafting when all of this was happening, and he deserves it. I am happy for him. He is not the So the idea is that you are going to sort of say: Well, we are going to cut Medicaid, cut opioid funding, and we are going to turn this into a big tax cut for people who are already doing well financially because that last bill was called It had the word ``Obama'' in it.  Listen, Republicans and Democrats across the country may not be politically sophisticated like we pretend to be, but they are smart. They are thinking to themselves, I am a Republican, I am a conservative, but I don't care about Barack Obama anymore. He is gone. He is not the So if you sit there and tell me we need to slash funding for mental health services or slash funding for my community health center in a rural neighborhood, I don't care--your argument cannot be: Because ObamaCare, right? You can't be: Because  Now you have a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate, you have the So now Republicans own the healthcare system. So here we are trying to figure out a way where we can both own the healthcare system. We are acting like this is impossible to discover. We are acting like: Gosh, what way would we work where we can each sort of shoulder some of the political and policy responsibility, the personal responsibility for the American healthcare system?  There is a very simple answer to that. We just do this through the regular order. If you do this through the regular order--what that means is--it is interesting to me that the difference between now and, say, 6 months ago is people actually know what reconciliation is. They know there is a threshold for regular legislation of 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, but it is a really important point. The moment the Republicans decided to do this via reconciliation, that was tactical, and that was kind of technical, but what that meant was, they said: We have 52. We only need 51. We don't need to talk to you.  I understand that kind of rationale. You have 52 votes. You can give up actually two and have Vice President Pence break the tie. That may be a judgment they made; I am not sure if they regret it or not.  So here we are. The way to take this off the table as a political liability for the Republicans is to get a bill that could get 60 votes because once it becomes a bipartisan enterprise, it cannot be a cudgel. We cannot beat each other up over it.  When the Affordable Care Act passed originally, one of the challenges we had as a political matter is that we had not a single, solitary Republican vote. I will take everybody at their word that they just couldn't vote for it because it was against their political ideology and their principles, but it also had the side benefit of, the moment a bill doesn't have the patina of bipartisanship--the moment only one party participates in a process--boy, do you own it.  So the question I have is, Do you really want to own the American healthcare system, whatever happens, good or bad? You become like the utility company. Nobody likes their utility company. The best thing that can happen, if you are a utility company, is the lights stay on and the rate of increase slightly slows. You are never going to have cheaper rates, right? And when you flip your light switch on and your lights go on, you don't say: Gosh, I am so pleased with my utility company. You ignore it.  The best thing that can happen is, you come up with a brilliant bill, without any Democratic support, and then everybody shrugs their shoulders and moves on. More likely you are going to own all the problems you are creating, and you are creating myriad problems. I just want to say, there are a lot of Democrats who are on the level about wanting to legislate here, and we will do it the moment repeal is taken off the table, the moment there is a commitment to public hearings, the moment there is a commitment to doing things through the regular order.  Now, those were not my prepared remarks, but that really matters to me. I really believe in the For all of our flaws, we are still the place that has to solve the problems. We are still the world's greatest deliberative body because we must be, because these are Federal problems and we are the Federal legislature so we have to fix this ourselves. There are only two paths; one is the partisan path, which is great peril for people across the country and great political peril, and then there is the path of statesmanship and stateswomanship--the path of us working together and being a Senate again. We can do that, but we have to decide that is what we want to do.  I am hoping we go home, we participate in our parades, we hang out with our families, we cook some burgers, we cook some hot dogs, and we think: You know what, I want to legislate again. That was the battle, that was tough, I[[Page S3806]]am angry, I am disappointed, I am relieved--it depends on who you are--but I would like to start legislating again, and I would like to do so in the regular order.  I am hoping that is what happens over the next week. If it doesn't, then we will be ready to fight again, and I know there are literally millions of Americans who are not going to let up until this bill is dead.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgS3803-4.txt,2173,1215,2017.0,27.0,June
5383,topic-id,2224,"First, let me thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Delaware, not only for his remarks but for his constant, conscientious concern about this country in just about every area. Whenever he speaks, he has a great deal of thought behind it because he is always thinking. My guess is, he is thinking while he sleeps at night. He has so many thoughts. It also comes from a good soul and a good heart because he really cares about making this country better and is working together in a bipartisan way to do that whenever he can. I thank my colleague.  Mr.President, it is likely, at some point today, we will finally see the majority leader's final healthcare bill, the bill he intends to either pass or fail. Thus far, we have been going through a pretense, defeating Republican bills that never had enough support even within their own caucus to pass. Repeal and replace has failed. Repeal without replace has failed. Now we are waiting to see what the majority leader intends for the Republican plan on healthcare. If the reports in the media are true, the majority leader will offer a skinny repeal as his final proposal.  As I mentioned last night, Democrats will offer no further motions or amendments until we see this skinny bill, but make no mistake, once we do see the bill, we will begin preparing amendments. In the event the bill fails, we can move directly to the NDAA, and out of deference to my dear friend Senator McCain, we will work to move that piece of legislation quickly.  If the skinny bill passes, remember, Democrats have an unlimited right, after it passes, to offer an unlimited amount of amendments. Now, many of my colleagues have many amendments on healthcare. They have just been waiting to see the final bill Leader McConnell will bring to the floor.  I want to put my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on notice, my Democratic and Republican colleagues, that they should prepare for numerous Democratic amendments if the skinny bill passes. With the skinny bill passing--I hope it doesn't, but if it does--it will not be the last vote. There will be many more after that to change it and to modify it. I want everyone to understand that.  I also want everyone in this body to understand the consequences of the skinny repeal. We Democrats asked the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to score the skinny repeal based on the four or five provisions of the bill that seem to be what the majority leader is considering: get rid of the individual mandate, get rid of the business mandate, get rid of the Cadillac tax, get rid of the tax on medical devices, and get rid of some of--I believe they considered getting rid of some of the essential healthcare provisions as well. Even if the bill is slightly different from the one we asked to be scored, the score will be pretty much the same.  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are thinking of voting for this skinny bill, listen to what the CBO said, which is nonpartisan and headed by a Republican whom Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan agreed to appoint. The Congressional Budget Office said that a skinny repeal would cause 16 million Americans to lose insurance, and millions of Americans would pay 20 percent more for their premiums starting next year. Premiums would go up 20 percent--not 3 years from now but in January--according to the  Let me repeat that.  A skinny repeal means 16 million fewer Americans with insurance and premiums up 20 percent next year and will stay there. It is not that they go down later, as in one of these CBO estimates of one of the other Republican bills. They stay there, getting higher every year, with people paying more and more. The premiums will go up immediately, as early as January 1, as I mentioned--not 3 years forward but on January 1. One of the promises our Republican friends have made over and over is to bring down premiums, but a skinny repeal would break that promise, and the American people would see it in just 5 months.  Yesterday, a bipartisan group of Governors sent a letter that urges us away from a skinny repeal--these are the Governors, bipartisan--warning that it would ``accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage.'' Republican Governors Sandoval and Kasich and a few other Republican Governors were on that letter.  Now, the argument from the Republican leadership is for Republicans to vote for this bill because they made a campaign promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Yet I ask my Republican friends: Did you[[Page S4353]]promise the American people that you would raise premiums on everyone? I didn't hear that in the promises. That is what a skinny repeal does. Did you promise the American people that you would take healthcare away from tens of millions? I didn't hear that. That is what the skinny bill does.  No, the Republicans not only promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they promised to replace it with something better. I do not know why, but, somehow, the first promise is more important than the second. The skinny plan manages to anger everyone--conservatives, who know it is a surrender and know it does not come close to the full repeal they promised, and moderates, who know that it will be terrible for their constituents.  Is this the one plan that finally unites the Republican Senate--a plan that angers everyone--conservatives, moderates, and, perhaps, most of all, the American people? I cannot believe that, and I hope it would not.  If the Republicans pass such a devastating plan, either one of two things could happen. The House could simply take up the skinny bill repeal, making all of those terrible possibilities a reality--premiums would go up in January, and insurance markets would collapse. In fact, if the House passed this skinny bill, our entire healthcare system could well implode. Everyone who voted for it, regardless of motivation, will regret it.  Or they could take it to conference, which is a pathway to full repeal. In conference, the Freedom Caucus will demand a full repeal--or something close to it--with all of the associated cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks for the wealthy, which so many here in the Senate have labored months to undo.  So this thing is turning into a game of hot potato. The House passed a bill that they do not like. They had to hurry it up. They had to do it twice and pass the hot potato to the Senator McConnell is juggling that hot potato. He cannot get the repeal, and he cannot get repeal and replace. So he comes up with this plan that no one likes, but they say: OK, we can send the hot potato back to the  How many more months is this going to go on, when we could be sitting down, in a bipartisan way, as my good friend from Arizona has recommended, and work together in the committee process?  In the gym this morning, I saw Lamar Alexander, the head of the HELP We see each other just about every morning in the gym. I was wearing, I think, my Syracuse T-shirt, and he was wearing his Tennessee Volunteers T-shirt.  I said to Lamar: If this skinny bill goes down, as it should--and I spoke to Patty Murray, our ranking member--we will sit down and work in a bipartisan way to improve We know that ObamaCare needs some work. We do not deny that. Let's do it in a bipartisan way instead of passing this hot potato back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and not getting anything done.  While our leaders are passing this hot potato, insurers will be setting their rates for 2018. That means that insurers will lock in rates for the next year with this massive uncertainty hanging over their heads, leading to huge rate increases or decisions to pull out of markets. A skinny repeal as a way to get to conference is a recipe for disaster. Beyond that, it is a shameful way of legislating.  My Republican friends should listen to the wonderful speech that the man whom we admire gave--John McCain--when he came back. We should be working in a bipartisan way. My Republican friends, you should not be passing a bill that you do not support or believe in, that you pray will not become law. If you believe that this bill should become law, vote yes, but if you do not believe that the bill should become law, you vote no--plain and simple. Then we can resume in the Finance Committee and in the HELP Committee a bipartisan process of making the present healthcare system better, which needs to be done.  You do not vote to advance terrible legislation and hope that it will magically get better in conference. Let's not forget that, months ago, many House Republicans justified their voting for their nightmare bill because they thought that it would get better in the It has not gotten any better. In fact, it has only gotten worse, and a conference will be no different. Voting yes on a bill that you do not support just to get it to conference is an unserious way of legislating, particularly on this issue, but that is, so far, what the Republican leader is doing.  There may be no better example than the amendment offered by Senator Daines, which favors Medicare for all. I cannot believe that this is happening, because all of the Republicans are going to vote against it. It is just pure cynicism, pure politics, and is not a serious effort to legislate and make things better when people need help. Senator Daines does not support the bill. He just wants to get Democrats on the record. The majority leader has made pending an amendment that both he and the author of the amendment will oppose, and that is the very definition of a political game.  We Democrats are not going to go along, because this is not a game. This is not a joke. It is not hot potato. We are talking about people's lives. We do not have time for phony amendments or phony bills. You do not play games with the healthcare of the American people.  As I said, anyone who listened to the eloquent words of my dear friend from Arizona should blush at this process. His was a clarion call that both sides of the aisle can do better. He criticized his side for being partisan, and he criticized our side for being partisan. He is right on both counts. We all can do better. Let's start. The Daines amendment does not do that. That is for sure. The only answer is to start over together, to work together through regular order, and to get some legislation that we can all live with.                            Russia Sanctions  Mr.President, I have one other point, on Russia sanctions. It is apropos. I didn't know, when we read all of this stuff, that my good friend from Arizona would be here. Even as we debate other items on the floor, we should not delay this legislation on the Russia sanctions any longer.  Last night, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee here in the Senate said that he was ready to move the package quickly. That is what Senator Corker said, and I am glad he did. I will work with the majority leader to send this legislation to the President's desk before the recess. We have already cleared this legislation on the Democratic side. We are prepared to move it by unanimous consent at any time.  I hope the White House signs this. This morning, the White House Communications Director said that President Trump may veto the legislation so that he could make a tougher deal with Russia than could The idea that the President would veto this legislation in order to toughen it up is laughable. I am a New Yorker, too, and I know bull when I hear it. If the President vetoes this bill, the American people will know that he is being soft on Putin, that he is giving a free pass to a foreign adversary who violated the sanctity of our democracy by meddling in our election and who seeks to undermine democracy and American life in any way he can. I hope and expect, if the President decides to use the first veto of his Presidency on this bill, that Congress will swiftly override it.  I see my friend here, the majority leader. I appreciate his work on making this Russia sanctions bill happen and being available. I hope that we will get the House bill to the President's desk, and I hope the President signs it.

The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, while the Democratic leader is still on the floor, I just wanted to mention that I[[Page S4354]]understand his concern about the healthcare issue and the amendments and the process for moving forward and the necessity for doing so. I made my views very clear; I won't repeat that eloquent speech I made. I would just like to say to my friend from New York that we do have a bill that passed through the committee 27 to 0--not a single person against it--after many days of debate, amendments, discussion, including a couple hundred amendments that were disposed of in the tradition of the Armed Services I believe it is in everybody's interest to go ahead and take up the Defense bill so that we can go to conference and resolve other issues, such as sequestration, et cetera.  I understand the frustration my friend from New York feels, but where I have a disagreement with my friend from New York is saying that these two issues are inseparable. I believe that our obligation to the men and women in the military is transcendent.  I understand the frustration of the Senator from New I was here when, with 60 votes, the bill was rammed through over Republican objections without a single amendment. I understand his frustration.  What the majority leader and I are asking for is just that tomorrow we take up the NDAA bill. We can get it done in a few hours. We can send it to conference, take care of the equipment, training, all of the things the men and women who are serving in the military need.  By the way, I understand the emotion on the other side. I felt the same emotion on this side some years ago, and I haven't forgotten it yet. So I would hope--and I know the Senator from New York has to discuss with his conference this issue of the Defense authorization bill. I would remind him and all of my colleagues that for 53 years now, we have passed and had the President of the United States sign the Defense authorization bill. That is a precedent that I really hope we do not break, because of our obligation to the men and women who are serving in the military. I know the Senator from New York feels exactly the same way.  I am not impugning the integrity of the Senator from New I just ask that we consider it. I know the Senator from New York has to go back to his conference. I hope they all will consider it.  Let me just finally say, I note, for example, the Senator from Virginia here on the floor, who has been a vital part of the--no, not the other one; not him. Both have been vital members of the Armed Services Yes, we have our disputes. Yes, we have our arguments. Yes, we are spirited. But we come out unanimously in favor of taking care of the men and women in the military.  I hope the Senator from New York will consider this.

5386,topic-id,447,"First, I wish to express our respect for the Senator from My dear friendship--really love for the man is unbounded.  I am repeating in my head, as many of us have, the speech our friend from Arizona gave when he came back, and we were all so joyous that he did. He talked about going to regular order. He talked about working in a bipartisan way. He talked about doing this healthcare bill the right way--with hearings, with debate, with amendment. Even I accepted his chastisement that we passed a partisan bill. He knows the record shows I didn't want to do that. But we did have debate and amendments. We had a process where six people--three from each party--spent 6 months trying to come to an agreement. They did not.  But I must say the reason that we must ask unanimous consent to go to the bill is because we are in reconciliation--the very process that has prevented us from debating, from having hearings, from having some kind of bipartisan input. I would say to my colleague, if you want to get rid of this reconciliation, fine. Let's recommit the bill to committee and start on a fair process, and we can go to NDAA immediately--in an hour--if we were to do that.  The reason we can't do that is our dear friend the majority leader is insisting on the reconciliation process. And you can't say--we can't, because we feel defense is important and we feel the healthcare of tens of millions of Americans is equally important. And we can't say you can turn on and turn off the reconciliation process when you want to and when you don't. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.  If reconciliation is poor and prevents NDAA from coming up immediately, it is equally poor--maybe more so--when it comes to healthcare.  So my plea and suggestion: Let's not go forward with this bill. We don't even know what it is yet. Let's go back to committee.  I spoke to Senator Alexander, I spoke to Senator Murray this morning. If this bill fails, they will go back and try to negotiate bipartisan improvements--just as my good friend from Arizona recommended when he came back and gave his moving speech.  But my caucus--I have spoken to a few--feel very strongly that this process on healthcare has been awful, and it is because of reconciliation, and now reconciliation has put NDAA in a bind as well. Let's get rid of reconciliation, and we can do what the Senator from Arizona wants and what I think the American people want--a fair process.  I yield the floor.

5482,topic-id,1468,"Mr.President, I listened to the majority leader this morning saying that ObamaCare was collapsing and Republicans are on a rescue mission. Honestly, the gall it must take to say, after Republicans and President Trump have spent all year sabotaging the marketplace, that ObamaCare is collapsing. They have threatened to stop critical cost-sharing payments that help keep deductibles and premiums down, hurting millions of people and sowing uncertainty in the market.  There is an easy way to fix it. Instead of crying crocodile tears, Republicans should guarantee that the cost-sharing payments will be made. That is not just Democrats saying it. That is the insurers. Listen to the insurers. What do they want? They want to keep premiums down and prevent them from leaving the exchanges. They want cost-sharing, which our Republican colleagues refuse to do, and, then, in a cynical ploy, they try to blame  Listen to AHIP, the Nation's largest trade group of insurers. It is nonpartisan. It is a business group. Listen to what they said about the uncertainty about cost-sharing payments. They said it was ``the single most destabilizing factor in the individual market.'' A series of insurance companies, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and Anthem, have said explicitly that uncertainty caused by President Trump and Republicans about cost-sharing is causing them to pull out of certain markets.  So this idea, this cynical ploy--after sabotaging the bill and then blaming someone else other than themselves--is pitiful.  The House bill, of course, was so bad--TrumpCare was so bad--that our Republican friends are trying to switch the blame to It is not true, and it will not work.  Now, last night, Democrats held the floor well into the night to discuss the Republican plan to pass a healthcare bill in just 2 weeks that no one in America has seen, without holding a single committee hearing or a robust debate on the floor. They want to bring the bill to the floor and rush it in the dark of night for a simple reason: They are ashamed of their bill. They don't want anybody to see it, least of all the public.  Last evening, I asked the majority leader if the minority would have more than 10 hours to debate and amend the final bill. He replied that ``there will be ample opportunity to debate and amend the bill.'' So I asked again: Will we get more than 10 hours? Ten hours is the maximum the rules allow us under reconciliation. He could only reply that ``There will be ample time.''  I have a feeling the majority leader and I disagree on the definition of ``ample,'' because 10 hours of debate time--a total of 10 hours of debate time on an issue this important--is a sham. It is a farce. We would have to read the bill, prepare amendments, and consider its consequences, all in 10 hours.  This is a bill that affects one-sixth of our economy, millions of For them, it is life and death, and we are supposed to rush it through.  The Affordable Care Act, for the sake of comparison, was debated for 25 consecutive days of Senate session and 169 cumulative hours of debate time, and that was after a robust hearing and committee process. Yesterday, the majority leader basically confirmed that we Democrats might only have 10 hours total--no committee hearings, no committee markups, no airing the bill--10 hours of debate. Can my colleagues believe it? This is supposed to be a democracy where we debate the greatest issues of our time.  I asked another question of the majority leader, and I ask him now and I hope he will answer: Will our 10 hours of debate time be on the House bill or will it be on the new Senate bill that he is crafting behind closed doors? Will he let us debate the full 10 hours on the new Senate bill--hardly enough--or is he even being more cynical and doing[[Page S3619]]the 10 hours of debate on the existing House bill and then putting a substitute in--the Senate bill they have written behind closed doors--and have no debate on that? With everything terrible that is happening, that could make it even worse. So I am asking the majority leader to publicly state what his plan is in that regard.  I have never heard of a more radical or a more reckless process in my entire career in politics--10 hours of total debate on a bill that would affect one-sixth of the American economy and millions of If the Senate bill, like the House bill, results in 23 million fewer Americans with insurance--23 million Americans losing their insurance--each hour of debate time would represent 2.3 million Americans losing their insurance. Each minute of debate time would represent 40,000 Americans losing their insurance. One minute, and 40,000 people's lives are changed; 40,000 people don't have the coverage they need.  It boggles the mind that the Republican leader is moving forward this way without letting anyone but Members of the Republican Senate caucus see the bill, and even many of them have said they haven't seen it. There is only one possible reason why my friends on the other side are going along with this process--only one reason: They are ashamed of the bill they are writing.  If they were proud of the bill, they would announce it. They would have brass bands going down Main Street America, saying: Look at our great bill. They can't even whisper what it is about, they are so, so ashamed of it. That is why they are hiding it. They must be ashamed that, just like the House bill, the Senate TrumpCare bill will put healthcare out of the reach of millions of Americans just to put another tax break into the pockets of the very wealthy.  President Trump likes to end many of his tweets with one word, almost like punctuation: ``Sad,'' ``unfair,'' ``wrong.'' It turns out the President has one word to sum up his healthcare plan as well: ``Mean.''  Last week, at a White House lunch with Republican Senators, the President reportedly told them he thought the House-passed healthcare bill was mean. That is what Donald Trump said on June 13, 2017.  For once, on the topic of healthcare, I find myself agreeing with the His healthcare bill is mean. Cutting Medicaid to the bone is mean. Cutting treatment for opioid abuse is mean. Cutting support for families with someone in a nursing home is mean. Allowing insurers to once again discriminate against Americans with preexisting conditions is mean. Charging older Americans five times or more for their health insurance is mean.  Passing a law which would cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance in order to give a tax break to the wealthiest among us is pretty much the textbook definition of a mean bill--a mean bill--and even the President thinks so, but just like the Republicans in the Senate, President Trump doesn't want the American people to know what he really thinks of their healthcare plan. That is why he said it was mean behind closed doors at the White House, while in public a few weeks earlier he said it is a ``great plan,'' ``very, very incredibly well-crafted.'' Those are his words, the same bill--the same bill--out to the public: Great bill, great plan; while behind closed doors, what it really is: mean.  All the plaudits the President gave the House bill turned out to be flimsy salesmanship. Speaking candidly to fellow Republicans, the President didn't say: Take up and pass the House bill. He didn't say it was a great plan or that it was very, very incredibly well-crafted. He said it was mean. My Republican friends ought to take this to heart. Even President Trump thinks what Republicans are doing on healthcare is a cruelty to the American people.  As we on this side of the aisle have said before, there is a better way. Republicans shouldn't feel like this mean bill cooked up in secret is their only option. I have invited my Republican friends to meet in the Old Senate Chamber to discuss a bipartisan way forward on healthcare. The Republican leader seems to have foreclosed that option, but the invitation remains and the sentiment remains.  Democrats are willing to work with our Republican friends on improving our healthcare system. We have significant disagreements, sure, but Republicans haven't even tried to sit down with us to hash them out. We would like to try, but if Republicans continue down this path, ignoring the principles of transparency and the open debate that defined this legislative body, we Democrats will continue to do everything we can to shine light on what our Republican friends are doing.

5542,topic-id,519,"Mr.President, a note on healthcare.  As the House Republican caucus continues their effort to revive TrumpCare, I just want to remind my friends in the House of a few things.  First, for all the significant changes House Republicans are proposing to the bill, it would still cause premiums and deductibles to rise, it will still jack up the costs on low-income and older Americans, and, most importantly, it doesn't change a thing about the 24 million fewer Americans who would get healthcare. It may actually increase that number, but it certainly will not decrease it.  Second, it is unwise and irresponsible to rush through a brandnew bill without a new CBO score, without committee hearings, and without any debate on the floor of the If this thing were so good, why wouldn't there be open debate? Why wouldn't there be discussion? I hope, if the bill gets to the Senate--I don't know if it will. I hope it doesn't, but if it does, I hope we will not mimic the House, have no committees, no hearings, no CBO score, not much debate. That would be very wrong.  Third, even if the new version of TrumpCare passes the House--we hope it doesn't--its chances for survival in the Senate are small. We don't even know if the new version would survive under the rules of reconciliation.  The amendment to allow States to drop preexisting condition requirements, for instance, very possibly violates the Byrd rule. If the moderate group in the House gets an additional amendment to deal with the very same issue, that may violate the Byrd rule as well because if Republicans try to throw money at their problem, as it has been reported, they may end up violating the budget instructions to reduce the deficit, and they will not even know if it does violate the Byrd rule because, again, they will not have a CBO score.  As my friend, the Republican Senator from South Carolina, Mr.Graham, said, talking about the TrumpCare bill, ``I just don't see how you square the circle here. Some of the things the Freedom Caucus wants probably won't make it through the Senate.''  The same is true for the group of moderates who are angling for more changes to the bill right now.  The reality is, TrumpCare cannot pass the So to my moderate Republican colleagues in the House, I ask: Why would you risk a ``yes'' vote for a bill that is devastating to your constituents and has virtually a minuscule chance--probably no chance--of becoming law?  Now, we Democrats--as we have said time and time again to both the President and to our Republican colleagues--are willing to work with you on ways to improve the Affordable Care Act and our healthcare system in general. Drop repeal, and then come talk to us about finding a bipartisan way forward. We are always willing to work in a bipartisan way, but, again, to repeat, ``bipartisan'' means talking to both sides and taking things from both sides, not just throwing a bill down and saying you have to support it. That is what bipartisanship is.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2689-2.txt,1036,1500,2017.0,3.0,April

5614,topic-id,1732,"Mr.President, when polls ask Americans what issues are most important to them, one topic seems to score high every time: jobs and the economy. It is not surprising. The American people have had a rough time over the past few years.[[Page S4642]]  The Obama years were characterized by long-term economic stagnation. Jobs and opportunities were few and far between. Wage growth was almost nonexistent, and yearly economic growth alternated between weak and woeful.  During the last year of the Obama administration--years, I might add, after the recession ended--economic growth averaged a dismal 1.5 percent. That is barely half of the growth needed for a healthy economy.  There have been some encouraging signs over the past few months. Economic growth for the second quarter of 2017 was stronger. We still have a way to go to get to where we need to be. Things still need to get better and better faster.  Another thing is, we want things to get better for the long term. During the Obama administration, there were periods of reasonable economic growth, but they were quickly followed by weak periods. That is not good enough. We need to put our economy on a strong, healthy footing for the long term.  How do we do this? How do we get back on the path to long-term economic health? One important thing we can do is reform our outdated, inefficient, and growth-stifling Tax  The Tax Code might not be the first thing people think of when they think of economic growth, but it actually plays a huge rule in every aspect of our economy. It helps determine how much money you have left over to save or invest or whether you can afford a car or a house. When it comes to businesses, it can be the key to determining whether a young business gets off the ground or an existing business has the money to grow and to hire new workers.  Unfortunately, our current Tax Code is not helping our economy. Too often, American families find their opportunities limited by the size of the tax bill they owe to Uncle Large and small businesses alike find themselves struggling under heavy tax burdens that compromise their ability to grow and compete.  What does tax reform need to look like? On the individual side, of course, we need to lower income tax rates to put more money in Americans' pockets. American families should be the ones deciding how to spend their earnings and not Washington bureaucrats.  On the business side, there are two important things we can do that will have long-term benefits for economic growth: first, lower tax rates for all types of businesses--sole proprietorships, S corporations, limited liability companies, and corporations; and, second, accelerate the rate at which businesses can recover their investment costs to free up money for them to reinvest in their businesses, create new jobs, and increase wages.  When it comes to lowering business tax rates, there are several things we need to do. For starters, we need to lower our Nation's corporate tax rate. The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. That puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.  When American businesses are taxed at a far higher rate than their foreign competitors, it is likely to be the foreign, rather than the American, companies that expand and thrive.  It is not just our high corporate tax rate that puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage. It is also our outdated worldwide tax system. If we want American businesses to stay competitive in the global economy, we need to move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.  The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, delivered a speech the other day explaining exactly why we need to move to a territorial system. I highly recommend reading his full speech, but I am going to take just a moment to highlight some of the points he made in that speech.  What does it mean to have a worldwide tax system? Under a worldwide tax system, American companies pay U.taxes on the profit they make here at home, as well as any profit they make abroad, once they bring that money back here home to the United  The problem with this is twofold. First, these companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money they make abroad. While the current Tax Code gives them some credit for those foreign tax payments, they can still end up paying some U.taxes when they bring that money home, meaning they are being taxed twice on those profits.  This discourages companies from bringing their profits home to invest in their domestic operations in the United If the tax burden for bringing that money home is too great, they have a strong incentive to leave that money abroad and invest it in foreign workers and foreign economies.  The other problem is, most other major world economies have shifted from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. In a territorial tax system, you pay taxes on the money you earn where you make it and only there. You aren't taxed again when you bring money back to your home country.  Most of American companies' foreign competitors have been operating under a territorial tax system for years so they are paying a lot less in taxes than American companies are. That leaves American companies at a competitive disadvantage.  These foreign companies can underbid American companies for new business simply because they don't have to add as much in taxes into the price of their products or services. By moving to a territorial tax system in the United States--a move that is supported, by the way, by Members of both parties--we can put American companies on an even footing with their global competitors.  With a territorial tax system and a lower corporate tax rate, we can provide a strong reason for companies to keep their operations in the United States and to bring their profits back home, instead of incentivizing companies to send their operations overseas the way they do now.  Improving the competitiveness of American companies and giving them a reason to invest their profits back home will have huge economic benefits, not only for American companies who are competing in the global marketplace but also for all the small- and medium-sized companies that form the supply chain here in the United  For every American company that operates in countries around the world, there are countless companies here at home that supply the raw material for the products that are sold abroad--businesses that handle the packaging and the shipping of those products and enterprises that supply support services like accounting and legal and payroll services.  The list goes on. America's global companies rely on a web of supporting businesses that spans the entire United As a result, when American companies are successful, so is the American economy.  Obviously, lowering corporate tax rates and moving to a territorial tax system will have the most impact on American companies with an international footprint. Tax reform also has to focus on that other engine of economic growth; that is, the American small business.  Like bigger businesses, small businesses currently face high tax rates, at times even exceeding those paid by large corporations. Lowering tax rates for small businesses has to be a part of any tax reform bill.  A dollar saved in lower tax rates is a dollar a small business owner can put back into the business to expand, to add another worker, or to give employees a raise. The other thing we can do for small businesses is to allow them to recover their investments in inventory, machinery, and the like faster.  Under current law, small- and medium-sized corporations are often required to use a method of accounting known as accrual accounting. Basically, what that means is, a business has to pay tax on income before it receives the cash and cannot deduct all of its expenses when it pays the invoice.  For investments in equipment and facilities, the delay in recovering the cost of the investment can be even longer. For instance, right now, the cost of a computer is recovered over 5 years; tractors, over 7 years; and commercial buildings, over 39 years.  For many businesses, this means it can be many years before that substantial investment can be fully deducted. That can leave a business extremely[[Page S4643]]cash poor. Cash-poor businesses don't expand, they don't hire new workers, and they don't increase wages.  Boosting small businesses' available cash by allowing them to recover their investments faster is one of the most important things we can do to help small businesses thrive.  I have actually introduced legislation that would do just that. My bill, which is called the INVEST Act, focuses on allowing new businesses to recover their startup costs more quickly and allowing existing small- and medium-sized businesses and farms and ranches to recover their investments faster, and in some cases deducting the acquisition costs immediately.  All of the tax reform priorities I have discussed today, and more, will be part of the final tax reform package that we develop in the U. Members of the tax-writing committees, in both the Senate and the House, have spent years working out the best approach to tax reform. Both committees have redoubled their efforts this year, even as the Senate and the House took up a variety of different priorities.  Last week, leaders from the Senate, the House, and the administration announced that the Senate Finance Committee, of which I am a member, and the House Ways and Means Committee would begin putting together a final version of a tax reform package. Our goal is for the Senate and House to take up and pass the legislation sometime this fall.  I am looking forward to working with Chairman Hatch and all of my colleagues in the Senate Finance Committee to put together that final bill, because American families and businesses are counting on us to enact a tax system that works for them and not against them. That is what we intend to give them.  I yield the floor.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that quorum calls during consideration of the Wray nomination be charged equally to both sides.

5564,topic-id,557,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1366, legislation that will close a loophole in our securities laws and better protect the investors and retirees of the U.territories.  The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs investment companies, such as mutual funds, closed-end funds, and Its purpose is to protect investors and provide oversight of these companies. In doing so, it regulates various transactions among affiliates, sets leverage limits, outlines recordkeeping requirements, and describes how securities may be redeemed.  These matters sound technical, but they provide fundamental protections to most U.investors. I say ``most'' because, due to a historical artifact, all funds located in and sold only to residents of U.territories are exempted.  The reason is, in 1940, territories like Puerto Rico were considered to be too distant from Washington, D.Obviously, modern air travel makes that a nonissue today, as regulators routinely travel to Hawaii and Alaska to conduct oversight. In addition, many of these financial products are now traded electronically, truly eliminating the need to visit in person.  The consequence of exemption falls squarely on the residents of U.territories. Investment companies can sell products to them without the important oversight, disclosure, and conflict-of-interest requirements to which mainland companies are subject.  As a result, many investors and retirees have been subject to investment losses, some resulting from behavior that would have been prohibited if the 1940 act applied to the island's investment companies.  To address this matter, H.1366, the U.Territories Investor Protection Act, applies the 1940 act to currently exempt investment companies that are located, organized in, and sold to residents of these territories.  I would like to point out that this bill is identical to legislation that passed the House last Congress twice with overwhelming bipartisan support.  In order to permit investment companies to comply with the legislation, it provides for a 3-year compliance period, with an option, at the approval of the SEC, for an additional 3 years. This time period balances the need to bring the investor protections of the 1940 act to the territories with enough time for affected entities to fully understand and comply with the 1940 act.  It is important to note that if investment companies need further relief from any specific requirement of the 1940 act, they are able to request such relief through the SEC under existing law. Earlier this year, past SEC Chair White testified that the exemption should be removed.  I want to thank Congressman Duffy and Congressman MacArthur, two of my colleagues from the Puerto Rico Task Force, for cosponsoring this bill. I also want to thank Puerto Rico's new Member of Congress, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, for cosponsoring it as well; and Senators Hatch and Menendez, who have put forward a companion bill in the All of this support means a great deal to me and to those investors on the island.  Finally, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for working with me throughout the last 2 years in a highly productive manner. We met with stakeholders, heard their concerns, and fine-tuned the bill. I am confident we developed an approach that would apply the 1940 act in a manner that is sensitive to investors and investment companies alike.

It knows no geological limits. It happens across our country and around the globe, including in my home State of  Victims of labor trafficking are not a uniform group of people. Victims are young children, teenagers, men, and women.  In my home State of Michigan, the National Human Trafficking Hotline reported over 38 cases in 2016 involving labor trafficking. This is a 52 percent increase in the number of reported cases since 2015.  Globally, the International Labor Organization estimates there are 21 million people trapped in forced labor.  The growing number of human trafficking cases is alarming and more needs to be done to identify victims, catch traffickers, and end this form of modern-day slavery.  In the course of inspecting workplace safety and labor law compliance within the United States, Department of Labor employees often have a front line to view and to identify patterns of labor exploitation. Providing these employees with the proper training to detect and respond to the signs of human trafficking is an important part of the larger comprehensive effort to eradicate this unthinkable crime.  The Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act would ensure the Department has a formal framework in place to detect trafficking and refer cases to law enforcement for prosecution.  Specifically, H.2664 would:  Direct the Department of Labor to train appropriate staff on how to effectively detect instances of human trafficking;  Ensure personnel regularly receive information on current trends and best practices;  Allow flexible training options, including in-class and virtual learning options;  Establish a clear course of action for referring suspected instances of human trafficking to law enforcement; and  Require an evaluation and report to Congress on the implementation of the training and the metrics used to measure and track the agency's response to human trafficking.

5400,topic-id,238,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to take this time to honor our country's fallen servicemen and -women. This weekend, we will observe Memorial Day, a day dedicated to those who have fought and died selflessly to protect our country.  Since 1868, Americans have celebrated what was once called Decoration Day to honor the fallen. Every year since then, we have honored those who have fallen at Gettysburg, at San Juan Hill, in the Argonne Forest, on the shores of Normandy and Guadalcanal, at Inchon, at la Drang, in the desert at Objective Norfolk, on the streets of Fallujah, and in Zabul  This important day is not only meant to commemorate those who lost their lives fighting for our country but also to highlight why they were called upon to serve our country in battle. They fought to preserve the great privilege of freedom that we must never take for granted.  America's promise of liberty would not be possible without the courage and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. We owe these patriots a debt that can never be repaid but that must be remembered always, not just on Memorial  This day of remembrance is a solemn occasion, and, therefore, let us not only say prayers for the fallen, let's also celebrate their lives and give heartfelt thanks to God and their families for their sacrifices in protecting our Nation, the world's bastion of liberty and freedom.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgH4593-2.txt,2115,MEMORIAL DAY,2017.0,25.0,July
