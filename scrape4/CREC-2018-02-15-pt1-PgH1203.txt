                    CALLING FOR SENSIBLE GUN REFORM

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I do not rise today for another moment of 
silence for Parkland, Florida, for the semiautomatic weapon and shooter 
who wielded it already silenced 17 Floridians and injured countless 
others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
  Instead, I rise to make their voices heard. I rise to call for action 
on sensible gun reform. The Parkland shooter likely got his 
semiautomatic weapon through a private sale or a gun show without a 
background check, in spite of a record of mental health issues.
  It is time to close that loophole. The Las Vegas shooter used a bump 
stock to convert a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon--which 
is already illegal. Bump stocks should also be illegal.
  Why is nothing happening? In my own home of Orlando, the shooter at 
the Pulse nightclub was on the FBI watch list. Imagine if we passed no 
fly, no buy and stopped that from happening.
  Now is not the time for silence. Now is the time for action, and now 
is time for solutions.
