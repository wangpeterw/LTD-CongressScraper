                       WELCOMING PASTOR RON DUNN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Pastor Ron Dunn from 
Akron, Michigan, who delivered that wonderful opening prayer.
  Pastor Dunn is an ordained bishop with the Church of God, and is 
senior pastor of New Hope Ministries in Akron, Michigan, not Ohio.
  His work is well known beyond the walls of the church. Pastor Dunn 
has led New Hope Ministries to assist those in need in the Akron 
community. Under Pastor Dunn's leadership, New Hope Ministries has 
provided food, clothing, counseling, and even assisted local families 
in sending their children to summer camp. His service and work is truly 
an example for all of us here and across the country.
  Pastor Dunn is also known in our community as the head football coach 
of the Akron-Fairgrove Junior/Senior High School, where he has mentored 
the team to grow into upstanding young men.
  Pastor Dunn's life of service extends back to his service in the 
United States Army. Pastor Dunn is a veteran of Operations Desert 
Shield and Desert Storm.
  Mr. Speaker, our community and our Nation are grateful for Pastor 
Dunn's service and sacrifice. It is an honor to welcome him to the 
Capitol today.
