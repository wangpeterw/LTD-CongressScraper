                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, the Children's Health Insurance Program, 
which is also known as CHIP, provides low-cost health insurance to 
nearly 9 million children all across the country, including over 25,000 
children in my home State of Hawaii. Together with Medicaid, these 
programs have reduced the Nation's uninsured rate for children to a 
record low of 5 percent.
  Republicans in Congress let CHIP expire back in September, 
jeopardizing the healthcare of millions of children.
  At the current pace, my home State of Hawaii will exhaust all current 
CHIP funding by the end of this year, leaving thousands of our keiki 
unable to visit a doctor for routine checkups and to receive 
immunizations, prescriptions, or more.
  We must act now to reauthorize this CHIP program to ensure that our 
children have access to the healthcare that they need. We cannot 
neglect those who need help the most by failing to act and reauthorize 
this legislation. We must act now.
