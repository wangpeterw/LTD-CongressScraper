                    HONORING PASTOR LORAN LIVINGSTON

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Pastor Loran 
Livingston and his wife, Sandra, in recognition of their 40 years of 
ministry at Central Church of God in Charlotte, North Carolina.
  God has used the Livingstons to grow and lead a church that truly 
impacts the Charlotte community and the world. Each week, over 6,000 
people gather together for a wonderful praise and worship experience, 
along with a dynamic biblical message from Pastor Livingston.
  Under their leadership, the congregation actively serves those in 
poverty, provides help for women facing an unplanned pregnancy all the 
way through life, and programs to assist seniors. Central Church also 
hosts an annual 5K race to raise awareness in the fight against human 
trafficking.
  If you want to address race relations in Charlotte, a good place to 
start is Central Church, where 40-plus nationalities worship together 
every Sunday hearing the love of Jesus.
  Thank God for Pastor and Mrs. Livingston and their dedication to 
Christ, Central Church, the Charlotte community, and their various 
missions around the world.
