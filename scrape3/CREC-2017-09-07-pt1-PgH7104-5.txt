      KEEP OUR GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONING EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Make America 
Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act that the House is considering. 
This bill is a package of legislation that the Appropriations Committee 
has diligently worked on over the last several months that will fund 
our domestic and national security priorities.
  This is legislation that prioritizes conservative policies, invests 
in proven and effective programs, and reduces unnecessary and wasteful 
spending. It will fund the government in a fiscally responsible way, 
keeping a lid on spending as we have since taking the House majority in 
2010.
  It will continue our work of rolling back burdensome, job-killing 
policies to help our economy grow even faster than we have seen over 
the last 7 months when we have added more than 1 million jobs.
  It includes many items that the House has already passed this summer, 
like the largest pay raise for our troops in 8 years and the most 
funding to care for our veterans in our Nation's history.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure to keep our 
government functioning efficiently and effectively for the American 
people.
