       RECOGNIZING THE CITY OF WEST MIAMI ON ITS 70TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to pay tribute to the 
city of West Miami in recognition of its 70th anniversary.
  What began as a small town of 700 residents has flourished into a 
haven for nearly 7,000 south Floridians, including my constituents, 
Senator Marco Rubio and Miami-Dade County commissioners and former West 
Miami Mayor Rebeca Sosa, who are proud to call West Miami home.
  While the city itself is less than 1 square mile, the tremendous 
growth that has graced West Miami in the past 70 years has led to the 
creation of some of the finest public parks and summer camps in our 
State.
  To celebrate its founding, local officials, businesses, residents, 
and their families will gather together on Saturday, April 8, at Cooper 
Park, in celebration of this incredible milestone.
  I am honored to represent the city of West Miami, and I thank all who 
have dedicated countless hours to making this corner of south Florida 
special for all of us to enjoy.

                          ____________________
