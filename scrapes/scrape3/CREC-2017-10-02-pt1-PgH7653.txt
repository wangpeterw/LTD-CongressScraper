                    CANCER LINK CELEBRATES 30 YEARS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 30th 
anniversary of Cancer Link, an amazing volunteer organization dedicated 
to finding a cure for breast cancer and assisting those in south 
Florida whose lives have been impacted by this disease.
  Cancer Link was founded in 1987 by a small group of 10 Miami women 
who wanted to spread awareness about breast cancer after suffering the 
devastating loss of a friend. In the years since, this wonderful 
organization has grown into an impactful volunteer group that has 
supported essential breast cancer research at the Sylvester Cancer 
Center in Miami, Florida.
  The volunteers at Cancer Link have also helped provide essential 
community healthcare programs that ensure that healthcare for breast 
cancer treatment is accessible to every woman in our community.
  Congratulations again to all who have been a part of Cancer Link 
throughout the years, and thank you for 30 years of service to our 
community.
