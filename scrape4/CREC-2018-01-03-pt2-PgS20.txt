                         LETTER OF RESIGNATION

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resignation letter of former Senator Al 
Franken to Governor Dayton be read and spread upon the Journal and 
printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:


                                                  U.S. Senate,

                                Washington, DC, December 24, 2017.
     Governor Mark Dayton,
     Office of Governor Mark Dayton & Lt. Governor Tina Smith, 
         Saint Paul, MN.
       Dear Governor Dayton: I write to resign my seat as a United 
     States Senator for the State of Minnesota effective at 1 pm 
     Eastern Standard Time on January 2, 2018. Serving the State 
     of Minnesota in the U.S. Senate has been a privilege and an 
     honor. I am grateful to Minnesotans for giving me the chance 
     to serve our state and our nation, and I am proud to have 
     worked on their behalf.
           Sincerely,
                                                       Al Franken,
                                            United States Senator.

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
