                       TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, next week marks Teacher 
Appreciation Week, which recognizes the special role educators make for 
American families.
  As the husband of a retired schoolteacher and a grateful dad of four 
sons with eight grandchildren, I know firsthand the positive impact 
educators have for students.
  South Carolina's Second Congressional District is filled with 
dedicated and talented teachers and administrators, and it is always a 
pleasure to visit with them at their school or when their classes visit 
Washington.
  I would also like to recognize the 2017 Teacher of the Year, Jennifer 
Wise, of Hand Middle School of Columbia, which my mother attended. As a 
math teacher, Jennifer motivates her students for mathematics to 
energize their lives outside of the classroom.
  The success of our teachers is amplified by the leadership of State 
Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, working with Education 
Secretary Betsy DeVos, and the parents, teachers, administrators, and 
locally elected school boards who are making a difference for the 
students of South Carolina for job opportunities and meaningful lives.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
