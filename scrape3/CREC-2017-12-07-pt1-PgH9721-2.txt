                              GOP TAX PLAN

  (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, our Republican colleagues who control the 
House, the Senate, and the White House are on the verge of another 
government shutdown. They have brought us to the brink, and now they 
are asking for more time to get their work done.
  Why do they need more time? We have seen this coming. We have already 
granted one extension. But instead of working with Democrats to avoid a 
shutdown, they have been rushing through a tax scam. They have been 
obsessed with this reverse Robin Hood scheme to take money from the 
middle class and give it to corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent.
  Meanwhile, we need to keep the VA open for business. We need to 
restore the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health 
centers. We need to provide safety for DACA recipients who are living 
in fear. We need to provide wildfire victims in California and the 
victims of the disastrous hurricanes who are waiting for emergency 
disaster funding the support they need to rebuild their lives.
  Each of these priorities has bipartisan support. But instead of 
working together on these bipartisan solutions, a unified Republican 
government has been focused solely on further rigging the system to 
benefit special interests and billionaires.
  No more extensions. Let's work to keep the government open and to 
address the real priorities of the American people.
