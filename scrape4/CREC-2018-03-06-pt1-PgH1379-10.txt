the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
memory of Richardson Police Officer David Sherrard.
  Last month, Sherrard and other officers responded to a domestic 
disturbance, where Sherrard was shot and later succumbed to his wound.
  Mr. Speaker, David Sherrard served with the Richardson Police 
Department for 13 years. He was known for his generosity and bravery, 
but above all, he was known for his faith in God, which he shared with 
others.
  Sherrard was the first Richardson police officer to die in the line 
of duty. His death is a great loss. His wife and daughters remain in my 
thoughts and prayers.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the service 
and sacrifice of David Sherrard, a true hometown hero.
