                                MEDICARE

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, a major western New York health 
insurance provider announced today that they are seeking an almost 50 
percent increase in health insurance premiums next year. They cite 
rising medical and drug costs as reasons for seeking this increase.
  Medicare is the most successful and popular healthcare system in 
America. With low administrative costs and high-quality outcomes, 
Americans ages 50 to 65 should be able to buy in, at their own expense, 
to Medicare. Under this plan, Medicare could add 10 million more 
Americans, using the leverage of 67 million Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, this is real leverage to drive down healthcare costs and 
drive up the quality of that coverage. With real patient protections 
and full and affordable coverage for preexisting diseases like cancer 
and diabetes, Medicare should be an option for Americans 50 to 65 years 
old.
