             150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ELGIN FIRE DEPARTMENT

 Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr President, today I wish to recognize the 
Elgin Fire Department's 150th anniversary and congratulate the brave 
men and women who protect the 100,000 residents living in Elgin, IL.
  For more than 100 years, the Elgin Fire Department has worked to 
preserve the safety and well-being of Illinoisans. Firefighters are the 
first responders who often put themselves in danger to rescue citizens 
from emergency situations involving extensive smoke and fire. The 
medical treatment responders save numerous lives, which may have been 
lost without prehospital care.
  The Elgin Fire Department continues to serve its community by 
providing fire safety education, fire inspection, and domestic 
preparedness planning, among other community outreach efforts, to 
increase community readiness. The department's stellar service ensures 
that the families and friends of Elgin are prepared for any emergency.
  I extend my best wishes for a remarkable and memorable anniversary. 
Thank you for your selfless work to Elgin, IL.
