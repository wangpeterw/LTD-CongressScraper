                            PETITIONS, ETC.

  Under clause 3 of rule XII,

       62. The SPEAKER presented a petition of Mr. Gregory D. 
     Watson, a citizen of Austin, Texas, relative to urging 
     Congress to propose, for ratification by special ratifying 
     conventions, an amendment to the United States Constitution 
     which would grant to the President the authority to veto 
     individual budgetary line-items of appropriation, that were 
     approved by Congress, and yet retain within Congress the 
     ordinary ability to override such a line-item veto by the 
     standard vote of two-thirds of both houses thereof; which was 
     referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
