                    IN SUPPORT OF THE MARCH FOR LIFE

  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, this week, thousands of Americans are 
joining together in our Nation's Capital for a common purpose, the 
March for Life.
  This year marks 45 years since Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in our 
country. Since 1974, generations of Americans have braved the elements 
and marched on Washington to pray for our Nation and be the voice for 
the most vulnerable members of our society, the unborn.
  As a member of the Pro-Life Caucus, I will continue to fight for 
legislation that values and protects the sanctity of innocent life. I 
applaud these courageous participants, and I stand with you in this 
movement. There is no more basic human right than the right to life.
