       RECOGNIZING TRACY BECKER FOR RECEIVING THE KEYSTONE AWARD

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Tracy Becker on being awarded the 2017 Keystone Award, which is the 
highest honor bestowed by the Pennsylvania Association of Chamber 
Professionals. Tracy Becker is executive director of the Clarion Area 
Chamber of Business & Industry.
  The Keystone Award was established in 1963 to recognize outstanding 
service in and contributions to the profession of chamber management in 
Pennsylvania. The award is not presented annually but only when an 
individual has merited such recognition.
  Tracy is just the 24th person to receive this award since its 
inception 54 years ago. She was nominated by her staff, the Clarion 
Chamber board members, and fellow members of the Pennsylvania 
Association of Chamber Professionals.
  Tracy began her chamber career in 1987, and she has dedicated her 
life to the betterment of the community. She has been with the Clarion 
Area Chamber of Business & Industry for more than 30 years, 13 of those 
as executive director.
  Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly congratulate Tracy Becker on this 
prestigious honor and thank her for making her community a better place 
to live and work.
