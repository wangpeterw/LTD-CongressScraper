     national security of the United States by helping to improve 
     the security of a major contributor to political stability, 
     security, and economic development in the Western Pacific. 
     Australia is an important Major non-NATO Ally and partner 
     that contributes significantly to peacekeeping and 
     humanitarian operations around the world. It is vital to the 
     U.S. national interest to assist our ally in developing and 
     maintaining a strong and ready self-defense capability.
       The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability in 
     current and future coalition efforts. This equipment will 
     help the Royal Australian Air Force better communicate with 
     and protect its F/A-18 aircraft, and the addition of MIDS 
     JTRS will accomplish the goal of making U.S. and Australian 
     aircraft more interoperable when supporting operational 
     forces. Australia will have no difficulty absorbing this 
     equipment into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of this equipment does not alter the 
     basic military balance in the region.
       The prime contractors will be the Harris Corporation, 
     Melbourne, FL. There are no known offset agreements proposed 
     in connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale may require the 
     assignment of U.S. contractor representatives to Australia 
     which will be determined at a later date.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

     or data could permit development of information which may 
     lead to a significant threat to future U.S. military 
     operations. If an adversary were to obtain this sensitive 
     technology, the missile system effectiveness could be 
     compromised through reverse engineering techniques.
       4. This proposed sale is necessary in furtherance of the 
     U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined 
     in the Policy Justification. Moreover, the benefits to be 
     derived from this sale, as outlined in the Policy

     result if the sensitive technology were revealed to 
     unauthorized persons.
       5. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to
