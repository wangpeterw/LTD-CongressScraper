                       NOMINATION OF AMUL THAPAR

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, as the Senate 
continues to process nominations, I would like to take a moment to say 
a few words about one for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth 
Circuit whom we will confirm this week.
  Judge Amul Thapar served with distinction on the U.S. District Court 
for the Eastern District of Kentucky for close to a decade, having 
previously served as U.S. attorney for that same district and as 
assistant U.S. attorney for several years before that.
  He was the first South Asian American to become a Federal judge, and 
once he is confirmed to the Sixth Circuit, Judge Thapar will be only 
the second South Asian American to serve on a Federal circuit court.
  The American Bar Association has given him its highest rating--
unanimously ``well qualified.'' That meant that in the group that rated 
him there was no one who didn't give him a ``well qualified'' rating, 
which is the best they could give any nominee. I certainly couldn't 
agree more with that characterization.
  Judge Thapar is an excellent jurist. I know he will make a great 
addition to the Sixth Circuit, and I am proud to support his 
nomination. I would encourage all Members of the Senate to support him 
as we advance his nomination today.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
