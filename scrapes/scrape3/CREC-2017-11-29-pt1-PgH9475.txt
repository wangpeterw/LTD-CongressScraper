                     WE NEED BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, look, I, like every Member in this House, 
recognize that we need to do something about taxes. We need bipartisan 
tax reform that actually works for everybody, but what the Senate 
passed through committee and what the House passed here a couple of 
weeks ago is not tax reform. It is a great big tax cut financed by 
middle class Americans and huge debt that will be passed on to our 
kids.
  It is just not right. We shouldn't do this just to put points on the 
board. I mean, if we are going to get this right, we should do it in a 
bipartisan way, and many of us stand ready to do that.
  What this shows--and the facts matter--is that every independent 
analysis, including our own analysis here in Congress that we have 
depended upon for years, shows that millions, tens of millions, over 80 
million middle class Americans, will get a tax increase, all to finance 
massive tax cuts for billionaires and corporations, people at the very 
top of the economy.
  This is a massive shift of wealth from hardworking Americans to 
people at the very top. We ought to do this right. We ought to do it 
right. We ought to stop this nonsense, go back to the process that we 
were elected to follow, and get this done in a way that is good for all 
Americans. This bill is not that.
