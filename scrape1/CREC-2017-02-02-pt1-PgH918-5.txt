                           LET US SHOW MERCY

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is going to be a devastating 
day for so many. For decades, America has been engaged in resettling 
refugees. I remember the Vietnamese, the Iraqis, and the people from 
Afghanistan. More importantly, I remember the excitement I had in 
visiting the Statue of Liberty and being reminded of what a great 
country this is.
  Tomorrow, with the 120-day suspension, we will literally devastate 
refugee families, some of whom waited 10, 12, 15 years, who have sold 
all their goods and who are good people who want to come to this 
country, and, as well, their documents will expire.
  I am asking the administration to have mercy and to be as the 
Chaplain ordered us to do: to find our grounding in being able to be 
servants.
  I would ask that we not devastate these families causing them to 
completely be derailed from moving toward being refugees in this 
country. No terrorist has been found in refugees.
  I believe it is crucial that we show mercy in the spirit of prayer, 
as in the prayer breakfast this morning. Let us show mercy.
