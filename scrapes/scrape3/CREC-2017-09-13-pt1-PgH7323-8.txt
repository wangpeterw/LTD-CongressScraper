                          CAMPAIGN FOR DECENCY

  (Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to the 
Campaign for Decency, which was launched by Lisa Cholnoky, a part-time 
resident of my district who is with us here today in the gallery.
  Operating out of the First Congressional District of New York, in 
Shelter Island, the Campaign for Decency is a nonpartisan organization 
that seeks to bring civility back to our Nation.
  Ms. Cholnoky was inspired to launch this campaign after witnessing 
much of the bitter division in our country and the inability of many 
Americans to engage in civil, productive discussion. As Americans, we 
cherish our freedom to dissent, but must always bear in mind that these 
debates must be productive and substantive.
  In July, Ms. Cholnoky mailed out 535 Decency buttons to every single 
Representative and Senator. She describes the campaign as ``a simple 
reminder of the basic standards of decency that every American 
deserves, regardless of their political views.''
  I am proudly wearing this button here today to join in Ms. Cholnoky's 
call for unity both here in Congress and together as citizens of the 
greatest country on Earth.
  This campaign sets an example for us all to abide by as we strive to 
reach across the aisle in a bipartisan fashion.
