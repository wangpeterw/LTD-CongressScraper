         RECOGNIZING BRETT RUBIN OF BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a brave 
young man in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Brett Rubin.
  A resident of Northampton, Brett's positive attitude and boundless 
energy make him a promising young leader in our community. This is even 
more notable due to the challenges Brett faces from type 1 diabetes. 
Despite these obstacles, Brett has never allowed this illness to define 
him or hold him back.
  More amazing, Mr. Speaker, is that Brett has channeled his desire to 
cure this illness and to help others. Partnering with the Juvenile 
Diabetes Research Foundation, Brett and his mother, Sandy, have raised 
thousands of dollars to combat type 1 diabetes. Participating in 
foundation walks, the Rubins join a close-knit group of family and 
friends, and they call themselves Brett's Band, which is a fitting name 
honoring a teenager who marches to his own beat and steals the show 
wherever he goes.
  It is my honor to recognize this exemplary young man. I know Brett's 
future will be bright and that type 1 diabetes will never interfere 
with his ambitions or his aspirations.
