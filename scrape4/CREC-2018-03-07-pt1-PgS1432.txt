       `` `You have a right to place a ``security freeze'' on your 
     credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting 
     agency from releasing information in your credit report 
     without your express authorization. The security freeze is 
     designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being 
     approved in your name without your consent. However, you 
     should be aware that using a security freeze to take control 
     over who gets access to the personal and financial 
     information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, 
     or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or 
     application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, 
     or any other account involving the extension of credit.
       `` `As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the 
     right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your 
     credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year 
     alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing 
     a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business 
     is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity 
     before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity 
     theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is 
     a fraud alert lasting 7 years.
       `` `A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, 
     or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of 
     the person or entity, with which you have an existing account 
     that requests information in your credit report for the 
     purposes of reviewing or collecting the account.
