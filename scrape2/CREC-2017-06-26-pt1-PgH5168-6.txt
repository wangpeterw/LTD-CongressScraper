         CONGRATULATING OUTSTANDING MUSIC PROGRAMS IN MINNESOTA

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to congratulate Chaska 
Middle School West, the Minnetonka School District, the Osseo Area 
School District, and Salem Lutheran School in Loretto on being named 
best communities for music education by the National Association of 
Music Merchants Foundation. They have all been recognized for 
outstanding commitment to their music programs.

  Research has proven that music is vital to a student's education. 
Music education benefits language development, spatial-temporal skills, 
and can lead to a higher IQ and increased test scores. Music also 
brings students together and gives them incentives to practice and 
strive for more self-improvement.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the administrators, the 
teachers, instructors, the parents, and the students in these schools 
and districts for their impressive dedication to music education. They 
put a lot of time and effort into their music programs, and all that 
hard work is really paying off.
