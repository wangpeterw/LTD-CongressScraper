                   AMERICANS DESERVE REAL TAX REFORM

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, again and again, President Donald Trump has 
promised tax reform that would help the middle class; and again and 
again, the President has broken those promises.
  Instead of helping America's middle class and the working poor, his 
proposals offer big breaks for millionaires and corporations, and 
painful cuts for nearly everyone else.
  The House Republican plan rolled out yesterday, rolls over the middle 
class and those looking to ascend the middle class. It cuts the estate 
tax, a tax that only affects a few thousand of the wealthiest American 
families, all while raising taxes on the lowest income bracket from 10 
to 12 percent.
  This plan slashes commonsense deductions for middle class families, 
including those for medical bills, student loan interest, and even 
mortgage interest. My Republican colleagues claim their plan would save 
people money,

but they say nothing about the $1.5 trillion their plan would add to 
the deficit over the next 10 years. That is about $12,000 of debt for 
each American household.
  The American people deserve real tax reform, not just more tax cuts 
for the wealthy and powerful and those connected.
