                    HONORING THE LIFE OF JACK BEATON

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Jack 
Beaton, a loving husband and father from Bakersfield, California.
  Jack traveled to the Route 91 music festival with his wife, Laurie, 
to celebrate their 23rd wedding anniversary. Jack died a hero, 
shielding Laurie from the gunfire.
  Laurie said Jack made her feel loved every single day. He was also a 
loving father to his two children. He always had a smile on his face 
and was a kid at heart.
  Jack was known as a hard worker who was always willing to give 
someone a helping hand. He was the type of person who had literally 
given someone the shirt off his back. His children's friends said that 
he, Jack, was a role model to them both as a father figure and as a 
best friend.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Jack Beaton's family and his 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.
