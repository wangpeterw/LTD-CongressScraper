                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Gracious Father, fill our government's legislative branch with Your 
truth. Where it is in need of purging, cleanse it. Where it is in 
error, direct it. Where anything is amiss, reform it. Where it is 
right, strengthen and confirm it. Where it is in want, furnish it. 
Where it is divided, unite it.
  Today, use our lawmakers for Your purposes. As they have the 
opportunities, may they strive to do good for Your glory. Guide and 
strengthen them as You provide for their needs. Lord, remind them that 
they are laborers together with You.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
