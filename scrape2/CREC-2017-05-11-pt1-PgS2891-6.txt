                    NOMINATION OF ROBERT LIGHTHIZER

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will take a cloture 
vote on the U.S. Trade Representative nominee, Robert Lighthizer. We 
know the task before Mr. Lighthizer is an important one. I appreciate 
his willingness to take on this challenge, and I look forward to 
working with the administration on pro-growth trade policies moving 
forward.
