                   THANKING GOOD KARMA ANIMAL RESCUE

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Good Karma 
Animal Rescue of Minnesota in Maple Grove and their animal efforts in 
southern Texas after Hurricane Harvey.
  After Harvey made landfall at the end of August, Good Karma Animal 
Rescue made two separate rescue attempts within a 2-week period south 
of Houston to the communities of Victoria and Rockport, Texas.
  Good Karma Animal Rescue, led by Lisa Booth, rescued over 50 
animals--ranging in all shapes, sizes, and ages--and brought them back 
to Minnesota to be treated for various ailments and prepare them for 
adoption by Minnesota families.
  Mr. Speaker, the Twin Cities community loves rescue animals, and I 
want to thank Good Karma Animal Rescue for their work to find homes for 
these pets that were left behind in the recent tragic storms.
