             WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH AND THE WOMEN OF DETROIT

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women's History 
Month and to show some R-E-S-P-E-C-T to a real Detroiter and Michigan 
legend, my dear friend and Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin.
  Aretha has taught us to be a proud ``Natural Woman.'' She has forced 
us, not just to ``Think'' about it, but also to act. Once called the 
voice of Black America, Ms. Franklin has been a champion in the 
African-American community for decades and in her hometown of Detroit.
  With a Hollywood star, 20 R&B number one hits, 18 Grammys, and a 
Medal of Freedom from President George Bush, she represents the best of 
Detroit and of our country.
  This month and every month, we must stand up to lift women up across 
this country, ensuring that our laws and policies empower and protect 
all women.
  I am proud to call Aretha Franklin my friend and to wish her a happy 
birthday, which was March 25, and to stand alongside this great 
champion for women everywhere this month, Women's History Month, and 
every day.
