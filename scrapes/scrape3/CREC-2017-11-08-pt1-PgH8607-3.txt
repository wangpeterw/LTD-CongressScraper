                           NATIONAL STEM DAY

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during National STEM Day, to 
recognize the importance of encouraging our youth to pursue their 
interests in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.
  As technology continues to advance, STEM occupations continue to grow 
and become more valuable to the development of our society. Over the 
past decade, employment in STEM occupations has outgrown non-STEM 
occupations by nearly 20 percent.
  I commend the House's work in implementing the annual Congressional 
STEM App Challenge for students across our Nation. This competition 
allows students to compete by creating an idea for an app on a platform 
of their choice and is designed to engage student creativity and 
encourage their participation in STEM fields.
  As a member of the Congressional STEM Education Caucus and the father 
of a STEM student in college, I will continue to support the growth of 
STEM education throughout Arkansas and our country.
