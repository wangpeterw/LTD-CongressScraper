             TRAFFICKING AT THE SUPER BOWL--NOT IN OUR TOWN

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, as the United States is gearing up 
for the Super Bowl in Houston, unfortunately, so are many human sex 
traffickers.
  Just a few days ago, a 21-year-old trafficking victim with mental 
special needs was rescued in Houston. The young girl was kidnapped off 
the streets of Ohio by a dastardly trafficker. He put her in his car 
and told her: Now you work for me. She was brought to Houston 
specifically to be trafficked at the Houston Super Bowl. However, the 
woman's mental disabilities and seizures became too much for the moral-
less trafficker, so he dropped the victim off downtown Houston where 
she later was sexually assaulted by a local criminal.
  A Good Samaritan rescued the girl and brought her to the hospital. As 
exploiters and buyers roam the streets looking for prey in Houston, 
they should know that Mayor Turner, the Department of Homeland 
Security, and local law enforcement are prepared to jail traffickers 
and rescue victims.
  No trafficking. Not in our town. We will protect victims and 
prosecute the slave trafficking deviants and buyers.
  And that is just the way it is.
