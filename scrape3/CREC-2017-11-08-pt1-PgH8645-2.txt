      CONGRATULATING MICHAEL FIRESTINE ON RECEIVING BRUNING AWARD

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Michael Firestine as he receives the prestigious Bruning 
Award from the American Bankers Association Center for Agricultural and 
Rural Banking.
  Mike Firestine's leadership and outstanding dedication to providing 
credit and financial guidance to farmers, ranchers, and rural 
businesses is well known in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He has 
been an agricultural banker with the same bank for more than 35 years.
  Mike began his ag banking career in 1978, with the Lebanon National 
Valley Bank, which later merged with Fulton Bank, where Mr. Firestine 
is currently a senior vice president.
  Over the course of his career, Mike has helped scores of young 
farmers establish themselves in the industry. His counsel and advice 
propelled many to success.
  In many ways, Mike has stayed true to his roots. He was born and 
raised in a small town in Pennsylvania, where his grandfather was a 
dairy farmer. He runs a family farm, where he produces pumpkins and 
other crops and raises Hereford cattle.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Mike Firestine on this 
tremendous achievement and an outstanding career in agriculture.
