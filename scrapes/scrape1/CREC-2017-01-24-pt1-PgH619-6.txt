        A WOMAN'S RIGHT AND LIBERTY TO MAKE OWN HEALTH DECISIONS

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against H.R. 7, 
the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full 
Disclosure Act.
  We are here to represent all of our constituents, even the ones we 
don't agree with. It should be the woman alone who makes the decision, 
not Republicans, not Democrats, not the Trump administration, no one 
but the woman and her doctor.
  I support choice so every woman in America could make the decision 
that is right for her, her family, her God, her health, and her 
reproduction.
  Creating access issues and removing coverage does not stop abortions; 
it drives them underground. H.R. 7 essentially creates a disparity 
between poor women and rich women.
  For women, children, foster youth, for the LGBT community, for the 
middle class, working class, poor people, people of color, undocumented 
residents, and people who see health care as a right and not as a 
privilege for those who can afford it, they should have the right and 
liberty to make their own health decisions.
