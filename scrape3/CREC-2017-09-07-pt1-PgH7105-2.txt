                          SUPPORT THE DREAMERS

  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of 
DREAMers.
  When I was just a baby, my parents brought me to this country because 
they sought freedom, opportunity, and a better life for our family. As 
a parent now, I know how they must have felt because I, too, would do 
anything for my children, no matter the risk. That parental instinct to 
give our children better opportunities than we had is universal and 
powerful.
  DREAMers were brought to this country as children by families who 
sought a better life. They were just kids and had no role in the 
decision to leave their native country, and they have done nothing 
wrong. They demonstrate one of our Nation's most basic promises: the 
American Dream is available to anyone who is willing to work for it.
  The President's decision this week to end DACA will tear families 
apart. Worse yet, it punishes children who have done nothing to deserve 
punishment. It is immoral and wrong.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you bring the Dream Act to the floor so we 
can enact an enduring solution for the 800,000 aspiring Americans who 
would be hurt by the President's decision.
