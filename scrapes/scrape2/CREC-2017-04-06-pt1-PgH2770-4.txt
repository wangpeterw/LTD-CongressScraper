  INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED CONCERNING RUSSIA 
                               CONNECTION

  (Mr. RASKIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, the gassing of civilians is an atrocity, a 
human rights violation, and a war crime. Assad's chemical gassing of 
his own people took place just a few days after the White House said 
that it would be silly to try to dislodge President Assad from power in 
Syria.
  Somehow, we have to disentangle and disenthrall ourselves from 
Putin's friend, Assad, and all of the bullies and dictators and 
authoritarians on Earth who are a threat to their own people.
  Last week 75,000 people marched in Russia against corruption and 
human rights violations. We should be on the side of the Russian people 
who are trying to liberate themselves from human rights violations and 
murder and political corruption in their country.
  We need an independent investigation of the political, financial, 
military, and diplomatic invasion of America with this Russian 
connection. We need to restore our moral leadership in the world as the 
champion of human rights.
