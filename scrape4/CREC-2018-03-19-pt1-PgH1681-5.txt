                        FIRING OF ANDREW McCABE

  (Mr. POCAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, President Trump had Andrew 
McCabe, the Deputy Director of the FBI, fired.
  His offense?
  Well, he is about to be a witness in the Mueller investigation and 
had copious notes about his conversations with the President. What 
better way to nullify damning testimony than to fire the person about 
to give it, all while signaling to anyone else the consequences of 
crossing the President.
  But it is worse than just that. The President fired Andrew McCabe in 
a way completely devoid of human decency: 2 days before his full 
retirement.
  The message to McCabe and anyone else who would cross him was: I 
won't just go after you, but your family and your future, too. I will 
destroy you.
  Like a thug in a mafia movie, Trump made his move. Fortunately, the 
Founders of this country made sure we had checks and balances in the 
system to avoid this dangerous style of governing.
  I and others have offered Andrew McCabe, a 21-year law enforcement 
professional in the FBI, a job to ensure he will be able to get his 
hard-earned pension.

  No one should fear harm to their family, their pension, their future 
by a petulant man-child or a ruthless demagogue, depending on the mood 
of the day.
  I stand with you, Andrew McCabe, and so do the American people.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Banks of Indiana). Members are reminded 
to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President.
