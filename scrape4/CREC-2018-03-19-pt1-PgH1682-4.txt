                REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JENNIFER IRVINE

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of 
Jennifer Irvine. She attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on 
October 1.
  Jennifer Irvine devoted her life and career to defending people in 
family court and criminal court. She opened her own law firm in 
downtown San Diego, California, where she worked tirelessly to defend 
each of her clients.
  In her free time, Jennifer loved snowboarding, hot yoga, cats, and 
sailing. She had even earned a black belt in tae kwon do. She hoped to 
one day learn indoor rock climbing and to later experience skydiving.
  Jennifer is remembered by all those who knew her as loyal, fierce, 
and passionate. She had a genuine devotion for helping people and was 
always driven to be her best self.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Jennifer Irvine's family and 
friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.
