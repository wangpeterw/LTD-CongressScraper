  CONGRATULATING PANAMA CITY BEACH FIRE CHIEF JOHN DALY ON RETIREMENT

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Panama City 
Beach Fire Chief John Daly on his retirement.
  Chief Daly served the people of Panama City Beach for 33 years and 
willingly took up the responsibility to run into the fire, putting his 
life on the line to save others countless times.
  When he began his career with Panama City Beach Fire and Rescue in 
1985, there were only seven career firefighters. Today that number has 
grown to 35 as our city has grown and thrived. John was promoted to 
chief in 2002 and has remained an outstanding leader ever since. He 
considers the firefighters under his watch to be family, and he knows 
that they will continue to do great things under the leadership of the 
new fire chief, Larry Couch.
  Madam Speaker, please join me in saying thank you to Chief Daly, his 
wife, Joan, and their daughters for their years of service and 
sacrifice, and wish them luck as they enjoy a new chapter in life.

                          ____________________
