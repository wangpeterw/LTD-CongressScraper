                        TRIBUTE TO CHASE GLAZIER

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Chase Glazier, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Chase is a graduate of Custer High School in Custer, SD. Currently, 
he is attending South Dakota State University in Brookings, SD, where 
he is majoring in communications. Chase is a dedicated worker who has 
been committed to getting the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Chase Glazier for all 
of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the 
years to come.
