10291,topic-id,2312,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today, having returned from the weekend in Wyoming, talking to people as a physician, and talking to former patients of mine. What I see is that the pain of ObamaCare is continuing to worsen around the country for men, women, families, and people who have been living under the Obama healthcare law for a number of years now.  This is an important day, when insurance companies have to come up with the filings and the plans on what they plan to do for next year with regard to plans that meet the ObamaCare mandate. So very soon, millions of people will find out if they are going to be able to buy an insurance plan in their own communities, regardless of the cost. We have seen that the Blue Cross Blue Shield group in Maryland has proposed rate increases up to 58 percent for next year in the State of This is after they went up 24 percent last year. How many families can afford such a thing? But that is what we are dealing with.  That is why it is so critical that we get involved in trying to provide relief for American families at this time, with the Obama healthcare insurance market, certainly, collapsing. The head of Blue Cross Blue Shield in Maryland, which is the largest insurer in the State, has said that they see their system is in the early throes of what is known as the insurance death spiral. Prices are continuing to go up, fewer people are signing up, and, as a result, prices are going to have to be raised even more. We saw last year that they went up 24 percent, and this year the proposal, going forward to next year, is 58 percent. This is a terrifying reality for people on ObamaCare today.  One of the big reasons we have been working so hard on healthcare reform is to improve access to healthcare--not empty coverage, but actual healthcare. So what we want to do as Republicans is get rid of some of the excessive mandates, the expensive mandates, things that are driving up the cost of care and certainly driving up the cost of coverage for that care.  When prices come down, people are able to afford insurance and companies are ready to sell that insurance. I know we have people in Wyoming who are ready to buy it. That is how you improve access to insurance. It is how you also improve access to care. You don't do it by forcing the prices up and[[Page S3666]]then requiring people to buy coverage, which is what the Democrats who voted for ObamaCare did. They said: You have to buy it, it is a mandate, whether you like it or not. We know better than you do. That is what we heard from the Democrats during the debate on President Obama's healthcare law. That is what they passed. They passed it. They voted for it. They didn't know what was in it. Actually, it was the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who said: First you have to pass it before you even get to find out what is in it.  President Obama gave a big speech to a joint session of Congress and said that if people like their plans, they can keep their plans. One of the newspapers called that the ``Lie of the Year.'' So millions of Americans then got letters from insurance companies; over 5,000 in Wyoming got that letter. It said: Sorry, your insurance plan isn't good enough for government.  People ought to be able to make that decision for themselves. Families ought to make that decision, not Democrats in Washington who voted for the ObamaCare law. They shouldn't have the right to tell the people of my State or any State what is best for them and their family. It is interesting because the Democrats don't seem to want to remember that anymore. They have selective amnesia.  It turned out that if people liked their plan, they weren't really allowed to keep it. I heard about it again a week ago at a Wyoming stock growers meeting--farmers and ranchers from around the State of Wyoming who come together each year, an organization that has been in existence longer than the State has been a These are hard-working people who know what works best for them, what works best for their families. Some of these outfits have been in those families for 100 years. We have something called the Centennial Ranch program where they gather all the family members when an outfit has been in that family for 100 years, and they have been able really to survive so much over the years. Often they would say, you know, whether they deal with floods, whether they deal with fire, the biggest problem they have is often dealing with the Federal We have seen it all across the board, and healthcare is just one of the last things to add to a long litany of Federal Government involvement in the lives of the people of our State of  So here we are today with this incredible government overreach and the failure of that overreach, and even the insurance companies, some of whom supported the passage of the healthcare law, are saying that this is not working. How they reflect the fact that it is not working is they say: OK, we are not going to sell insurance anymore. You can't make them sell insurance. The prices have to go up too much, and it is just not worth the effort.  One of the big insurance companies, Humana, is dropping out of the ObamaCare exchange entirely next year. They made the announcement. Aetna said that it is quitting the internal markets in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska, and Anthem is pulling out of The list goes on.  Now, so far, there are over 40 counties across the country that are expected to have no one selling insurance on the exchange--no one. In Wyoming, we are down to one company that sells it. We had two; one lost so much money, they were pulled off of the market. The second one, which does sell insurance in Wyoming, continues to lose money by selling on the exchange. They are committed to stay, but they just scratch their heads about what the potential future may hold. We are now seeing over 40 counties across the country where no one is selling insurance. That is the reality of  Remember, President Obama said: If you pass this, there will be huge competition, big marketplaces. If there is only one selling insurance, it is not a marketplace; it is a monopoly.  Next year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has said that about 40 percent of all the counties in America will have just one company selling on the exchange--just one--forty percent of the counties all across That is a monopoly. What happens when those companies decide to drop out?  Even for people who get an ObamaCare subsidy, if there is no one in that community, in that county selling ObamaCare insurance, the subsidy has no value whatsoever. It can't be used.  That is another part of the story that the Democrats refuse to talk about. In fact, Democrats say a lot of things about insurance coverage that aren't really telling the whole story. They have talked about the Congressional Budget Office report; they talk about a number of things. One of the interesting things about the Congressional Budget Office report--the CBO report, kind of the scorekeepers that take a look at things--on the bill that passed the House said that there will be millions of people fewer who will have insurance if the Republican-passed bill becomes law. Well, the news headlines screamed that the House bill would mean millions of people lose their insurance. Well, that is wrong. That is not at all what will happen.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, when you look at it and see why is it that there will be fewer people with insurance under ObamaCare if you eliminate the individual mandate--the part of the law that says you must buy a government-approved program--the Congressional Budget Office says that if you don't mandate it, a lot of people don't want to buy it. They don't view it as a good benefit to them. They don't view it as worth their money.  If people aren't required to buy insurance, millions of them will choose not to purchase the insurance, especially when they believe it is not a good deal for them personally. I believe Americans have that right. Apparently, the Democrats don't believe that Americans have that right. They like the mandate. They like making people do things. That, to me, is the difference between a Republican approach, which provides for freedom, and a Democratic approach of government and mandates.  We want to give people the right to decide what is right for them and their families. That is what I hear in Wyoming at the Wyoming Stock Growers Association and as I travel around the People know what is best for them and their families. Then, when all of a sudden what they had is taken off the market because the government says that you can't sell it anymore, that is an affront to their ability to choose what works for them and their family, and it is things they have had in the past. Then they got stuck buying some very expensive plan that covered a lot of things they didn't need, didn't want, and couldn't afford, but the government said: We know better than you do, the people of Wyoming, the people of  So the Congressional Budget Office says that 8 million people who get coverage in the individual market will decide it is just not worth buying. They also said that there will be 4 million people on Medicaid next year, and if you eliminate the mandate, they aren't going to sign up for it, even when it is free, because they realize that, for many people, being on Medicaid--a failing system--isn't providing much for them at all.  So insurance isn't being taken from people; these are people who are making a decision as free individuals--Americans--of how they want to spend their money and what they want to sign up for, or not.  So the legislation that passed the House really makes no changes in Medicaid in 2018. Yet, the CBO says millions of people on Medicaid will drop it when the mandate goes away.  The Senate is coming up with its own solution. We are looking at ways to make sure that Americans have access to insurance that works for them, not just what works for Democrats in We roll back some of the worst parts of Prices for health insurance will go down. People will have better options than the one-size-fits-all plans that Washington has forced on the American people. They will have other options that will work better for them and their families.  Our goal is to not do what the Democrats did. ObamaCare actually kicked people off insurance that worked for them, pulled the rug right out from under them; Republicans don't want to pull the rug out from anyone. Our goal is to reform the American healthcare system so that insurance costs less and it meets the needs of the people who buy it. Republicans' goal is to focus on care, not just useless coverage that ObamaCare had provided for many,[[Page S3667]]with narrower networks so you can't keep your doctor, you can't go to the hospital in your community, you can't get the care you need, you can't see certain specialists, which is what we have seen with  If Democrats want to talk about people losing their insurance, they need to look at what ObamaCare is doing to people right now. They need to look at people who are losing their insurance because their insurers are walking away from them. They need to look at people who are losing their insurance because of the premium increases we are seeing requested in Maryland; 24 percent is actually how much it went up last year and 58 percent in certain areas requested for this year.  Now I hear the Democrats say that they are worried about whether people with preexisting conditions get insurance. As a doctor, I will tell you, my wife is a breast cancer survivor; we are absolutely committed as Republicans to make sure that no one with a preexisting condition is left out. Democrats can't make that claim. They have made it over the years. But if there is no one selling insurance where you live, there is no exchange being offered, and you live in those 40 counties right now with no one selling--none--zero, and that number of counties is going to expand next year--if you have a preexisting condition and you are living under ObamaCare, you cannot get insurance no matter what any Democrat says, because no one is willing to sell it to you, even if you get a government subsidy--no one. You are left out. That is what the Democrats have given us in this country with their failed ObamaCare system.  So ObamaCare continues collapsing. It is going to harm more Americans who have preexisting conditions.  The other day, Senator Schumer admitted that ObamaCare isn't providing affordable access to care. I think it is an important admission from the minority leader. Now it is time for him and the Democrats to join with Republicans in the Senate--join us in providing Americans the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

10264,topic-id,521,"Mr.Speaker, this week, the Senate is poised to completely break Donald Trump's promises on healthcare. Remember, he promised insurance for everyone, it would be less expensive, and it wouldn't touch  Well, the CBO report, out yesterday, makes it devastatingly clear that the Republicans are ready to repudiate all three of those promises. Next year alone, 15 million Americans will lose their healthcare coverage.  Over the course of the decade, that number will swell to 22 million And because they have disguised the impact to appear later in the next decade, we will watch those numbers skyrocket.  Less expensive?  Well, under their proposal, a 64-year-old with a $56,800 income--not upper middle class by any stretch of the imagination--will, by 2026, face an annual insurance premium of $20,000. Impacts are most pronounced on low-income and older  Won't touch Medicaid?  Their proposal anticipates $772 billion over the next decade to be slashed from that budget, a 26 percent cut for the health insurance provider that gives care to most Americans, 16 percent fewer people, people with higher costs, less coverage, and poorer insurance.  They take a stab at the concern about the destabilization of the insurance market, which their proposal will do, by taking away the mandate that people have coverage, allowing people to wait until they are sick but still requiring insurers to cover them.  There is an escape hatch. They don't have to provide that if there has been a break in coverage. Then there is 6 months' delay required before people can sign up. Think about what a 6-month delay could mean for somebody who is just diagnosed for cancer. It is the equivalent of a death sentence.  The people you trust for your healthcare do not support this bill. The American Medical Association, hospitals, people who deal with rheumatism, cerebral palsy, cancer advocates, across the board they express reservations or outright opposition.  Who do you trust with your medical care--who do you rely on who supports it?  No one you rely on supports this measure.  And make no mistake, healthcare in America will be worse. That is why the people you trust don't support it. Seniors in nursing homes and disabled children will suffer and, yes, we ought to admit it; people will die. There is very good research available that is logical, suggesting that for every 20 million people who do not have insurance coverage, an extra 24,000 people a year die year after year.  And why are we doing this?  To fulfill a campaign pledge and to be able to cut taxes for those who need it the least. This massive reduction in healthcare finances massive tax reductions. This is immoral.  There is a reason that it was hatched in secret, keeping it away even from Republican senators while it was being formulated, and why they are trying to jam this through in 1 week--a parody of Republican complaints about not enough process for This is unprecedented and it is wrong.  It is our job, each and every one of us, to make sure the American public knows what is at stake before it is too late.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5183-4.txt,99,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,27.0,May
10237,topic-id,795,"Mr.President, I am deeply disappointed by the secrecy that has been employed by my colleagues in their reckless attempts to gut the Affordable Care It is clear to me that, in the absence of hearings,[[Page S3681]]of public debate, and of any bill text at all, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will go to any length to suppress the undeniable successes associated with the Affordable Care  Unfortunately, that now includes blocking a noncontroversial resolution to promote and bring awareness to National Minority Health Month simply because the text contains facts about the Affordable Care They have decided that concealing the reality of what the Affordable Care Act has brought to minority communities is more important than promoting minority health.  I am proud to help lead this resolution with Senator Cardin and my colleagues here this afternoon because raising awareness and finding ways to promote minority health is critically important to the future of our Nation and should be a shared priority amongst my colleagues. As of last year, over half of nonelderly Americans who lacked insurance were people of color and minorities face increased barriers when trying to access the care that is available to them.  In the past, our Republican colleagues worked with us on this resolution, which is why it has seen bipartisan and unanimous support. Now, however, like the secret healthcare bill they are drafting behind closed doors, they have turned an important and commonsense resolution into a political football, refusing to pass it unless it is stripped of any and all facts that don't fit their false narrative on the Affordable Care The fact of the matter is that the Affordable Care Act has worked for minority communities. The Affordable Care Act has reduced the uninsured rate for minority communities by at least 35 percent.  It has led to a 7 percent drop in the uninsured rate amongst African Americans and has cut the uninsured rate for Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders in half. It has provided new protections for American Indians and Native Alaskans while cutting the uninsured rate amongst those communities by nearly 10 percent. The facts show that minorities have seen some of the largest gains in health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act and, despite the work we still have before us, have more access to affordable coverage than ever before.  Still, many in minority communities struggle to obtain coverage and receive quality care, despite chronic diseases disproportionately impacting many minority groups. That is why the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which was created to address and prevent chronic disease under the ACA, is so critical to minority health. That is also why these same communities will yet again feel the brunt of these callous and misguided cuts should the prevention fund be eliminated along with the  African Americans are twice as likely to die from diabetes as White Thankfully, the prevention fund has invested $291 million in diabetes prevention. Latino women are 44 percent more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer than White women. Therefore, the prevention fund has invested $218 million in breast and cervical cancer prevention. Overall, the prevention fund has invested $227 million to the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health  But eliminating the prevention fund wouldn't just negatively impact minority communities. In Connecticut, the Fund has invested over $27 million in our communities since 2010, improving the lives and well-being of people there every day.  This strong investment has provided more Connecticut women with screenings for cancer. It has given our State health department the ability to better prevent diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and fight obesity through improved physical activity. It has allowed Connecticut to address school health more successfully, enriching our children's lives and inspiring a new generation of more healthy and happy citizens. It has provided the Connecticut Immunization Program with nearly half of its funding, with the program stating they ``don't know how we could continue to exist without this funding.''  Should the Affordable Care Act be repealed and the Prevention Fund eliminated, with TrumpCare cruelly and inadequately thrust upon our Nation in its place, the consequences would be devastating, not only for minority communities, but for the country as a whole. Bottom line: the Affordable Care Act has improved access to quality and affordable healthcare for all Americans and particularly for those that need it the most.  I sincerely hope that my Republican colleagues stop denying, ignoring, and concealing that the Affordable Care Act--and the minority communities that benefited from it--has helped our Nation's health. I stand ready to build upon the great strides made in improving minority health since the Affordable Care Act, and I hope my colleagues are ready to do the same.

10297,topic-id,2722,"Mr.President, earlier this week, on Monday morning at 9 a.m., I held a last-minute emergency field hearing on healthcare. With our colleagues on the other side of the aisle refusing to hold any official hearing on the bill and refusing to even show us the bill--what almost certainly is almost bad policy that is contained in the bill--I wanted the people of Connecticut to know that their voices and their faces would be heard and seen here in Washington, DC, and their stories would be told with or without an official committee hearing.  When I say this emergency field hearing was last minute, it was truly last minute, with many people having not even days but hours of advance notice to come and speak and share with me and others what the Affordable Care Act has meant to them, to their families, to their communities, and what losing it would mean to them.  To say the room was full would be a gross understatement. Every seat was filled, and when those seats were gone, people lined the wall two or three deep and squeezed in through the door. They were so anxious to be heard, and they were loud and clear. They were heard by me, and now I want their voices to be heard here.  We are continuing this hearing. In fact, we are having a second hearing on Friday afternoon at 1:30 in New We are sending out notices, blasting them to the people of We will have a third, if appropriate and necessary.  The people who came to this emergency field hearing in Connecticut were no different from millions of other people around the country, and they were speaking, in a sense, for all In my mind, they were speaking for parents who are suffering, providers who are healing, kids fighting back against dreaded diseases. They came because the closed-door discussions held in secret here by a small number of colleagues across the aisle will impact them every single day for the rest of their lives. My constituents and the people of Connecticut and the people of the country are unrepresented in those discussions. That is a travesty and a betrayal of our trust and our job.  So, on Friday, we are going to do the same thing. We are holding another emergency hearing in New Haven so people of my State can be heard, despite this disgraceful process that has left them and so many others on the outside looking in. They are excluded from democracy, and that is unconscionable.  If nothing else, I hope my colleagues will realize one thing. This is what democracy looks like. This is how we are meant to make decisions with many opinions--much debate, diversity of viewpoint, sometimes messy but always transparent, open, and clear to people whose lives are affected by it. That is what this emergency field hearing was designed to do.  Since it is becoming increasingly clear that this bedrock principle of our democracy--the right to open and honest debate--is being denied, I want to share some of the stories I heard on Monday, just some of them, and I will be sharing more of these stories over the coming days.  Justice Brianna Croutch was described by her mother as a beautiful free spirit, as you can see from this side of the photo. She was filled with compassion and at 21 years old had a beautiful and meaningful life ahead of her, all of her life ahead of her. She was a full-time student in a dental program, and she had a 4.0 average.  Justice, like far too many people, particularly young people in Connecticut and around the country, had a substance use disorder, and she needed effective, long-term treatment to begin that road to recovery. For Justice, this treatment came too late, and on August 23, 2015, she overdosed on heroin. It led to a brain injury. It is likely she will never recover from that injury.  ``More likely than not,'' her mother said, ``I will have to make the decision to bring my daughter home with hospice care. No parent should be faced with these decisions.'' That is what Jennifer Kelly said at the hearing on  That is a picture of Justice as she is today.  I want to read exactly what Jennifer Kelly said because her words are far more powerful and meaningful than mine could ever be.       The American Health Care Act--  The House version of the so-called replacement for the Affordable Care Act--     would reduce Medicaid funding by $800 million, which provides      coverage to an estimated 3 in 10 adults dealing with an      opioid addiction. This will be so devastating to those      seeking treatment for an opioid addition. In a system where      families are already seeking help, this will be a tremendous      step backwards.       So here I am, almost two years later, pleading for life,      fighting once again for families I have never met, because I      believe that no one should have to fight to get help for      addiction in this country like my daughter did. So my      question is, Mr.President and the members of the Senate,      what number of lives lost will be enough? What is the magic      number of sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, aunts and      uncles that we as a nation will have to lose before you      realize this country needs help?  I ask that same question of my colleagues today. I ask the question that Jennifer, a brokenhearted mother, asked. What number of lives will be enough? How many is enough? When will others in this body realize that gutting our healthcare system and stripping millions of care will simply make this opioid epidemic worse?  Jennifer was unfortunately not the only person who came to speak about the opioid epidemic. For me, the most moving and powerful among those moments came from Maria Skinner, who runs the McCall Center for Behavioral Health in Connecticut, who was there to give her thoughts and share the stories of two young people. I was actually lucky enough to meet both of them. Once again, I am going to share her words directly:       What I want to do is talk to you about two people and make      that a real, personal, granular, human story. . . . And you      know these two people very well; it's Frank and  She was speaking to me.       [You] have met Frank and Sean, who were able to access care      and get clean and sober because of the Medicaid expansion,      because they were able to have coverage.       And they've come here, to these rooms, to speak      courageously and publicly about their struggle and about      their recovery, and about how grateful they are to be able to      be clean and sober because of the access of care afforded      them through their insurance coverage.       We went to Sean's funeral on Saturday, and . . . Frank      would be here today if he wasn't as brokenhearted as I am.      Sean was 26 and had been doing really well, was on      Naltrexone, was taking a Vivitrol shot, and he had to have      surgery for a hernia, because[[Page S3671]]     he raced motorbikes professionally and the hernia hurt him.      He wanted to go back and was doing so well, he was speaking      publicly to youth and was anxious to go back into doing what      he loved. So he had that surgery and had to come off of his      medication to do that. He was very vulnerable after his      surgery, and he slipped once, and he used.       I've been to too many funerals and seen too many mothers      and fathers brokenhearted at the coffins of their sons and      daughters. We can't make this any harder than it already is.      To me, it is unconscionable.  Maria is right, and so is Gutting Medicaid would be unconscionable. Weakening the protections afforded to those with mental health or substance use disorder would be truly unconscionable. Repealing the Affordable Care Act and the provisions within it that have meant more coverage, more healthcare, and more healing for those suffering from substance use disorder and struggling to break the grip of this opioid epidemic would be unconscionable and costly beyond words.  Alternative funds, as some reports say Republicans have considered, will never replace a permanent insurance program like Medicaid because Medicaid guarantees that coverage is there when families need it. No alternative can do that.  In Connecticut, nearly half of all medication-assisted treatment for people with substance use disorders is paid by My fear is that the Republican bill in place will mean that these people would have no place to go. They would have no support for medications, counseling, and help, no chance to get better, no place to go. I refuse to let us find out the answer to what would happen to them if Medicaid were gutted. I refuse to allow it to happen, if I have anything to do with it.  People with substance use disorder are not the only ones who will see their coverage threatened by a weakening of protections for those with preexisting conditions. In Connecticut on Monday, Shawn Lang of AIDS-Connecticut expanded on what this bill would mean for the people living with HIV in this country.       Some of us lived through the early days of the plague when      we went to funeral after funeral, memorial service after      memorial service, week after week, month after month,      watching our friends wither away and die. The healthcare bill      that is currently secretly weaving its way through Congress      would bring us back to the early days of the plague.       HIV is a preexisting condition. Over half of the people      living with HIV in the country and in this state are over the      age of 50 and rely on Medicaid as their primary source of      insurance. Most of those people also have other co-     morbidities like substance abuse disorders and mental health      disorders. What little we know about this bill would be      devastating to people with HIV and AIDS, and it essentially      would amount to a death sentence. Once again, having lived      through those early days, we don't want to go back there.  Shawn's story is one of many I heard about the fear of losing coverage due to a preexisting condition.  Gay Hyre, a 60-year-old breast cancer survivor, has similar concerns about what gutting the Affordable Care Act would mean not just for her but for everyone around her. She said this about why she came to speak at the hearing:       I'm not just worried for me about my own care, although I      will be on the receiving end of a lot of bad parts of this. I      care passionately about the other 23 million Americans who      are my fellow citizens of every age, type, and need. It's      about the future, it's about our kids, it's about our      grandkids who won't have access to treatments, who won't have      access to doctors.  I know my colleagues across the aisle don't want to hear these stories. If they wanted to hear these stories from people in Connecticut and around the country, millions of stories, we would have hearings--not just emergency field hearings; we would have hearings here in Washington before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and before the Committee on Finance and other committees that have jurisdiction on the House side as well as in the We would be having a real debate, a robust discussion, and everyone of us here would have a chance to review this bill, if there is a bill, and comment on it and hear from the people we represent. But unfortunately my colleagues across the aisle don't want to hear about the details of repealing the Affordable Care  One witness at my hearing, Ellen Andrews of the Connecticut Health Policy Project, really summed up the reason. Here is what she said:       We have been working on expanding health coverage, high-     quality, affordable coverage to everyone in the state and now      everyone in the nation. I looked back, actually, at 2010, how      many people were uninsured in this state before the      Affordable Care Act, it was 397,000 people, almost 400,000.      Last year it was down by 262,000. That is 262,000 fewer      people living in our state without insurance because of the      Affordable Care  I want to share one final story. It is about a little boy in Connecticut who has a lot to lose if the Affordable Care Act is secretly gutted behind closed doors, as is now happening in real time right before our eyes, in secret, invisibly, in this body. I want to tell you about Connor  Two years ago, when Connor was 5 years old, his parents noticed that he was lagging behind his twin brother. They brought him to a doctor. Rather than receiving a simple diagnosis, they learned that Connor has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a degenerative terminal disease that has no cure. Most people with the disease don't survive past their midtwenties. Connor's family wrote that their sweet boy, who was just 5 and full of life, would slowly lose his ability to run, to walk, to lift his arms. Eventually, they said, he would lose the ability to hug them at all.  Connor needs complex care from multiple specialists, costing an estimated $54,000 a year. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, he cannot be denied coverage and has the coverage he needs to receive care. His family also wrote that any elimination of lifetime caps or elimination of essential health benefits will hinder his family's ability to access the care that Conner needs.  This is Conner in a picture that has been provided by his family.  The ACA removed barriers to Conner's care, and they are concerned--and so am I--that this reckless, reprehensible bill will put them back to the place that they were when they first learned about Conner's diagnosis.  Should Conner's disease progress, he will very likely need access to Medicaid in order to offset the costs of living with a disability, but for his family, the question now is, Will Medicaid even be there? If that devastating day comes, will he continue to receive the care he needs?  Conner's family is not about to give up. They have come to my office annually since he was diagnosed in order to fight for a cure and to fight for the Affordable Care Act--sometimes with tears in their eyes. They raise awareness, and they fight for their little boy. I know they would do it a million times over again if it meant that Conner could get better and live a long and healthy life.  Conner and others like him are why I am here. Conner and others like him are why I will continue this fight against any attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a shameful, disgraceful bill that has been written behind closed doors--destroying lives and degrading the quality of life for millions of  The people whom I have met in Connecticut who came to this hearing--and countless others who have talked to me about the Affordable Care Act--are fighting for their lives and their health and for others who need it as well.  Those people whom I met in Connecticut and the others who will come to our hearing on Friday and, perhaps, afterward are the reason I am fighting for better coverage for all of the people of Connecticut and our country.  Those people are the best of our country with their fighting spirit and dedication to the people they love, and they deserve to be heard. They are the voices and faces of the Affordable Care Act who have been turned away at the door of this I refuse to allow them to be silenced.  As I have mentioned, we will be back at it again on Friday because hearing from our constituents is part of our job. It is the bedrock of democracy. It is the fundamental core of what we do--listening to the people whom we represent. Failing to do so is unconscionable just as destroying the Affordable Care Act would be unconscionable, just as denying Conner what he needs would be unconscionable, just as ignoring Justice and Sean and Frank would be unconscionable.

I am proud to support this rule and the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization  Mr.Speaker, last November, the American people sent a strong message: They want a secure southern border. Having a strong system of border security is critical to our national defense and the safety and the security of the American people. President Trump has asked us to get more boots on the ground protecting our border, and this bill is an important step in that process.  U.Border Patrol agencies are the ones serving on the front lines when it comes to border security. These hardworking men and women serve day at night at the border, at airports, and at sea and land ports in an effort to keep us safe. We should be grateful for their service and their sacrifice.  Unfortunately, U.Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, is woefully understaffed. In fact, the numbers show that we are short 1,000 officers and 1,800 Border Patrol agents. This shortage is making it harder to secure the border and help keep bad actors out of our country.  That is where this bill comes in. It would amend the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 to provide necessary discretionary waiver authority to the CBP Commissioner in an effort to reduce the staffing shortage. The bill specifically would provide the Commissioner with the authority to waive the polygraph examinations in three circumstances.  The polygraph exam would be waived for current State and local law enforcement officers who have already passed a polygraph examination, Federal law enforcement officers who have already passed a stringent background investigation, and veterans with at least 3 consecutive years in the military who have held a clearance and passed a background check. These are three very tailored and specific circumstances, and these are exactly the[[Page H4663]]kind of men and women we want and need when it comes to border security positions.  Mr.Speaker, it is important to note that the waiver authority granted under this bill is not mandatory. It will ultimately be the decision of the CBP Commissioner to decide on a strict case-by-case basis whether to issue a waiver. The Commissioner can order a polygraph.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

10071,topic-id,1002,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to talk about the President's proposed budget as it relates to Medicaid and the fact that it is just a war on Medicaid; that is, it continues the wrongheaded ideas that have been proposed in the House bill on healthcare reform and takes that and continues to make cuts to Medicaid that are unsustainable for our healthcare system.  The President's budget would impose a block grant or per capita cap on States in 2020 in exchange for so-called flexibility. I haven't met one State administrator of healthcare in our State who says they need more flexibility. They have a lot of flexibility on Medicaid currently, but they know this is just a budget cap and a budget cut.  The budget would result in $610 billion in cuts to States, in addition to what would happen if they were successful in passing the House bill in the As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities put it, the Trump budget cuts Medicaid ``considerably more deeply than the House bill's per capita cap proposal would do.''  No doubt what the budget is proposing from the President today and what our House colleagues have proposed on healthcare means more damage for healthcare and more damage for  Let's be more specific. Medicaid for healthcare is about children. It is about seniors. It is about the disabled. It is about working families. It is about young people. Medicaid covers half of the births and the majority of long-term care stays.[[Page S3086]]  What people may not realize is that the President's budget cut to Medicaid also cuts children's healthcare, as a new study reveals, by at least $43 billion, according to Avalere That is taking healthcare away from children, poor children, who need access to healthcare. Additionally, the budget impacts 1.75 million veterans who also get healthcare through  How can we possibly be standing here with a budget proposal by the President of the United States--after he promised not to cut Medicaid--that not only proposes to cut Medicaid but cuts childrens' and veterans' healthcare when they need it most?  Medicaid is a lifeline for people who can't get covered or can't get a fair deal. It is a highly cost-effective, dynamic, and innovative program that has worked well, and Medicaid is a winning economic strategy for how to help families get out of poverty. It is one of the most successful anti-poverty programs in the United States and the second largest program to combat extreme poverty.  Its expansion in Washington has helped create jobs indirectly and directly and has saved our State about $353 million in our State budget. It injects billions into the economy and supports our high-wage, high-skill jobs throughout the healthcare economy.  As we know, our colleagues, in the House draconian healthcare act, would for the first time cut Medicaid's successful program by introducing a cap that would result in reductions every year to the Medicaid Regardless of who needs access, regardless of those children, regardless of those veterans, it would continue to push down Medicaid funds by more each year.  I have said to my colleagues in the House that there are far more innovative ways to help our healthcare delivery system that are cost-effective, but simply cutting veterans or families or children off of Medicaid is not the way to do it.  The President's budget released today would reinforce this permanent cap. Currently, Medicaid is a needs-based partnership between the States and the Federal During economic recessions, natural disasters, or public health emergencies, States know they can count on the Federal  Under what has been proposed in the House, the per capita cap would give States only a fixed amount and start reducing the amount of money each year. It would leave a tsunami of seniors and others without new technologies, prescription drugs, or tools to address new healthcare threats.  There is nothing about it that is reform. It is not innovation. It is simply a budget mechanism to cut I don't know how the President, given that he promised before not to cut Medicaid could do this. He said: ``I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.''  If that is what the President tweeted, if that is what he said he was going to do, why is he now proposing a budget that actually cuts Medicaid?  We do not want to throw 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries off of coverage in my State--and 14 million across the country--and take $1.4 billion out of Washington State's economy every year. These are numbers according to the Congressional Budget Office's most recent estimates and estimates by the State of  I think it is time to say no to the President's budget proposal. It is time to remind the President of his promise not to cut Medicaid, and it is time to stop talking about the silly idea of capping Medicaid and reducing funding to the  I mentioned the impact on children and veterans. I also want to mention the impact on those suffering from the opioid epidemic and what we have been trying to do to treat those individuals. Also, those facilities would be in great danger in continuing to treat that population if they don't have  So the notion that this is a smart healthcare strategy or a smart healthcare budget--it is not. It is a draconian measure that is going to leave many more Americans without healthcare. As I said, Medicaid is a successful program. The promise should be kept, and we should continue to improve the delivery system as a way to make it more cost-effective. I know we can't afford to leave sick children without access to healthcare, and now is not the time to leave veterans without the healthcare they deserve.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

10075,topic-id,1880,"Mr.President, obviously, a big problem before the country right now is, What do we do about rising healthcare premiums?  What we know under the Affordable Care Act--or the un-Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as some call it, is that premiums are rising more and more. One of President Trump's campaign pledges was that premiums would come down and, actually, come down with, as he said in one place, beautiful coverage--that it is actually good coverage and premiums are lower. So let's kind of set the stage.  I just got a message on my Facebook page. I will read it. By the way, anybody can post on our Facebook page these sorts of stories, if they are interested in them.  Brian from Louisiana sent a message saying: My family plan is $1700 a month for me, my wife, and two children--so roughly about $20,000 a year. The ACA, or the Affordable Care Act, has brought me to my knees. I hope you can get something done as my credit cards are all maxed out. And 80 percent of my friends are in the same situation. The middle class is dwindling away. Can everyone just come together and figure this out?  Think about this: $1,700 a month. He did not write this, but what would be standard for this sort of policy is a $13,000 family deductible.  I say that because I have an acquaintance in San San Francisco is so expensive for housing, transportation, and food, and the premium for their young family is $20,000 a year, with each family member with their own separate $6,000 deductible. This is under the un-Affordable Care Act, as I call it, or the Affordable Care Act, as others do.  A friend of mine back in Baton Rouge, whom I have quoted many times, put this on my Facebook page because people would not believe it: He and his wife, 60 and 61, their quote for their insurance last year was $39,000. Their quote for their insurance was $39,000.  Then I spoke to a fellow who is an insurance consultant here in Washington, DC--an insurance consultant. If anyone can get their premiums down, it would be he. For his family, their premium is $24,000 a year with a $13,000 family deductible. If they get in a car wreck, their family will be out $37,000 before the insurance kicks in. Who can afford this? We must do something better.[[Page S3089]]  When President Trump ran for office, President Trump clearly recognized this. On the campaign trail, he said over and over that he wished to lower premiums. It is the President's genius, if you will, that he knew how to do so. You do so by expanding the risk pool. He said he wanted to continue coverage for all.  He gets away from the ObamaCare mandates, which people hate. The American people don't like being told what to do.  He also said he would care for those with preexisting conditions. This is how it works. When you cover many, you have a bigger risk pool. Those with preexisting conditions have the cost of their illness spread out over the many. So premiums come down for all.  My hat is off to the President for coming up with that. In fact, 5 days before he was sworn in, he echoed this, because one way to lower premiums is to give poor coverage. One way to lower premiums is to give folks such terrible coverage that it doesn't cost anything. On the other hand, it doesn't cover anything. The President seems to know this.  Five days before he was inaugurated, he said to the Washington Post about people covered under his replacement for ObamaCare:       [They] can expect to have great healthcare. It will be in a      much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.       We're going to have insurance for everybody. There was a      philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you      don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.  I am a physician, a doctor. Again, I admire President Trump's insights. As a physician, I know that whoever wants healthcare gets healthcare. Twenty or so years ago, Congress said that if you walk into an emergency room, the emergency room has to take care of you. It doesn't matter if you are an American citizen. It doesn't matter how much it costs. The hospital has to take care of you.  I told folks when I was practicing--it would be the middle of the night--that as long as that emergency room was open--and it was open 24/7--in through the door came folks vomiting blood, heart failure patients, folks with drug overdoses, schizophrenics, diabetics, asthmatics--you name it. They came through that door, and we cared for them all--and somebody paid.  President Trump understands that even if you say you can't afford it, everybody is going to be treated. That is our current system, and that is not going to happen under his watch.  We mentioned that one way to lower premiums is to give poor coverage. I think everyone knows, or many people know, of Mr.Kimmel, the late night comedian who pointed out that when his child was born, instead of celebrating and handing the baby to the mother so the mother could kiss and the father, Mr.Kimmel, could cuddle the baby, the nurses and the doctors looked at the baby and immediately recognized that something was wrong. They recognized that this child was blue. He didn't have oxygen, and if something wasn't done immediately, this child would die.  Folks criticized Mr.Kimmel for being emotional. I totally get it. Instead of cuddling, you are signing a release waiver so your child can be transferred across the city of Los Angeles for emergency surgery. In his emotion, he asked that all children--and I would expand to all Americans--have the ability to get that sort of emergency care done.  Again, the President was about that. I came up with what I called the Kimmel test. Again, it echoes President Trump's contract with the American voter--that we would protect those with preexisting conditions, that we lower premiums, but as we lower premiums, we make sure that the coverage is adequate.  The Kimmel test, making sure there is adequate coverage while lowering premiums and caring for those with preexisting conditions, is so compatible with what President Trump said, because Americans need lower premiums.  Let me echo that one more time. We need to lower premiums. The President's approach, the contract he made with the voters on the campaign trail, is the right approach. You get a bigger risk pool, lots of younger people, so those who are older and sicker have the cost of their care spread out among the many.  We have a plan, the Cassidy-Collins plan, or the Patient Freedom Act, which I introduced with Senator Susan Collins and four other We have a way to go about it. One way to get young, healthy folks involved is to do something that we do on If you are eligible, you are enrolled unless you call up and say you don't want to be. That is what we do with By the way, that is what Fortune 500 companies do with their employees for 401(k) plans, and it works really well.  Ninety-five percent of employees are likely to participate in a 401(k), and they love it. As to people on Medicare, 99 percent stay on Medicare, and 1 percent call up and say: I don't want it. Usually they have better coverage someplace else. As a rule, no one feels coerced because they all know they can call up and say: I don't want it; I don't get it. As it turns out, most do.  The plan we have taken with Cassidy-Collins, in our attempt to fulfill President Trump's contract with the American voter, is that we allow a State to automatically enroll for this, and you would be in. The credit you receive would be sufficient to pay for the annual premium.  If you don't want it, call up. Make it easy. Get out of here. I don't want it.  As a rule, we think folks would be in. By doing this, you expand that risk pool so those old and sicker, those with preexisting conditions, can have their conditions cared for, but we fulfill President Trump's campaign pledge. We also lowered those premiums.  Ultimately, to lower the cost of insurance, you have to lower the cost of healthcare. Cassidy-Collins does that with some conservative approaches that even liberals will like. One way is that we put in what is called price transparency. You would know the price. A mother would know the price of a procedure--an x-ray, a blood test--before she gets it for her daughter, as opposed to finding out 6 months later when she gets the final bill.  Let me give one example. We have all seen those urgent care centers. Some are run by hospitals. Typically, a visit there will cost you $500 to $1,500. Others are run by a group of physicians, or maybe a small business decides to set up an urgent care center. The same visit might cost you as little as $75 to $150. The patient doesn't know that until she gets the bill.  One door has exactly the same appearance and exactly the same type of facility with the same capabilities. In one door and it can cost $500 to $1,500, and in the other door and it can cost $75 to $150, and the patient never knows.  I think we can lower the cost of healthcare by giving the patient the power of knowing what is the price of healthcare.  Think of it. You walk up to a French restaurant in a city you are not familiar with, and you look at the menu posted on the door. You see the prices of the food. Oh, the food is pretty good, but look how expensive it is. Let me go down the street. You go down the street. The food looks good, and it is less expensive.  The power of price informs the patient of what is the best deal for both our health and for our pocketbook. One way we can lower the cost of health insurance is by lowering the cost of healthcare. There are other ways of doing so as well.  Let me return once more to what I said earlier. Americans need lower premiums. President Trump, during the campaign--his contract with the voter, I think, is the right approach to get there.  I will summarize with this. He said he wanted to maintain coverage for those who have insurance, lower premiums, that preexisting conditions would be cared for, and eliminate the ObamaCare mandates. If we fulfill President Trump's goals--and these are goals that folks on the right and left can get behind. By the way, if we do get behind them, premiums will be lower. If we can fulfill President Trump's campaign contract with the American voter, we will lower those premiums, and we will do so by achieving these other great goals.  I yield back.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

I am a physician, a doctor who worked in a public hospital for the uninsured for decades before I went into politics. I guess from my perspective, the primary thing is not Republican versus Democrat, but that patient who is struggling to pay her bills, her premiums, or the fellow who can't afford medicine. What are we doing for them?  There is a gentleman who went on my Facebook page--again, cutting through this kind of political noise.

It kind of brings us to where we are now--two aspects to what we are considering.  By the way, when folks say that we are redoing one-sixth of the economy, that is not true. The Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, again, attempted to address one-sixth of the economy that is healthcare. We are focused on the individual market, which is about 4 percent of those insured, and We are not touching We are not touching the employer-sponsored insurance market. It is important to realize that this is not as comprehensive as the Affordable Care It is something far more focused.  Let's first talk about I am very concerned about what has been proposed for Medicaid, but also concerned about current law regarding Under the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, States got 100 percent of all the cost of the patients enrolled for the first 4 to 5 years. As you might expect, States were quite generous in their payments for these patients as they contracted with Medicaid-managed care companies to care for them, so much so that those folks enrolled in Medicaid expansion. Taxpayers are paying 50 percent more than taxpayers are paying for those in traditional And States enrolled roughly 20 million people in the Medicaid expansion program. The combination of enrolling so many people in the Medicaid expansion program and paying 50 percent more than for traditional Medicaid means that when States finally have to foot 10 percent of the bill, which they will by 2020--when States have to finally foot that 10 percent of the bill, they cannot afford that 10 percent.  Unfortunately, under the Affordable Care Act, State taxpayers will not be able to pay what in California is $2.2 billion extra per year as the State's 10-percent share. Similarly in Louisiana, my State, our taxpayers--me, my colleagues, my friends, my neighbors--would be on the hook for $310 million per year. Our State is having a budget crisis because we can't afford $300 million. Now it is a $310 million recurring bill every year.  One thing that is not said is that Medicaid expansion in its current format is not sustainable. We have to do something--again, to preserve benefits for that patient. We have to take care of that patient, but we have to make it sustainable, both for the Federal taxpayer and the State taxpayer. By the way, whoever is watching this is both a Federal and State taxpayer. You are getting caught both ways.  Let me speak a little bit about the process. If you want to speak about Medicaid, we just laid it out. Let's speak a little about the process, as much has been said about it. I don't care for how the process transpired, but I certainly understand Leader McConnell's concerns that Democrats would not collaborate. I find that a sorry state of affairs.  What do I mean by that? Susan Collins and I, and four other Republican Senators, put forward a bill that would allow Democratic States to continue in the status quo--to get the money they would have ordinarily received under the Affordable Care Act and to continue a system--as much as they desire to have--for the whole  The minority leader, Chuck Schumer, condemned our bill before we filed it, meaning before he had a chance to read it. Without reading our bill, he condemned it, even though his State of New York would have been allowed to continue in the program that they are currently in and receive the dollars to support that program. He condemned the bill before he read it, even though it would have allowed his State to continue in the status quo.  Similarly, we approached other Senators--10, at least, on my part. None would help us with our bill, even though their State could have continued in its current status quo, receiving the income it currently receives. That tells me that even a good faith effort to reach across the aisle was not going to get cooperation. That is too bad, and that is why, I think, there is kind of a political back-and-forth in which the patient--the American like Brian, struggling to support and cover his family--gets lost in the crossfire. A goodwill bill, designed for States to do that which they wish to do, would not even be considered by the other side.  I have always pointed out that if even two Democrats had walked into Mitch McConnell's office and said ``We will work with you to pass a bill,'' they could have gotten far many more things for their State than saying ``No, we have not been invited to the party; therefore, we will not participate.'' I say that as an observation, not as a criticism, but also as an explanation to the American people of how we have ended up in this position.  Now, as to the bill that will be before us, I have not seen the written language. I reserve judgment until I have seen that, but I will say that there are some things I like. If our desire, again, is to take that patient, the American citizen, and make sure his needs or her needs are met--a family such as Brian described here who cannot afford their current premiums--there are things in this bill which will lower those premiums. There is the so-called cost-sharing reduction payments for the next couple of years that would continue to provide certainty to the insurance companies so that when they market insurance on the individual market, there would be certainty. They would be able to know those dollars are coming from the Federal taxpayer to support folks for the next couple of years, and they could lower their premiums accordingly.  There will be a so-called State Stability Fund that going forward, States[[Page S3670]]could use to create what was called the invisible high-risk pool--a reinsurance program, if you will--so that if you are a patient on dialysis, a patient with cancer, very expensive to care for, you would continue to get the care you require, but everyone else in that insurance market has their premiums lowered because there is a little bit of help for those folks with those higher cost conditions. By that, we lower premiums.  President Trump, when he was running for President, said he wanted to continue coverage, care for those with preexisting conditions, eliminate the ObamaCare mandates, and lower premiums. What I have seen or, at least, heard is we are on the path to fulfilling President Trump's pledge. Now, again, reserving judgment until I have seen written language, I will say that what I have seen so far keeps the patient as the focus, would address someone like Brian, the needs of his family, the needs of their pocketbook as well as their health, and build a basis so that going forward, States would have the ability to innovate, to find a system that works best for them.  On behalf of those patients, I hope that we as a Senate--whatever our party--are successful. I hope going forward we, as a Senate, no matter what our party, put the patient as the focal point, hoping that our combined efforts--again, no matter what our party--will address her needs or his needs, both financially and particularly for their health.

The Republican plan will change that.  We are also in the process and will, tomorrow, be voting to repeal the Dodd-Frank legislation, which has had a devastating effect on our community banks all across this country and on our communities, and moving away from the really misguided approach of the last 8 years that centralized power here in Washington, D. One thing that didn't happen in the last 8 years though was the security of the border. And far too often we saw laws that weren't enforced. We saw people turning the other way for sanctuary cities, for example, and the failure on the part of the last administration to do what was necessary to make sure that we could know who is coming into this country and that we had the resources necessary to secure our border.

10105,topic-id,1700,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Florida for his participation in this debate today.  I think it is important for the record to be clear and to be accurate, Mr.This House of Representatives, in the time that we have been in session, has been the most productive House during the first 100 days of a Presidency in 30 years.  I am sure that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may not want to agree to that. They may not want to acknowledge that because Speaker Pelosi held the record previously when she was Speaker, but I am very proud of that, that we have done a tremendous amount for the American people in the time that we have been in session.  We have overturned 14 Obama regulations in this Congress alone, which has had a tremendous impact on our constituents. We have already taken steps that will save them $3.7 billion in regulatory costs, 4.2 million hours in paperwork.  Mr.Speaker, when I think about the communities across my home State of Wyoming, this relief could not have come soon enough. We are in a position today where we have faced strangling regulation out of Washington, D.C., for the last 8 years, regulation that was truly intended in too many instances to drive businesses out of business, to drive our community banks out of business, and to create a situation where Washington, D.C., was creating one-size-fits-all policies. But those days are over. This is a new day, and we take very seriously our obligations to put country ahead of party.  With respect to Russia, Mr.Speaker, as my colleague is well aware, there are multiple investigations underway in the We on the Republican side--I think this is a bipartisan issue--take very seriously the sanctity of our electoral process and will make sure that we get to the bottom of it.  We have got to ensure that we recognize and understand the extent to which Russian hacking was going on--frankly, not just in the United States, but around the world--and make sure that we do everything necessary to stand up against both Russian hacking, to stand up against the kind of Russian attacks that we are seeing on electoral processes in Europe, and, Mr.Speaker, to ensure that we secure ourselves.  At the end of the day, that is what this debate is about here this afternoon. We have got to make sure that we all recognize in this body that there is nothing more important than the security of our  Frankly, Mr.Speaker, we are at a crisis moment. We are at a crisis because, for the last 8 years, our military has been strangled. For the last 8 years, our borders weren't secure. We have had threats growing around the world.  We have seen the rise of We have seen the rise of al-Qaida--the expansion of al-Qaida around the world into many more countries than it ever existed before.  We have seen the Iranians make steady progress towards obtaining a nuclear weapon under what is the most misguided treaty agreement ever entered into by any American President: the Iranian nuclear agreement.  We have seen Chinese aggression in the South China We have seen Russian aggression in  Mr.Speaker, we have seen North Korea attempting, on a near weekly basis it sometimes seems, to make sure that it has perfected and acquired ballistic missile technology, while they also work to make sure that they are able to put a nuclear warhead on those ballistic missiles.  Mr.Speaker, we are living in a very dangerous world. We are living in a world in which America's ability to defend and protect itself is under threat in a way that it has not been certainly since the end of the Cold War, and maybe even since World War  Defending and protecting this Nation, Mr.Speaker, will require, both, that we provide the resources our military needs to defend us so that we can, Mr.Speaker, get out from underneath the policies of the last 8 years, but it also will require that we secure our border.  This bill today on the floor will provide the relief necessary for the CBP to do what is necessary to keep us safe. We have no greater responsibility than providing for our security.  I would remind the gentleman from Florida that this bill passed out of the Homeland Security Committee on a voice vote, on a bipartisan basis, with sponsors from both sides of the aisle. It is crucially important that we take this step to provide the relief--and not mandatory relief, but the relief--that the CBP can use if it needs.[[Page H4664]]  Mr.Speaker, as we discuss the range of accomplishments that we have had that I am very proud of in this Congress and the accomplishments still to come, I think that we have to also recognize that nothing is more important than the security of the This bill goes to the heart of that, to making sure that the CBP can do its job.

Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with.

At the conclusion of consideration of      the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report      the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

10171,topic-id,2893,"Mr.President, on Thursday, after two additional weeks of consultation and input from Senators, we released an improved version of the bill we call the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which represents our efforts to address the failing status quo of  We have said all along that even if Hillary Clinton were elected President, we would have to revisit ObamaCare because we have seen in a number of States that insurance companies are fleeing, leaving people with few, if any, options. People in the individual and small group market are seeing their premiums skyrocket 105 percent, nationwide, since 2013 alone--a 105-percent increase in premiums.  For many of these folks, even though they paid the higher additional premium, their deductibles are so high that, effectively, they are being denied the benefit of any insurance whatsoever. I guess, perhaps, it is no surprise that 28 million Americans would simply be willing to pay the fine that goes along with the individual mandate for not buying government-approved health insurance or claim some sort of hardship exemption.  ObamaCare was sold under the premise that, if you like your policy, you can keep your policy, and, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor and, oh, by the way, your premiums are going to go down $2,500, but what people have experienced has been the opposite of that, with premiums going up on average $3,000.  We simply believe that we have to act to save the millions of people who are being hurt by the status quo. That would be true whether Hillary Clinton were President or Donald Trump were  Our first goal in the Better Care Reconciliation Act is to stabilize the insurance markets, to make sure that people actually have an insurance company they can buy from.  Our second goal is to get premiums down. The reasons premiums are not down are mainly twofold. One is that you have younger, healthier people simply forgoing insurance, leaving only sicker, older people in the risk pools. Under adverse selection, that means everybody pays higher premiums when younger, healthier people simply don't purchase the product because they can't be part of that risk pool. The second reason why premiums are so high is the mandates. People are simply being ordered by their own government to buy coverage they don't want or need, which drives up premiums, not to mention the fact that young people are subsidizing older people's health insurance premiums the way that ObamaCare was constructed.  We are going to do everything we can to get the premiums down. The first Congressional Budget Office report said that long term you would see premiums go down by as much as 30 percent by the year 2020, but we want to do even better than that if we can.  The third thing we said we wanted to do was that we wanted to protect people with preexisting conditions. When[[Page S4011]]people are forced to keep a job they really don't want because they don't want to lose their employer-provided health coverage due to preexisting conditions, we don't want people to be stuck at a job they don't want or be unable to quit their job and look for something else because they are worried about not being covered due to preexisting condition exclusions. We maintain the current status of the law with regard to protecting people with preexisting conditions.  The fourth thing that we try to do in this bill is that we try to take one of the large entitlement programs, Medicaid, which is an important safety net for low-income Americans, and we put it on a sustainable path. There are some people who think you can spend hundreds of billions of dollars more for Medicaid over time and we can continue to deliver those services to the poor people in our country, and we don't need to worry about crowding out defense spending or education or some other priority. We simply cannot do it. What we have done is put it on a responsible growth rate and delegate more of that authority to the States to come up with innovative programs.  Our plan will remove costly mandates and will help provide more options and drive down some of the exorbitant costs. We will soon have a chance to rescue the American people from the failures of the ObamaCare experiment. This is a critical moment for the  I want to go over a few updates to the discussion draft, perhaps in the hopes that some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will realize that, when faced with the choice of our reform plan or the status quo, the choice is clear.  After listening to a number of Senators, we made some important updates. For example, to combat the opioid epidemic that is ravaging the country, our new draft includes an additional $45 billion for substance abuse and recovery.  As this chart indicates, the number of people with HIV has gone down to 6,400, thanks to innovations and drug therapy, principally. As to car accidents, 37,000 people a year die in the United States as a result of car accidents, but 52,000 people--and growing--lose their lives due to opioid and other drug overdoses.  This is an epidemic that has to be dealt with. The abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers is devastating families and communities all across the country, but, particularly, we hear from our colleagues in Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky that this is an urgent and unmet need.  These additional resources will be critical for providers, for advocates, and for families on the front lines of this crisis. As I said, our colleagues from Ohio, West Virginia, New Hampshire, and other places advocated for something called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act last year, which we were able to pass to address this crisis, and we passed additional legislation called the 21st Century Cures Act in December, which, again, added additional resources. But this represents the single largest allocation or appropriation of Federal dollars to deal with this crisis than has ever occurred before. I think it is because it is necessary, and I thank our colleagues for bringing this to our attention. This is a shocking statistic, when you think about it--that more people die of drug overdoses in America today than die in car accidents--and we are going to do something about that in this legislation.  We are also introducing a provision that, for the first time, would allow people to use pretax dollars to pay for their insurance premiums. Let's say you paid 25 percent of your income to taxes. If you can use pretax dollars, then, basically, that effectively lowers your out-of-pocket cost if you can use pretax dollars rather than the net of tax.  We expand the use of health savings accounts to give people that ability, which effectively lowers the cost of their premiums, again, and provides them more flexibility in terms of determining how to provide for their healthcare. Some people may decide--and we want to give them the freedom to do so--to say: Maybe, all I need is a hospitalization policy in addition to a health savings account, where I will put pretax dollars in there and save them and use those to pay for doctors' visits.  That is the kind of thing that we have seen in States like Indiana and elsewhere, which have been used very effectively to provide additional choices for consumers and their physicians on how they address their healthcare needs and their costs. As I say, allowing consumers to use pretax dollars to pay for their health insurance premiums will help bridge the coverage gap.  Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have affirmed that this will help boost access to healthcare coverage.  Another improvement this latest discussion draft brings forward is more options to buy lower premium plans. Under the Better Care Act, anyone in the individual market is allowed to purchase a lower premium health insurance plan, like the one I mentioned.  While those plans have lower monthly costs with a higher deductible, they will still cover up to three primary care visits a year and, ultimately, limit an individual's out-of-pocket costs. Coupled together with the health savings account, this may well be the most affordable way for people to address their healthcare.  Not everybody is the same. That was part of the problem with It treated us all like we were widgets and not human beings with unique needs, depending on our family circumstances or our health condition or what part of the country we lived in. This allows people to personalize and individualize their own healthcare plan.  I think this is great news for otherwise healthy adults previously barred from purchasing these plans under Young people, whom we need in the insurance pool in order to bring down premiums for everybody else, don't want to have to subsidize older folks' health coverage. They want to pay the freight for their own costs, but this will allow them access to a lower cost plan that will allow them to be covered for an unexpected hospitalization or other catastrophic event.  In addition to this freedom of choice, these plans will now also be eligible for tax credits. In other words, what we provide is a refundable tax credit, which essentially is a check from the Federal Government to the insurance company to pay your health insurance premium.  Under ObamaCare, people enrolled in these sorts of catastrophic plans were prohibited from receiving tax credits like the ones we are offering, even when they met all other eligibility requirements. That doesn't make any sense, and our legislation fixes that.  We have also made several revisions to I might mention that there is a lot of discussion about whether we are cutting I have said before that only in Washington, DC, can you spend more money year after year and be accused of cutting.  Honestly, fairly, what we do is to reduce the rate of growth for Medicaid, this uncapped entitlement program that contributed more than $20 trillion to the national debt. We put it on a reasonable budget and a rate of growth. Actually, from the beginning until the end, we will see Medicaid spending go up by the Federal government by $71 billion.  Ultimately, for Medicaid to work more efficiently for the people it is intended to serve--primarily, the children, the blind, the disabled, and the elderly frail--we need to give the States more flexibility to implement Medicaid spending based upon the unique needs of people in their  One of the big problems with ObamaCare is that it expanded Medicaid to otherwise healthy adults. We have a better way to deal with that, using the tax credit, the State innovation and stability funds, and something called the 1332 waivers, where the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services essentially is giving the States the opportunity to innovate and use the money and the tax credit to come up with something that suits the needs of their population.  Really, what we need to do is to get Medicaid focused again on the most vulnerable populations, which are the disabled, the blind, the frail elderly, and children. To improve the management of vulnerable populations such as this, now States can apply for a waiver[[Page S4012]]to utilize existing funds as they see fit to improve community-based services that these folks rely on.  Our Medicaid provisions allow the States flexibility to route funds to regions impacted by public health emergencies, which include disastrous weather events like hurricanes. Instead of being applied as a block grant or based on per capita caps, under our legislation, emergency funding will be applied where and when it is needed.  Lastly, under our Medicaid revision, States can add expansion populations under existing block grants if they choose to do so. Medicaid will always be as it has been--a Federal-State shared expense. By allowing States to be flexible in their Medicaid application, we can help them fill the gaps that the mandates under ObamaCare chose to merely gloss over. For example, in Texas, we were not a Medicaid expansion So young adults between 100 percent of poverty and 138 percent of poverty will now get access to a tax credit with the innovation and stability funds and these waivers, which will allow them, for the first time, to get access to private health insurance. That is good for them, and I think represents a vast improvement on the status quo--about 600,000 in Texas alone.  Our new draft includes an additional $70 billion to encourage States and help them implement these new reforms. What I have come to learn is, people don't really trust Washington, Certainly, based on the experience of ObamaCare--this failed experiment where people were promised certain things that ended up not being true and created the problems we now are having to fix--I think people will have a lot more confidence in a plan that lets the Governors and lets the State leaders manage this money and address the healthcare needs of their population by people who are closest to those people rather than out of Washington,  Our bill does that in a dramatic way. It takes that authority and power grabbed by ObamaCare and gives it back to the Governors and the States to manage. Based on the polling I have seen, people certainly have greater confidence in the States and their leadership at the local level to deal with this than they do under If Governors want to try to come up with unique healthcare products to drive down premiums, cost sharing, or increased funding for health savings accounts, this legislation gives them greater flexibility and gives them additional funding through the Innovation and Stability Fund to do just that.  Many of us have quoted Louis Brandeis, who served on the U.Supreme Court, who said: States are the ``laboratories of democracy.'' It is true. You don't see any innovation at the Federal level. It is more like dealing with the It is all command and control--central planning, which we know doesn't work very well. The States are the laboratories of democracy. If we give them the freedom to innovate and the resources to do so, I think we can expect our healthcare system to move forward.  Soon we are going to have a critical vote, one that has been 7 years in the making. While our plan is not perfect, it is certainly better than the status quo, which is why we call it the Better Care This is not the end, as Tom Price, of Health and Human Services, points out. This is just the next step. We know we are going to have other opportunities to address healthcare, most notably in September, when we reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, but this, by any measure, represents an improvement over the status quo.  I think there are some very useful parts of this bill that people will like if they look at it objectively and consider it fairly, but if we don't take up the bill, well, it can't be changed, and millions of Americans will continue to be harmed by the status quo. That is a decision we all have to make when we move to the bill.  Do we have enough confidence that we can make it better or are we simply going to throw our hands up and say, ``Well, I give up,'' before we even start, leaving people with the failure of the status quo?  I would like to encourage our colleagues to work with us to make this legislation better. It is unfortunate that healthcare has become such a polarizing and partisan issue. It doesn't need to be that way, but it started off with ObamaCare, which was passed along purely party lines, creating a situation where there is not bipartisan support for healthcare, generally, which is a real tragedy, given the importance this has to all of us and all of our families. Given the hand we have been dealt, we are going to plow ahead and do the best we can.  I sat down at my computer this morning, and I started to write a list of things I liked about the Better Care Act that perhaps most people haven't heard much about. 1, it repeals the individual mandate. This is the fine that has been imposed on people for not buying government-approved health insurance. It repeals the job-killing employer mandate. This bill will lower premiums, repeal burdensome taxes, and restore choices. It will help stabilize insurance markets and protect people with preexisting conditions. It will allow people to use pretax dollars to pay for their healthcare costs, including insurance premiums. It provides substantial resources to fight opioid and other substance abuse. It provides better quality coverage to low-income Americans that will improve medical outcomes for low-income Americans, and it puts Medicaid on a sustainable path.  I would like to encourage all of our colleagues to work with us to help make this legislation even stronger. Everybody will be able to offer an amendment and get a vote on the amendment when this bill comes to the floor. I believe the alternative is a disaster for our country, and we simply can't afford to let it stand.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

10293,topic-id,2326,"Mr.President, as the Senate knows--and I suspect a lot of people outside of the Chamber know--we will move forward on the healthcare reform effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare very soon. A bill will be released as early as tomorrow morning, representing a discussion draft.  I think it is important to remind all of our colleagues of the urgency that we face. We already know that insurance premiums have gone up since 2013 alone for those in the individual market--those would be individuals with small businesses--by 105 percent. This is 2013. Can you imagine in 2013 paying a premium only to realize that over the next 4 years, it would quadruple in just a short period of time?  Most Americans can't absorb that additional cost. We know that many people are struggling from the high cost and the lack of quality of care and the choices available to them.  Again, on the cost issue, when ObamaCare was being sold to the American people, I still remember President Obama saying that the average family of four would see a decrease in their premiums of $2,500. I think the correct figure is based on experience. They have seen their premiums go up $3,000.  I shared a story last week about a small business owner in Texas who had lost his healthcare. He lost his doctor, and yet he had to pay astronomically more for what ends up to be less coverage. I would say he is only one person who I have heard from. I have heard from many, many more under similar circumstances.  Even those who receive their healthcare from their employer are feeling trapped by I had a constituent, for example, from Needville, TX, and his story, yet again, is all too familiar. After his employer renewed their healthcare plan, premiums rose 50 percent, and his current doctors refused to accept his plan from the ObamaCare marketplace. While his healthcare costs rose, of course, his salary did not follow suit.  He has been forced to dramatically cut back on his standard of living and is living from paycheck to paycheck. In his letter, he said he is worried about being able to provide for his family. Can you imagine what that must be like? And not thinking of himself, but what this means for his coworkers, as well, and his community.  This is one of the endless stories that my constituents have sent me over the past few years, and I know Texas isn't alone, which causes me to wonder who our colleagues are listening to or not listening to in their  I mentioned yesterday that I had one colleague, whose name I won't mention out of respect for his confidential communication--this is a Democratic Senator--who has a son who has seen his insurance premiums go up to $7,500. Sorry, that is the deductible. But his premium has gone up $5,000. He told me that his son's out-of-pocket costs for healthcare was $12,500 a year.  That is another casualty of Yet, when we are looking around to see how many Democrats are willing to join us to come to the rescue of people who are being hurt by the destruction of the healthcare markets, we see no one raising their hand or coming forward.  For our Democratic friends to attack us for trying to fix the havoc that they wreaked in our healthcare system is really ridiculous. Our friends on the other side of the aisle had their chance. They passed ObamaCare by a party-line vote. In the interim, it demonstrated that this is an experiment in big government and massive spending that has simply failed.  Our friends on the other side know that. They also realize that, regardless of who won the election in November, we would be moving towards a new, better healthcare alternative, but they are simply unwilling to participate and are sitting on their hands and waiting. Indeed, they are hoping that we will fail in our efforts to save many Americans--millions of Americans--from a healthcare system they were promised but one that was not delivered.  Instead of working with us, they effectively are throwing what could only be called a temper tantrum. They are trying to shut down any productive activity in the Senate, including bipartisan committee work.  I was in three committee hearings this morning, one involving the Intelligence Committee and our investigation into Russian active measures involving the 2016 election. I was in another important Finance Committee hearing where we talked about the importance of modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and then another one in the Judiciary Committee, where we talked about the influx of dangerous gangs into the United States, including MS-13, from Central American countries. Yet our Democratic colleagues are so bent out of shape over the healthcare debate that they are willing to shut down legitimate bipartisan concerns for each of those issues by not letting our committees operate as they should.  Here is the rub. If they actually had a better plan, we would be more than happy to listen. We would be more than happy to work with them. But the only thing they have offered has been offered by the Senator from Vermont--one of their Presidential candidates--Mr.Sanders, who said that what he wants is nothing less than a complete Federal Government takeover of healthcare, the so-called single-payer system. That would wipe out all private insurance, and you would be looking to the government for all of your healthcare.  We know that hasn't worked particularly well in places like Canada and England and elsewhere. We also know that it is completely unaffordable. The Urban Institute, which did a study of Senator Sanders' single-payer healthcare system, said that just in 2017 alone, it would add more than a half trillion dollars to Federal spending, and it would add trillions and trillions of dollars more over ensuing years. This isn't a solution. This is creating a bigger problem.  Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues have let the far left faction of[[Page S3668]]their own conference hold them hostage to pushing for a single-payer system that would make ObamaCare look like a wild and resounding success.  As I said, we need only look to our neighbors to the north, who under a single-payer system have their healthcare decisions decided for them by the government, while they see their taxes go up every single day.  Canada is marketed as an affordable outcome, but only if your procedure is deemed necessary by the government. In other words, if the government doesn't think the procedure you need is necessary, good luck with that.  Would you want somebody in the government making your medical decisions for you or your family without considering your individual medical history? I certainly wouldn't. Under a single-payer system, this could lead to many families having to buy supplemental health insurance on top of the taxes they have already paid or simply pay cash, rewarding high-income individuals with a better level of healthcare above that offered to the rank-and-file citizens under a government program.  Single-payer systems are not a solution, certainly not in this country. Not only is choice and cost threatened under a single-payer system, but so is quality of care.  Just last year in Canada, it took an average of 20 weeks for patients to receive medical care that was deemed necessary--the longest recorded wait time since wait times began to be tracked. One report estimated the Canadians are waiting for nearly 1 million healthcare procedures.  Can you imagine having to wait up to 38 weeks for some medical procedure, the whole time worrying about your health or the health of your loved one?  Single-payer is a costly, inefficient, and unfeasible option, and, perhaps because of that, we are not hearing many people on the floor stating what I believe to be the case, which is that it is the only choice being offered by our friends across the aisle. They are not willing to come here and debate the merits of what we are proposing, which is a market-driven, individual-choice system, which is designed to keep premiums down in a way that makes it more affordable. They are not willing to debate that and a government takeover known as a single-payer option with all of its assorted problems.  The reforms we are seeking are patient-centered and market-driven. These are the sorts of things that many of our colleagues across the aisle said they would like to see as well, but they have somehow fallen in line with part of their political base, which makes it impossible for them to have an open, rational discussion about the merits of each proposal.  We are left with no option but to finalize our discussion draft and introduce that tomorrow so that the world can see it and so it can be put on the internet, so we can have a fulsome debate and we can have unlimited amendments in the so-called vote-arama process, which I know is very popular around here. We will vote dozens of times or more on proposed amendments to the bill. That is the kind of transparency and openness that I think are important when you are dealing with something as important as healthcare.  Here are the goals of what we are going to propose tomorrow in this discussion draft.  First, we need to stabilize the markets that have left millions in the country with no choices when it comes to insurance providers. Under ObamaCare, insurance markets have collapsed. In Texas, one-third of Texas counties have only one option for health insurance, which is no choice whatsoever. Of course, in addition to threatening competition, it also lowers quality while doing nothing about rising costs.  Second, we have to address the ballooning price of ObamaCare premium increases. I mentioned, just in the ObamaCare exchanges since 2013, they have gone up 105 percent. If we do nothing about it, they are going to go up by double digits again next year, so doing nothing is not an option. Again, without competition, there is no room for these prices to go anywhere but up, and we have to come to the rescue of the millions of Americans who are simply being priced out of the health insurance market.  Third, something our Democratic colleagues have repeatedly called for is that we have to protect people with preexisting conditions. If we want our healthcare system to work, we must be able to provide coverage, particularly for preexisting conditions, for all We will do that in the discussion draft proposed tomorrow.  Lastly, I believe we need to give the States greater flexibility when providing for the low-income safety net known as Medicaid, in a way that is more cost-efficient and effective. For example, in my State, we have asked for a waiver in order to provide managed care for people on More than 90 percent are on managed care, which means if you have a chronic illness--if you have a particularly complicated medical problem--you have a medical home and somebody keeping track of your treatment, making sure you get the treatment you need and are entitled to.  Now we have the opportunity to make Medicaid a sustainable program. We know that it is not, as currently written. What we are proposing is to spend more money each year on Medicaid but to do so at a cost-of-living index that will be affordable and sustainable by the American taxpayer. We have the opportunity to address the quality issues and redtape issues and provide this important entitlement to make sure that it remains on a stable path.  The American people have made clear, time and again, that the status quo of ObamaCare is not working. All you have to do is look around. There were 60 Democratic Senators in 2010 who voted for They were in the majority--a big majority. How many are there today? Well, there are not 60 anymore. They have gone from the majority to the minority, I believe, in large part because of the unfulfilled promises of  I encourage our colleagues across the aisle--indeed, I encourage all of us to listen to the stories from our constituents. There are too many families asking us to step up and come to their aid. We need to do more than just give floor speeches or loft impossible single-payer options, which simply won't work. We need to actually deliver on the promises we made to deliver healthcare reform and to do so to the best of our ability.  I am under no illusion that this will be perfect. Indeed, when you are operating under the constraints of the budget rules, with Democrats taking a walk and sitting on their hands, it is impossible for us to come up with the best possible product we could under the circumstances.

The army rabbi blew the shofar, and the eternal capital of Israel was reunited.  This war was not the first time that Israel was threatened with annihilation. After the Jewish people established the modern State of Israel in their ancient homeland just 19 years earlier, neighboring Arab States responded to Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion's declaration of independence with an invasion. The Arab armies failed to destroy the newly established Jewish State, but Jerusalem, the ancient and Holy City central to the identity of the Jewish people, was left divided and occupied by  Residents of the Old City were murdered or expelled. Jews were prohibited from visiting and praying at the Temple Mount and Western Their synagogues were destroyed, and their cemeteries, such as the Mount of Olives, were desecrated. Access for Christians to their holy sites was also severely restricted.  Leading up to June of 1967, Arab leaders repeatedly and openly expressed their desire to wipe Israel off the map. Syria was engaging in attacks on Israel from the Golan Heights and soon started to mobilize its forces for battle. Egypt began moving troops into the Sinai Peninsula in a massive military buildup, demanded and achieved the withdrawal of the U.Emergency Force that had been stationed in the Sinai, and then closed the Straits of Tehran, imposing an illegal blockade on Israel and cutting off a vital shipping lane for the Jewish Jordan then signed a mutual defense agreement with  Outnumbered and outgunned and against all odds in the face of external pressure not to act first to ensure its survival, the Jewish State launched a successful, preemptive strike against its hostile neighbors and prevailed in a defensive war.

Today is a day where we must also reassert historical truth: The historical connection between the Jewish people and Jerusalem and the land of Israel did not begin in 1967. These profound ties to Jerusalem have existed for thousands of years.

10120,topic-id,550,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to share the important work of the Paralysis Resource Center at the Christopher and Dana Reeve  Christopher Reeve put a face on spinal cord injury and had an unrelenting drive to pursue the best research in the world. It was his vision, it was his passion, and it was his brilliance that attracted young scientists to take on the cause and advance the field of spinal cord research.  And while his wife, Dana, was universally known as the model for caregiving, her real legacy is the creation of the foundation's Paralysis Resource Center that has reached so many of those living with paralysis and their families with life-changing resources.  The President's budget eliminates all funding for the Paralysis Resource Center and suggests that the program is duplicative. Fortunately, my colleagues in the House appreciate the unique nature of the work that the PRC does.  The PRC consists of a variety of services, communities, and programs, including:  Information specialists trained to help anyone, from newly paralyzed individuals and their family members to persons who have lived with disabilities for quite some time, by providing individualized support and information;  The Peer and Family Support Program, which builds peer-to-peer connections to help individuals find support and resources among the communities that best understand the day-to-day realities and long-term challenges of individuals living with paralysis;  The Quality of Life Grants Program, which has awarded over 2,900 grants, totaling more than $22 million, to broaden the impact of nonprofits across the country that foster community engagement and involvement while promoting health and wellness for individuals living with paralysis; and  The Military and Veterans Program, the MVP, which supports the unique needs of current servicemembers and veterans regardless of when they served or how their injury was obtained.  I urge my colleagues to reach out to the Paralysis Resource Center to learn of the important work that they are doing for vulnerable constituents in their districts. If you do, you can see that the PRC is so much more than a line item in a budget. It is more than dollars and cents. It is more than just another program.  The value of these programs can only be appreciated when you learn the stories of the thousands of Americans that the PRC has helped with their services. Tonight, I would like to tell some of those stories. It is through these stories that we can see the amazing work of the Paralysis Resource Center, the lasting legacy of Christopher and Dana Reeve, and the bright future of so many who have been served through the PRC's programs.  You will notice that, throughout these stories, you hear the same names pop up again and again. That is because the PRC builds community and it builds connections.  When a spinal cord injury leaves Americans with no place else to turn, the PRC steps in to help guide the way; and, in return, many of those who have benefited from PRC turn back and look to help others with spinal cord injuries, to support their journey of recovery and rehabilitation.  Mr.Speaker, in order to move forward and to tell these stories, I would like to start by yielding to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.Langevin), my friend, who will share some thoughts with us now.

10122,topic-id,2201,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Rhode Island, Representative I thank him for his leadership here in the House on these important issues.  But just as you spoke about your friends Christopher and Dana Reeve and talked specifically about how Christopher Reeve was not quiet and introverted, that he was an inspiration to you, I think it is fair to say, and I am comfortable actually speaking in this one instance on behalf of my colleagues here in the House in saying that just as Christopher Reeve was an incredible leader and an inspiration to you, so, too, Representative Langevin, are you an inspiration to all of us in the I thank you for participating tonight.  There are so many other stories to tell. Representative Langevin shared some. I would like to share just a few others.  One is the story of Eric On October 16, 2010, Rutgers University football star Eric LeGrand sustained a spinal cord injury at his C3 and C4 vertebrae.  After a kickoff in the fourth quarter against Army, Eric sprinted down the field and he made the tackle, but after the collision, he stayed down on the field at MetLife Eric was paralyzed from the neck down, and doctors gave him a zero to 5 percent chance of regaining neurologic function.  From the moment he was injured, the Paralysis Resource Center was by Eric's side with a wealth of services and support. To conquer the immediate challenges of paralysis, his mother, Karen LeGrand, spoke regularly with the PRC's information specialists, who provided a roadmap of the resources that helped Eric transition to the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange, New At that point, Eric was already exceeding expectations for his recovery and was weaned off of his ventilator and his feeding tube.  To help his family understand the long-term realities of a spinal cord injury, Eric and Karen were put in touch with Alan Brown, a dear friend of mine I will speak more about in a bit. Alan is a certified peer mentor and staff[[Page H6209]]member of the Reeve Foundation, and he offered advice from his own personal experience living with quadriplegia for over 25 years.  Eric was also enrolled in the Reeve Foundation's NeuroRecovery Network, the The NRN is a growing network of rehabilitation centers that develop and provide cutting-edge therapies, like Locomotor  Thanks to the NRN therapies and Eric's determination, he recovered the ability to move his neck and his shoulders. He has also improved trunk, cardiovascular, and pulmonary control.  His quality of life, well-being, and health have dramatically improved through the efforts of the  To pay forward his gratitude and help others, Eric founded Team LeGrand of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation to speed the development of treatments for spinal cord injury. Since its inception in September 2013, Team LeGrand has raised close to $1 million.  Karen LeGrand was also inspired by her experience with the PRC, and became a certified peer mentor to offer guidance and support to parents who have children living with paralysis.  Elizabeth Forst is someone else whose story we should focus on. An avid traveler and diver, Elizabeth ``E.B.'' Forst's life changed in 2014 when a dive into a swimming pool resulted in a C4-C5 spinal cord injury.  In the aftermath of her injury, Elizabeth's family struggled with how to move forward and to ensure that Elizabeth could still live life to the fullest.  Her older brother, Tracy, reached out to the Reeve Foundation to tap into the constellation of programs and resources offered by the Paralysis Resource He spoke with information specialists to get a better understanding of his sister's condition and how his family could help her adapt physically, emotionally, and socially to living with a spinal cord injury.  Tracy also regularly referred to the Reeve Foundation's website to educate himself on life after paralysis from both Elizabeth's perspective and his role as her family member and caregiver.  Thankful for the support she received from the Paralysis Resource Center, Elizabeth became a trained and certified peer mentor to help fellow paralysis community members find beauty and joy after a life-changing injury.  She has also resumed her passion for diving and traveling, as well as blogging for the Reeve Foundation to share her tips for traveling with a disability. E.has said she still has a lot of travel destinations on her list, and the PRC is surrounding her with support to make sure she can continue to travel the world.  Denna Laing is someone else we should think about tonight. On December 31, 2015, Denna Laing, a standout hockey player for the NWHL Boston Pride, was playing in the Women's Winter Classic at Gillette Stadium when she crashed headfirst into the boards and sustained a spinal cord injury at her C5 vertebra.  While she was in the hospital, the Reeve Foundation mobilized a network of support through the Paralysis Resource Center to help her family understand the short-term and the long-term challenges of living with paralysis.  They spoke with information specialists who provided tailored assistance on transitioning Denna from the hospital to acute care, and then adjusting to life back in her community.  Denna and her family connected with certified peer mentors like Alan Brown, who offered support and guidance based on their own personal experiences.  She is currently building up her strength and working to improve her health by participating in a comprehensive therapy regime at Journey Forward in Canton, Massachusetts, which is part of the Reeve Foundation's NeuroRecovery                              {time}  2045  Denna recently tackled the Boston Marathon with help from former NHL player Bobby Carpenter, who pushed her racing wheelchair to the finish line.  Known for her vibrant personality, she credits the support she received from the Reeve Foundation and paralysis community as the reason that she keeps smiling. In her words: ``I know the best of my life has yet to come.''  J.Bruning and Kelly Lamb are from After graduating from the University of Arkansas, J.was enjoying the warm weather with his friends when they decided to take a float trip on a local river. Near the end of the float trip, J.dove into what he thought was deep water, but it was too shallow, and he sustained a high-level spinal cord injury.  Since that life-changing moment over 4 years ago, J.and his family have tapped into the wealth of resources provided by the Reeve Foundation Paralysis Resource Center to help J.live a full and active life in his community.  Given the scarcity of resources for the paralysis community in Arkansas, the PRC was critical in establishing the best possible care for J.and helping to navigate the path forward for his family.  His girlfriend, Kelly Lamb, was so inspired by the Reeve Foundation's programs and mission that she ran both the Chicago and New York City Marathons in 2016, under the Team Reeve banner, and raised over $20,000 to accelerate innovative research.  Kelly has cited the Paralysis Resource Center as a lifeline for thousands of families impacted by paralysis in the State of Arkansas and across the  Sabrina Cohen is from Born and raised in Miami Beach, Sabrina sustained a C3-5 spinal cord injury in 1992, when a teenager driver, who promised to give Sabrina a ride to a party, started drag racing and, unfortunately, slammed into a tree. She was 14 years old, and her life was changed forever.  When Sabrina was first injured, there was no centralized resource to learn how to live with paralysis or connect with fellow community members.  When the Reeve Foundation Paralysis Resource Center was founded in 2002, it became and since remains a lifesaving resource for 5.4 million Americans living with paralysis from spinal cord injury, ALS, MS, spina bifida, stroke, and cerebral palsy.  However, physical barriers still existed in Sabrina's community as there was no beach in the Miami Beach area that was accessible to wheelchair users. Through the Sabrina Cohen Foundation, she applied for a Reeve Foundation Quality of Life Grant to fund her dream of a fully accessible beach and playground for the disabled, including seniors, veterans, and children with special needs.  The Quality of Life Grants Program is funded through the Paralysis Resource Center and awards financial support to nonprofits that foster greater health, quality of life, community involvement, and independence for individuals living with paralysis and their caregivers.  She made the most of a Quality of Life Grant to establish Miami Beach's first-ever dedicated public beach with improved wheelchair access and outdoor adaptive fitness and watersport activities.  Finally, I would like to talk about two other people, both also from Florida, and both good friends of mine.  Alan Brown, I mentioned earlier. He is a resident of Aventura, Florida, who was injured in 1988, at the age of 20, when his neck was crushed by an ocean wave while on vacation in the The accident caused a C5-6 spinal cord injury and left Alan a quadriplegic with no movement below his chest.  For nearly 30 years since the accident, Alan and his family have, through the Alan Brown Foundation to Cure Paralysis, provided support, education, and advocacy for the paralysis community.  Initially, the focus for the foundation was on finding a cure for paralysis, a magic bullet that would help everyone living with paralysis to walk again. But after years in a wheelchair, and the difficult challenges to overall health and emotional well-being that paralysis presents, he and his family decided to overhaul the mission of the foundation.  Today, they focus on improving the lives of people living with paralysis through peer mentoring, outreach, and fundraising to help others with basic needs like wheelchairs and ongoing medical care. And now, Alan and his foundation have partnered with the Reeve Foundation to extend the reach and impact of his message to the paralysis community.[[Page H6210]]  Alan travels the country on behalf of the Reeve Foundation to advocate, to increase awareness, and to make an impact on the quality of life of other people living with paralysis and their families.  He currently serves as manager of public impact at the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, and in this role, he focuses on extending the reach of the foundation's impact on the greater public, creating new opportunities for partnership with peer organizations, increasing the visibility of PRC and other Reeve Foundation programs, bolstering fundraising efforts, and developing the national Peer & Family Support  I have been with Alan and been inspired by him on a regular basis, close up, and the work that he does in the paralysis community and for those who are experiencing paralysis firsthand. The work that he does at those early moments is extraordinary.  Finally, Shawn Friedkin, who is from my community in south In March of 1992, Shawn was injured in a motor vehicle accident 2 weeks before his 27th birthday. He was married with one child, and he spent much of the early years following his injury working to increase medical research funding for spinal cord injuries.  For his efforts, he was invited to the White House to meet with Hillary Clinton, then-First Lady, as part of her healthcare initiative.  Shawn testified before Congress on the need for an increase in research funding. And based on his desire to help others in the community, Shawn left his career in finance, where he worked as a hedge fund manager, to create Stand Among Friends in 1997.  Stand Among Friends, based in Boca Raton, Florida, is a cross-disability advocacy organization. It is focused on helping people with disabilities find employment through vocational training and adaptive technology. It has provided services to more than 4,000 people and helped over 1,000 people find employment. Shawn has grown the services and mission to become one of the top disability service providers in the State of  And each year, Shawn and the Stand Among Friends organization hosts the ``emb(race).'' The emb(race) is a day of diversity awareness that includes a half marathon, a 5K, and a family fun walk; and it is, indeed, a way for all of us to embrace one another.  Shawn, as I said, is a dear friend and an inspiration in his community and to all who know him.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank all of those who make the Paralysis Resource Center at the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation what it is today.  As you can see from these stories, the PRC comes in at a family's most vulnerable moment. These are the most serious injuries and illnesses one can imagine. They are life-changing, and they come in with an immediate response to help guide families who are hurting to help them create a positive vision of a new life and build a community of support for Americans living with paralysis.  I would like to leave with the words of Christopher He said: ``I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.''  Tonight, Mr.Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Paralysis Resource Center in their work to help empower more American heroes in the fight against spinal cord injuries.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgH6207.txt,1976,SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,24.0,July

That effort by the House of Representatives passed by, I believe, 2, 3, or 4 votes. It was very close, and it was a partisan rollcall--all Republicans voting for it and no Democrats voting for it. So it came to the floor of the House without any bipartisan preparation. It was only after the vote that the Congressional Budget Office took a look at the measure and reported to the American people its impact.  Now, that is unusual because, when you take a big issue like the reform of America's healthcare system, historically, traditionally, Members of the Congress--the House and Senate--will send their versions of the bill to the Congressional Budget Office and ask for an analysis: Tell us how much this will cost. Tell us the impact on the deficit. Tell us what it will do in terms of healthcare coverage. But the House Republicans chose to vote before the analysis.  Well, the analysis still came out, and when it came out, the report was unsettling because it had a dramatic negative impact on healthcare in The House Republican repeal, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would mean that 23 million Americans would lose their health insurance.  Remember, we started this debate 6 or 7 years ago because we were concerned that too few Americans had health insurance and we wanted to expand the reach of health insurance and make sure that it was good health insurance, and that is why we passed the Affordable Care We fell short in some respects, but we certainly achieved our goal of increasing the number of insured Americans with the Affordable Care In my home State of Illinois, the percentage of those uninsured with health insurance was cut in half. In fact, it was even better than that. So more and more people ended up with coverage through Medicaid, as well as through private health insurance.  Now comes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and the Republicans in the House decide to not only erase all of that progress in providing more health insurance for more families but to make it worse--to make the number of the uninsured even higher than it was. So if that is the starting point of healthcare reform, you ask yourself: Is that really a worthy goal? Why would you do that?  Well, they were forced to do it. They really were. The House Republicans really, in fairness to them, had no choice, because they made the initial decision that their highest priority was to give a tax break of about $700 billion to the wealthiest people in So by creating this tax break--giving this money back to wealthy people--they took that same amount of money out of America's healthcare system. When you take $700 billion out of America's healthcare system, here is what happens. People who are currently receiving their health insurance through Medicaid, a government program, will have fewer and fewer opportunities to take advantage of In fact, they acknowledged that. The Republicans said in the House: We are just cutting back on  Secondly, you reduce or eliminate the helping hand we give to working families who can't afford to pay their hospitalization premiums. If you are in certain categories, we give you a subsidy to pay for your premiums. So follow the logic: If you cut the taxes by $700 billion and take $700 billion out of the healthcare system, you have less money to provide Medicaid health insurance for those in low-income categories, and you have less money to help working families pay for their health insurance premiums.  The Congressional Budget Office looked at that and said that the net result at the end of the day is that 23 million Americans will lose their health insurance because of this decision by the Republican In the State of Illinois, a State of about 12.5 million people, 1 million people would lose their health insurance because of this action taken by the Republican House of  Well, from basic civics we know that here we are in the Senate and we get our chance once the House has acted. So we have been waiting--waiting for almost a month for the process to begin. The sad reality is it never even started--not the ordinary, open, public, transparent process of debating a change in America's public health system.  Instead, Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, said: What I am going to do is to take 13 of my male Republican Senators, put them in a room, and let them write an alternative to the House bill. Why he didn't initially include the women in his caucus, he can explain, but it was 13 of the male Republicans who would sit in a room to write, in secret, their alternative.  We think: Well, most legislative ideas start with that kind of a meeting--a closed-door meeting in the quiet of a room, basic negotiation. But it is the nature of a democracy and our form of government that at some point this becomes public. Shouldn't it? If we are going to change the laws about health insurance--basic fundamental coverage for American families--shouldn't we know it? Shouldn't we know what the changes will be before we vote on them?  Well, there is a pretty rampant rumor that tomorrow, for the first time, there will be a limited disclosure of this Republican effort over the last several weeks. We are told--and it is only a rumor--that the Senate Republican leadership will sit down with the Senate Republican caucus and show them for the first time what they want to propose that we vote on.  One might say: Well, that sounds like the beginning of a good, long process.  It is not. It is the beginning of a short process, because the Republican leader has said that this time next week we will be into debating that issue and voting on it to its conclusion--in 10 days. That is 10 days, start to finish, to rewrite the healthcare system of America, 10 days on a measure that has not been disclosed to the Republican Senators--not all of them--let alone the Democratic Senators and let alone the American people. That is what we are faced with.  When we wrote the Affordable Care Act, which was widely criticized by the Republicans, let me tell you the process we followed with the Affordable Care In 2009, the Senate HELP Committee--or the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--held 13 public, bipartisan hearings, 20 walk-throughs of various proposals, and a markup in the committee that went on for 1 calendar month, and 160 amendments offered by the Republicans were adopted. That was in 2009 with the Affordable Care  The Senate Finance Committee, which writes the tax laws, held 17 roundtables, summits, and hearings on the legislation, 13 Member meetings and walk-throughs, and 38 meetings and negotiations.  Keep in mind that we still haven't seen the Republican proposal we are supposed to vote on next week--this secret proposal.  The Senate Finance Committee on the Affordable Care Act held a 7-day markup and adopted 11 Republican amendments. At the end of the day, not a single Republican Senator voted for the measure, but they offered amendments, and those amendments were debated and many of them were adopted by the Democratic majority.  When the Affordable Care Act came to the floor of the Senate, we spent--and I remember this well--25 consecutive days in session considering that bill--25 days. As to what Senator[[Page S3661]]McConnell and the Republicans will offer to us in what we call reconciliation, we will be lucky to get 25 hours. We spent 25 days on the Affordable Care In total, the Senate spent more than 160 hours on the Affordable Care Act and more than 150 Republican amendments were adopted, though not a single Republican Senator ended up voting for the bill. We opened it to their amendments and adopted their amendments. It was a bipartisan effort.  What has been the process this time around? No hearings, no markups, no public input, no support from the medical advocacy community at all. I don't have a single medical advocacy group in Illinois that supports what the Republicans did in the House of Representatives--not one. Hospitals, doctors, nurses, pediatricians, and disease advocacy groups, like cancer and heart, are all opposed to what was done in the House of Representatives, and we are being told, when it comes to the Senate's turn: Get ready, it is going to be fast. Don't blink, you might miss it.  Let me tell my colleagues what else we have. We have a record of quotations from leaders on the Republican side who, even though the Affordable Care Act went through all of these hearings and all this deliberation, were very explicit in their criticism. Here is Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican of Kentucky, in December of 2009, on the Affordable Care He said: ``This massive piece of legislation that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy is being written behind closed doors, without input from anyone, in an effort to jam it past not only the Senate but the American people.''  I might say to Senator McConnell: How would you explain what you are doing now when it comes to rewriting the healthcare system behind closed doors without input from anyone? Is it an effort to ``jam it past not only the Senate but the American people''?  Senator Marco Rubio last week was quoted as saying: ``The Senate is not a place where you can just cook up something behind closed doors and rush it for a vote on the floor.''  I agree with Senator Rubio, but that is what they are trying to do.  Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska, said: ``If we had utilized the process that goes through a committee, I would be able to answer not only your questions but my constituents' questions.''  Senator Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska, expressed what most of us feel. How could we even answer an honest, legitimate question from someone we represent when we can't even see the measure that is being produced by the  Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, said last month:       I want the committees of jurisdiction to hold hearings,      bring the experts who know about healthcare from across the      country, bring the constituents to tell us their stories.      Then I want every Senator, all 100 of us, to have the chance      to offer amendments.  Thank you, Senator I agree with you. That is how the Senate is supposed to work, but that is not how it is working now.  Let me tell my colleagues what some of the groups have said about this Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care You expect: Oh, it is a partisan comment from a partisan These are nonpartisan groups.  The American Heart Association, what do they say? They say: ``The House bill would seriously erode preexisting condition protections, including for patients suffering from cardiovascular disease.''  About a third of us on Earth--or at least a third of us in America--have some preexisting condition. For the longest time, insurance companies said: If you are a woman, it is a preexisting condition.  Go figure. But now, at least a third of us have some condition which, in the old days, would disqualify us from insurance coverage or make it too expensive.  So now we put in the Affordable Care Act a prohibition against discriminating against any American because they have a preexisting medical condition. I think that is pretty important. My family has certainly had the same experience as other families when it comes to preexisting conditions.  Now the Republicans have said: We are going to take that out. We want to give you more choice. We want the insurance companies to give you more choice. Choice means another reason to say no. Choice means coverage that isn't there when you need it. Choice means restrictions on your health insurance policy. That may not bother you at all today, but tomorrow, when you go to that doctor for that diagnosis you will never forget as long as you live or get involved in an accident and finally take a close look at that health insurance policy, you want to make sure it is there if you need it, don't you?  The Republicans say we need more choice. The American Heart Association says that, when it comes to preexisting conditions, the House Republican repeal bill would seriously erode protection of  The American Medical Association, the largest group of physicians in America, said: ``We cannot support [the bill] that passed the House as drafted because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations.''  The American Diabetes Association said: ``It would give insurers the ability to charge people with pre-existing conditions--such as diabetes--higher prices [for health insurance] . . . and would allow insurers to deny people with diabetes the care and services they need to treat their disease.''  The American Association of Retired Persons has weighed in. Here is what they say: ``This bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for Americans aged 50-64, and put at risk the health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities, and poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term services and supports.''  AARP is working overtime to notify Americans over the age of 50 and their kids that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act that passed the House of Representatives is a bad deal for seniors and their families.  There is something else going on, too. For more than 6 years, Republicans in Congress have been shouting ``repeal and replace'' from the rooftops, and they voted more than 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care They never liked it from the start. They put language into bills to make it more difficult for the Affordable Care Act to work, such as funding needed to make individual insurance markets work as intended. Then, on his first day in office, President Trump signed an Executive order directing Federal agencies not to enforce the Affordable Care  The Trump administration cut the open enrollment timeframe in half, making it harder for people to sign up for insurance--meaning fewer people covered, fewer people in the insurance pools, and premiums going up as a result. The President, to this day, continues to make uncertainty in the insurance market. He refuses to say whether he will continue providing cost-sharing reduction payments to help 7 million Americans afford health insurance. Without the payments, insurers tell us premiums will skyrockets 20 percent next year.  Let me mention one other thing that has happened as part of this health insurance debate. We decided to make a historic change in healthcare in I have told the story repeatedly, and I will not tell it in detail, but it was Paul Wellstone, a progressive from Minnesota, who sat right there, and Pete Domenici, a conservative from New Mexico, who sat right there, who came together--these two unlikely partners--because they each had members of their families who suffered from mental illness. They said: Why is it that we don't treat mental illness like an illness? Why is it that health insurance just covers physical illness?  They were right. They fought the insurance companies for years, and they won. We put it in the Affordable Care We said: If you offer health insurance, you have to cover mental illness. My friends, it is time for us to step out of the shadows, where mental illness was considered a curse and not an illness, and deal with it as something that can be successfully treated. We put it in the bill, and most Americans would agree that it was the right thing to do.  There was another part of it, though, that slipped my attention and now I know it is critically important. It wasn't just mental illness. It was coverage for mental illness and substance abuse treatment.[[Page S3662]]  How important is substance abuse treatment in America today? Go to Maine, go to Iowa, go to Illinois, and ask the question: Are there any problems with opioids? Heroin? Overdosing? Death? Of course.  When you go to the rehab and addiction treatment centers and you ask people: How is your family paying for this care to try to rescue this young child in your family or someone dealing with addiction, they say they are either under Medicaid, the government insurance program, or their health insurance policy covers substance abuse treatment. Why? Because Wellstone and Domenici effectively included that in the bill. Now, under the bill that passed in the House of Representatives, an estimated 1.3 million Americans with mental disorders and 2.8 million seeking help with substance abuse will lose their coverage for treatment. It is no longer a priority under the Republican idea of giving you choice with your health insurance.  Choice--when you are a father buying health insurance for your family and you are picking out a health insurance policy and you have a choice, could you anticipate the teenaged daughter you love with all your heart will one day face an addiction and desperately need substance abuse treatment to save her life? Did you think about that when you signed up for the right choice in a lower cost health insurance plan?  I feel, and many feel, that this is essential when it comes to services and health insurance. Republicans say: No, it is an option; take it or leave it. People who leave it and then need it find themselves in a terrible predicament. They can't provide the lifesaving treatment their kids and other members of the family they love desperately need.  I see my colleague on the floor, and I will not go any further other than to say this: Why are we in this position when, 10 days before the final vote on changing healthcare for 360 million Americans, it is in a proposal that no one has seen and no one has read and no one has analyzed? It is an embarrassment to this great institution, the Senate, that we are not deliberating on this measure--this lifesaving, life-and-death measure--with the kind of respect that it deserves, with the kind of expertise that it deserves.  My Republican Senate colleagues have said it well--Senator Murkowski, Senator Moran, and others: The Senate ought to do what the Senate was elected to do. Take up an important measure like this, read it carefully, debate it, amend it, bring in the experts, and don't move so quickly on it that you could jeopardize the healthcare of millions of I am sorry it has reached that point.  If 3 Republican Senators out of 52--if three of them--will step up and say: This is wrong; we need to do this the right way, a transparent way, a fair way, a bipartisan way. If three will step up and do that, then we can roll up our sleeves and do the right thing for  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

10287,topic-id,743,"Mr.President, no choice and a proposed 43-percent increase in premiums--that is what ObamaCare and its harmful impact will bring to Iowa in 2018. This year, it brought premium increases up to 42 percent. Last year, it brought increases up to 29 percent. ObamaCare is not sustainable and not affordable for  To anybody who has studied healthcare reform, this should come as no surprise. In the past, many States have tried to reform their individual market. Twenty-seven years ago, Kentucky made an attempt and implemented the Kentucky Health Care Reform Act of 1994. This bill was similar to ObamaCare in many respects. It contained more taxes, more regulations, and more mandates. Within 3 years--3 years--insurers fled the individual market and the State was hit with skyrocketing premiums.  What happened in Kentucky then is eerily similar to what is happening in Iowa today as a result of When it comes to affordability and choice, my home State of Iowa has been hit particularly hard.  While traveling across the State, I hear from Iowans who are looking for affordable coverage. Far too often, I hear that high monthly premiums are squeezing pocketbooks and that soaring out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and copays, make coverage unaffordable to use for those who do have it. That is not what ObamaCare promised, but that is what it has brought.  One Iowan who works at a small business in Hinton wrote to me and said:       Over the past seven years, prices have jumped considerably      and the coverage employees are getting for the amount of      money spent is substantially less! We have tried to help our      employees by minimizing the changes in premiums, but these      last two years we had to start passing on some of the      increases in order to survive.       We can no longer absorb the constant rate increases, nor      can we not offer a health plan to our employees. Therefore,      we find ourselves between the proverbial rock and the hard      place. We certainly are not the only small business facing      the same dilemma.  Employees at this small business can breathe a small sigh of relief because their employer still has the ability to offer coverage, even if they are forced to pay more and more because of Other Iowans are on the edge because their options for coverage are shrinking.  In 2016, UnitedHealthcare left the individual market in A few months ago, Wellmark and Aetna both announced they would be leaving the individual market in 2018. Medica is the only remaining statewide carrier, and while they appear to be staying for the next year, it will take a massive rate increase on Iowans for them to do so.  The Iowa insurance commissioner said:       Iowa has hit a point within our market's collapse that a 43      percent rate increase will drive healthier, younger, and      middle aged individuals out of the market. Iowa's individual      market remains unsustainable.  If Medica leaves after next year, there is a very real possibility that tens of thousands of Iowans will have nothing to purchase on the individual market.  To put this issue into perspective and show why it matters so much, I want to share concerns I received from a constituent in Ames, This constituent is the parent of a child with a rare disease. The family purchased a plan from Wellmark to cover the child for 2017, but now that Wellmark plans to leave, the parents are unsure whether they will be able to find a plan for their child. They find this whole experience ``disruptive and anxiety provoking.''  Disruption and anxiety are not being felt just in Iowa; all across the country, premiums are skyrocketing and choices are limited and in some places, nonexistent. Recent data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows that 2.4 million people in 1,200 counties across the country will have one option for insurance in 2018. That is not an option at all. A recent report by HHS found that between 2013 and 2017, premiums more than doubled on the exchange--more than doubled on the exchange. In some States, premiums tripled.  Across the country and in my home State of Iowa, we don't have the option to continue with the status quo when it comes to our healthcare. The reality is, the status quo is truly unsustainable.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

10073,topic-id,2971,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the healthcare bill the House of Representatives passed and is currently being considered behind closed doors by my Republican colleagues.  I travel around greater Minnesota all the time, and when the Republicans' healthcare plan first came out, I traveled to rural Minnesota to meet with rural hospitals, nursing home providers, and constituents to hear how this bill would impact their lives and communities. They are upset and they are frankly scared.  In Perham, MN, I heard from a woman who was in tears, not knowing where her mother would go if the Republican plan passed and she lost her nursing home coverage. This woman and her husband work full time, but together they cannot afford the around-the-clock care her mother needs.  Later, at a nursing home in Moorhead--that is in Minnesota across the river from Fargo--I also heard from a resident, Chrysann, who said this new plan wasn't about taking care of people but about ``survival of the fittest.'' The hospitals and nursing home administrators I met with said the financial blow they would receive would cause them to cut services and in some cases even close their doors.  What I heard, and the real panic that I saw, is a far cry from what President Trump promised this past January when he said: ``We're going to have insurance for everybody.'' He went on to say it would be ``much less expensive and much better.''  Versions of these promises keep coming from President Trump, his Cabinet, and from his allies in Congress--coverage for more people, at lower costs, with better quality. Those things all sound great, things that might help people like Chrysann, but the fact is, the Republican bill does the exact opposite. It takes coverage away from people, it drives up costs, and it makes coverage worse. In other words, the GOP is selling this healthcare bill on false pretenses.  Today I would like to explain how the Republican bill betrays each one of these three fundamental promises, and let's take them one by one. We can start by the number of people who will be covered. President Trump promised that everyone would have insurance, but an analysis of an earlier version of the healthcare bill--the first iteration of this, which is actually not as bad as this one--an earlier version analysis conducted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that under current law the House Republican plan would leave 24 million fewer people with health insurance by 2026. That means by 2026, nearly 1 in 5 Americans under the age of 65 would be uninsured, compared to just over 1 in 10 today.  One particular way the Republican bill cuts coverage is by gutting Medicaid, a program that covers more than 60 percent of all nursing home residents nationwide, covers kids with disabilities, and benefits nearly 70 million The Republican plan ends Medicaid expansion. It fundamentally undermines the structure of the Medicaid Program and cuts the program's budget by as much as one-quarter over 10 years, a more than $800 billion cut.  On May 7, journalist Jake Tapper of CNN asked Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price whether the hundreds of billions of proposed cuts would result in millions of Americans not getting Secretary Price responded: ``Absolutely not.'' Well, that is absolutely false. When I say ``absolutely,'' I mean that literally.  It doesn't take an expert to know that if you take funding away from this program, which provides health coverage for millions of Americans, the program will suffer, and the human beings who rely on Medicaid will suffer as well. Specifically, according to the[[Page S3087]]Congressional Budget Office, 14 million of those 24 million people who will lose coverage under the Republican bill would lose their health insurance because of cuts to ``Absolutely not,'' says the Secretary of  It is bad enough to push a bill that will take away care from millions who need it; it is extra galling to be so fundamentally dishonest about it in the process. Look, the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect and we have problems that need to be fixed, but let's step back and review how far we have come because of the Since it came into effect, about 20 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage, producing the lowest uninsured rate in the history of this country.  In Minnesota, the number of uninsured dropped by nearly half, with people in rural areas seeing the largest gain in coverage. As a result, we have eliminated the gap in coverage between rural and urban These coverage gains have increased access to vital health services, including access to treatment for mental illness and substance use disorders, but the Republican healthcare plan throws all of these gains into jeopardy, which is particularly troubling given that the country is still in the midst of battling a devastating opioid and heroin epidemic. Researchers estimate that 2.8 million Americans with substance use disorders will lose some or all of their insurance coverage under the ACA repeal.  Let's be clear. People will lose coverage as a result of the proposed Medicaid cuts; people will lose coverage because of the proposed insurance reforms; and tens of millions of more people will be uninsured and without care in the Republican plan than under current law.  Let's move on to the second point; the assertion that is repeated constantly by President Trump and by others that their bill brings down costs. In his Rose Garden celebration after the Republican health care bill passed the House--not after signing it into law but sort of an unprecedented Rose Garden celebration after merely the House passed the bill--President Trump said: ``As far as I am concerned your premiums they are going to start to come down.''  When Secretary Price was asked, again by Jake Tapper, if he stands by the President's statement, he responded: ``Absolutely.''  On an earlier date, Secretary Price actually said: ``Nobody will be worse off financially'' under the Republican plan.  This is just blatantly wrong. Republicans are actively sabotaging the individual market, needlessly driving up premiums in the short term, and in the long term what they are doing will result in exorbitant premium hikes for older, sicker people--so much so that CBO estimates some will eventually drop out of the market altogether.  Let me explain. For years, Republicans have taken deliberate steps to sabotage the individual market. First, Senator Rubio ran through a last-minute change to the 2015 spending bill that undercut the Risk Corridor The Risk Corridor Program, which was modeled after a similar program in the Medicare Part D Program, was included as part of the ACA to offset high costs incurred by insurers as they took on new enrollees in the early years of the  Here is how it worked. The Federal Government would make payments to health plans that enrolled a group of people who were sicker than expected and had higher healthcare costs than the insurer predicted when it set its premiums. On the flip side, the Federal Government would receive payments from health plans that enrolled a group of people who were healthier than expected and needed less care. By limiting losses incurred by insurers, the Risk Corridor Program was designed to help make premiums more affordable for individuals and families who bought coverage on the exchange. Senator Rubio's provision undercut all of this. It severely curtailed the payments that could be made under the Risk Corridor Program, which meant that premiums soared and health insurers left the market.  For example, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota lost about $220 million between 2014 and 2016 under the weakened Risk Corridor Program, which the CEO told me in a meeting late last spring was a huge setback for the company. I was dismayed but not surprised when I heard, shortly after our meeting, that the company was leaving the individual market, which affected coverage for more than 100,000 Minnesotans and contributed to average premium increases of 36 to 67 percent in Minnesota's individual market in 2017.  Insurers across the country faced similar destabilizing losses, but that is not all. On top of that, for months, President Trump has been doing his part to sow uncertainty by repeatedly arguing that the individual market is in a death spiral. For example, on May 4, in response to Aetna's exit from the individual market in Virginia in 2018, President Trump shouted on Twitter: ``Death spiral!'' This is similar to his post on March 13 in which he said: ``ObamaCare is imploding. It's a disaster and 2017 will be the worst year yet, by far!'' But he is wrong.  Even the CBO noted in one of its scores that barring any significant changes, the individual market would probably be stable in most areas. This confirms what other research has found, which is that this year markets were starting to stabilize, which led Standard & Poor's to issue a report last December predicting that 2017 could see ``continued improvement, with more insurers getting close to breakeven or better.''  But this didn't faze President Trump or any of the Instead, they seem to have used these reports as a guidebook on what changes are necessary to actually cause the individual market to collapse. For example, President Trump has been playing games with payments that are due to insurance companies that reduce out-of-pocket costs for working families. On numerous occasions, he has threatened to stop these payments altogether, but in practice, he has been holding these payments hostage on a month-to-month basis to push forward other insidious reforms. Just yesterday, his administration announced that it would seek another short-term delay in the House's lawsuit, which aims to stop these payments permanently. These games are driving up the premiums for families and rattling health insurance markets.  Lastly, the administration has stopped enforcing the individual mandate. As a result, we are seeing enrollment in the individual markets stall for the first time since 2010, and if this results in younger, healthier people dropping their coverage, we could see prices rise dramatically for those left behind.  That is right. President Trump and the Republicans are actively attacking the insurance markets, causing premiums to go up. So if these markets falter and consumers suffer, it is because of what Republicans are doing right now and have been doing for years to undermine the individual market.  Still, you will often hear Republicans talk about the need to reduce costs. They even claim that their proposed healthcare plan would lower premiums in the long run. For millions of Americans, that is not true, but the reasons why it is untrue are slightly complicated. It goes to the CBO report for the Republican healthcare plan.  The March 13 CBO score says that average premiums for single people in the individual market would be 15 to 20 percent higher than under current law--than under the current ACA--in the first 2 years of its implementation. But it does say that they would be roughly 10 percent lower in 2026 under the House bill than they would be under current law.  At first blush, this sounds like prices would be coming down for people, right? That is certainly what the Republican leadership wants you to think. That day, House Speaker Ryan stated: ``This report confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums and improve access to quality, affordable care.'' House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy got more specific. He said: ``After 10 years, premiums will be 10 percent lower than under ObamaCare.'' But Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McCarthy are being deliberately misleading. One of the reasons that average costs go down is that the price for some people would go up so much that they couldn't afford any insurance at all. If the people facing the most expensive insurance[[Page S3088]]simply dropped out of the market, sure, average costs go down.  Here is how this works: Under the Republican plan, insurers would be able to charge older enrollees five times more than younger ones, which would dramatically increase premiums for people aged 50 to 64 years old while decreasing premiums for younger people. Meanwhile, the tax credits that help older Americans afford their premiums would be drastically slashed. The result is that, especially for older people of modest means, coverage would become unaffordable, so they disappear from the market. If only younger, healthier people can buy insurance, average premiums go down, but you have actually made the system much worse and much more expensive for the people who really need it.  But that is not all. The Republican plan would also allow States to waive crucial protections for patients with preexisting conditions, which means that in those States, we could go back to something like the old days when insurance companies could charge people with preexisting conditions much more--potentially as much as $25,000 more for their coverage, as estimated by the  Republicans are quick to point out that their bill maintains a requirement that insurance companies have to offer plans to everyone, but it abandons the principle that the plans must be affordable, and an unaffordable plan does people about as much good as no plan at all.  If you are young, if you have no preexisting condition, it might be true that your premiums will go down under the Republican plan. But for millions of Americans, though, if the Republican bill passes, insurance costs are going to go up. For many people, they will go up so high that they will be out of reach.  That brings me to the third claim the Republicans are peddling--that their plan will result in higher quality coverage. In fact, Republicans want to open the door to junk insurance.  In defending the House Republican plan, Secretary Price recently stated that the plan allows ``for every single person to get the access to the kind of coverage that they want.'' We have heard this before. This is a code for allowing insurers to offer garbage insurance plans that offer skimpy benefit packages and impose much higher deductibles and cost sharing on consumers.  Under the Affordable Care Act, you cannot sell junk plans on the insurance exchanges. Plans have to cover the essential health benefits. This is key. Under the ACA, plans have to cover the essential health benefits--10 key categories of benefits such as prescription drugs, maternity care, and mental health services. On top of that, the law prohibits insurers from imposing annual or lifetime limits on these essential health benefits. The goal is to make sure that when people get sick or if they have a preexisting condition, they don't go broke getting the care they need because of fine print in their health insurance plan.  The Republican bill would allow States to eliminate these essential health benefits. Consumers would be left with plans that leave them up a creek if they actually get sick. And plans for people who are sick--the price of those plans will go sky high. No one would call that ``better care,'' which is why Republicans aren't really being straight about it. What they call ``flexibility'' is actually just the removal of consumer protections.  To review, the Republican plan covers fewer people, costs too many people more--in many cases, much, much more--and provides worse coverage, and it is being sold by misleading people on each of these points.  It is not as though there aren't ways to cover more people, reduce costs, and provide better coverage. You could do a public option, for example. You could reduce prescription drug costs--an issue on which I recently introduced a comprehensive bill. You could improve coverage by increasing the number of healthcare providers in rural areas, as I proposed last year in my rural health bill. But the Republican plan does none of these things, which raises the question: What does it do? Why would anyone take the time to propose such a terrible bill? The answer is this: It gives a giant tax cut to the wealthy. That is the real point of this bill. It is not a healthcare bill; it is a ``take healthcare away from people who need it and use the money to give a tax break to the rich'' bill.  As Chrysann in Moorhead, MN, said, it is about ``survival of the fittest.''  The average tax savings for the 400 richest Americans under the Republican plan is $7 million each--again, $7 million each. For households earning $1 million or more a year, it is more than $50,000 apiece, each year. But for households earning $50,000 a year, which is about the median income in the United States, the tax cut is next to nothing, or you could even face a tax increase. There are tax cuts specifically for insurance company There are tax cuts specifically for drug companies. There is nothing comparable for the middle class. And all of those tax cuts are paid for by cutting healthcare programs that keep people alive, by cutting off funding that lets seniors age with dignity, and by cutting services for kids with disabilities.  This bill would take us back in time and roll back our progress. It is up to us here in the Senate to stop that from happening. This bill is literally sickening. It is vicious, it is cruel, and it should never be passed into law. I urge my Republican colleagues to walk away from this cruel effort and work with us to actually improve healthcare for And I urge everyone considering this bill to be straight with the American people about exactly what it is that this bill will do to them.

10235,topic-id,3575,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from College Station for the profound tribute to a great man, great people.  It has been an interesting week. Our President is headed for the Middle East, and it has gotten rather vitriolic, condemnation of our President for firing the FBI  The FBI Director is supposed to be more concerned with law enforcement than with press conferences. Since he is not elected, his job is not to go out and appear to be, politically, a substitute and, particularly, not to help one party over another.  It seemed that under Director Comey's tenuous head of the FBI--I was thrilled when he replaced Mueller did a lot of damage to the FBI with his 5-year up-or-out policy, where anyone in a supervisory position for 5 years anywhere outside of Washington, at the end of the 5 years, had to either leave the FBI or come to Washington and be a minion up here for the  We lost thousands and thousands of years of valuable FBI experience under Director In fact, no one has done more damage to the rank and file of our outstanding FBI agents than Director I keep hearing all these glowing things. Well, he did a lot of damage.  Plus, under his time as FBI Director, Mueller had the training material that would help FBI employees and agents understand more about radical  The FBI, in the 1990s, had done an outstanding job of gathering information about radical Islam, of groups like the Holy Land Foundation, individuals associated with supporting terrorism. After the 1993 attempt to bomb the World Trade Center, he did a good job gathering evidence for that trial. By the time Director Mueller came along under President George Bush, they had gotten pretty good at figuring out what radical Islam was.  Kim Jensen, with the FBI, had a 700-page program to train FBI agents on what radical Islam was, how you go about spotting people that had been radicalized, the things they believe, understanding which scriptures in the Koran they focused on. It really helped FBI agents figure out how to stop radical  But the reason the FBI took so much criticism after so many people across America have been killed needlessly from people who were on the FBI radar is because, under Bob Mueller, the FBI agents were not allowed to know how to spot radical Islam, and, in fact, they could hurt their career if they attempted to point out that someone had been radicalized.  So that is why, when Russia told the United States twice--once, directly told the FBI, as I understand it--that the older Tsarnaev brother had been radicalized and where he had traveled and where he had been radicalized over in the former Soviet Union area, the FBI, the best we can find out from the public hearings we had, apparently, under Mueller, they sent somebody to ask Tsarnaev if he was a radical terrorist, and he assured them he wasn't. And they sent somebody to ask Tsarnaev's mother, and she, in essence, said, ``No, he is a good boy; he is not a terrorist,'' and that was their investigation.  I challenged Mueller: You didn't even go to the mosques, the main Boston mosque where these guys attended to see and investigate whether they had been radicalized.                              {time}  1315  He refuted that. He said we did go to those mosques, but then he added: ``In our outreach program.''  It turns out, as he admitted, he did not even know that the Boston mosque where the Tsarnaev radicalization was heightened was started by a man named Alamoudi helped the Clinton administration back before they started making so much money on who they were. But the Clinton administration used Alamoudi to help them find the perfect Muslims to be chaplains at prisons, the perfect Muslims to help advise the government, the perfect Muslims to plug in to help our United States  And it is what I have asked more than once and have gotten no answer: Who was it that encouraged or placed Huma Abedin Weiner next to Hillary Clinton as an intern in 1996? Who was it that put her in that position next to the First Lady, where she grew from being intern to being helper and ultimately her number one closest adviser as secretary of state?  Had Hillary Clinton been elected President, she would have been the foremost closest adviser to the President of the United States with some strong direct ties from her family to the Muslim  In fact, Osama bin Laden had indicated that a couple of things that radicalized him, made him want to kill people like Americans for being infidels, was a booklet written by an Egyptian Muslim brother named Qutb--Q-u-t-b--called ``Milestones.'' He also gave great credit to a guy named Naseef, who was head of a number of Muslim activities--still is. But he had a journal that was a favorite publication of the Muslim  And come to find out that, gee, back when she was working for Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin was listed on the masthead as being a part of that publication, contributing to being part of that publication, along with, at different times, one or two other family members. That is the journal that Naseef started for the Muslim group.  Quite interesting, the ties that she had. Some of us asked for the inspector general--all we did was ask five different inspectors general and five different departments or agencies if they would investigate the extent of Muslim brother influence in their particular department or agency, and one was the State There is not one single thing that we put in any of those five letters that was inaccurate. They were all factually correct. But there was a firestorm. John McCain rushed to the Senate floor to condemn us. We were right about everything we put in those letters. We are still right.  Bob Mueller did a lot of damage to our ability--as one of our agents told me, we have been blinded of our ability to see who our enemy is.  In recent days, since Director Comey was fired by the President--which he totally has the authority to do for any reason or for no reason--there have been all these glowing comments by my Democratic friends in the House and Senate condemning the firing of President Trump has been vilified even for commenting today and yesterday that he thought when he fired Comey he would have wide bipartisan support. Because he had heard so many comments, he thought that would be widely appreciated on both sides of the aisle, because clearly the FBI had become about Comey and not about law enforcement.  It certainly seemed inappropriate, what he said last summer, when basically he laid out the case of how Hillary Clinton had committed a Federal crime that did not require intent, but then he added an element to the offense that Congress didn't add, that is not part of the law, of specific intent. Didn't exist. Not necessary to prove. It hadn't been proved in other cases where we have got people that have been put in the penitentiary for a lot less than what Hillary Clinton did. But he exonerated her. No prosecutor in his right mind would prosecute this case, when, actually, there are a lot of prosecutors who would have prosecuted that case if they were not so politically attuned as Mr.Comey was and is.  I thought it would be helpful, Mr.Speaker, to just go back and revisit comments from some of our friends across the aisle about the FBI Director In fact, nobody has been more vocal since Director Comey's firing than our friend down the hall, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat from New  I am quoting from my friend Chuck He came out bluntly on November 2, 2016: ``I do not have confidence in him any longer.''  Published in So being a man of his word, we know that as of November 2, Senator Schumer had no confidence in Director Comey any longer.[[Page H4384]]  Despite what he has said in recent days, beloved Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont did an interview with ABC News in January of this year. The headline from the ABC News story: ``Sanders: `Would Not Be Bad Thing for the American People' if FBI Director Comey Steps Down.''  Then the story went on to say: ``Asked by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview on `This Week' if Comey should leave his post, Sanders responded, `I think he should take a hard look at what he has done and I think it would not be a bad thing for the American people if he did step down.'  `` `I think that Comey acted in an outrageous way during the campaign,' Sanders said. `No one can say that this was decisive, or this is what elected Trump, but clearly his behavior during the campaign in terms of what he said during the week or two before the election was unacceptable.' ''  Then we have former Senator Harry All those who know him to be a man of his word can take his comments seriously because as of October 30, 2016, Senator Harry Reid from Nevada said in a letter to Director Comey: ``Dear Director Comey: Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.''  Again, this is Harry Reid to Director Harry Reid goes on: ``The double standard established by your actions is clear. In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian Government, a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity.''  And I will insert here parenthetically, we now know that the FBI did not possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian In fact, the Obama administration, intelligence, law enforcement officials have repeatedly testified that despite all their inferences, despite all the things they wanted to find, they could not point to any evidence of the Russian Government affecting our election, of the Russian Government colluding with the Trump administration or with Donald Trump's campaign to affect the election. No evidence.  Anyway, we know more now than we did at the time that Harry Reid wrote this letter.  Senator Reid went on: ``The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.  ``By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible.  ``Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department. You rushed to take this step 11 days before a Presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton.''  Well, again parenthetically, we know now it actually condemned Secretary Clinton, showed she committed a crime. She may not have had the intent to violate the law, but had the certain intent to do what she did, and that was a violation of the law.  He goes on. This is Harry Reid talking to and about He says: ``As you know, a memo authored by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on March 10, 2016, makes clear that all Justice Department employees, including you, are subject to the Hatch The memo defines political activity prohibited under the Hatch Act as, `activity directed toward the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.'  ``The clear double standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group.  ``Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant.  ``With deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.  ``Sincerely,  ``Senator Harry Reid.''  So as of last October 30, Reid believed Comey was not fit for being Director of the  On May 5: ``Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Friday that the letter FBI Director James Comey sent to Congress days before the 2016 election notifying lawmakers of the reopened investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices was `probably the lowest moment in the history of the FBI' next to wiretapping Martin Luther King Jr.''                              {time}  1330  Tim Kaine, Senator Kaine, went on: `` `It will go down as probably the lowest moment in the history of the FBI, probably next to the decision of Edgar Hoover to wiretap Martin Luther And it was unfortunate,' Kaine said.'' That was from the Free  Senator Dianne Feinstein from California, November 6, 2016, had this to say about Director Comey of the FBI: `` `The FBI has a history of extreme caution near election day so as not to influence the results. Today's break from that tradition is appalling.' ''  Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat from Connecticut, said this on May 10 on MSNBC: `` `It is absolutely true the Democrats have been very critical of James Comey, and many of us did call for his resignation.' ''  Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey, back on November 6 of 2016, said: ``Hillary Clinton was sharply critical of the FBI in the wake of the surprise announcement that investigators were examining newly discovered emails that could be related to her former private server, but she has avoided the issue more recently.  ``So it was striking that Senator Cory Booker took a swipe at the law enforcement agency on Sunday when he introduced Clinton at a black church here.''  This actually is a story from the LA  ``Without mentioning the email probe specifically, Booker said there have been `reruns' in this election.  `` `We saw what the FBI did in MLK's day,' he said, a reference to how it targeted the civil rights leader decades ago.  ``FBI Director James Comey has faced withering criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans for notifying Congress so close to the election that the agency was examining additional emails.  ``But Booker's reference to the Martin Luther King, Jr., was also interesting in light of how Comey has required FBI trainees to study the lessons from the `shameful' investigations of the civil rights leader.''  In an interview with NPR back on November 8, 2016, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey had an interviewer say this to him: ``Now, earlier today, we had House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calling the FBI Director James Comey's recent announcements a Molotov cocktail. And she was saying it might have affected down-ballot races for House and Senate, saying it might have made things more of an obstacle for What concerns do you have about that in the Senate?''  Senator Booker, again this is November 8, 2016, said: ``Well, I really think that it was a big impact on the election. I don't have any, obviously, data to back that up, and hopefully through an analysis we will see. But clearly our Senate candidates and our Presidential candidates were surging--or at the time that news came, it sucked the momentum out a lot of those races. And we think it could likely affect the outcome of some very[[Page H4385]]tight Senate races as well. It's unfortunate that he would break with precedent. It's--to me, it showed a grave lack of judgment, to put something like that into an election days before it would come to pass. And I think he did a disservice to the United States of America.'' That was from NPR on condemning the actions of Director  Just so that we know what the theme is we are talking about here, basically Farewell to Director Comey as FBI Director, and I am just giving quotes that our friends across the aisle, Democrats, have made about Director  Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said this November 2, 2016: `` `Maybe he's not in the right job,'. . . .  `` `I think that we have to just get through this election and just see what the casualties are along the way.' ''  Our friend, Representative G.Butterfield, Democrat here in the House, serving nobly, former head of the Congressional Black Caucus, he said this year, January 24: `` `I can't speak for Democrats, but I can speak for myself, and I think that James Comey needs to fade away into oblivion.'  `` `He embarrassed this Nation, he possibly influenced the outcome of a presidential election, and he should not hold any position of trust, whatsoever, in our government.' ''  And my friend, Representative Steve Cohen from Tennessee, we serve together on the Committee on the This was his press release October 30, 2016. The press release his office sent out said: ``Congressman Steve Cohen, ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, today called on James Comey to resign as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.''  Then it has a quote in the Cohen press release: `` `FBI Director James Comey's recent public comments on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her emails, apparently before seeing any evidence, and against the advice of the Justice Department according to press reports, and even, some have suggested, in violation of the Hatch Act, make it clear that for the good of the FBI and the Justice Department, he should resign his position effective immediately,' said Congressman `In the past, even quite recently, I have expressed my appreciation for Director I appreciated his courage as Deputy Attorney General when he stood up to President Bush's Chief of Staff Andrew Card and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales when they attempted to persuade hospitalized Attorney General John Ashcroft to reauthorize Bush's domestic surveillance program, which the Justice Department had just determined was illegal. When, in July of this year, Director Comey recommended no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was Secretary of State but added his own sidebar of opinions to the announcement, I gave Director Comey the benefit of the doubt, despite the fact that his making such highly unusual remarks was called into question by many.'  ``Congressman Cohen elaborated, `While I cannot know Director Comey's reasoning for his recent letter to House Members notifying them about the FBI's review of emails that he deemed ``potentially related'' to Hillary Clinton's personal server, it was plainly premature, careless and unprecedented in its potential impact upon a Presidential election without a speck of information regarding the emails in question, their validity, substance or relevance. Director Comey stated in the letter that he had no idea of ``the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails,'' which makes his decision all the more disturbing.  `` `There is a reason that FBI investigations are not usually made public until they are completed. To do so gives an impression of guilt before all the facts have been determined. That was the case during the FBI's investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails that led Director Comey to state that there was no evidence that Secretary Clinton intentionally transmitted or willfully mishandled classified information and that ``no reasonable prosecutor'' would bring a case against her. In light of that finding and the Department of Justice's prohibition and practice against influencing elections, it is clear that Director Comey's actions, no matter his motivations, have called into question his judgment and ethics. That is unacceptable as the FBI Director must, like Caesar's wife, be above suspicion. I agree with CNN's Paul Callan who, in calling for Director Comey to resign wrote `Trashing the Justice and FBI rule books in the interest of `openness' is likely to put the FBI front and center in one of the most contentious Presidential races in recent U.history.' ''  ``Congressman Cohen continued, `Additionally revelatory is The New York Times opinion written by Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer for President George Bush, in which he states: Absent extraordinary circumstances that might justify it, a public communication about a pending FBI investigation involving a candidate that is made on the eve of an election is thus very likely to be a violation of the Hatch Act and a misuse of an official position.

Now, to coincide with the talk radio anti-immigration week, Republicans are putting on a passion play of their own in the House of Representatives by bringing two anti-immigrant bills to the floor.  So we have a coordinated campaign from broadcasters, lawmakers, and the anti-immigration advocates to pressure Congress into passing bills to paint immigrants as a threat to our national and community safety--right out of the Trump playbook.  The question is not whether or not these bills will pass the House--they will pass--but whether Democrats will be tempted to vote for tough-sounding measures because they are afraid to be labeled by conservative talk radio hosts as weak on punishing the ``murdering, rapist, drug-dealing Mexicans'' they think are lurking in every alley.  Of course, that is not what these bills actually do at all. Truth and talk radio do not often go together--certainly not in the era of  Let's look at the two bills Republicans are bringing for a vote.  One bill is H.3004, named for Kate Steinle, a young woman who was shot and killed by an immigrant nearly 2 years ago in San It happened in July, and as you may remember, I was the first person to come to the floor and give a speech denouncing Kate's killer and calling for laws that keep people like him off the streets.  A week later, while talking about various immigration issues in Spanish with Telemundo, a quote was included in a story about Kate Steinle's killing. After it was aired, rightwing groups circulated it, alleging it was proof that I was insensitive to the Steinle family, when, in fact, I was not speaking about Kate Steinle at the time, and I had already spoken out specifically on Kate's death here on the floor.  But what is coming to the floor this week would not have kept Kate Steinle's killer off the streets. It would have had no impact on that case whatsoever. Instead, we are voting on a bill to put other people in different circumstances in jail for longer periods of time.  It is a bait-and-switch strategy: use a horrible tragedy to sell a policy that would not have prevented that death so that we put more immigrants in jail for longer periods of time and prevent them from ever living legally in the United  The other bill, H.3003, is designed to take money away from America's largest cities and counties, specifically from efforts to fight crime--yes, take money away from them. Grants that would help local police fight crime would be eliminated under this bill from 600 of the country's largest jurisdictions. That doesn't sound like crime fighting, because it isn't.  So why are we doing this? Because Republicans in Washington think they have a better idea of how to fight crime than the county executives, State legislators, mayors, and local police chiefs. ``Do what we say or we will take away your money'' is what the Republicans are saying to big cities and counties.  That is the approach being taken by the conservatives who always talk about how State and local people should be trusted more and protected from Federal mandates. Well, I guess, not when it comes to immigrants. This is why these types of bills are opposed by the National Fraternal Order of Police and other police organizations.  So to all the talk radio hosts and advocacy groups: Why are you on the side opposing the National Fraternal Order of Police? And why would any Democrat want to cross that blue line to stand with you?                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgH5237.txt,478,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,28.0,April

10066,topic-id,2147,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss international data privacy. This is a critically important issue that has become all the more important over the years as we become more sophisticated. It has become all the more pressing in recent months as a result of court decisions impacting law enforcement's ability to access electronic communications overseas.  I don't think it would surprise anyone to hear me say that our privacy laws have not kept pace with technological developments. The primary statute that governs law enforcement's ability to access electronic data, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or ECPA, was enacted over 30 years ago--long before most people had even heard of email or the internet. ECPA was drafted in a world in which electronic data was stored on personal computers or on servers located in offices or homes. It presumes a world where data is in one location and where in order to access data, a person simply goes to the relevant location and retrieves it. But that is not the world we live in, at least not today. Nowadays, much of our data is stored not on home or office computers but in the cloud, a network of remote servers spread throughout the world that allows us to access data from literally anywhere.  The rise of cloud and remote network computing has transformed the way companies and individuals store data. No longer is data stored on sites or in one discrete location; rather, data pertaining to a single individual or even to a single document may be stored at multiple sites, spread across countries or even across continents. This has created all sorts of complications for our laws.  ECPA requires law enforcement to obtain a warrant before it can access many types of electronic communications. It also prohibits disclosure to foreign entities. Warrants, however, traditionally have stopped at the water's edge. A judge here in Washington can issue a warrant authorizing law enforcement to search an office here in Washington but cannot issue a warrant for searches in London or  So what is law enforcement to do in a world of cloud computing where pieces of the same electronic document might be stored in Washington, London, and Paris?  One possibility is to say that as long as the data is accessible from the United States--that is, so long as you can retrieve it by logging on to a computer somewhere in the United States--that is all that matters; law enforcement can order its disclosure.  This sort of maximalist approach, however, brings with it a whole host of problems. To begin with, it pays scant attention to the laws and interests of other countries, including our closest allies. Other countries, it turns out, have data privacy laws of their own, and just like ECPA, sometimes these laws prohibit disclosure to foreign entities, including foreign law enforcement. So to say U.law enforcement can compel disclosure and data stored anywhere in the world so long as that data is accessible in the United States is really to say that U.law enforcement can override the laws of other countries.  More particularly, it is to say U.law enforcement can order individuals or companies that store data overseas to violate the privacy laws of other countries. This is unfair to service providers who may find themselves on the wrong side of the law no matter which side they choose and does little to help international relations. It also undermines trust, drives customers to foreign competitors, and undermines the privacy of U.citizens by emboldening other countries with less robust privacy regimes that similarly seek unlimited extra territorial access to data.  Another possibility is to say that if the data is stored in the United States, then law enforcement may access it, but if it is stored outside our borders, it is off limits.  This is essentially the current state of affairs following a decision last summer by the U.Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that ECPA warrants do not reach data stored abroad. Under the Second Circuit's decision, U.law enforcement can use compulsory process to access data stored in the United States but must work through diplomatic channels to obtain data stored overseas.  This sort of domestic storage regime has the benefit of avoiding the conflict-of-laws problems I have just described, but it also has very real drawbacks.  To begin with, it impedes law enforcement's ability to solve and prevent crime in cases where the needed data is stored outside the United States, even when the creator of the data is an American, the service provider storing the data is an American, and the crime being investigated took place here in the United The mere happenstance that the data is stored beyond our borders, even though it may constantly or instantly be accessed from within our borders, places it off limits. Service providers' varying business practices in moving and holding data determine whether an investigation moves forward.  This sort of domestic storage regime also forces U.law enforcement to work through diplomatic channels, which sometimes are slow and sometimes very cumbersome and in many instances less protective of privacy than U.criminal process, which requires a warrant from a neutral magistrate and a finding of probable cause.[[Page S3083]]  The upshot is that neither of these regimes is satisfactory. A maximalist regime that extends U.law enforcement jurisdiction worldwide creates serious conflict-of-law problems and places U.service providers in impossible positions. A more modest domestic storage regime, by contrast, hinders law enforcement's ability to solve crime and protect us from harm, based solely on where a particular document or piece of data happens to be stored at a given moment in time.  What we need is a sensible regime with clear rules that determine access based on factors that actually matter to the person whose data is being sought. Privacy laws are meant to protect people, not abstractions. We ought not get bogged down with mindless formalism. Most people could care less whether their data is stored at site A or site B or country A or country B as long as it is easily accessible and has robust privacy protections.  At the same time, we need to take proper account of the laws and interests of other countries, especially our allies. We ought to avoid, where possible, trampling on other nations' sovereignty or ignoring their own citizens' legitimate claims to privacy, whether here in the United States or abroad.  For this reason, I believe the right approach to international data privacy is to ground the analysis on the location of the person whose data is being sought. It is, after all, the person who has rights and the person whose interests are devalued when data is obtained without proper process.  Accordingly, I have proposed legislation called the International Communications Privacy Act, or ICPA, that sets clear rules for when and how U.law enforcement can access electronic data based on the location and nationality of the person whose data is being sought. I intend to introduce an updated version of this legislation in the very near future.  Here is what the updated version of this legislation will say: If a person is a U.national or located in the United States, then law enforcement may compel disclosure no matter where the data is stored, provided the data is accessible from a U.computer and law enforcement uses proper criminal process. If a person is not a U.national, however, and is not located in the United States, then different rules apply.  These rules are founded on three principles: respect, comity, and reciprocity.  First, respect. If U.law enforcement wishes to access data belonging to a non-U.national located outside the United States, then law enforcement must notify the person's country of citizenship and provide that country an opportunity to object to the disclosure. This protocol shows respect to the other country and gives the country an opportunity to assert the privacy rights of its citizen.  Second, comity. If, after receiving notice, the other country lodges an objection, the U.court undertakes a comity analysis to determine whose interests should rightfully prevail--the U.interests in obtaining the data or the foreign interests in preventing disclosure. As part of this analysis, the court can consider such factors as the location of the crime, the seriousness of the crime, the importance of the data to the investigation, and the possibility of accessing the data through other means. This analysis prevents an obstinate foreign power from impeding investigations without good reason or where the U.interests in disclosure are particularly strong.  Third, reciprocity. In order to receive notice and an opportunity to object, the other country must provide reciprocal notice-and-objection rights to the United The country must also provide robust privacy protections within its own borders and satisfy international human rights standards. These requirements ensure that the U.provides its own citizens an equal or greater level of protection against foreign requests for data. They also offer incentives to foreign governments to properly safeguard the data of U.citizens within their jurisdiction.  Tomorrow, the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism will hold a hearing on law enforcement access to data stored abroad. That hearing, I hope, will elucidate many of the principles I just described.  Soon after the hearing, I will reintroduce the International Communications Privacy The bill as reintroduced will incorporate feedback from law enforcement and privacy groups. I intend to push very hard for this legislation and will seek every opportunity to do so. I want my colleagues to know that I will be pursuing any and all legislative vehicles to get it across the finish line.  In the words of Utah businessman Jeff Hadfield, writing in the Deseret News, ``It's imperative that Congress quickly address the ambiguity within our current law. As every company becomes a software company, we need legislation that supports our companies' ability to store data overseas, protects our individual privacy rights, and helps U.law enforcement do its important job.'' I could not agree more.  The International Communications Privacy Act provides critical guidance to law enforcement, while respecting the laws and interests of our allies. It brings a set of simple, straightforward rules to a chaotic area of law and creates an example for other countries to follow. It is a balanced approach and a smart approach, and it deserves this body's full support.  Mr.President, on another matter, I wish to register my strong support today for the confirmation of John Sullivan to be Deputy Secretary of  The nomination of John Sullivan is another example of President Trump choosing the best and brightest for national security positions in his administration.  I have known John Sullivan since he was confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Commerce during the George Bush administration. He excelled in this position, which bears many similarities to the Deputy Secretary of State role to which he has been nominated.  For example, as Deputy Secretary of Commerce, John was responsible for the day-to-day operations and management of a major Federal agency. As Deputy Secretary of State, he will assume the same managerial duties, but for a different Federal agency.  In facilitating international trade agreements at the Department of Commerce, John Sullivan also honed his negotiating abilities, developing a diplomatic skill set that will be critical in his new role at the State  As the chairman of the Finance Committee, I closely followed John's tenure at I was consistently impressed with his ability to promote American interests abroad while maintaining constructive relations with our trading partners. I have no doubt that he will continue to serve our Nation well as the Deputy Secretary of  In addition to his management expertise, John Sullivan is a practicing attorney with the law firm of Mayer Brown There, too, he has developed a reputation for excellence, especially in the area of national security law.  In John Sullivan we have a proven manager, a seasoned diplomat, and a sharp policy mind who will bring strong leadership to the State In John Sullivan, President Trump and Secretary Tillerson have made an inspired choice.  Secretary Tillerson is doing a tremendous job at the State With John Sullivan as his Deputy, even more can be accomplished.  In addition, I would like to thank John Sullivan for his willingness to serve. Of course, I would be remiss if I did not also thank his family--especially his wife of 29 years, Grace Rodriguez, who has provided invaluable support to John throughout his public service. It is unlikely John would be here today without their consent and their constant support.  Few have the skills that John Sullivan possesses. Fewer still possess the patriotism, professionalism, and integrity he has displayed over a distinguished career. He is the best man for the job, which is why I urge my colleagues to confirm him without delay.  I appreciate this opportunity to make these points on the floor.  I yield the floor.

10270,topic-id,1803,"Mr.President, last week, I had the opportunity to return home to visit the recently declared Bears Ears National This Federal designation encompasses roughly 1.35 million acres in Utah, and it is located in one of our country's most remote communities--Juan  For decades, this quiet county remained largely untouched by the tensions of modern life and the taint of[[Page S2476]]Washington politics, but no more. San Juan County is now the epicenter of a brutal battle over public lands, the outcome of which will have long-lasting consequences not only for Utah but for the entire  In geographical terms, San Juan County is massive. It is the largest county in the State of Utah and the second largest county in the United To put the size of San Juan County in perspective, consider that the county itself is larger than several States, including Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode  San Juan County alone accounts for nearly 10 percent of all the land in Yet Utahns have had very little to say about what actually goes on there. That is because the Federal Government administers the vast majority of San Juan Incredibly, just 8 percent of the county's land is under private ownership while an area of more than 2 million acres is controlled by the Bureau of Land  This means that for years, my constituents who depend on the land's resources, have been at the mercy of out-of-touch bureaucrats who have little knowledge or personal connection to the land. President Obama only made matters worse when he spurned the men and women of San Juan County by declaring the Bears Ears National Monument last In doing so, he defied the will of the State legislature, the Governor, and the entire Utah congressional delegation. President Obama's midnight monument designation imposed even greater land use restrictions on a region that is already predominantly controlled by the Federal  This last-minute monument designation was a case study in Presidential hubris. In making this unilateral decision, our former President either failed to heed the concerns of San Juan County residents or ignored them completely. As evidence of his disdain, President Obama issued this declaration with no open debate, no public hearing, and no vote in Utahns are now suffering the consequences of his recklessness.  When I visited the Bears Ears region last week, I met with small business owners and local officials who admitted the fact that the Obama administration never even gave them the courtesy of a simple phone call. President Obama knew his last-minute decision would impact the livelihoods of thousands in my State, but he was clearly more concerned with appeasing far-left interest groups than helping the men and women who depend on this land for their very survival.  I wish to be clear. In opposing the Bears Ears Monument designation, I am in no way opposing the protection of lands that need to be protected. Indeed, there are many cultural sites in San Juan County that deserve special care, and I am committed to working with the President and with Congress and with the people in that county to preserve these sacred sites.  I believe it is both unlawful and undemocratic for any President to seize millions upon millions of acres of land through the Antiquities Act--a law that was meant to give the President a narrow authority to designate special landmarks, such as a unique natural arch or the site of old cliff dwellings.  We desperately need a more sensible approach to protecting public lands--an approach that adheres more closely to the original intent of the Antiquities Under this bill, Presidents were to exercise their authority to designate only the smallest area necessary to protect objects of antiquity. Instead, past Presidents have abused their power under the Antiquities Act to seize entire swaths of land.  In the case of Bears Ears, President Obama cited his authority under the Antiquities Act to lock away an entire quarter of San Juan County--an action that undermines local autonomy and clearly violates the spirit of the law. In my view, land use decisions should not be decreed by executive fiat. They should be made only through a collaborative process that involves those who actually live there, live on the land, and know how to manage it.  For example, had President Obama worked with--rather than around--Congress to protect public lands, Utah's schoolchildren would be better off today. That is because there are more than 100,000 acres of school trust land that lie within the 1.3 million-acre Bears Ears National The land is a significant source of revenue for schools across our State, providing children with the instruction and resources they need to succeed well into adulthood. But with President Obama's unilateral monument designation, this land was effectively rendered useless, eroding our State's ability to raise much needed funding for Utah's schools. Had a more responsible legislative approach been taken to protect Bears Ears, we could have preserved our school trust lands and protected the revenue they generate to benefit Utah's schoolchildren.  I wish to emphasize again that I am fully committed to protecting the vast stretches of red rock, desert, and rolling prairie that dot our western landscape, but the Antiquities Act is not the means to that end. Monumental land use decisions affecting thousands of westerners should be made by the men and women on the ground and their duly elected representatives, not just the President and his advisers. Congress--not the President alone--should have a say in decisions that restrict access to millions of acres of federally owned land.  In making such decisions, the voice of the people is paramount. That is why last week I visited the people of San Juan There, I spoke with Native Americans who rely upon this land and its resources for their very livelihood. I met with members of the San Juan School District who depend on the school trust lands to keep their classrooms lit and their schools up and running, and I met with members of the San Juan County Commission who are dealing firsthand with the negative consequences of the Bears Ears designation.  I traveled to San Juan County to listen to the people who feel abandoned by their very own government. My trip only reaffirmed my concern for the Bears Ears National Monument, which I have long held is not in the best interest of San Juan  The men and women of San Juan County are a strong and hardy people. They share a deep connection and history with the land. But San Juan County isn't without its struggles. For decades, it has been listed among the most persistently poor counties in the With the vast majority of the land owned and operated by the Federal Government, the fate of San Juan County rests almost entirely with beltway bureaucrats making politically motivated decisions more than 2,000 miles away. The families of Southern Utah should not be at the mercy of a Federal bureaucracy so completely out of touch with the western way of life.  Enough is enough. Under the Constitution, Congress has the sole authority to manage public lands. The only reason the executive branch has any say in the management of Federal lands is because Congress granted the President limited authority to participate in this process. We entrusted the executive branch to exercise reasonable authority through bills such as the Federal Land Policy and Management At the heart of these policies was the principle of multiple use and sustainable yield--a mandate that Congress gave the executive branch when granting it this authority.  The mandate of multiple use was meant to preserve the ability of areas like San Juan County to live and grow, even when inundated with federally owned public lands. But President Obama betrayed this mandate through his Bears Ears designation when he declared much more than the smallest acreage possible as required by the Antiquities  When I spoke with the leadership of the San Juan School District, they told me how prosperous the county had been when they were able to strike a balance with multiple land use. But the county's schools have been strapped for cash ever since the Bears Ears National Monument designation rendered these lands useless.  After speaking with school officials, we then met with local county commissioners and Navajo from San Juan County and drove together to the heart of Bears Ears, Bears Ears Meadow--behind me, the actual Bears Ears split of the mountains. We discussed how the monument could be altered so that the lands that deserve protection can remain protected but in a way that is consistent with the language of the Antiquities  I believe there will be changes made to Bears These beautiful lands[[Page S2477]]deserve protection, but so too do the people of San Juan They should not be trampled on by their own government. As long as I am a U.Senator, I will not stop fighting to make sure that Utahns have a voice in the management of public lands. For years, I have fought to check the abuse of executive power under the Antiquities That is why I have been working closely with the Trump administration from day one to right the wrongs of previous administrations.  In the opening weeks of his Presidency, I met personally with President Trump in the Oval Office to discuss the national monument issue at length. He listened intently as I relayed the fears and frustrations of thousands in our State who have been personally hurt by the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monument designations. I explained the urgency of addressing the harm caused by these devastating measures, and I asked for his help in doing so. I was encouraged that, unlike his predecessor, President Trump actually took the time to listen and understand the heavy toll of such overreaching activities. Our President even assured me that he stands ready to work with us to undo the damage wrought by previous Presidents under the Antiquities Act, and I believe he will do so.  As details emerge, I understand the President even stands ready to issue an Executive order reining in the abuse of authority under the Antiquities Now, this action would direct the Department of the Interior ``to review prior monument designations and suggest legislative changes or modifications to [these] proclamations.''  In President Trump, we have a leader who is committed to defending the western way of life. I am deeply grateful for his willingness to work with us to undo the harm caused by the overreach of his predecessors.  In protecting our public lands, I look forward to working with the Trump administration to establish a new precedent of collaboration and trust between States and the Federal  I yield the floor.

10300,topic-id,2326,"Mr.President, for the last several weeks, I have been hearing quite a bit about process here in the Senate, particularly as it relates to the ongoing debate over the future of  My friends on the other side of the aisle have, apparently, poll-tested the strategy of decrying the supposed secrecy surrounding the healthcare bill and the lack of regular order in its development. They have come to the floor, given interviews, and even hijacked committee meetings and hearings to express their supposedly righteous indignation about how Republicans are proceeding with the healthcare bill.  Of course, hearing Senate Democrats lecture about preserving the customs and traditions of the Senate is a bit ironic, but I will get back to that in a minute.  Last week, the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair, held a routine nominations markup to consider a slate of relatively uncontroversial nominees. On that same day, several of our colleagues and congressional staffers had been viciously attacked by an armed assailant, and a Member of the House of Representatives, of course, was in critical condition in the hospital.  I opened the meeting by respectfully asking my colleagues to allow the committee to use the markup as an opportunity to demonstrate unity in the face of a violent attack against Congress as an institution. Even then, my Democratic friends were, apparently, unable to pass up an opportunity to try to score partisan points and rack up video clips for social media by playing for the cameras as they lamented the committee's position in the healthcare debate.  Once again, the situation is dripping with irony. As I said, I will get to that in a minute.  If my Democratic colleagues are going to continue grandstanding over the healthcare debate, I have a few numbers I would like to cite for them.  Under ObamaCare, health insurance premiums in the State of Oregon have gone up by an average of 110 percent. In Michigan, they have gone up by 90 percent. In Florida, they have gone up by 84 percent. In Delaware, they have gone up by 108 percent. In Ohio, they have gone up by 86 percent. In Pennsylvania, they have gone up by 120 percent. In[[Page S3673]]Virginia, they have gone up by 77 percent. In Missouri, they have gone up by 145 percent.  I have not picked those States at random. Each of these States is currently represented by a Democrat on the Senate Finance Of course, those trends extend well beyond the committee.  In Illinois, where the Senate minority whip resides, premiums have gone up by 108 percent.  In West Virginia and Wisconsin, both of which are also represented by Democratic Senators, premiums have gone up by 169 percent and 93 percent, respectively.  Montana is in a similar situation with premiums rising by 133 percent under  Now, just so people do not go thinking that I am picking on the Democrats, I will note that, in Utah, health insurance premiums have gone up by an average of 101 percent.  In Wyoming, they have gone up by 107 percent, and, in Nebraska, they have gone up by 153 percent.  I can go on, but I think my point is clear: Health insurance premiums have skyrocketed all over the country by an average of 105 percent. I will repeat that. Under ObamaCare, the average health insurance premiums in the United States have seen triple-digit increases.  These are the fruits of the so-called Affordable Care This is the burden that ObamaCare has placed on patients and families throughout our country, and people are feeling that burden whether they vote for Democrats or  The only difference is that, for 7\1/2\ years, my Republican colleagues and I have been talking about the failures of ObamaCare, and for 7\1/2\ years, Senate Democrats have done virtually nothing to address these problems.  For 7\1/2\ years, Republicans like myself have pleaded with our Democratic colleagues and with the previous administration to work with us to address the failures of ObamaCare, and for 7\1/2\ years, it has been virtually impossible to get any Democrat in Washington to even acknowledge that there have been any problems with ObamaCare to begin with.  As the cost of healthcare in this country has skyrocketed out of control and the system created by the so-called Affordable Care Act has been collapsing under its own weight, Democrats in the Senate have been cherry-picking what few positive data points they can find and telling the American people that everything is fine and that ObamaCare is working.  Give me a break.  By no honest or reasonable measure is ObamaCare living up to the promises that were made at the time it was passed. As a result, the American people are saddled with a healthcare system that has been poorly designed and recklessly implemented.  Sure, it has made for partisan political theater for my colleagues to express shock and dismay at the current state of the healthcare debate. I am quite certain the strategy has poll-tested very well among the Democratic base, and the Senate minority leader clearly has an elaborate media campaign in mind.  Before they begin berating Republicans, I hope my Democratic colleagues were able to come up with something to tell their constituents whose healthcare costs have exploded as a result of I have just mentioned a few things.  I hope they have answers for their voters for wondering why they only have one insurance option available to them, if they even have that, and, most importantly, I hope they have an explanation as to why they have been more or less silent while the law they supported--and still support--has wreaked havoc on our Nation's healthcare system.  Until they can answer those questions and provide those explanations, my good friends should spare anyone within earshot their lectures about what is currently happening in the  Finally, let me address the irony of my Democratic colleagues' process complaints. Some of them have selective memories when it comes to the history of We have heard our colleagues talk about the number of committee hearings held in advance of ObamaCare's passing. What we don't hear is that there was not a single hearing held in the Senate on the ObamaCare reconciliation bill, which was an essential element that ensured passage of the Affordable Care Act in the  We have heard our colleagues talk about the markup process in committee and the number of amendments that were filed and accepted. What we don't hear about is the fact that the bills reported by the Finance and HELP Committees were tossed aside so the healthcare bill could be rewritten behind closed doors in Senator Reid's office, who was then the majority leader. The final product was only made public a few days before the Senate voted on it.  The truth is this: Senate committees--including the Finance Committee--have had literally dozens of hearings wherein the failings of ObamaCare--both the structure of the law and its implementation--have been thoroughly examined. Between all the relevant committees, there have been at least 66 healthcare hearings in the Senate since ObamaCare became the healthcare law of the land. More than half of those were in the Finance  Committees have conducted countless oversight investigations and inquiries into these matters over the years. Few matters in the history of our country have received as much of the Senate's attention as ObamaCare has received. Very few laws have been examined as extensively as the so-called Affordable Care Act, which is anything but affordable. ObamaCare is the very definition of well-covered territory.  The majority leader has made clear that Members will have an opportunity to examine the forthcoming healthcare bill, and I expect that to be the case. He has always made assurances that when the bill is debated on the floor, we will have a fair and open amendment process, as required under the rules. There is really no reason for anyone to expect otherwise.  Let's recall that when ObamaCare was passed, the Democratic Speaker of the House, with a plain face, stated that Congress had to pass the bill in order for people to see what was in it.  Let's also recall that a couple of years later, one of the chief architects of the so-called Affordable Care Act bragged about the lack of transparency that surrounded its passage and said it was necessary to, in his words, take advantage of the ``stupidity of the American voter.''  Any argument that the process that resulted in ObamaCare was a picture of transparency and deliberation is so off base that it would almost be humorous if the issue was something less important.  As I said in committee last week, I want to welcome my Democratic colleagues to the healthcare debate. Ever since ObamaCare was signed into law, Democrats have more or less assumed that the debate was over and that all they had to do was keep telling the American people that everything was just fine, as if repetition alone would make it come true.  Everyone is going to see the bill, and everyone is going to get their chance to say their piece about it.  For now, I simply hope my Democratic colleagues will spare us their lectures and maybe look in the mirror when they are ranting about the degradation of the process and traditions of the  I have been around healthcare for most of my 41 years in the A lot of the healthcare bills that work in this country have my name on them. This is one of the worst bills I have ever seen in all my time in the U.If I were a Democrat, I would not be claiming success because of that bill. It is a pathetic piece of legislation that is going to put this country down and make healthcare not available for everybody but make everybody have the worst healthcare system they could possibly have.  Now, it is one thing to cherry-pick a few things that the healthcare bill can help with, but it would be a totally stupid bill if it didn't have something in it that was good. If you look at the overall bill and you look at the overall cost to America and you look at what it is doing to America and you look at how the medical profession is starting to really wonder if they want to be in the profession anymore--you can't do all of this and look at all of these things[[Page S3674]]without asking, What in the heck have we done here? Are we so stupid that we believe the Federal Government is the last answer to everything?  Well, we will see, because I think some people are that stupid and, frankly--I don't want to name anybody, and I hope I am wrong, but I have been here 41 years and I have seen a lot of stupidity around this place and you have to really go a long way to find anything worse than the so-called ``affordable'' healthcare bill.  This is a pathetic piece of legislation that is going to wreck our country if we don't, as Democrats and Republicans, get together and reform it. This is an opportunity for my friends on the Democratic side as well as the Republican side to see what we can do about this and to get this thing straightened out.  This is the greatest country in the world. There is nobody in this country who should go without basic healthcare. When we have terrible cases like my distinguished friend and colleague from Connecticut has mentioned, yes, we want to make sure people who suffer like that are taken care of, and there are some on our side who could be a little more humane and compassionate, but there are some on the other side, too, who could be a little more humane and compassionate and maybe a little more honest when they talk about this bill.  We are a long way from solving the healthcare problems in this country, and if we go down this road any further, we will be an even longer way from solving these problems, and we may very well bankrupt the American economy, which will then really show us how bad we are with regard to healthcare in this country.  My friends on the other side never ask, Where is the money going to come from? Who is going to pay for this? Who is going to help us to get through this? We are just going to throw money at it, and we are $100 trillion in unfunded liability in this country and $20 trillion in national debt. It is astounding. Who is going to pay for it, especially when it doesn't work any better than that.  I spent some of my prior life in medical malpractice work defending doctors and hospitals and healthcare providers, and some of that was really astounding to me because some of those cases were brought just to get the defense costs, which were always pretty high because those cases were very expensive to defend. Most of them were not good cases, but once they got in court, if they had any kind of basis at all--but even if they were dismissed, it still cost a lot of money.  All I can say is, there is a lot wrong with our healthcare system in this country, but it is still the best healthcare system in the world, and it is about to go down if we don't get together as Republicans and Democrats and straighten this mess out. We can make our political points all we want to. Both sides have been right in some cases and both sides have been wrong on some things, but we are wrong if we think that the current system is going to work, and we ought to be working together as Republicans and Democrats or Democrats and Republicans to straighten it out.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgS3660-2.txt,1351,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2213, ANTI-BORDER CORRUPTION",2017.0,21.0,May
10209,topic-id,240,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary of Grand Valley State University's pioneer class.  In June of 1967, in a tent on its Allendale, Michigan campus, Grand Valley held its long dreamed of first commencement ceremony. On that day, 138 seniors, including 86 members of the pioneer class that started in 1963, received their diplomas from Michigan's newest college.  These first graduates laid the foundation of a university that would grow to offer 124 degrees, enroll students from 82 different countries, and boast a 94 percent employment rate for its graduates--always a good thing.  After that first graduation ceremony in 1967, GVSU had 138 alumni. Today, the university has over 110,000 proud alumni throughout Michigan and, frankly, around the globe.  Under the leadership of its first president, James Zumberge, followed by the continued guidance of Arend Lubbers, Mark Murray, and current president, Thomas Haas, Grand Valley has come[[Page H5059]]to be a renowned institution and one of the 100 largest universities in this  During the very first commencement address, a speaker noted: ``No one could ever possibly chart your course through these years.'' And it is hard to imagine that the pioneer class could have dreamed of the role that they would be playing in helping Grand Valley State University achieve such great heights.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Grand Valley State University's pioneer class of 1967, the original ``Lakers for a Lifetime.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5058-5.txt,2028,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2213, ANTI-BORDER CORRUPTION",2017.0,22.0,May
10299,topic-id,1064,"Mr.President, I thank the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate, the chairman of the committee. I am honored to take that 5 minutes.                          Veterans Healthcare  Mr.President, a lot of us wake up in the morning with a plan for the day, and we know what we are going to do each hour--and every 5 minutes if you are a Member of the Some days surprise you. I went to breakfast this morning for Members of the Senate who are veterans of the U.military. There were three of us at that breakfast. There were supposed to be more, but some did not come at the last minute.  One of the people at the breakfast handed me a piece of paper--four pages as a matter of fact--and asked: Have you seen this?  I did not know what it was, but I turned and looked at it. It was a white paper on the impact of President Trump's proposed budget on the American veteran.  The guy said: You are the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs I want you to explain why all of this is true.  I quickly turned through it, from one page to another, and looked at each of the headlines and subtitles. Every one of them was wrong. There was not a statement of fact in it, but there was a purpose to the paper.  So I thought all morning about what I would do today to try and get the word out about what is true without getting into a partisan or a bickering battle on the floor of the Senate about documents that have been sent out circuitously by one Member of the Senate or another. Facts are facts, and facts are stubborn things. It is very important for me as chairman of the committee to make sure that the Members of the Senate know what we are dealing with as we lead up to making important decisions.  This white paper alleges that President Trump's budget is a circuitous route to privatize VA health services for our veterans, which is patently untrue and wrong, and the authors of this in the Senate who have written it know it is untrue because they are on the committee. It further alleges that the funding of healthcare for veterans has been cannibalized by privatization programs in order to take healthcare out of the Veterans Health Administration and put it into the private sector.  I know, within a few weeks, that I am going to be coming to the floor with, hopefully, the entire Veterans' Affairs Committee and will be seeking additional funds for the Choice Program so as to continue to meet the demand for our veterans and their healthcare.  It was 2\1/2\ years ago that this Senate and this Congress and the former President passed and signed legislation that guaranteed that every veteran, no matter where he lived, could get services within the private sector in his community that were approved by the VA--services that he could not get from the VA anywhere. In other words, he got a choice. If he were denied an appointment within 30 days, he got a choice if he lived more than 40 miles from the service area. It became known as the Choice Program--popular but difficult to manage. It was popular in that 2.7 million appointments were held in the next 2 years over the previous 2 years because of the increased accessibility of healthcare for our veterans.  I come to the floor to say that the Veterans' Affairs Committee is working with the appropriators and the authorizers to see to it that the healthcare money that needs to be appropriated for our veterans is appropriately done in the budget proposal that we pass out of this body.  I want everybody on the floor to remember, every time you allege as a Member of the Senate that money for veterans is being cannibalized and that they are not going to get their health services, you are accusing the Congress and the Senate of not doing their constitutional duty of providing the funds we guarantee these men and these women when they voluntarily sign up to serve our country, serve for the eligible time necessary, and get VA status.  I am never going to forsake my obligation to the men and women who serve us today, have served us in the past, and will serve us in the future. I am never going to be one of those politicians who is not trustworthy in standing behind every promise that is made.  We have made a great promise to the veterans of America, and we are going to keep it because they made the greatest promise of all--that they would risk their lives for each of us.  So, if you get a document that reads ``The Impact of President Trump's Proposed Budget on America's Veterans'' and read it and it talks about the cannibalization of VA healthcare and its going to a privatized system of healthcare, put it in the trash can because that is where it belongs. It is full of quotes that have been taken out of context and that have been put together to tell a story to frighten folks.  Today and every day, we are in the process in the Veterans' Affairs Committee of working toward seeing to it that we meet the funding shortfalls that exist, to see to it that our veterans get the healthcare that they deserve and they come to our Veterans Health Administration for or that they have a choice, and we will continue to do so.  I have but one responsibility in the U.Senate, which is of paramount importance, and that is my chairmanship on the Veterans' Affairs I am not going to let our veterans down, and I am not going to let somebody else allege that we on the committee are trying to do something that would not help the veterans or guarantee them their healthcare. On the contrary, we are going to see to it that nobody else takes it away. We are going to do for our veterans what they have done for us--pledge our sacred honor to see to it that they get the service they deserve, have fought for, and have risked their lives for.

10286,topic-id,1686,"Just a moment, Madam I am looking for the healthcare bill. I know it is here somewhere. I haven't been able to find it and have been looking all morning. I suspect maybe we will find it in the next couple of days.  I wish to talk about Medicaid is often perceived as a welfare program, and it isn't. It is essential medical support.  Now, let's talk about who receives Seventy-two percent of the people who receive assistance from Medicaid are children, people with disabilities, and the elderly. Indeed, 85 percent of the expenditures for Medicaid, as opposed to enrollees--85 percent of the expenditures--are for those same groups--the children, the disabled, and the elderly.  Particularly, what a lot of people don't realize is that Medicaid is one support--if not the principal support--for nursing home care throughout the country, and especially in my State of I suspect, if we surveyed people--perhaps some even in this body, but certainly in the general public: How are you going to cover Aunt Minnie's nursing home care when she has to have it later in her life, most people would say: Oh, we have People I talk to at home say: Medicare is going to take care of me. No, except in very rare and limited circumstances, Medicare does not cover nursing home care. It doesn't cover long-term care. That is  Sixty-eight percent of all the Medicaid spending in Maine was for elderly or disabled people in 2014. About one in three people nationwide is going to require nursing home care--one in three. Nationally, over three-quarters of nursing home residents are covered by So if we are talking in this bill, wherever it is--if anybody finds it, let me know--about significant cuts to Medicaid, we are talking about people's ability to have long-term care in nursing homes. Make no mistake about it. You cannot cut Medicaid by over $1 trillion in 10 years and not have it affect those people.  Now, some say we are giving the States flexibility. We are giving the States flexibility to make agonizing decisions between disabled people, children, and seniors. That is not flexibility. To quote the President, that is ``mean.'' That is cruel. The States are only going to have two choices. They are either going to have to cut people off and limit services--and remember that three-quarters of the people are disabled, elderly, and children--or they are going to have to raise taxes on their own citizens.  Now, we are claiming we are going to help the Federal budget. We are going to reduce the deficit by $800 billion over 10 years by passing this bill. But we are just shifting the bill to the That is nice work, if you can get it. Why don't we shift the cost of the Air Force to the States? That would make the Federal budget look better. But it is not a real savings to our citizens if they have to pay out of their pocket at their home State or in their city, or if they have to pay part in their income taxes. That is no savings. That is a fake savings. That is a smokescreen to tell people: We are cutting government expenditures. No, we are not. We are just shifting them to another level of government where you are going to have to pay for them there as well.  But to get back to Seventy percent of the nursing home residents in Maine are covered by Who are they? They are people who can't be cared for at home any longer. They require nearly constant care and support. These aren't welfare recipients. These are our former teachers, police officers, the people who looked after us, the carpenters who built our houses, the nurses who cared for us in hospitals, the wait staff who served us meals, the veterans who served in times of trouble and fought for our freedom.  They and their families are simply part of our communities. They are not welfare recipients. They are people who have paid their fair share throughout their lives. They have worked hard. They have done all the things they were supposed to do, all the things that were expected of them. They stayed in their homes, by and large, as long as they possibly could. But at some point, after their assets and ability to pay were exhausted, they had Medicaid to help them in terms of long-term care.  I often say when I talk about this that it really frustrates me that we talk about this healthcare issue in terms of ideology and the free market and all of these kinds of things. No, this is about people.  This is about Jim and Cora Banks from Portland, They lived in He was a State employee, and she was a beautician, who worked out of her home and most of her energy went into raising four boys. Cora was a den mother and Scout leader. They worked on projects and--can you believe it--all four of their boys were Eagle That is an astonishing accomplishment, to have four sons as Eagle They were active in the Kiwanis and taught Sunday school. One of their sons was involved in Little So Cora raised money to build a concession stand on the field, which is still used today.  At 55, tragically, Cora began to have memory issues. Because they had health insurance--because they had health insurance--she could get great care at a geriatric practice in Friends and family were helpful, and Jim was the principal caregiver for many years. But at 70, it became clear that Cora needed full-time care, and Jim could not provide that level of care. The doctors said she needed to be[[Page S3663]]in a residential setting. Her assets were exhausted. She qualified for MaineCare, which is what we call Her nursing home care was covered, and she lived for a year in that nursing home.  Two-thirds of the income for all of our nursing homes in Maine come from Medicaid, from What happens to this resource of the nursing homes if suddenly their revenues are significantly cut? What happens? But, mostly, what happens to people like Cora?  There is also an idea--and I heard the head of the OMB talk about it: We are not really cutting; we are just cutting the rate of growth. Well, if the demand is growing, the cost is growing, and you cut the rate of growth, you are cutting. Less money will be available than is necessary to meet the need. That is a real cut.  All of us know we are facing a demographic bulge from the baby boom generation, who are aging and are going to require more and more medical treatment, and they are going to put a greater demand on our nursing homes.  In Maine, we are projecting a 105,000-person increase in the next 10 years of people over 65. One in four Maine people will be over 65 in the next two decades.  The Alzheimer's Association projects that 35,000 Maine seniors will be afflicted with the tragic disease of Alzheimer's within 10 years; 25,000 had the disease in 2014. People with dementia are 10 times more likely to live in a nursing home.  There is a lot in the bill, I am told. I don't know; I haven't seen it. I have been looking for it. But the central premise seems to be, if it is anything like the House bill, a massive cut in Medicaid and a massive tax cut to the people in our society who least need it. The tax cut is targeted at the very wealthiest Yet the results of that decision will be to cut essential medical support for elderly people, disabled people, and children. I don't understand that bargain. I don't understand that equation--a gigantic tax cut to the wealthiest and a substantial cut in support for those who most need it.  Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised when I see the bill, whenever that is. I hope it is more than a few hours before we are called upon to vote on it. Right now, what we are hearing and what we are learning and what the House bill looked like would be a tragedy for this country and a tragedy for real people.  I don't understand the impulse to give a tax cut and to hurt people when we know that is going to be the case. And again, these are not welfare recipients; these are your friends and neighbors.  In all of our States, almost two-thirds of the nursing home residents are on We are not going to be able to cut Medicaid in the dramatic way that has been proposed without affecting those people.  I hope this body will take the time necessary to analyze this issue, to openly debate it, to argue about it, and to find solutions that make sense and will work for the people of America, not try to ram something through for the purpose of checking a box on a campaign promise made years ago.  The reality is, we have an obligation, in my view, not only to solve the problem in a compassionate and rational and efficient way but also to develop and run a process here that respects the institution and respects the American people.  This is not the way this place is supposed to run--to have a bill drafted in secret, brought to the floor within hours or a few days of voting, and then force a vote without the kind of consideration, hearings, input, argument, and debate that is supposed to be the hallmark of this institution.  This is a very important decision, I think one of the most important any of us will ever make. I, for one, am going to be able to tell my children and grandchildren that I stood for Maine, for our children, for our elderly, for our disabled people. And when the chips are down, the United States Senate is going to do the right thing.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis).

10121,topic-id,1609,"Mr.Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Deutch), my colleague, for yielding. It is an honor to join him this evening to discuss the cause and mission that is very close to my heart.  As many of my colleagues know, I was injured back in 1980, as a young police cadet, when I was accidentally shot and paralyzed in the police locker room when a police officer's gun accidentally discharged. So, the cause of finding a cure and better treatments for spinal cord injuries and supporting family members as caregivers of people with spinal cord injuries has, again, been a passion of mine and mission for many years.  In late 2001, it was my privilege to join Christopher and Dana Reeve, two very dear friends of mine whom I got to know very well over the years, in announcing the creation of the Paralysis Resource Center, or the PRC, which was officially established in 2002 as part of the Christopher and Dana Reeve These were two remarkable individuals, as I said, I got to know and who became friends of mine over the years.  I can remember back when Christopher Reeve was paralyzed in his horse riding accident and how, instead of being quiet and introverted and just dealing with his recovery, he made it his mission to call attention to the cause of spinal cord injuries and the need for further research to be done and support services to be provided. He was an amazing inspiration to me because he gave voice and was a face of spinal cord injuries and the work that needed to be done to find a cure.  Because of his work and that of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, we are getting closer and closer every day to finding a cure for spinal cord injuries; and we are getting closer and closer every day to providing support for better quality of life for people with disabilities and paralysis and further support for the families of those who care for people with disabilities, especially those with spinal cord injuries.  In 2009, I was so proud to support the enactment of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, which formally authorized some of the programs that have led to the success of the This center has grown to include a network of information specialists, a number of veterans programs, a Peer and Family Support Program, a substantial Quality of Life Grants Program, and a neurorecovery rehabilitation network.  It really is an inclusive center. It conveys the message that people dealing with spinal cord injuries or nerve-related conditions are not alone, that there are people and organizations around them who care and are willing to give the advice and counsel support that they need. So whether you are living with paralysis or you are the caregiver of a loved one who is paralyzed, the PRC provides resources and information to help serve the specific needs of those affected by spinal cord injuries.  We know there are more than 43 million caregivers in the U.providing support to loved ones with chronic disabling conditions on a variety of disabilities, whether it is a sick child or a[[Page H6208]]sick parent or, in particular, those living with spinal cord injuries and paralysis.  Reports estimate that the annual economic value, if we had to put a price tag on this uncompensated care of family caregivers, to be somewhere approximately at the level of $470 billion annually--$470 billion annually, if we had to put a dollar figure on this uncompensated care. That is more than the total Medicaid spending was in 2013. That is when this study was done and those statistics were made public.  The benefits of family caregiving, of course, are plentiful and it is what families do for one another. If you have a sick child or a sick parent or a loved one, families so often step up to the plate and they provide that uncompensated care. Again, it is what families do. But, at the same time, it can also take an emotional, mental, and physical toll.                              {time}  2030  As a result, respite is the most frequently requested support service among family caregivers. Respite is that little bit of assistance where you have someone coming in to give the caregiver a break during the course of a week. Maybe it is an hour or two a day or a few hours during the course of a week that can make all the difference in allowing the caregiver themselves to go to the doctor or go do their grocery shopping, the things that are important to the rest of the family, or bringing a child to a baseball game or soccer practice; again, just those little everyday things that maybe we often take for granted that a family caregiver may not be able to do but for the fact that they have respite coming in. As a result, respite is, again, the most frequently requested support services among family caregivers.  Supported by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, the Lifespan Respite Care Program, which I helped to create back in 1996 with then-Congressman Mike Ferguson, a Republican from Pennsylvania, it was a bipartisan effort in creating this program, which operates now in 35 States and the District of Columbia, complements the PRC's efforts to help paralyzed individuals achieve a high quality of life by ensuring that caregivers who help them also receive relief and care, again, and support themselves.  Access to respite services has been shown to promote caregiver health and well-being, promote family stability, reduce the likelihood of abuse and neglect, and delay or even avoid the need for admission to costlier, long-term institutional settings, resulting in significant savings for the healthcare system and ultimately taxpayers, but ultimately helping the loved one who needs the care receive better care, because the loved one providing the care gets the support and the break that they need.  So beyond supporting access to respite for caregivers, we know the PRC's services and programs have touched the lives of people across the country, including those residing in the Ocean State, where I am from in Rhode  For instance, Sarah Galli of Rhode Island spoke about her brother, Jeff, who was injured in 1998, and I would like to share her impactful words on the importance of the PRC now. She wrote:  ``July 4, 1998, was the day that my family changed forever. My healthy, strong, athletic 17-year-old brother dove into the shallow end of a swimming pool and was rendered a high-level quadriplegic.  ``Each Independence Day that followed has been a reminder of how quickly and irrevocably Jeff had his physical independence taken from him. It is also a reminder of how grateful I am for the support that has enveloped my family with care.  ``I can't speak for my brother's experiences as a quad. That is his story to tell. But here is mine. In the years following his accident, I have counted on the Paralysis Resource Center and the Reeve Foundation for support. I have referred friends and strangers to them who require information and advocacy.  ``And as a theater major in college, I started a student cabaret, Born for Broadway, that expanded an annual gala in the years since, raising awareness and funds for paralysis organizations, including And I have also picked up the phone on several occasions to call the PRC and cry. Sometimes you just need to know that you are not alone.  ``A friend of mine, Reeve supporter Jeff Ruben, wrote a song about a pal who lives with paralysis, using the lyrics, `I believe in miracles.'  ``I don't believe in miracles, but I do believe in And I believe in Do you?''  Mr.Speaker, we know the PRC's network of support remains strong to this day. When another Rhode Islander, 21-year-old Jack Calbi, was injured in a mountain bike accident this past April and left paralyzed from the chest down, the PRC immediately reached out to Jack's family to discuss the array of resources available.  Nearly 6 million Americans live with paralysis, depend on robust services and supports, respite for caregivers that love them, and a continued investment in the science and innovation that will lead to the treatments and cures of tomorrow.  The PRC has become a beacon of hope for so many. And as my dear friend Christopher Reeve said, ``Once you choose hope, anything is possible.''  Christopher and Dana Reeve were friends of mine. I miss them dearly. They truly did provide hope to me and millions of others, whether affected by paralysis or some other nerve disorder or disabilities in general, or the families that are affected by this condition as well. They made a difference, as has the I am grateful for their work and I am grateful for all the efforts to keep the PRC going strong so that they can continue to help those living with paralysis, their families, and for those who may be affected in the future.  And together I know that one day, because of all the efforts that are going on through amazing research right now, as we get closer step by step every day to finding a cure for spinal cord injuries, that families will know that they are not alone, that we are in this together, and that PRC and the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation are helping us to one day get one step closer to finding the cures and those treatments that we so desperately look for.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for raising attention to this issue and for yielding to me.  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgH6207.txt,1668,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,24.0,July
10276,topic-id,763,"Madam President, today I will vote for Sonny Perdue to be the next Secretary of Governor Perdue, with his lifetime of experience with farming and agribusiness, stands out as one of the few nominees to this Cabinet who appears well qualified for the position to which he has been nominated.  But to lead the U.Department of Agriculture, USDA, and American agriculture, Governor Perdue must represent the broad spectrum of interests before USDA and do all he can to hear from all sides because this truly is the ``People's Department.'' USDA touches the lives of every American, in many ways that include but go far beyond farming itself. This Department's workforce is spread across all 50 States and another 99 countries.  I hope that Governor Perdue will continue the important work that Secretary Vilsack diligently led for the last 8 years, to help USDA look forward to addressing the changing needs of agriculture and rural We must stand by our rural communities, communities that, thus far, seem to be forgotten by this administration. These small towns desperately need USDA's help to access broadband, to make critical infrastructure improvements to their water and wastewater systems, and to support new rural businesses.  I also hope that he succeeds in elevating the status of USDA among government agencies in an administration that appears to have forgotten about both this Department, as well as the rural communities that depend on its work. I am hopeful that, as the President's top adviser on matters of agriculture, rural development, safe and affordable food, the role of immigration in our farm labor needs, research, agricultural trade, and countless other issues, he will carefully provide advice that reflects good judgment and independence from the President and respect for the law.  I was grateful when Mr.Perdue said in his confirmation hearing that he would be a voice and an advocate for agriculture at the highest levels of government. As I reminded him at his hearing and in our private meeting, he must represent all of agriculture. This includes not only the farmers he has gotten to know during his tenure as Governor of Georgia, but also our new and beginning farmers, organic farmers, Vermont's dairy farmers, those selling directly to consumers or focused on local food systems, those trying to develop new markets for energy crops, as well as researchers promoting new farm practices, forestry opportunities, and sustainable practices. He must also stand up for our hungry and malnourished families, both here and abroad, and for consumers who want to know that their food is safe to eat and grown in responsible ways.  This Department's work is vast and far-reaching--from helping those with the least, to stewarding Federal forest and range lands, combating climate change, ensuring food safety, conserving water and wildlife, and preserving farmland, to researching new technologies, feeding young school children healthy meals, advancing international trade, supporting rural communities and housing, and ensuring fair and competitive markets for farmers.  I do have concerns about some of Mr.Perdue's past statements and positions. I am concerned that he continues to question broadly accepted science regarding the role of humans in the mounting climate crisis. I don't feel that every question has been answered related to past ethical issues. I have heard from many Vermonters concerned not so much with the policies and positions of Mr.Perdue himself, but who are alarmed by this administration overall. Some Vermonters fear that Mr.Perdue will not fully defend our vital social programs and environmental regulations. I do appreciate that, in his confirmation hearings, he said that he recognizes that as Secretary he must work hard to improve the lives of the least among us and that he knows that it is our responsibility to leave the land better than we found it.  In these challenging times for agriculture and our rural communities, I call on Governor Perdue to provide a loud voice of reason and a thoughtful balance within what continues to be an undisciplined and impulsive administration led by a President who continues to put forward extreme proposals, such as budget cuts that would starve small towns and communities of jobs and opportunity and have a disproportionate impact on small towns, and the rest of the Cabinet appears in many cases to have very little understanding or interest in the needs of rural  As a chairman and most senior member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee as we begin to write the next Farm Bill, and as vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I look forward to working closely with Mr.Perdue in his new role.

The bill, in fact, does weaken critical screening of potential CBP officers, and our country actually should be working to increase the security relative to CBP is essential. It is our first line of defense to stop terrorists, to stop drugs, to stop dangerous persons coming in, and we should not weaken our standards.  Now, the overwhelming majority of CBP officers are honest, hardworking public servants. Crime and corruption has, however, been a persistent problem for the agency. Numerous CBP officers have been found to have strong connections to organized crime, including drug cartels. They are in prison now.  In many cases, cartels try and infiltrate the CBP by recruiting people to apply for CBP positions. This results in illicit drug smuggling and other dangerous activities.  In 2015, the CBP Integrity Advisory Panel found that--and this is a quote--``arrests for corruption of CBP personnel far exceed, on a per capita basis, such arrests at other Federal law enforcement agencies.''  In 2016, this same panel observed that ``corrupt CBP law enforcement personnel pose a national security threat.'' And it recommended that the current polygraph test be expanded, not reduced.  Now, this bill allows for an exemption for local law enforcement and former members of the Armed Forces from the polygraph requirement. For example, if a polygraph has been taken in the prior 10 years, I think it is a mistake to think that that will protect us.  In fact, the Inspector General at DHS, John Roth, advises against this bill. He explained that the polygraph changes, including this legislation--and this is a quote--``could put CBP at significant risk.''  He says: ``While it may sound reasonable to say you could waive requirements from former military personnel because they have passed a polygraph, Border Patrol agents work in a different environment that is not as controlled as the military.''  Now, it is important to note that, of the applicants for the CBP, two-thirds fail the polygraph test. That may be a concern, but we ought to be glad that people who are a risk are not actually hired by the  I will just note that the Government Accountability Office advises that, between 2005 and 2012, there were 2,170 reported incidents of arrest of CBP personnel for misconduct. That is about one arrest a day of CBP officials.  CBP's own Integrity Advisory Panel, and these are law enforcement experts, outside law enforcement experts, concluded in 2015 that ``there is data indicating that arrests for corruption of CBP personnel far exceed, on a per capita basis, such arrests at other Federal law enforcement agencies.'' And in its final report, that panel recommended that the current polygraph testing be expanded to include postemployment tests that are best practices at the FBI and agencies in the U.intelligence service.  Now, I will just give you some examples that are real life examples from CBP, and this is from the agency itself. These are individuals who could be exempted.

10172,topic-id,1877,"Mr.President, I came to speak on a different subject and will not speak at length about the healthcare bill because this Senator has spoken on a number of occasions about the healthcare bill. Suffice it to say, in light of what the majority whip has just said; that if we really did want to seek a bipartisan solution to the healthcare situation in expanding healthcare for as many people as we possibly can, then what we do, in a bipartisan way, is start saying: We have a current law. Let's fix what needs fixing.  This Senator can say there are a number of discussions going on between Democratic Senators and Republican Senators about doing just that--about such items as a reinsurance fund to ensure companies against catastrophe, the likes of which, in a proposal this Senator has filed, has been costed out. In my State of Florida, it would reduce insurance premiums for health insurance 13 percent. Ideas like that--in a bipartisan way--will solve and bring stability to the marketplace. That is why insurance companies, in fact, are being vigorous in their opposition to the Senator Cruz part of the bill that basically destabilizes the market by taking all of the older and sicker people and putting them in one pot and putting the younger and healthier people in another pot, which is exactly the opposite of what the principle of insurance is. The principle of insurance is, you spread the risk over as many people as you can and thereby can bring down the per-unit cost.  If we really wanted to fix it in a bipartisan way, we would be able to, but still, as you can see, there is not the appetite for that in this highly polarized, highly ideological, and highly partisan atmosphere we find ourselves in on this particular topic.                  Protecting the Scientific Community  Mr.President, this Senator came here to talk about another thing that is equally disturbing because there is a blatant, coordinated effort by some elected officials to muzzle the scientific community. When you start muzzling scientists, you don't come up with the facts, and you don't come up with the truth. What is being presented as facts doesn't really match the truth, and certainly the rhetoric doesn't match what is happening.  For example, just last month in the State of Florida, the Florida Legislature passed, and the Governor signed into law, a bill that allows any resident of the State--regardless of whether they have a student in school--any resident can challenge what is being taught in the public schools. So if a single resident objects to a certain subject that students are being taught[[Page S4013]]having to do with science, a subject such as what is happening in the climate and the changes; the fact that the Sun's rays come in and reflect off the Earth and go back--reflect out and radiate the heat back into space--but when you start putting what are known as greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, up there, they suddenly act as a ceiling, a greenhouse gas ceiling having a greenhouse effect, trapping the heat and causing the Earth to heat up. Two-thirds of the Earth is covered with water. Most of that heat is absorbed in the oceans. What happens to water when it is heated? It expands. That is a fact. Sea level rise in South Florida is a fact. It is a measurement over the last 40 years. The seas have risen 8 inches in South That is a fact, but if there are some who object to that climate science, then under this new law just signed by the Governor, they are going to be able to object to that subject being taught in our public schools. A single hearing officer will determine--Lord only knows whom that officer is appointed by--that single person will determine, under the new law, if the objection is justified. They can force a local public school to remove the subject from its curriculum.  Does that sound a little bit strange? Does that sound a little bit scary? It seems like this is the most brazen attack on science we have seen in a long time. It is a blatant attempt to cover up the truth. Instead of accepting the fact that the seas are rising and what is going to be a very real threat--and already is to a coastline like Florida's--they want to literally rip the subject right out of our children's textbooks, while at the same time silencing the teachers and the scientists. I don't think we can sit back and allow our public schools to become political battlegrounds, and we shouldn't allow politicians to silence our teachers and scientists just because they don't happen to like that part of the science.  While this bill was just enacted in Florida, it may be one of the most egregious examples of hiding the truth. Unfortunately, I am sad to report, it is not the only one. In fact, in 2015, Florida's Governor went so far as to reportedly ban State officials from even using the term ``climate change'' in their reports. Doesn't that sound like muzzling? Yet the effect of sea level rise is still painfully evident in South What about the water washing over the curbs on Miami Beach at the seasonal high tide? What about the water that is coming over the streets in the Las Olas section of Fort Lauderdale at the seasonal high tide?  In just a month, the new head of the U.Environmental Protection Agency fired several members of the Board of Scientific Counselors--the very people responsible for overseeing the Agency's science and research programs. These were scientists at the top of their fields working on behalf of the American people, and suddenly, in one fell swoop, the new head of the EPA fired them all and wants to replace them with--you guessed it--industry representatives, scientists from the very industries that the EPA is supposed to monitor and oversee. If this is not what completes the picture of putting the fox in charge of the henhouse, I don't know what is.  The henhouse is not just climate science, but it includes basic research in all fields, including healthcare--By the way, thank goodness we have a head of NIH who is a guy who broke the code on the human genome, It includes the fields of astronomy--how about NASA--and it includes the origin of the universe--quantum physics in multiple agencies.  This disturbing trend of hiding the truth if it doesn't match their rhetoric is a trend that is spreading across all levels of government. If information can't be removed from the public domain altogether, then guess what they try to do: They try to discredit it.  For example, look at what has been done now in an effort to pass this disastrous Republican healthcare bill. Instead of--as I have just made comments preparatory to this science subject--trying to work together on a bipartisan bill aimed at improving our Nation's healthcare system, some on the other side of the aisle have resorted to attacking whom? Attacking the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office after it said that the bill will take healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of people.  The nonpartisan CBO is just that; it is nonpartisan. It is responsible for estimating the costs and effects of nearly every bill that Congress considers. Yet suddenly, when the conclusions of CBO don't match the rhetoric coming from one side, they turn their attacks on the scientists and the mathematicians who release the findings.  Listen to these quotes:  ``I have a lot of questions about the accuracy of the CBO,'' one of our Republican colleagues said here in the  CBO's time has ``come and gone,'' the White House Budget Director said earlier this year.  ``We disagree strenuously with the report,'' HHS Secretary Price said. ``The CBO report's coverage numbers defy logic.''  ``If you're looking at the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place,'' said the Press Secretary at the White  If that is not enough, just last week, the White House itself released a video saying that the CBO's score of the Republican healthcare bill is based on ``faulty assumptions and bad math.''  It is clear what is going on. This administration's war on science is not a myth. It is not fake news. If you want to know an administration's true priorities, you need to look no further than their budget, and if you look at the President's most recent budget request, you will see dramatic cuts to some of our most important scientific agencies. This Senator has seen that in the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee--in the NOAA programs and in the NASA programs.  The President's budget calls for more than a 30-percent cut to It calls for the firing of nearly one-quarter of its staff and the elimination of all funding for programs aimed at fighting climate change. Climate change isn't just about Florida nor is it a coastal State problem; it is a problem of the entire country. The extreme weather events caused by climate change affect us all. Droughts become more frequent, floods become more severe, and major storms like hurricanes and tornadoes become stronger and even more deadly.  The scientists at NOAA, the National Weather Service, NASA, and most of the other agencies, including our military, who study climate change aren't trying to create a mythical problem that doesn't exist. They are trying to solve real-life problems that affect all of us and that affect them in the carrying out of their duties.  They work at Federal agencies across the country with one goal in mind--to make credible, valid data publicly available for researchers, academic institutions, and businesses that use the information to better understand things.  I see the leader is here to speak. I will conclude with just a couple of thoughts.  These scientists know that we can't just stick our heads in the sand. Science doesn't work like that. Facts are facts. And the fact is that the Earth is heating up, and there is a reason for that, which I explained. If we don't do something about it, the communities that are already affected in my State are going to be communities all over the world. These are not alternative facts.  Yet, instead of helping these scientists do their work, some political leaders are using their positions to hide this information and to make it unavailable. We ought to be speaking out against it, and that is what this Senator is trying to do.  I have filed legislation to protect scientists' rights to speak publicly about their research--not to let them be muzzled--and to ensure that all agencies maintain their scientific integrity.  I hope we can stop this nonsense of hiding the truth. Let's stop this war on science. Let's accept facts as they are and then debate the issues, the policy. The American people deserve an open and honest government that works for them, not a government that distorts the truth to match its rhetoric.

10301,topic-id,1211,"Mr.President, I rise with the understanding that the Senate will be voting on a Republican healthcare bill next week, a bill that has been written entirely behind closed doors.  The bill has been hidden from the American people, the press, and, as far as I can tell, almost every I have not been allowed to see it and neither have any of my Democratic colleagues.  I was elected to the Senate in 2014 during the same election that Republicans regained the majority, and I remember a pledge by their leadership that the Senate would return to regular order. Well, regular order means public hearings on legislation. Regular order means committees have a chance to gather input from expert witnesses, consider a policy's potential impact, and amend bills before they come to the floor.  Prior to enacting ObamaCare, the Senate Finance and HELP Committees held nearly 100 hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs on healthcare reform. In the House, where I served at the time, there were over 79 bipartisan hearings and markups that included an opportunity for our Republican colleagues to offer input and amendments in the bill. Dozens of Republican amendments were adopted during the House committee markups of the Affordable Care That is an open process.  What we are seeing now is a bill drafted entirely in secrecy and hidden behind closed doors. But why? Is it because Republicans know that this bill is not a good deal for the American people? You could call the recent process a lot of things, but you can't call it open, and you can't call it regular order.  Supposedly, the bill has been assembled by a working group of 13 of my Republican colleagues, but just yesterday--just yesterday--one of these Members complained that he had not yet seen a draft. In fact, he went on to say--this is a Republican colleague of mine in this working group:       It has become increasingly apparent in the last few days      that even though we thought we were going to be in charge of      writing a bill within this working group, it's not being      written by us. It's apparently being written by a small      handful of staffers for members of the Republican leadership      in the  This quote makes it clear that this working group is--well, it is not working.  When Senators in the majority party are unable to tell you who is writing the bill, let alone what is in the bill, we have a problem. While we clearly have a problem with the secretive, rushed process, this process is a symptom, not the disease. The underlying disease is that this bill, which we reportedly will see tomorrow, is almost certainly terrible for the American people.  There are two explanations for keeping a product under wraps: Either you want to build excitement for it or you are worried about the weaknesses that would be exposed by the daylight. I don't believe for a moment that Republicans are trying to build excitement by hiding this bill. This bill is not next year's model of the Ford Mustang or Chevy Camaro waiting to be unveiled at the Detroit auto show to great fanfare. This bill is like a disaster that will negatively impact millions of This bill is the iceberg that sunk the Titanic, and Republican leadership has turned off the ship's radio and are furiously shoveling coal into the engines.  While the Senate moves full steam ahead to vote next week on a bill we haven't even seen yet, I am worried that my colleagues across the aisle, along with too many political commentators and pundits, are simply asking the wrong questions. They are asking: Will moderate Republicans vote for it? Will the tea party wing support it? Will it take sweetheart deals to get to 51 votes?  Well, folks, this is not a game. This is not about if and how the majority can count to 51 votes and solve their political problems with the far-rightwing base of their party. This is about people's lives.  There are serious policy questions we need to ask, and the American people deserve to have answers. There are questions like these: What are your policy goals here? How do you think this will help people afford quality insurance coverage? What will the bill do for tens of millions of Americans who have gained healthcare coverage in recent years? What will the bill do for patients with preexisting conditions? What will the bill do for the hundreds of thousands of Michiganders covered under the successful Healthy Michigan Program? What will the bill do for small business owners and employees? What will the bill do for seniors who need affordable, long-term care options? What will the bill do for individuals battling opioid addiction? These are questions I am asking, along with all of my Democratic colleagues.  I serve on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and just a few weeks ago we held a hearing on opioid abuse and how the epidemic is simply ravaging our  I had the opportunity to speak with a police chief from our southern border State of He was very clear that if Medicaid expansion were to go away--as we saw in the House bill and expect to see in the Senate bill--it will make it much more difficult for local police departments to tackle this crisis because of dramatically scaled-back[[Page S3675]]availability of addiction treatment. I spoke with a coroner, a medical doctor, and an addiction expert on the panel as well.  These are professionals dealing with a public health crisis each and every day--not people with political agendas. They all agreed that Medicaid expansion is critical to combating addiction, improving public health, and helping individuals suffering from addiction have an opportunity to be productive citizens and have a second chance at life.  The bottom line is that this bill--this secretive, rushed bill that we will supposedly see tomorrow--will move us backward and rip healthcare away from millions of When you take health coverage away from people, people will die.  As a Member of the House, I voted for the Affordable Care Act because I knew that, at the end of the day, it would save people's lives. As elected officials and public servants, there are only a handful of votes we cast that are literally about life and death. Next week, we will see one of those votes.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to read the bill, whenever we get it, and then talk to doctors, patients, families, clinics, and hospitals in their I also urge my colleagues to vote no next week and to start a truly bipartisan process that keeps what works, fixes what doesn't, but, most importantly, helps all Americans afford quality healthcare in their communities.  I stand here ready and willing to be a partner in a bipartisan process and to work with my Republican colleagues to improve our healthcare system.

10304,topic-id,838,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about a promising young man from Wyoming, OH--just outside of Cincinnati, my hometown--a young man whose life was drastically cut short at just 22 years of age. I rise to talk about Otto  Otto had all the smarts and talent you could ever ask for. He was a homecoming king and the salutatorian of the Wyoming High School class he graduated from a few years ago. He spent a summer at the London School of He was a smart kid. He won a prestigious scholarship to study at the University of As everyone expected he would, he excelled at He got great grades. He had a thirst for learning. He loved meeting new people and hearing about their lives and their perspectives. His future was as bright as it could possibly be.  It was this smart, kindhearted young man--a college kid--who was taken prisoner by the North Korean regime for nearly 18 months. Otto's detainment and sentence were unnecessary and appalling. Neither one should have ever happened in the first place. At some point soon after being sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, from what we know, Otto suffered a severe brain injury--from what, we don't know, and we may never know.  Whom did the North Korean Government tell about this? No one. For the next 15 months or so, they kept this a secret. They denied him access to the best medical care he deserved, and they refused repeated requests for consular access that would normally be provided to those who have been detained--requests from our government, from the Obama administration, from the Trump administration, requests from the Red Cross, requests from the Swedish Government, which provides consular service for Americans in North Korea, requests from many of us here in the  The regime unjustly imprisoned him and then lied about his severe medical condition. By the way, they continued to tell stories that make no sense. Doctors at the University of Cincinnati--some of the best doctors in the world and just the type of medical professionals Otto should have been able to see from the start--say that North Korea's claims as to what happened simply don't stand up to the evidence.  They called him a prisoner of war, but they also violated the Geneva For North Korea to imprison Otto Warmbier with no consular access for more than a year with his medical condition and severe brain injury--it goes well beyond that. It demonstrates a complete failure to recognize fundamental human rights. Because of these actions by the North Koreans, Otto is dead. His promise has been cut short.  If there is ever any doubt about the nature of the North Korean regime--that pariah country--then Otto's case should erase all doubt. We know this regime has no regard for the rule of law or the freedoms we enjoy here, but they also have no regard for basic human rights and dignity. They have subjected hundreds of thousands of their own people to mistreatment, torture, and death for decades. They are now extending that treatment to innocent North Korea should be universally condemned for its abhorrent behavior and be held accountable for its actions.  Otto's family--God bless them--tried everything they could to bring Otto home. For 18 months--and for almost 16 months not knowing of his dire condition--they were steadfast and resilient, trying everything they could.  I was there with Fred and Cindy Warmbier when Otto finally returned from North He came home. It was incredibly emotional to watch Otto be reunited with his loving family. I believe he knew he was back home. I believe he knew he was among those who loved him.  I want to thank State Department Special Representative Joe Yun, Deputy Secretary Sullivan, and Secretary Tillerson for their work to help secure Otto's release last week and to bring him home.[[Page S3677]]  There are still three Americans who are being detained by the North They should be released immediately, and we should do everything we can do as a country to secure their release.  Otto's case is a reminder that we must, on the one hand, increase pressure on North Korea to force them to change. There will soon be more to discuss on that. At the same time, we have to maintain an open line of communication to deal with the deadly serious issues we face. Those are some of the lessons I have taken from the last 18 months.  Fred, Cindy, and the entire Warmbier family have been incredibly strong through this ordeal. No one should have to go through what that family has experienced. My wife Jane and I will continue to be at their side, including at the funeral service tomorrow in Wyoming,  I urge my colleagues and everybody listening at home to continue to hold up this family in prayer, but also let's ensure that this tragedy is a wake-up call about the true nature of this brutal regime.

10289,topic-id,2492,"As a proud resident of Rhode Island and proud resident of Providence Plantations, I thank the Chair for the recognition.  Mr.President, I want to join my colleagues in expressing strong opposition to the Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to ask my Republican colleagues to abandon these efforts. They are crafted behind closed doors, and they embrace a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of the most vulnerable among us.  Indeed, I implore Republicans to work with us on a bipartisan basis, in good faith, to make improvements to our healthcare system. We can make these improvements. I hope we can.  Just a couple of weeks ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office told us that 23 million Americans would lose health insurance under Let me say that again: 23 million Americans will lose health insurance under the Republican bill. That is more people than live in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, and my home State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations combined--a huge portion of That is a shocking number.  What is worse is that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle plan to dismantle our healthcare system--one-sixth of the country's economy--without so much as a hearing to get input on the bill. Their bill is being written in secret, and from what we can glean of the process the Republicans are employing, we likely will not even see the text in the near future, although I am encouraged that there is some discussion of releasing the text tomorrow. Regardless of whether it is released tomorrow, there has been no deliberate consideration in a hearing. There has been no thoughtful interaction between Republicans and  In sharp contrast, I was a member of the HELP Committee while we drafted the Affordable Care The Senate spent 25 consecutive days in session on consideration of the Affordable Care Act, the second longest consecutive session in the history of the The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which I served on at the time, held more than 47 bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs on health reform. In fact, the HELP Committee considered over 300 amendments over the course of a month-long markup, one of the longest in the history of the  Over half of the accepted amendments were from This bipartisan input, along with testimony and consultation from healthcare organizations representing hospitals, doctors, nurses, and patients, among others, over the course of a year led to a better, more informed bill.  We have a lengthy legislative process for a reason. Yet the Republican leadership--up until this moment at least--continues to write their bill in secret as they look for ways to convince their caucus to support a bill that nearly every major healthcare organization opposes, to say nothing of the 23 million Americans across all of our States who would lose their health coverage, and millions more would seek increased costs because of  I would like to remind everyone that these are real people who will be hurt if we go forward as my Republican colleagues intend to. These 23 million people are all our constituents, our family members, our friends and neighbors. In fact, since the beginning of this year, I have heard from thousands of my constituents from all walks of life, through phone calls, letters, emails, appearances at townhall events, and even those I see out and about shopping around the State or on the airplane to Washington and back to Rhode They have all indicated how they have benefited from the ACA and how TrumpCare could have a devastating impact on their families.  For example, David from Providence, RI, wrote to me to tell me how his life has been affected by the Affordable Care He said:       I don't usually write Senators, actually I've never written      a I have great concerns about my healthcare. I have      a preexisting condition, two heart attacks and open heart      surgery, triple bypass. I had medical issues and needed to      leave my position at a full-time job 3 years ago to get      well. During that leave, the company went chapter 11. I      lost my healthcare and had no income. I was able to      acquire Medical Insurance through the Affordable Care      I started my own design business as a sole proprietor and      worked a second job to make ends meet. My healthcare was      subsidized for two years. I am now successful in my design      business and will be paying back the subsidy for this year      and no longer need the subsidy going forward. I am able to      purchase affordable healthcare through the Health      Connection in Affordable healthcare and the subsidy      were there when I needed it. This allowed me to start my      business and become a successful business/sole proprietor      in It is critical for my continued success to have      access to affordable healthcare and not be judged by      preexisting conditions.  As David describes, the Affordable Care Act gave individuals and families control over their healthcare for the first time. He was able to get the care he needed, regardless of preexisting conditions, and able to start a new business. This is something I have heard a number of times from my constituents.  I have also heard from Andrew and his wife in Little Compton, RI, who decided to strike out on their own and open a dairy farm after the Affordable Care Act was implemented. Andrew said: ``We took this plunge and started a business knowing that the stability of health care was there--we have a four year old daughter--and if it goes away, we are not sure what we will do.''  Time and again, I hear from Rhode Islanders who are now free to take risks and start new businesses and other creative pursuits knowing that they will be able to access affordable healthcare. I ask my Republican colleagues: Do you want to go back to the days when people are locked into their jobs for health insurance? The only reason they are there is for health insurance. Their creativity, their ability to innovate and to invigorate our economy is stifled literally because they need the health insurance. Do you want to discourage your constituents from starting new businesses? Under TrumpCare, people like David, with preexisting conditions, would not have the option, and Andrew and his wife may not have been willing to take on the risk of leaving a job with health insurance to start a new business.  However, as we speak, my Republican colleagues are meeting in secret planning to take away these opportunities. I encourage my Republican colleagues to meet with their constituents, to hear their stories about the They are not unique to Rhode  It is not enough to just ban insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions. The ACA eliminated annual and lifetime limits. In fact, yesterday I bumped into a family--two families--one with an adorable little girl who had a tracheotomy and who was being pushed around in a stroller. She is about 2 or 3 years old. And I met some other children, another young boy named Tim with a tracheotomy. Today I found out that their problem is lifetime limits. These are very young children, 2 years, 3 years old. Most insurance policies, except for the ACA, would have a lifetime limit. Now, you might be able to go buy it, but before these youngsters are 10, 12, or 13 years old, they will not have health insurance for the rest of their life.  So it is not just the preexisting conditions. The ACA eliminated annual and lifetime limits. When I saw those darling children yesterday, I just knew that has to be the law. Otherwise, it is just a matter of time. Maybe in 5 years, maybe in 6 years, but the kind of conditions they have, at some point, they will hit that limit and at some point the insurance company will say: No thanks.  We made those changes in the They are going to be disposed of in the proposals I have seen. The ACA requires coverage of basic healthcare services like maternity care. That is not guaranteed.  Before the ACA, insurance companies would cut off coverage just when it was needed most and priced people with health conditions out of the market. These are not abstract concepts. I hear from constituents each and every day about the importance of the critical consumer protections under the ACA,[[Page S3665]]and TrumpCare would undermine all of these.  Susan from Warwick wrote me to say:       ObamaCare saved my life. Please keep fighting to make      affordable healthcare available to all I was      diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in 2012. I have my own      business and pay for my own health insurance. We always      purchased what we thought was adequate, but I'd reached the      limit on my policy within just a few weeks of cancer      treatment. That left me with huge bills, a need for more      expensive coverage in order to obtain lifesaving treatment .      . . and technically with a ``preexisting condition--cancer.''  Susan knows that insurance doesn't mean much if you are sick and have limits on your care. She goes on to say:       I am horrified by the Republican plan to replace      Health care is not a luxury. It should be available to all. I      never want anyone else to experience the fear I did when my      insurance ran out and I realized the care that could save my      life might not be available to me. Before we found additional      insurance--and jumped through hoops to get it--we looked at      selling the house, emptying our IRAs and savings account to      pay for my care. It would not have been enough.  Cynthia from Woonsocket, RI, wrote to me to tell me about how TrumpCare would undermine care for people like herself with Parkinson's disease. Specifically, Cynthia wrote about how patients with Parkinson's rely on the essential healthcare benefits required under the Affordable Care Act, including rehabilitative services, mental healthcare, and access to prescription drugs. TrumpCare would do away with these benefits.  Cynthia also points out that the average age of diagnosis of Parkinson's is around 60 years old. However, TrumpCare creates an age tax, leading to skyrocketing costs for this very population. Cynthia also said in her letter that one-third of patients with Parkinson's access care through She says TrumpCare puts all of those patients at risk of losing care. As a patient, she knows better than most that without these existing protections, health insurance will not actually cover the care that is needed.  To add more detail on how critical Medicaid can be, especially to seniors, a constituent living in a nursing home in Pascoag wrote to me to say:       I am 101 years old and enjoy every day to the best of my      ability. I am petrified that many of the programs that I rely      on for my health and well-being, indeed my life, will be      reduced or even eliminated. Please protect my access to      DO NOT make Medicaid a block grant to the states.      My daughter is helping me to send this communication to you.      Please do not forsake me.  So I ask my colleagues: How do you intend to protect her access to nursing home care while cutting Medicaid by over $800 billion? Block-granting Medicaid, as Republicans have proposed to do, will reduce Medicaid funding by at least 25 percent over the next decade and leave States unable to maintain current Medicaid programs, leaving behind our most vulnerable.  Indeed, the most significant costs for Medicaid in my State and every other State is nursing home care. It is exactly those men and women, like my constituent from Pascoag, a vigorous 101-year-old, who will be forced to pay more, who will be forced because of cutbacks in service at the facility not to have two or three people on duty but just one. All of that we can foresee, and we only can prevent it if we reject this attempt to replace, to repeal, to undercut affordable care.  Now, this Medicaid crisis is serious, and it is not just going to affect the healthcare sector because we know the pressure is on the States to make up some of this lost funding. It will not just be by transferring funds within healthcare efforts. They will have to go everywhere through their budgets: That is K through 12 education. That is infrastructure. That is law enforcement. That is all the things States and localities do but particularly They will try to plug the gap because they will have people, like I have described who have written me, coming and not just demanding but obviously in need of healthcare, and they will try to respond, but the response will affect our competitiveness, our education systems, our productivity, when you can't fix infrastructure, and it will be a profound impact.  In fact, a significant number of jobs in my State and a significant number of jobs projected for the future are in the healthcare industry. When this significant reduction of resources to the healthcare sector comes about, the jobs will go, too, because without the resources, you will not employ people--you can't employ people.  Let me share a letter from one of my constituents because it succinctly describes what TrumpCare will really mean for this country. Glenn and Paula from Wakefield, RI, shared a letter from their daughter, Gianna, who has type 1 diabetes, saying:       Let me offer you a translation of what your votes mean: I      will die younger and sicker. Probably much sicker. My kids      will have a mother for less of their lives. Your votes are      what will cause this. Because no matter how consciously I      care for myself, no matter how responsible I am, it won't      matter if my insurance refuses to cover me. And it won't      matter for you either, if you are one of the vast majority of      Americans who will end up with a pre-existing condition over      the course of your life. If you think you can simply pay the      costs yourself, you are in for a rude awakening.  These are only a few examples of the letters, calls, and emails I have received from constituents. The response in opposition to TrumpCare has been overwhelming by the very people whom it will impact the most. I hope my colleagues will listen to these concerns, not just the Rhode Island stories I am sharing today but also from their own constituents. People's lives are at stake.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon this effort to pass TrumpCare and start working with us on bipartisan solutions to improve our healthcare system.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

10115,topic-id,4329,"Madam Speaker, today a lot of people are looking at Washington more perplexed than ever, thinking that nothing is getting done here. It is easy for them to think that because, when they turn on their televisions or listen to their radios and listen to news commentators, all they seem to be talking about is some very obscure idea. But something that dominates all the communication, or a great deal of communication, is that Russia in some way altered the outcome of the last election, perhaps--what they have been telling us--the Russians hacked into the system. This is the image we are being given.                              {time}  1815  All those emails that came out during the election from the Democratic[[Page H5043]]National Committee and the Hillary campaign, those emails were, in some way, a product of a Russian conspiracy with the Trump campaign. Over and over and over again, even though all of the experts who we have seen from the intelligence communities on down the line have said that that is bogus; that did not happen; there is no proof that that happened. And many people who are looking into this don't think that the Russians were involved with that hacking at all, much less their involvement in our campaigns in a way that differentiated from every other government in the world, including our own, being involved in trying to impact other people's elections in a light-handed way.  In this situation, the Russian Government has not--again, has not--been proven or even the evidence seems to indicate that they were not involved in a way that actually affected the outcome of our last election. Yet that is all we hear about. That is the massive news coverage, and the American people's attention is being focused on that, or they are being told: Oh, but over in Washington, the Congress is so tied up because of this crisis. We have not been tied up. We have been doing great things here in the Nation's capital, and the Trump administration has been doing great things. We have not been frozen by this unrelenting attack trying to give the American people the idea that the last election was invalid.  This effort to distract us is a disgrace. And I do believe the American people see, when they hear this over and over repeated but there is no substance being told us that indicates the specific crime, the specific hacking incident that happened. No, we have no incidences where any type of Russian interference, in some way, determined the outcome of the last election.  But, of course, the distraction that is taking place is basically covering the fact that we have a group of people who lost the last election who have been disrupting, who have a plan, a program of resistance and disruption of those who did win the election. If there is anything more anti-American than that, I don't know what is. Talk about destroying democracy.  So with that said, what are we doing if we aren't tied up in this Russian problem? And let me note, there has been, even to the point after all the hearings that we had and there is no evidence of it, now some Republicans have gone along with this effort, and we have appointed what was called an independent or a special prosecutor. And now what we can expect is another 3 or 4 months of the headlines on all of the news media except one or two trying to divert our attention. Well, I would ask that the independent counsel and the special prosecutor, they are going to look into Russia, let them not just look into, did our Attorney General have two conversations or three conversations with the Ambassador from Russia to the United States in passing meetings, I might add, other people engaged, instead of asking questions like that and trying to find some way to charge our Attorney General with some sort of crime that he would have committed and maybe perjury even because he forgot about one conversation with someone over a year's time period where there were thousands of conversations with thousands of people, nobody hope--if they can go into detail like that, let us hope that the Clinton Foundation becomes a target of that investigation.  They want to find out what effect the Russians had on our elections. Let's find out what the millions of dollars that went into the Clinton Foundation did that might have helped Hillary's chances of being elected. Let's find out that. And let's find out how much money was actually put into the Clinton family's pockets when former President Clinton, speaking again before Russian oligarchs, was able to receive certain payments, exorbitant payments, from what I understand, we need to know exactly what they were, into his own pocket at the same time Russian oligarchs were putting millions, maybe tens of millions, into the Clinton  So, okay, that needs to be looked at. But I would suggest that the American people need to go beyond this made-up crisis. The American people need to take a look at what we have been accomplishing here, and we have been accomplishing. A healthcare bill passed. And, yes, it is not a perfect healthcare bill, but now we have actually got a bill that is in the system. The Senate is going to have their bill. The system is now working, and there is a healthcare bill going through the system to improve our situation now instead of being stuck with ObamaCare that was so poorly written that people were being priced out of the market of having insurance. And we end up with millions of people who can't afford the health insurance because ObamaCare did what? ObamaCare basically said anybody with a preexisting condition, that risk will be paid for by other health insurance policyholders. And, thus, everybody else's health insurance went way up, and the amount of coverage they got went way down. No, that was not a good way to go, and the Republicans are trying to find a better method.  Let me just note that I have personally been involved with promoting another concept of how we should be dealing with preexisting conditions, and there is a bill circulating now, and hopefully it will be seriously considered. And as the healthcare bill goes through the House and the Senate, maybe we can get this in there, and that is you look at preexisting conditions and you say: okay, that person has a preexisting condition, and right now that preexisting condition puts them into the mix with all the other policyholders. And then everybody else, including that person, picks up the cost of insuring for that preexisting condition, which then prices everybody out. More people end up without insurance, or insurance that they can't cover, or what they are getting for their money is decreased.  My daughter, for example, had leukemia a few years ago. She is 9 years old. And thank God that we got through that and she is now free of leukemia. But I am sure that somewhere along the line what we are going to have is an insurance company saying: Well, you had leukemia, you had a preexisting condition, thus we are going to charge you more money for health insurance. Maybe 10 years down the road this will happen to her, maybe 20. But the fact is that we don't need to have people around our country that are in that situation. My daughter is now cancer free. And if she has a preexisting condition, or anybody else in the country has a preexisting condition, what I am proposing--and there is a bill making its way around, people are considering this as an alternative, and I hope they take it seriously, but we will see, at least we are trying, and the idea is the Federal Government will document all preexisting conditions. My daughter's leukemia would be on that list. And at any time from then on that someone with a preexisting condition has that preexisting condition, if leukemia comes back to her or anyone else who has a preexisting condition that is documented, it will be paid for by Just as simple as that. That condition only. All the rest of her health insurance, however, need not be covered by the Federal Government or anybody else.  Now that the preexisting conditions have not put their amount way up in the cost to buy an insurance, now they will be charged just the same as anybody else who is healthy. But if they break their arm, they are in a car accident, if they have another disease that comes on, they now are insured from that, but they are not having to pay extra insurance because of that preexisting condition, and you just leave that to It is a simple answer. It is not going to cost the taxpayers any more money by doing it any other way. Just let the government take care of those preexisting conditions. All the rest of their healthcare, however, will have to be paid for by that individual. Just the preexisting condition is covered.  So that is a type of reform that we can put into place, and people are talking about these ideas now here. That is why, when the Republican bill passed, it was launching a discussion, an honest discussion, of what we should do. The Senate is going to send us back something, and we will, this year, have a healthcare bill because we will have gone through all of these types of alternatives like the one I just suggested.  We also passed a financial reform bill. It was called the CHOICE It was a financial reform bill that one of[[Page H5044]]the main parts of it actually repealed the Dodd-Frank bill which was so dramatically hard for our economy and was basically making it very difficult for businesses to function in our country, was a terrible burden, and was actually bringing our economy down. So we passed the elimination of the Dodd-Frank Act, and we have reformed our financial community, and that has passed the It is now over to the  We have passed dozens of notable bills, yet the impression we are given, of course, is the only thing happening here is the Russians were, in some way, engaged in the last election, and we must focus totally on that, even though all the committees that investigated this, all the people who came from the various intelligence agencies, no one said, here is the proof that they were colluding with the Trump campaign to defeat the Democratic candidate in the last election.  So people are only getting that story, but there are all kinds of bills that are being passed, legislation being passed here. Like, for example, there was a weather bill that passed. I mean, this is one example. Suzanne Bonamici was someone who had a bill that was attached to the weather bill. It was aimed specifically at trying to have a warning system for tsunami waves that might be created and come not only towards the United States but towards Japan and any other coastal area. That bill passed, and, as I say, it is part of the weather bill now.  And Suzanne Bonamici, of course, is a Democrat, and I am a  The other lie is that Republicans and Democrats can't work together. Well, that is just wrong. People are creating a false image, and I am glad to see, by the elections last night, that the American people aren't falling for the baloney they are being fed.  So was that a good bill, the tsunami bill? I think it was, and it has made it through.  We have other environmentally aimed bills that are making up for the excesses of the last administration that was basically pushing a radical, environmental, globalist approach to environment issues. I think it is a great thing that the President of the United States has withdrawn us from the Paris Agreement, which would have cost us billions of dollars that we would send to other countries and would put us under the jurisdiction of decisions made by international bodies, not by American-elected officials but by international bodies. That was a terrific move on the part of the  In fact, Trump has done a number of wonderful things that he is not getting credit for. Because all the media wants to talk about is how many conversations anybody associated with Trump had with any Russians in the last 2 years. A lot of other things that are happening are important. Those people who are trying to distract us are not succeeding. The fact is that President Donald Trump had a triumphant trip overseas. His first visit was to the Middle  I am a former speech writer for President I didn't write the speech, but I was there when he gave that speech in Berlin telling Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall,'' a speech that made history, not just reflected it but is now seen as a pivotal moment in changing the direction of what was going on with the Cold                              {time}  1830  I might say, I didn't write it, but I did make sure that I was one of the people who smuggled that speech into the President's hands. After the President was given that speech and said he was going to say that, all of his senior advisers tried to convince him not to say, ``tear down this wall.'' And ``Mr.Gorbachev, tear down this wall,'' was a phrase in history that made history. And Ronald Reagan stood up against all of the people on the left who were attacking him and even all of his own advisers. That made a huge difference in the world that we live in.  Now, let me just note this. We have a President now, President Donald Trump, who went to Saudi Arabia and went to a meeting with the leaders of that part of the world. He talked to them--and these were Muslims, of course. And he said to the Muslim world that, if there is going to be peace with the United States, drive the terrorists out of your mosque; drive the terrorists out of your country.  I haven't been as proud of any President since I was with Ronald Reagan when he said ``tear down this wall'' than I was proud of our President, President Donald Trump, for telling the Islamic world that they have got to disassociate themselves, they have got to drive the terrorists out of their families and out of their relationships with good and decent Muslims, who are the vast majority of the Muslims in the world.  So, with that said, I think there is a lot going on that is good. There are good things. This is a good report. I hope the American people pay attention.  There are a lot of creative ideas that are going on. These I just told you about, healthcare and finance reform, these are really important things. And the fact that we are not putting everything in the hands of the United Nations or some unelected government to tell us what we have to do in the name of the environment, that is good, too.  Well, I have got a few creative ideas that I have actually presented. I thought I would just let my colleagues know, let my constituents know, and let the rest of the country know, these are some issues on the table that I have personally put on.  I think I have a good chance, for example, of getting into the tax bill a provision that is now written out in H.1792, the Expanding Employee Ownership  What my bill suggests is that we should have more involvement by working people in their own companies. Let them own part of their companies so that the bosses and the laborers work together as a team rather than looking at each other as adversaries.  My bill, H.1792, is being considered for the tax bill that we are putting together. What it says, very simply, is that, if an employer gives to his employees--it has to be a general distribution--stock in that company, the employees don't have to pay income tax on it. And if they keep that stock for 10 years, they don't have to pay capital gains tax.  So what we have now is a major boost of people keeping their good employees, a better working relationship, more productivity, and management more concerned about their laborers because now their laborers own stock in the company--maybe even 10 or 20 percent of the stock at some point. What we have is a bill that has a chance, and it is being considered. That is the type of thing that is going on here.  People are talking about new ideas. For example, I talked about the idea of a new healthcare reform bill and my approach and what I am doing to promote that price for people with preexisting conditions. That is another example, ideas that are being discussed, legislation that is going through, and people are trying to mold it. That is part of the legislative process.  Also, when you talk about Republicans and Democrats working together, we are being told we don't work together. Well, we do. Republicans and Democrats work together, just like I did on the tsunami bill. We actually have a good relationship--many of us do.  Nowhere is that more evident than in my leadership of H.975, which is a bill that is entitled, Respect State Marijuana What this bill does is--over the years, in the last 6 years, I have been joined with a It is Mr.Blumenauer now, and it used to be Congressman Farr when he was with us. We were able to put into the appropriations bill for the Department of Justice a provision, an amendment to the bill that said: No money in this bill can be used by the Department of Justice to supersede the State laws on medical marijuana in those States that have legalized the use of medical marijuana.  So, for the last 5 and 6 years, that has been a totally bipartisan effort. I am a Republican, obviously, and I have been joined by Mr.Farr and, now, Mr.We have actually created a situation where we now have people who are getting involved in researching medical marijuana.  By the way, did you know that Israel now, finally, has stepped forward and has done research in the last 10 years? We haven't. The United States hasn't. In fact, for 100 years, when we should[[Page H5045]]have been trying to find the medical uses of marijuana, it has been virtually outlawed. And now Israel has found wonderful applications for medical marijuana.  They also, by the way, when they were studying the effects of marijuana, have legalized it for personal use, for adult use of marijuana, as well as medical marijuana.  Well, what does that tell you? That tells you that some of the people who have been telling us, ``oh, we can't do this because it is going to have a serious impact,'' Israel studies this closely, especially when it might have a military implication. This would not destroy their military; otherwise, they would not have passed this major reform in their country.  Now, why is it that marijuana is an important issue and it brings Republicans and Democrats together? We have limited resources here. The idea that we are going to spend billions of dollars not on protecting Americans from terrorists, not from trying to get bad guys--rapists and murderers--in our local area; no, we are going to spend billions of dollars on police, on jailers, on lawyers, on judges, and on prisons. And then we are going to take people out of the workforce. We are spending billions of dollars so somebody will not smoke a weed in their backyard.  And what is even worse, we are telling them we are going to spend billions of dollars to prevent you. If you find that there is a medical use for marijuana, like for senior citizens who have lost their appetites after a major operation--which happened to my mother, by the way. I did not give her marijuana, but I knew when I was feeding her that she had lost her appetite after a major operation. I said to myself: Why can't she have cannabis here? Well, now people know about that.  There is no reason for us to prevent our seniors from having some euphoria when they are 85 years old in a senior citizens home, especially if it brings back their appetite and they feel better because of it rather than drinking. Do they want to have them all drinking?  Well, this is not just for seniors. This is for people who have medical problems. It has been documented to have important uses. And again, no one has ever overdosed with marijuana, ever.  In terms of what we need to do and what we need to focus on are drugs that are harmful. We have an opioid addiction problem now. Doctors have been giving prescriptions for this. We need to confront that and confront other challenges in crime rather than billions of dollars to try to prevent someone from hurting themselves.  If an adult wants to consume cannabis--an adult--it is their business. For the government to intrude, especially the Federal Government, after a State has legalized it, this is tyranny. Our Founding Fathers did not believe that we should have police forces and criminal justice operating at the State--they believed it should happen at the State and local level, not the Federal level.  These current restrictions that we have, we have people, unfortunately, again, that are living in the past. All they can remember is the sixties when hippies were smoking dope, and it was just literally a counterculture--counter our culture. And I say ``our culture'' because I have more of a conservative family background.  Although I lived a life in my past and I had too much to drink at times, and maybe even when I was younger, maybe I tried cannabis a couple of times, but I have had an adulthood since I was 23 that I think meets the approval of my parents and, in particular, my dad, who was a lieutenant colonel in the  So with that said, had I been arrested, let's say, where some of my friends or something were consuming marijuana when I was around, what would have happened to my life? And what is happening to the lives of all of these people, especially in our less affluent areas, who can't afford the legal protections of hiring a lawyer right away?  It is destroying their ability to function in our society. We should not be taking people who are involved in an activity like consuming a weed. Adults should be able to make that decision for themselves. Sending police for someone like that or expending billions of dollars or ruining the life of that young person who can't afford, whether Black, Chicano, or Caucasian, who can't afford a lawyer to get them off and expunge their record, it is going to affect them the rest of their life. We can't be doing that. It is a waste of money.  We have a chance now, with bipartisan support, to pass this amendment again, perhaps. We are trying to get that onto the appropriations bill for the Department of Justice, which would then keep in place those restrictions on the Federal  But I have a bill, again, with bipartisan support, that would make that across the board. It just says that every State that has legalized the use of marijuana, that none of the departments and agencies of the Federal Government should supersede. They should be treated just like someone selling alcohol or whatever. And, in fact, if they do, they will be asking for ID cards from people to make sure that they are not selling to juniors, to people who are minors, rather than to adults, just like beer.  Unfortunately, when it is illegal, it is easier to get marijuana than it is--for someone who is not 18 or 21, it is easier for them to get marijuana than beer because they don't have to show their ID card at the liquor store.  So with that said, there is bipartisan support for my bill. I am hoping that we can get it passed this year or next year, at least in this session of  And then, finally, we have lots of things going on here. I just discussed several creative things that are being discussed around town. And we have got a President of the United States who is opening the door which was guarded by basically a very far-leftwing philosophy for the last 8 years. The door of government in this country now is open to working people, where this President has committed himself to trade policies and others that are aimed at creating jobs for the American people, ordinary jobs.  One of the things that he has promised us to protect the American people and our American workers is to stop the massive flow of illegals into our country. The massive flow of illegals into our country is bringing down the standard of living of working people.  There is one idea that I have presented. When he wants to build a wall, we have the means to provide the resources to build that wall in a very creative way. It wouldn't cost the American people anything.  So I would hope that those who are listening who like some of these ideas don't get depressed about what they are hearing in the news. Good things are happening in Washington, and a lot of new creative ideas are being discussed.

He also helped found the Coachella Valley Boys and Girls Club, which has grown to five clubhouses serving thousands of children across the valley.  This is just a small part of the incredible work he did as a philanthropist and community leader throughout his life.  Mr.Marguleas was very special to me and my family in a very deeply personal way. He gave my father, Gilbert, the chance in life that transformed our entire family.

10159,topic-id,2090,"Mr.Speaker, today, exactly 100 years ago, on this very floor, the United States declared war on Imperial Germany and entered the First World War on the side of the The decisions that led to that monumental declaration forever changed America's destiny, economy, military, foreign policy, and culture.  Today also marks the beginning of our National Centennial remembrance of America's service in World War I for the sacrifices made by all Americans and for the more than one-quarter of a million American casualties, including over 100,000 dead, most of whom were lost in a mere 6-month period from May to November 1918.  By the war's end, my great-grandfather and his three brothers would all serve. My great-grandfather's brother, my great-uncle, Frank Chamberlain, was killed in action. This is his pipe that he was carrying when he was killed in France, his dog tags, and his uniform insignia that I was able to inherit from my great-grandfather.  He lays peacefully in France under a white marble military gravestone, a scant, faceless hint of the man who was once filled with laughter and humor, who held dreams, hopes, and goals for the future. Frank was 19 years old.  On April 6, 1917, our country was forever changed, and it began right here on this very floor. It is only fitting, Mr.Speaker, that we give remembrance to its beginning here today. I am indeed indebted to the fine work of Eric Setzekorn of the United States Army's Center of Military History for his material from ``Joining the Great War,'' which forms the basis for today's remembrance.       After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of      Austria on the 28th of June 1914, which led to the military      mobilization across Europe and declarations of war by early      August, most Americans took solace that the Atlantic Ocean      shielded the United States from the conflict. The Chicago      Herald summed up the popular support for isolation from      Europe's strife in its article that said: ``Peace-loving      citizens of this country will now rise up and tender a hearty      vote of thanks to Columbus for having discovered America.''       Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium brought Great Britain      into the war and divided Europe into two great camps. Britain      joined France and Russia to form the Triple Entente, more      commonly referred to as the Allied Opposed to them      were Germany and Austria-Hungary, making up the Central            President Woodrow Wilson believed that the immoral nature      of European politics created entangling alliances that      transformed a regional conflict into a global war that      threatened world peace. The President delivered a Declaration      of Neutrality to this very Congress on the 19th of August      1914, calling on all citizens to remain ``impartial in      thought, as well as in action.'' However, between late 1914      and early 1917, the escalating conflict tested American      traditions of isolationism as it threatened to draw the      Nation closer to the war.       The initial German offensive against France ended in      September at the Battle of the Marne, after which both sides      attempted a series of flanking maneuvers to gain the      advantage. Neither side proved capable of overcoming the      killing power that machine guns and rapid-firing artillery      brought to the defensive, and the battle lines all along the      Western Front stabilized in a vast system of trenches      stretching from Switzerland all the way to the English      This was a new type of warfare, with soldiers      subjected to prolonged stress and danger, with little chance      for daring heroics or martial glory.       Behind the trenches, the development of sophisticated      supply systems that were able to support millions of men and      massive levels of firepower and the ability to rush reserves      to block any potential enemy breakthrough led to a vicious      stalemate.       On the broad expanses of the Eastern Front, Germany and      Austria were locked in a brutal war of attrition with Russia,      where logistics and artillery shells counted far more than      bravery.       To break through the deadlock, the combatants attempted to      smash through enemy[[Page H2778]]     lines with ever larger offensives. Attacks in 1915 saw tens      of thousands of soldiers and hundreds of artillery pieces      deployed along only a few miles of the front, trying to win      through sheer weight of numbers and ordnance. The result was      thousands of dead and gains measured in yards after weeks of      constant fighting.       Poison gas, first used by the Germans in April 1915 and      later adopted by every nation, added to the daily misery and      danger. By 1916, as the industrial economies of Germany,      France, and Britain became fully geared toward war      production, battles increased in scale and destructiveness.      In the fight of the fortress of Verdun between February and      December, the French and Germans suffered more than 1 million      casualties combined.       On the first day of the Somme Offensive on the 1st of July      1916, the British and French fired more than 2 million      artillery shells into the German lines in support of 19      divisions attacking along only a 20-mile front. Despite this      colossal weight of numbers, the British alone suffered 57,000      casualties on the very first day and did not break the German      defenses. By the time the Somme ended in mid-November, all      sides had suffered more than a combined 1 million casualties,      while the front moved fewer than 10 miles. As a result,      Verdun and the Somme became synonymous with the slaughter and      destruction that defined the Western       As the stalemate in France continued, U.political and      public opinion began to shift from neutrality toward support      for the German atrocities in Belgium, at times      exaggerated by Allied propaganda, shocked many      Additionally, in early 1915, the Germans began an effort to      isolate the British Isles by using submarines, known as      Unterseeboote, or U-boats, to attack British merchant      shipping.                              {time}  1215       The German campaign, which consisted of the unrestricted      sinking of any merchant vessel bound for Britain, was      portrayed by American newspapers as a cowardly and immoral      method of warfare.       On the 1st of May 1915, a German U-boat sank the British      liner RMS Lusitania, killing 1,198 men, women, and children,      including 128 American citizens onboard. After the attack,      The New York Times called on President Wilson to ``demand      that the Germans shall no longer make war like savages drunk      with blood.''       Fearing that such action could pull the United States into      the war, and concerned over British violations of American      shipping rights, President Wilson continued his policy of      neutrality. Seeking to take the moral high road, he      proclaimed: ``There is such a thing as a man being too proud      to fight . . . There is such a thing as a Nation being so      right that it does not need to convince others by force that      it is right.''       However, after the Germans sank the French passenger ferry      SS Sussex in March 1916, Wilson threatened to break off      diplomatic relations with In May, the Germans      pledged to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare, though      they reserved the right to attack legitimate targets such as      armed merchant ships or those vessels carrying war materiel.       As Germany's submarine campaign damaged its relations with      the United States, America's economic relationship with      Britain and France expanded. Faced with a war of attrition,      the Allies relied on agricultural and industrial resources to      support their war efforts.       Despite a British blockade that severely cut American      commerce and its friendly relations to the former central      powers, U.trade with Europe more than doubled from 1913 to      1917. U.companies not only provided civilian goods, but      also war materiel. Bethlehem Steel alone supplied the Allies      with over 20 million artillery shells between 1914 and 1918,      while major weapons manufacturers like Remington and      Winchester sold rifles and guns. Allied governments relied      heavily on the U.banking industry for billions in loans to      finance their war.       Despite the United States' growing economic ties to the      Allies, the American public still preferred that the Nation      remain neutral. The British Government's brutal suppression      of the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland angered many Americans--     and certainly, Irish Americans--as did its continued      violation of American neutral shipping rights through its      blockade of       As the casualty list grew during 1916, most Americans were      thankful that they had not been drawn into the carnage      engulfing       In November 1916, President Wilson won reelection by a      narrow margin, largely on the slogan, ``He kept us out of      war.'' However, circumstances changed rapidly in early 1917.      Many Americans began to volunteer for the French, great      Britain or Canada, like my Uncle       Germany's increasingly desperate strategic situation led to      a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare on the 31st of      January 1917. This action broke the earlier pledge of the      Germans to respect passenger shipping and convinced President      Wilson to break diplomatic relations with Germany on the 3rd      of February 1917.       Soon after, the British Government provided Wilson an      intercepted communication from the German foreign secretary,      Arthur Zimmermann, to the German envoy in In the      telegram, Zimmermann proposed that if the United States      joined the war on the Allied side, Germany and Mexico should      enter into an alliance. In return, Mexico, by taking up arms      against the United States, would receive from Germany      supplies, financial assistance. Once a victory was achieved,      Mexico could claim territory in Texas, New Mexico, and            The State Department released the telegram to the      Associated Press on the 28th of February, and the American      public opinion turned sharply, as many became convinced of      German duplicity and aggressive intentions. No longer was the      war seen as simply a horrific folly by the European powers,      but rather as a clear indication of the danger of unchecked      militarism.       With the abdication of the Russian czar in February 1917      and the rise of a provisional representative government,      Americans came to see the war as a struggle that pitted      democracies against aggressive, authoritarian imperialists.       Faced with this clear contrast, President Wilson addressed      this very floor on April 2, 1917, in a joint session of      Congress declaring his desire that: We shall fight for the      things which we have always carried nearest our hearts--for      democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to      have a voice in their governments, for the rights and      liberties of small nations, for universal dominion of right      by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and      safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.       On the 6th of April--100 years ago today, where I am      standing--with concrete evidence of German hostility to the      United States, to international peace, and to liberal      democracy, Congress of the United States declared war on       The first act of war committed on Germany was executed that very day, when the United States Army's 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry marched from Fort Jay, New York, to Hoboken, New Jersey, boarded and seized the German ships in the harbor and interned the German crews. I had the privilege to command the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry in Iraq in 2003-2004.  Among the ships seized that day on April 6, 1917, was the SS Vaterland, a luxury liner later renamed the USS This luxury transport would send 10 percent of all doughboys to France and bring a great many of them home as well.  The last American World War I veteran was Frank Buckles, who enlisted from Oakwood, Oklahoma, in August of 1917. He died only 6 years ago, in February 2011, at age 110.  I had the privilege to know a great many World War I veterans. The last time I saw my great-grandfather was when I came home on leave as a young Army captain. As we had a very pleasant visit and it came to a close and I had to go, he told me: ``Don't go yet. I want to give you something.''  He returned from his bedroom with some items in a cigar box that I remember looking at as a kid. He said: ``I want you to have these.''  I said: ``I can't take these, grandpa. Those were your brother's.''  He said: ``You will take them because I know you will keep Frank's memory alive.''  He was right. They have been displayed by me ever since, wherever I have been.  As we reflect today on the declaration of war 100 years ago on this very spot in 1917 that began the United States entry into World War I, let us embark on a national centennial remembrance for all Americans of that day who sacrificed so much for our They are all gone now, but as long as we who knew them have breath and remember them, they will live.

10094,topic-id,360,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule providing for the consideration of H.2213, the Anti-Border Corruption and Reauthorization Act of 2017.  As someone who has spent their entire career and adult life in law enforcement, I know full well the importance of being able to hire quality men and women to provide for the security of our communities and our Nation at large.  H.2213 simply provides the Border Patrol and U.Customs a tool in their[[Page H4662]]hiring toolkit to expedite the hiring of those who have already held some of our Nation's highest positions of public trust and who have already undergone the most thorough vetting available.  It allows Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have served in good standing for more than 3 years and who have undergone a polygraph exam to be eligible to have their CBP preemployment polygraph waived in order to expedite their hiring.  As a former sheriff who mandated--I mandated preemployment polygraphs in my own department. I have full confidence in thoroughness of the vetting conducted by State and local law enforcement agencies prior to hiring an officer. Those exams do not need to be duplicated by CBP in order to hire a prospective officer or agent who has already been vetted by their local department and has a proven track record of performance.  If CBP finds derogatory information on an applicant whose polygraph has been waived, then they still have the authority to conduct their standard CBP polygraph to determine whether that applicant should, in fact, be hired.  This bill does not lower standards. I want to say that again. This bill does not lower standards. It merely takes a commonsense approach to hiring by giving CBP the option not to duplicate a polygraph exam already completed by a highly qualified applicant's previous law enforcement agency.  I represent the Port of Jacksonville, which moved 82 tons of cargo last year and is one of only 16 ports of call authorized to move military cargo through our national security operations.  It is absolutely vital that U.Customs and Border Protection are able to hire enough quality officers to maintain the flow of commerce.

Maybe this can be a moment where we start doing that.  Both sides will have to give. The blame hardly falls on one side or the other, but if we can take this moment--a solemn moment--and start working this body the way it had always worked until the last decade or so, with both sides to blame for the deterioration, we will do a better job for our country, a better job for this body, a better job for ourselves.  Finally, I am glad that the leader asked us to move to We need to do it. I can say that on this side of the aisle, we will move expeditiously.

10152,topic-id,434,"Madam President, finally, a word on China and North  Yesterday, the President tweeted: ``While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi and China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!''  We will wait to see if this tweet actually signals a shift in U.policy--you never know with these tweets--but no doubt it is a confession that the President's conciliatory approach toward China has failed.  Just months after he was elected, President Trump said he was willing to offer a better trade deal if China worked with us on North Korea--going back on years of campaign rhetoric about getting tough on trade with China, which is something I have fully supported and opposed, frankly, both President Bush and President Obama for being too weak on trade with When I heard that President Trump, during the campaign, was going to be tough on China, I was glad. I thought this was an area in which we could work together.  Yet the minute he sits down with Xi, Xi sort of wins him over, and he says: Well, we will get something out of North  I told the President on the telephone that China will not back off and help us with North Korea unless they feel the sting of economic sanctions for their illicit, unfair trade practices which have robbed millions of American jobs.  The idea that China would suddenly start to cooperate with the United States after President Trump dropped his threats to get tough on China was always unrealistic and misguided. China has been unwilling to cooperate with the United States in the economic or foreign policy spheres for decades. China puts itself first. That is what it is doing now.  Let's not forget that millions of American workers have been hurt by China's rapacious trading practices over the decades. Selling out those American workers and simply hoping that China, out of its good graces, would start working with us on North Korea never made sense.  The best approach to dealing with China is to be clear and consistent and tough about America's foreign policy and economic interests. President Trump, rather than going soft on trade with China, should get tough on trade with That is the best way to get China to work with us on North Korea, and it is the right thing to do for the American worker.

Wishing Senator McCain a Speedy Recovery  Mr.President, before I begin, for once I would like to express my hope--and I think the hope of every Member of this Chamber--that the senior Senator from Arizona, my good friend John McCain, has a full and speedy recovery from his recent surgery. There is no one who has done more to serve this country in this Chamber than John There is no one who is more passionate in his defense of our soldiers and our defense than John He is just an outstanding man and a very, very good friend. I admire him very much, treasure his friendship, and wish him the best. Godspeed to Senator McCain and his family.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, because of Senator McCain's recent illness, it seems that it will be at least another week until the Republican majority forces a vote on the Republican TrumpCare bill. I would suggest to my good friend, the Republican leader, that he use this time to hold public hearings on the bill.  My Republican friends propose to pass legislation that would reorganize one-sixth of our economy and touch the lives of every American without a single hearing. Is that amazing? There has not been one hearing, even though we have been on the bill for 7 months now. There has been no opportunity to hear from experts in a public setting, let alone consider amendments.  So I say to my friend, Senator McConnell: Let's use this extra week or extra weeks to do what Republicans should have done a long time ago. Hold public hearings and allow the stakeholders to come in and express their concerns.  Today we Democrats sent the leader a letter to make this request formally, and we will include a list of nonpartisan stakeholders we believe should have a chance to air their views on the Senate Republican healthcare bill. These are groups known for their followings and for the good they do, known for not being political at all, like the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the American Hospital Association, AHIP--the largest trade group for insurers--to name a few. Let's have these groups testify on the policies in this bill so that the American people will have a chance to hear what experts and patient advocates have to say.  I say to my friend, the leader: When you don't have hearings, when you try to hide a bill, it usually results in poor legislation. That is what is happening now: a bill done behind closed doors by a handful of Senators--even Republican Senators didn't know what they were putting together. It doesn't work.  The wisdom of the Founding Fathers, the wisdom of this body through the centuries is to do it in public, have a discussion, have a debate, and the crucible of the legislative process will make it better. The suggestion we are making--obviously we oppose many parts of the bill; obviously so do the American people. But maybe something that would be said at a hearing would change things around.  Additionally, we ask the majority leader to wait for a complete score from the Congressional Budget Office before proceeding to his bill. The Republicans now have a week--maybe more--to get their bill scored by the nonpartisan They have no excuse to proceed to a bill of this significance without knowing its cost or consequence. Now that they have plenty of time to get that done, we Democrats hope there will be a full CBO score before a vote on the motion to proceed. We make these requests respectfully.  Let me just say one more thing about the The White House has had an awful tendency--when they don't like a fact, they call it fake, and they try to discredit the fact giver. We have never seen a Presidency like this. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Don't let this infection spread to you.  CBO is a nonpartisan organization. The head of CBO was appointed by the Republican leaders of the House and To discredit CBO simply because you don't like the answer they give is not the American way. The American way is to debate the facts, not deny them, not call them fake because you don't like them.  Unfortunately, our President has made this a hallmark of his Anything he doesn't like is fake, even though it is real. His son gives an email, gives a statement, and he says that is fake--what was said is fake. Let it not spread to this body. CBO is a respected organization, as I said, with leaders appointed by Republicans, not by us. Let's hear what they have to say, and let's take it seriously, even though we may not agree with the outcome of where their facts lead.  I would like to make some additional points on one of the more controversial parts of the Republican TrumpCare bill--the Cruz amendment. The Cruz amendment, by allowing insurers to sell junk insurance, would actually increase out-of-pocket costs on average Premiums might come down for some plans because insurers wouldn't have to cover very much, but the reduction in premiums would be more than offset by skyrocketing deductibles and copays. So the average American would be paying more, not less. The average American, or so many of them, would likely get junk insurance.  My friend Senator Coons of Delaware put it best when he said: Yes, we will sell you a car. It will be cheaper, but it will have no bumper, no steering wheel, and no carburetor. It will be cheaper, but it will not serve its purpose. It will not get you where you have to go. On these Cruz insurance policies, the insurer can say: no hospitalization, no payment for drugs. What good are they? It is a talking point, but it doesn't help people. It hurts them.  The Cruz amendment would also make insurance unaffordable for Americans who need it most, creating what even the very conservative American Action Forum says would be a death spiral in the marketplace. My friend the senior Senator from Iowa said the Cruz amendment would ``annihilate the preexisting condition requirement.'' That is not Chuck Schumer or Bill Nelson speaking. That is Chuck Grassley, one of the most senior Republican Senators from the great State of Iowa, who says that. It is not fake. It is real, what he said. You can't wash it away.  The Cruz amendment winds back the clock in America to the days of the worst practices of insurance companies. It seems that the raison d'etre of the Cruz amendment is to let insurance companies do whatever they want. In the 1890s, that philosophy may have governed, but America has learned under Republican and Democrat alike that it doesn't protect them. It would allow insurers to sell policies without the ban on preexisting exclusions, without covering essential health benefits, and without lifetime limits on out-of-pocket costs. It would even allow insurers to sell policies that include excessive waiting periods of more than 90 days.  If your kid has cancer, this policy in its fine print says that you have to wait 90 days while you watch your child suffer. What kind of freedom is that? It is freedom for the insurance company. It sure isn't freedom for the family with a child who is suffering.  I find that the Cruz amendment--and sometimes my good friend from Texas cares about freedom for very wealthy people, for millionaires. What about average people? You need freedom to be able to have your insurance company pay when your kid has cancer. You need to be free of that--that they can't pay or will not pay or that you have to wait 90 days. But the Cruz amendment blesses those kinds of restrictions. Remember, the Cruz amendment was added to a bill that slashes Medicaid in a way that would shatter protections for Americans in nursing homes, those struggling with opioid addictions, and Americans in rural parts of the country. The Cruz amendment is a cruel insult adding to a devastating injury.  We have another week or more before the Senate will vote on this bill. The Republican leader can spend that time trying to find new or ever more cynical ways to buy off necessary votes with[[Page S4015]]bailouts and giveaways to certain States, or he can do what he has promised to do repeatedly as majority leader--return this body to regular order, go through the committee process, have hearings and a robust amendment process--and, I dare say, the resulting product will be a lot better than the one we have before us. I dare say that is why the Founding Fathers set up a Congress--not to have a few people get in a room and rush through a bill that affects a huge percentage of the American economy.                        ``Made in America'' Week  On another matter, Mr.President, the administration has termed this week ``Made in America'' So I would urge every American to use this opportunity to look at the administration's and this President's ``Made in America'' record.  President Trump said in his inaugural address that his administration would follow two simple rules: ``buy American'' and ``hire American.'' But President Trump's own businesses don't even follow those rules. If you are going to preach something, start at home. Start at home.  Trump shirts and ties are made in Trump furniture is made in While President Trump and his administration are importuning others to make it in America, maybe he should demand it of his businesses first.  The American people should also take a hard look at the Trump administration's policies on the issues of trade and outsourcing. Again, the words in the President's inauguration and his actions contradict each other, just as do the actions of his company. Earlier this year, President Trump refused to insist that pipelines and water infrastructure be made with American Buy American, hire American--why did he refuse to do that? We Democrats wanted it done. I think many Republicans wanted it done. If President Trump were serious about the ``Made in America'' Week, he would demand that Senate Republicans put Senator Baldwin's bill requiring that infrastructure be made with American Steel on the Senate floor.  Another example is the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act, prepared by the Republican majority. It includes rollbacks--actual rollbacks--to the ``Buy American'' rules. If President Trump was serious about ``Made in America'' Week, instead of a lot of show and a lot of talking, why doesn't he oppose those rollbacks and threaten to veto any bill that dilutes or rescinds ``Buy American'' rules, which the Defense bill coming to the floor does.  So, again, as ``Made in America'' Week commences, I urge the American people to study the policies of this President and the practices of the businesses that bear his name, because, at least thus far, the Trump administration's push for ``Made in America'' is a bit like Mr.Putin's proposing a cyber security task force.     Recognizing French President Macron's Remarks on Anti-Zionism  Mr.President, I would like to applaud French President Emmanuel Macron for his comments over the weekend about anti-``We will yield nothing to anti-Zionism,'' he said, ``because it is the reinvented form of anti- President Macron is absolutely right. Anti-Semitism is a word that has been used throughout history when Jewish people are judged and measured by one standard and the rest by another--when everyone else was allowed to farm and Jews could not, when everyone else was allowed to live in Moscow and Jews could not, when others could become academics or tradesmen, and Jews could not. Praise God, it has not happened in America, but it was a hallmark of  The word to describe all of these acts is anti-So it is with anti-The idea that all other people can seek or defend their right to determination but the Jewish people cannot, that other nations have a right to exist but the Jewish State of Israel does not is also a modern form of anti-Semitism, just as President Macron of France said this weekend. Anti-Zionism, unfortunately, continues to bubble up in many different forms.  There is perhaps no greater example than the pernicious effort to delegitimize Israel through boycotts, divestment, and sanctions. The BDS movement is a deeply biased campaign that I would say, in similar words to Mr.Macron's, is ``a reinvented form of anti-Semitism,'' because it seeks to impose boycotts on Israel and not any other nations, most of whose practices are abhorrent, far worse than the democracy of Israel, which recognizes people's rights.  I hope that the States across this country will continue to push back against the BDS movement by boycotting the boycotters, as my home State of New York has done. I know that my fellow Senators on both sides of the aisle--this is an issue that has, thank God, not lent itself to partisanship--will join me in condemning this modern brand of anti-Semitism, as President Macron did this weekend.

10252,topic-id,454,"Now, Mr.President, on another matter: healthcare.  Yesterday, the insurer Anthem pulled out of exchanges in Ohio, citing the administration's decision to hold cost-sharing reduction payments hostage as the reason for its exit. Anthem joins a growing list of health insurers that have chosen to leave the 2018 marketplace or considered raising their rates as a result of the uncertainty the President and Republicans are causing--deliberately, in my judgment--in our healthcare system.  The President and Republicans blame ObamaCare for insurers leaving the marketplace. It is simply not true. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it is the ``substantial uncertainty about enforcement of the individual mandate and about future payments of the cost-sharing subsidies'' that have led insurers to withdraw from the current marketplace. AHIP, which is hardly a Democratic group--it is the largest trade group of insurers and is completely nonpartisan--said the uncertainty about cost-sharing payments was ``the single most destabilizing factor in the individual market.''  The Affordable Care Act is not falling under its own weight. It is being sabotaged deliberately by President Trump and Republicans who have been whipping up all of this uncertainty to gain political advantage, to say: ``I told you so.'' They are hurting millions of people. That is really wrong.  After downplaying weeks of expectations in moving forward, yesterday our[[Page S3303]]Republican colleagues said they expect to have a repeal bill passed by June 30. That is 23 days from today. From all reports, the efforts by Republican Senators to craft a different TrumpCare will be based on many of the provisions in the House bill--a bill that would remove the guarantee of coverage for preexisting conditions, raise rates on some older Americans by as much as 800 percent, and decimate Medicaid, which so helps rural folks, folks with a family member in a nursing home, and those suffering from opioid abuse. It would also leave 23 million more Americans without health insurance.  I remind all of my colleagues on the other side that drafting a Senate Republican healthcare bill that is based on a House bill is putting lipstick on a pig. TrumpCare is fundamentally flawed, has been rejected overwhelmingly by the American people of all political stripes, and will devastate our healthcare system in order to finance massive tax breaks for the wealthiest of There is no amount of window dressing that can fix up a flawed concept.  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that even if the proposal is 10 or 20 percent better than the House bill, it ain't close to being good enough for the American people. Republicans ought to drop the repeal.

Based on President Trump's decisions over the past few months, it is clear, unfortunately, that agriculture and small towns like those all over Michigan have been an afterthought.  It didn't help that Governor Perdue was the very last Cabinet Secretary to be nominated by President The White House then took 7 weeks to submit the official nomination paperwork to the Senate, which further delayed our hearing process.  Despite unprecedented delays from this administration, the Agriculture Committee acted in a swift and bipartisan fashion to approve Governor Perdue with overwhelming support.  Governor Perdue grew up on a dairy and crop farm in a small town in He worked as a veterinarian and served as a two-term He has the confidence of nearly 700 agricultural stakeholder groups that represent farmers, ranchers, conservationists, landowners, and the food and nutrition communities.

President Trump's budget proposal makes it clear that rural America is not a top priority for his administration. His proposal cuts USDA funding by 21 percent, the third largest cut to any Federal agency.  To examine the impact these proposed cuts would have on our country's small towns and rural communities, I released a report that highlights how President Trump is turning his back on rural  This report demonstrates how the Trump budget would eliminate--eliminate--the rural water and sewer program that repairs crumbling water infrastructure that is depended upon in communities all across America and certainly all across This would leave thousands of communities across the country without the ability to provide clean water.  USDA business loans are also slated to end, undermining the creation of new jobs in areas where unemployment is already too high. Again, I can go from community to community in Northern Michigan or in the east or the west and talk with people who have been able to start their small business with the support of USDA rural development business loans, creating jobs, communities, and really helping to form the lifeblood of small towns all across Michigan and the country.

We need a Secretary of Agriculture who will be a relentless advocate for our Nation's farmers and the important services USDA provides. That is why I am supporting Governor  It is important to stress again that American agriculture and our rural communities are already doing more with less. In the last farm bill, we made responsible, bipartisan reforms that cut $23 billion in Federal spending, and we now know that the 2014 farm bill policies are actually predicted to save tens of billions of dollars more than we originally had expected.  The budget cuts the Trump administration has proposed are frankly irresponsible and show a stunning disregard for the current state of the farm economy. Farm prices are down nearly 50 percent from their highs just a few years ago, and producers are struggling to make ends meet. Rural America is the economic backbone of our country, and too many small towns are still struggling to recover from the great recession.  Over the last 8 years, USDA has made important investments in rural communities, and we are beginning to see small towns across the country on the road to recovery, but there is more to do. Now is not the time for the Trump administration to turn its back on people who live in rural  We need a strong voice to insist that the President listen to the 500 groups that are saying that agriculture, conservation, food assistance, and other farm bill services are critical to our economy and should be maintained.

I am pleased he is committed to looking for creative solutions in the short run as well as the long run.

10069,topic-id,854,"Mr.President, if there is one thing that has become clear, it is that the ObamaCare status quo is not sustainable.  Prices continue to soar while choices are rapidly dwindling. Between 2016 and 2017, the average premium for a midlevel ObamaCare plan on the Federal exchange went up 25 percent--25 percent for just 1 year. Let's remember that this is on top of years--year after year--of premium increases under  How many families can easily absorb a 25-percent premium increase? I would submit that not many. Again, that is just for 1 year. ObamaCare rate hikes aren't going anywhere. Numbers for next year are starting to emerge, and they are not looking good. Connecticut's ObamaCare insurers are requesting average premium increases in the double digits. One Connecticut insurer has requested an average rate hike of 33.8 percent--33.8 percent. In Virginia, one insurer has requested an average rate increase of 38 percent. Another has requested an average 45-percent rate hike. In Maryland, average increases range anywhere from 18 percent to almost 59 percent. One insurer has requested a staggering 150-percent rate increase--150 percent.  Obviously, these kinds of price increases are unaffordable for most families, but ObamaCare isn't leaving them any options. Along with soaring prices, choices on the exchanges are rapidly dwindling. Roughly one-third of U.counties have just one choice of health insurer on their exchange for 2017. Several States--including Alabama, Oklahoma, Alaska, and Wyoming--have just one choice of insurer for their entire State, and things are only getting worse.  In 2018, a number of counties may lack an ObamaCare insurer at all. In February, health insurer Humana announced its decision to completely withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges for 2018, and 2 weeks ago, Aetna, which had already sharply reduced its participation in the exchanges for 2017, announced its decision to fully exit and completely get out of the market in 2018. That leaves the Nebraska and Delaware ObamaCare exchanges with just one insurer for 2018.  UnitedHealthcare is leaving Virginia, and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield is withdrawing from In the wake of Aetna and Wellmark's decision, Medica, the last ObamaCare insurer for most of Iowa, announced it will likely leave the State in 2018. That would leave 94 out of 99 counties in Iowa with no ObamaCare insurer next year--all but five counties in the State of Iowa with no ObamaCare insurer. Iowa families with ObamaCare subsidies would have no place to spend them. As my colleague Senator Alexander likes to point out, that is like having a bus ticket in a town where there are no buses running.  Dwindling healthcare choices aren't limited to the ObamaCare exchanges, either. Aetna is not only withdrawing from the exchanges. It is also withdrawing from the non-ObamaCare individual health insurance markets in several More than one insurance CEO has suggested that ObamaCare is in a death spiral, and I would have to say it is pretty hard to disagree. Combine soaring premiums with a steady insurer exodus, and sooner or later you get a partial or complete exchange collapse.  Then there are the other ObamaCare problems--like deductibles which are sometimes so high people can't afford to actually use their healthcare plans; or, narrow plan networks with few provider choices.  ObamaCare may have been well-intentioned, but good intentions don't make up for a lack of good policy--and ObamaCare was not good policy. ObamaCare took a healthcare system with problems and it made things worse. It is time to repeal this fatally flawed law and replace it with real healthcare reform.  Three weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed an ObamaCare repeal and replacement bill. The House's legislation repeals ObamaCare's tax increases, penalties, and mandates, and starts the process of restoring control of healthcare to States and individuals. My colleagues in the House have made a good start, and I am looking forward to building on their bill here in the United States We have a lot of Members with good healthcare ideas, and we are going to work hard to produce a bill that will start the process of giving the American people real healthcare reform.  ObamaCare is failing, and it is failing rapidly. Our Democrat colleagues need to stop pretending this law is ever going to do what it was supposed to do and come to the table to work with us on real healthcare reform. There is no question our healthcare system has problems, but ObamaCare is not, and it never has been, the solution.  Real reform is possible, though, and that is what we are focused on now here in the United States Senate--the kind of reform that will actually drive down prices, that will put patients and their doctors--not the government--in charge of healthcare decisions, that will empower States to embrace the solutions that are right for the citizens in their States and will give Americans more choices and real healthcare freedom.  That is the kind of healthcare reform Republicans are committed to delivering for the American people.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

10067,topic-id,1541,"Mr.President, today many of my colleagues will come to the floor to speak about the devastating impact that TrumpCare will have on rural communities. I rise to join them in speaking on this topic and on the many other serious flaws in the Republicans' bill to replace ObamaCare.[[Page S3084]]  When he was elected, President Trump promised he would provide healthcare for everyone, but President Trump and our Republican friends have turned their backs on that promise. The Republican healthcare proposal would put insurance companies back in the driver's seat, and that means less quality and more costs for all of us. Rural communities, working families, and people with medical conditions would be hit the hardest.  Today, we got a taste of how devastating TrumpCare would be. The President's budget proposal slashes billions of dollars for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance President Trump takes direct aim at bipartisan programs that have made historic progress for kids, for the disabled, and for the elderly.  Former Senator Hubert Humphrey once said: ``The moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.''  When Senator Humphrey spoke those words, he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He died a few months later. His words are just as meaningful today.  TrumpCare fails Senator Humphrey's moral test. It doesn't cover more people or more services or improve healthcare. It raises costs and reduces quality. Compared to the ACA--or ObamaCare--TrumpCare would be a disaster for families in my home  In New Mexico, tens of thousands of people have healthcare, thanks to ObamaCare and the Medicaid expansion. Before the Affordable Care Act, New Mexico had one of the highest rates of uninsured in the country. It was almost 20 percent, at 19.6 percent. That rate has been cut in half to 8.9 percent.  Approximately 300,000 more New Mexicans now have healthcare. And each one of these 300,000 people has a story about how having healthcare has made a difference--even saved lives.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans now have essential health benefits, including doctor visits, hospital care, prescription drugs, pregnancy and childbirth, and mental health services, and a range of preventive services, like mammograms and other cancer screenings, are available at no cost.  I am not saying that the ACA is perfect. Premiums are still too high, deductibles are increasing too much, and we still must bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We absolutely need to work to bring down costs. But, on balance, the Affordable Care Act passes all tests--many with flying colors. TrumpCare does not come close. TrumpCare gets an  Test 1: Does TrumpCare increase the number of Americans who will have healthcare? No, it decreases coverage and decreases it dramatically.  According to the most recent figures from the CBO, 24 million Americans will lose healthcare coverage under TrumpCare over the next decade. TrumpCare would dismantle the Medicaid expansion provisions that help so many working Americans, including 265,000 people in New Mexico, and TrumpCare would hit rural communities the hardest.  The National Rural Health Association has said that TrumpCare ``does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure crisis.''  Rural areas like the ones we have in New Mexico have more elderly and disabled people, and fewer people have insurance through their jobs. TrumpCare is the hardest on these groups.  Rural hospitals are already struggling. They will have an even harder time keeping their doors open.  Many New Mexicans would have to drive an hour or more if their local hospital closed. And not only would closed hospitals mean less access to healthcare, it would also hurt the economy. In rural areas, hospitals are a big employer. If they close, the rural economy takes a hit too.  The administrator of the Guadalupe County Hospital in New Mexico, a fine woman by the name of Christina Campos, fears what might happen if TrumpCare becomes law. She is urging me to protect access to care in rural areas.  Guadalupe County is one of our smallest counties by population. The hospital's uninsured payer rate declined from 14 percent to 4 percent from 2014 to 2016, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and its uncompensated care increased 23 percent in that same period.  I can tell my colleagues that I will fight tooth and nail to keep residents in our rural areas insured and to keep rural hospitals in New Mexico open.  Test 2: Does TrumpCare increase coverage of healthcare services? No, it fails this test too. Under the ACA, insurance companies must cover essential healthcare services, period. But under TrumpCare, starting in 2020, States can get a waiver and define their own essential benefits for individual and small group plans. So States would be able to cut the benefits that people count on--and that are making patients healthier.  Test 3: Does TrumpCare make healthcare more affordable? It doesn't. It takes aim at the most vulnerable working and low-income families and seniors--the people most in need of care--and it cuts access to healthcare out from under them. If you are older and poorer, you lose big under If you are young and wealthy, you win.  What is wrong with this picture? What is wrong is that it is unjust. And it is bad for healthcare costs over the long run. Trump and the Republicans are proposing drastic changes to our healthcare system--and they are changes for the worse. They want to go backward to a time when insurance companies could decide who gets healthcare and who doesn't.  Finally, TrumpCare would hurt anyone with a preexisting condition. One of the most popular provisions of ObamaCare is that it prohibits insurance companies from dropping you if you get sick and from refusing to cover you because of a preexisting condition. A preexisting condition could be something serious like cancer, but insurance companies have considered everything from childbirth to hand warts a preexisting condition.  Under TrumpCare, States would be able to decide whether to get a waiver from those patient protections. And then we would go back to that time when insurance companies decided who could get healthcare and who couldn't. States would have to set up high-risk pools to provide people with the option of insurance in catastrophic situations. But in the best cases, high-risk pools wouldn't protect many people from going bankrupt just to get healthcare, and TrumpCare wouldn't provide nearly enough funding for States to run them successfully.  Take Alexis from Alexis is here in the photograph with her husband. Alexis had a stroke and brain surgeries when she was 28 years old. Even though she had no lingering effects, she was denied insurance in the private market and had to get insurance in New Mexico's high-risk pool. According to Alexis, ``It broke us financially.'' Alexis now has affordable health insurance with the help of the Affordable Care Act subsidies. Like most people, she doesn't want to risk going broke just to get healthcare. She shouldn't have to.  Finally, I want to tell you about a 1-year-old from Albuquerque, NM, whose name is Rafe was born with cortical visual impairment--a kind of legal blindness--and significant developmental delays. His parents--Jessica, his mom, and his father, Sam, a veteran--have been able to access the intensive medical care, early intervention services, medical equipment, and therapy he needs through a combination of the military's insurance and But TrumpCare jeopardizes Medicaid by turning it into a block grant for States, which will most certainly result in deep cuts to It threatens Rafe's chances of a better life.  The President promised he would keep protections for people with preexisting conditions--people who are sick. His broken promises can hurt tens of millions of  In the end, TrumpCare is not a real healthcare bill. It is a tax relief bill for the richest 1 percent. The CBO estimates that TrumpCare would cut taxes by $346 billion over 10 years, at the expense of the healthcare of working families and seniors.[[Page S3085]]  Our priorities for healthcare reform should be increasing coverage, increasing the services provided, making people healthier, and providing affordable healthcare. I strongly and unequivocally support all Americans having healthcare.  Let's get to that goal, and let's get to that goal now. Ninety-one percent of the American people are insured, thanks to the steps taken under the Affordable Care Rather than repealing it, let's build on its strengths so 100 percent of people can afford to see a doctor when they are sick. We can do this. We can do better. Let's ensure that Americans in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the disabled, have the right to healthcare so that America meets the moral test of good governance.

10305,topic-id,756,"Mr.President, President Trump said last week that the healthcare bill passed by the House was ``mean,'' and then he said the Senate should make the bill more ``generous, kind [and] with heart.'' It sounds like the President is having second thoughts about this Republican bill.  So now, Mr.President, you are waking up and noticing just how heartless this bill is; you know, the bill your Republican buddies in Congress slapped together in a back room; you know, the one you celebrated with a big press conference in the Rose Garden a few weeks ago; you know, the bill that you and House Republicans gave each other high fives over for taking away healthcare from millions of people, and now it sounds like you want a do-over.  Too bad no one explained to the President that mean is just part of the deal the Republicans have struck. Mean is baked into every sentence of this bill. When you set out to trade health insurance of millions of American families for massive tax cuts for the wealthy, things get real mean fast.  This mean bill does a lot of things, but some of the meanest things about it are how hard it will hit American women. To pay for the hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts for this bill, Republicans chose to make one of their classic moves--a sort of old reliable for Republican men: attack women's healthcare.  Let's run through just a few examples. Today, most people helped by Medicaid are women. The Republican bill cuts Medicaid by $834 billion. Republicans say millions of women who lose healthcare will do just fine.  Today, plans on the individual market have to cover maternity care and treatment for postpartum depression. The Republican bill says: Forget it. Let the States drop those benefits. Women are the only ones using them anyway.  Today, the law says you can't charge women more by labeling things like pregnancy as preexisting conditions. The Republican bill says: Who cares? Go for it.  Today, women can choose healthcare providers they trust the most, but the Republicans want to eliminate that choice by cutting funding for Planned Republicans say women can do just fine without the care they need.  Frankly, I am sick of many coming down to the Senate floor to explain to Republicans what Planned Parenthood does. I am sick of explaining that it provides millions of women with birth control, cancer screenings, and STI tests every year. I am sick of pointing out, again and again, that Federal dollars do not fund abortion services at Planned Parenthood or anywhere else. Women come to the floor, we explain, we cite facts, but Republicans would rather base healthcare policy on politics than on facts.  Speaker Ryan called this mean bill pro-life, but this is just the biggest political play of all. Calling something pro-life will not keep women from dying in back-alley abortions. It will not help women pay for the cancer screenings that could save their lives. It will not help them take care of their families, have safe sex, or afford their medical bills. The pro-life label is the Republicans playing politics with women's lives.  Let's be blunt. The Republican bill will make it more likely--not less likely--that women and their children will die. Women aren't fools. We can feel the difference. We can tell the difference between reality and lies, and that is why we are here today. That is why we are fighting back on the Senate floor today.  Right now, 13 Senators--all men--are sitting in a room writing revisions to the secret Republican bill. These 13 men will not show us the bill and will not hold hearings on its contents. Just in case anyone missed the point, please note that all 13 of these men have already voted during their time in the Senate to reduce women's access to contraception and abortion. Republicans have told the press that Americans shouldn't worry about the fact that women are shut out because ``reduc[ing]'' the 13 men to their gender is a ``game . . . of identity politics.''  This is not identity politics, and it is certainly not a game. This bill will affect every woman in this country, and we know what is going on behind closed doors: 13 men are trading away women's healthcare for tax cuts for the rich.  American women deserve better than this mean Republican bill, and American women are here to fight back.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

10080,topic-id,1819,"Mr.President, I am here to discuss what you might call the Scott Pruitt philosophy of environmental regulation. In a recent interview, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency expressed his view that the EPA should ``simply pass regulations that provide fairness and equity and allow utilities to make decisions based upon stability, cost, and security to the consumers that they serve.'' Did we notice anything missing in that assertion of what EPA's role should be? How about no mention of the environment, no mention of climate change, no mention of public health? So my 168th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech will look at how paid-for Administrator Pruitt is by the very industries he is supposed to be regulating. Often, the word for this is ``corruption.''  Scott Pruitt is a functionary of fossil fuel money. He has a long record of dark money fundraising and long, cozy relationships with big fossil fuel political donors.  As you can see, energy interests contributed over $136,000 to Pruitt's 2014 campaign even though he ran unopposed. During the 2010 and 2014 election cycles, oil and gas giants Devon Energy and Koch Industries--yes, of those infamous Koch brothers--maxed out to Pruitt's campaigns.  Thanks to Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting by the New York Times, we know that backing Pruitt was a good fossil fuel investment, particularly for Devon In 2011, Attorney General Scott Pruitt took a letter written by Devon Energy, he put it onto his Oklahoma attorney general letterhead, he signed it for them, and he sent it off to EPA, pleading Devon Energy's anti-regulatory case as if it were his own.  As attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt directly solicited political donations from companies now regulated by EPA, then regulated by EPA as well.  He spoke at dozens of industry events but never at a public health or environmental event.  He led the boards of political organizations, like the Republican Attorneys General Association and its dark money political fundraising arm, the so-called Rule of Law Defense Fund, this thing. Pruitt was a member of the RAGA executive committee--RAGA being Republican Attorneys General He was a member of their executive committee between 2014 and 2016, when RAGA raised $530,000 from Koch Industries--yes, those same infamous Koch brothers--and $125,000 from Devon Energy--yes, of the letter he put onto his own letterhead.  Coal giant Murray Energy donated $50,000 to Liberty 2.0, Pruitt's own super PAC, and it donated $350,000 to RAGA between 2014 and 2016.  The Rule of Law Defense Fund doesn't have to disclose its donors. They hide in a loophole in the law. But other public reporting has shown that it received at least $175,000 from something called Freedom With a name like that, you know it is up to no good. Sure enough, it is another dark[[Page S3091]]money group run by several Koch Industries executives. That is not Coca-Cola; that is the Koch brothers' fossil fuel processing company.  We don't know more about this. Why do we not know more about this? Because Republicans in the Senate protected Scott Pruitt from having to answer these questions during his confirmation process.  While he was busily helping raise dark money, dark money groups, in turn, came back and worked hard to help Pruitt get confirmed to the A Republican opposition research PAC called America Rising launched a pro-Pruitt ad campaign, and its dark money arm, America Rising Squared, funded confirmpruitt.com. A 501(c)(4) dark money entity ironically named Protecting America Now was created solely to help confirm Pruitt to the Its fliers asked for contributions ranging from $25,000 to $500,000. Just another grassroots group trying to get a good guy confirmed. Koch Industries' own lobbying disclosure forms reveal it spent part of $3.1 million lobbying to confirm Scott  In Trump's science-denial Cabinet, Administrator Pruitt seems to see little reason to hide his anti-environment and Republican political interests. He has spoken at the Conservative Political Action Conference and the American Farm Bureau board meeting. He attended rallies with coal miners against his own regulations and met with the National Mining Association's executive committee ``to lay out his concerns with the Paris accord'' the day before the mining association voted to press President Trump to withdraw from that agreement.  Administrator Pruitt planned to appear as the keynote speaker at the Oklahoma Republican Party Gala on May 5. This invitation mentioned his official position as EPA Administrator three times. It featured this photo of him being sworn in as the EPA It promised donors a ``once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear him discuss his plans to slash regulations, bring back jobs to Oklahoma, and decrease the size of the EPA.'' Well, the 1939 Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities, more commonly known as the Hatch Act, forbids this, so I filed a Hatch Act complaint and Administrator Pruitt's appearance was canceled. The Office of Special Counsel is now conducting a full investigation.  But it wasn't just there. He goes to other dinners. On February 28, 2017, Pruitt was a speaker at a RAGA major donors dinner. You know who major donors are by now. Days after the RAGA major donors dinner, Pruitt unilaterally withdrew an EPA request for information from oil and gas producers about their methane emissions, citing a letter from nine members of RAGA and two Republican Governors, who alleged the methane information request ``furthers the previous administration's climate agenda and supports . . . the imposition of burdensome climate rules on existing sites, the cost and expense of which will be enormous.''  There was no public comment period. There was no request for input from other This basically was a little party favor for his RAGA pals right after the RAGA dinner.  This EPA Administrator has solicited thousands, if not millions, of dollars from corporations he now regulates. Our current ethics laws do not require nominees in the confirmation process to disclose their political and dark money connections, so the Senate and the public are kept blind to the conflicts of interest of such nominees, and we have no idea how those conflicts would manifest in their offices. Pruitt knows who gave dark money to his political causes. The corporations know what dark money they gave. It is just the rest of us who are in the dark.  This is new, and this is weird. This was not a problem for President Obama's nominees because the dark money political tsunami that has swamped our politics in slime did not exist when President Obama was elected. It was the Citizens United decision of 2010 that allowed unlimited political spending by big special interests, and that unlimited money found dark money channels.  To address the gaping loophole in our Federal ethics laws, I have introduced the Conflicts from Political Fundraising Act with Senators Udall, Carper, Van Hollen, and This bill would require Presidentially appointed Federal officials like Scott Pruitt to disclose their political fundraising, and it would require Federal ethics officials to address these conflicts by, for example, making sure officials are recused from decisions affecting big political donors, making sure the public has the information to know they should ask for a recusal because the director is conflicted by reason of his political relationship with big dark money donors.  I wish the conflicts at EPA stopped with the Administrator, but they don't. It is a swarm of swampy conflict over there. Pruitt has surrounded himself with political operatives and fossil fuel lobbyists. The Associate EPA Administrator for Policy previously worked at RAGA, the Rule of Law Defense Fund, and something called the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce--a Koch brothers-funded dark money group that has underwritten the Rule of Law Defense EPA's Senior Adviser for Regional and State Affairs came from Pruitt's own fossil fuel-funded super PAC, Oklahoma The Assistant Administrator for Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations came from the oil company, the Hess One Deputy Associate Administrator is the former president of the Ohio Coal Another Deputy Associate Administrator was a registered lobbyist at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, where she specifically lobbied against EPA's Clean Power Plan and New Source Performance Standard, the clean water rule, the ozone standard, EPA enforcement, pesticides bills, budget resolutions, and EPA appropriations bills.  This corruption of EPA is the work of the fossil fuel industry. One day there must come a reckoning.  Just this weekend, the New York Times reported ``How Rollbacks at Scott Pruitt's E.P.Are a Boon to Oil and Gas.'' The article included a checklist of rollbacks that specifically benefit long-time Pruitt benefactor Devon Energy--the one that got the letter--delaying a rule raising royalties on fossil energy production on Federal land, undoing new fracking standards, rolling back rules on the leaking and flaring of methane, and rolling back reporting of methane emissions.  In another matter, Devon Energy had been preparing to pay a settlement of over $100,000 and to install emissions scrubbing equipment to remedy illegal emissions from a Wyoming natural gas facility. Five days after Pruitt was installed at EPA, the company told officials it was ``re-evaluating its settlement posture,'' offering a quarter of what it had previously proposed to settle the charges and scrapping the emissions controls entirely. They know their Administrator  Pruitt's record at EPA reveals he is unabashedly looking out for his industry donors at the expense of public health and the environment. As far as I can tell, every action he has taken since taking office will lead to an enriched industry--at the expense of dirtier air and dirtier water--and a more imperiled climate.  Myron Ebell is someone I don't quote often. He is the head of President Trump's EPA transition team and a prominent climate denier. He has something interesting to say about Scott He has said that he thinks Scott Pruitt is using EPA as a ``stepping stone to political office'' and that ``everything he does is going to be a political calculation about what furthers his own political career.''  This is not a liberal environmentalist making these accusations. This is somebody who is right in Scott Pruitt's climate denial wheelhouse. This is someone from the Trump science denial EPA destruction team. This is the guy who is in the club of fossil fuel-funded climate denial, and he thinks everything Pruitt does is a political calculation about what furthers Pruitt's own political career. If that is the case, everything Scott Pruitt does is a conflict of interest, as he sees regulated industry as the funders of his next political campaign. They pay for him now, and he delivers.  Sadly, the people who own Pruitt also own So good luck getting an honest look at this mess from our fossil fuel-funded colleagues in the majority.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

10303,topic-id,1692,"Mr.President, I come weekly to the Senate whenever we are in session to give my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, talking about climate change and, quite often, talking about the climate denial campaign that prevents us from taking action and, quite often, talking about the campaign finance problems in our country that make climate denial effective. Here, in Congress, it is not hard to connect the dots from campaign finance to climate denial.  The Supreme Court's Republican majority's disastrous Citizens United decision was requested by the fossil fuel industry, and the fossil fuel industry took instant advantage of it--almost like they saw it coming. The industry and its front groups instantly used their new power conferred by Citizens United to come after politicians--Republicans in particular. Ask Bob Inglis, who backed responsible climate policies. Citizens United created new American dark-money emperors, and--no surprise--the new emperors love their new political power.  Their first payoff was that Republicans in Congress fled from any legislative action on climate change. Before Citizens United, there were multiple bipartisan climate bills. Year after year--when I was here in 2007, 2008, 2009--there were bipartisan climate bills to the left of you, bipartisan climate bills to the right of you, bipartisan climate bills cropping up all over. Today, we watch our Republican President trying to undo curbs on carbon emissions and, to the cheers of Republicans in Congress, withdrawing the United States from the historic Paris We join Syria and Nicaragua as the only nations to reject this common cause. That, my friends, is the heavy hand of fossil fuel influence, driving us into isolation and abdication of American leadership.  Of course, right now, no Republican can safely sponsor any bill to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and so none do. Very different than before the Citizens United decision in January of 2010. That changed everything. When those five Republican justices opened up unlimited political spending to the big Republican special interests, that unlimited political spending was inevitably going to find dark-money channels. Dark-money channels hide the identity of the political donor, so that big special interests can pollute our politics with their money with seemingly clean hands.  The climate denial scheme of the fossil fuel cartel is powered politically by dark money. Whether through the lure of dark money coming in for you in a political race or the threat of dark money coming in against you in a political race, dark money powers climate denial. Well, we have just learned something new about dark money.  Chairman Graham and I held hearings in our Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism to look at Russian interference in the recent 2016 election and what it portends for elections to come. Our witnesses warned us that Russia has strategically manipulated politics in Europe for decades. They started working in the former Soviet Union countries, and they expanded to where they are manipulating politics in France, Germany, Holland, England, and all over The witnesses warned us that we in America must be prepared for that. They jumped the Atlantic to manipulate the 2016 elections, and they are not going away.  One identified weakness of the United States against Russian influence was this dark money in our politics. Why is that? Well, it is obvious. Once you allow dark money in, dark is dark. Cash from Vladimir Putin is no more traceable than cash from Charles and David One witness, a former Republican national security official, told us: ``It is critical that we effectively enforce the campaign finance laws that would prevent this type of financial influence by foreign actors.''  ``It is critical that we effectively enforce the campaign finance laws'' against foreign influence by foreign actors.  The two best studies of Russian influence in Western Europe in their elections and in their politics are ``The Kremlin Playbook,'' by CSIS, or the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and ``The Kremlin's Trojan Horses,'' by the Atlantic Both of them report that Russia takes advantage of nontransparency in campaign financing to build its shadowy webs of influence and control. If you leave dark-money channels lying around, it is likely that Vladimir Putin and his oligarchs will find them.  The ``Trojan Horses'' report warns this: ``The Kremlin's blatant attempts to influence and disrupt the U.presidential election should serve as an inspiration for a democratic push back.'' That is a lower case ``d'' for ``democratic push back,'' and it points to one key way we need to push back.  I will quote them again.       Electoral rules should be amended, so that publically      funded political groups, primarily political parties, should      at the very least be required to report their sources of      funding.  That is, end dark money.  Likewise, the ``Kremlin Playbook'' report warns:       Enhancing transparency and the effectiveness of the Western      democratic tools, instruments, and institutions is critical      to resilience against Russian influence.  Enhancing transparency means ending dark money.  Our hearing and these reports reveal another political influence tool used by the Kremlin: fake news. As we shore up our democracy to defend against Russia's fake news information warfare, we must remember this: Climate denial was the original fake news.  To give an example, here is a story that may sound familiar. An unknown hacker illegally breaks into and steals an organization's emails. The organization's emails are held until they can be released at a politically strategic moment. At the strategic moment, emails are leaked to a website with shady ties. The leaks are then amplified and spun by fake news, driven into the regular media, and have their desired political effect. Does any of that sound familiar? Of course, it is the methodology of the Russians' hack of the Democratic National Committee, right? Unknown hacker, stolen emails, strategic release, caching them until they can be used, shady website, fake news spin-up, regular media takes the bait, political damage.  If you step back and look at just the methodology, we have seen this pattern before--so-called climategate, the[[Page S3676]]fake scandal years ago cooked up by the climate denial machine. It was 2009, not 2017. The organization hacked was not the DNC but the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United The release was timed to the U.climate conference in Copenhagen, not the Presidential election. The documents went to climate skeptic blogs--with, interestingly, the first upload in Russia--instead of to WikiLeaks, but the mainstream media took the bait, and the political damage was done.  At the time, the New York Times wrote:       The[se] revelations are bound to inflame the public debate      as hundreds of negotiators prepare to negotiate an      international climate accord at meetings in Copenhagen next      month.  This climategate scheme worked so well that in November 2011, the climategate operation did it again just before the U.climate conference in Durban in what was dubbed climategate 2.0. Of course, the whipped-up climategate hysteria was all fake news.  As the Guardian wrote in February 2010:       Almost all the media and political discussion about the      hacked climate emails has been based on soundbites publicised      by professional [climate] sceptics and their blogs. In many      cases, these have been taken out of context and twisted to      mean something they were never intended to.  Eight times, everyone from the inspector general of the U.Department of Commerce, to the National Science Foundation, to the British Parliament found no evidence of any misconduct by the scientists, but for the climate denier groups, the truth was never the point.  This climategate stunt was the product of a fake news infrastructure built by the fossil fuel industry to attack and undermine real climate science--disinformation campaigns, false-front organizations, stables of paid-for scientists, and propaganda honed by public relations experts. This denial operation aspires to mimic and rival real science, and it is an industrial-strength adversary with big advantages. It does not need to win its disputes with real science; it just needs to create the public illusion of a real dispute. It doesn't have to waste time in peer review, and it doesn't have to be true; it just has to sound like it might be. This industrial fake news operation isn't going anywhere. It is too valuable to the big polluters.  As we prepare to face down Russia's campaign of election interference, we will have to face up to these two hard facts:  If the Kremlin wants to deploy fake news information warfare in our country, the climate denial fake news infrastructure already exists. Remember, climate denial was the original fake news.  If the Kremlin wants to deploy a surreptitious financial influence campaign, the dark money infrastructure already exists. The fossil fuel industry's dark money election manipulation machinery is ready to go. Putin doesn't have to build a thing. The fossil fuel dark money and fake news infrastructure stands ready to go.  Unfortunately, we know it works because it has worked for years for the fossil fuel cartel, particularly since Citizens United allowed the fossil fuel industry to enforce silence on the Republican  The dangers of fake news, dark money, climate denial, and foreign interference in our elections are all intermixed. They have brought us to the point where the President of the United States will leave the Paris Agreement, betraying the country's interests, in the service of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers' climate denial operation, and Breitbart fake news.  This calls for an American response. Dark money and fake news are a sinister combination, whoever is behind them. America must address the twin threats of fake news and dark money. It is bad enough when these are the tools of the fossil fuel industry's climate denial operation, but we are on notice now. We are on notice from these reports and from multiple witnesses that the Kremlin can borrow these tools too.  I will close by asking that we clean up this mess. It may take citizen action, given the stranglehold dark money and fake news have on Congress, but this is a fight worth having. There is no good that comes out of dark money and fake news, whoever is behind them. We should rid ourselves of this sinister combination.  I yield the floor.

This is National Police Week, and so I rise to honor our men and women in service across our country who wear the uniform every day: our first responders who are police officers who rush to trouble, as opposed to running from, and who put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe. Every day, they get up and keep our families safe and our communities safe. They are our heroes.  So this week, Mr.Speaker, Congress has welcomed many of these policemen and -women and their families to D.to recognize them for their heroism and to remember those whom we have lost.  In Kansas, we are all too aware of the sacrifices that law enforcement makes to keep us safe. Brad Lancaster, Dave Melton, and Brandon Collins all made the ultimate sacrifice over the last year in my district alone, and they are on my mind this week and each and every day along with the other fallen officers across our country.

10181,topic-id,404,"Mr.President, in my home State of Indiana, we take great pride when our children display exemplary academic work and interest in our Nation's history. We are very proud of four Hoosier middle school students from Warsaw, IN, who are using their research skills to tell the story of a heroic veteran for their National History Day project entitled ``Taking a Stand at Pearl Harbor.''  I am pleased to recognize these four fine young men, Keller Bailey and Jason Benyousky of Washington STEM Academy, Geoffrey Hochstetler, who is educated at home, and Ryun Hoffert of Eisenhower Elementary; who worked together to research, write, and perform a series of skits around the theme, ``Making a Stand in History.'' These boys chose to design their project around the events of December 7, 1941, the day the Japanese attacked Pearl As part of their detailed research, the students read a book by a veteran and Pearl Harbor survivor Donald This book inspired[[Page S3395]]one of the scenes of their presentation, which depicts the heroic actions of Boatswain's Mate 2nd Class Joe George's rescue of six men from the sinking USS Ryun Hoffert went the literal extra mile and traveled to Pearl Harbor for the 75th anniversary of the attack to meet with local experts and see the memorials erected in honor of our fallen heroes. After this exhaustive research effort, these dedicated students each wrote scenes for their presentation.  According to their project sponsor, Richard Rooker, each student brought his unique gifts to the team: ``Keller displayed indefatigable energy. Jason contributed his outstanding acting ability. Geoffrey lent the team his calm and steady demeanor, and Ryun brought his insatiable curiosity about history to the project.''  In February, their presentation won first place in the district competition. They continued to revise, refine, and practice their presentation, and their perseverance paid off on May 6, when they placed first in the junior division in the Indiana State competition. This week, they will compete at the national competition at the University of  I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Keller, Jason, Geoffrey, and Ryun for their hard work, patriotism, and success in the Indiana State competition for National History I would also like to recognize the supportive parents, teachers, and advisers who helped the students along the way, especially Mr.On behalf of all Hoosiers, we are proud of your creativity and determination; your entire State is cheering for you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgS3394-3.txt,1256,TRIBUTE TO HOOSIER STUDENTS,2017.0,12.0,May
