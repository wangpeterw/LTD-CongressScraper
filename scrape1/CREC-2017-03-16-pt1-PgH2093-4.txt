                 LET'S FIX AMERICA'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

  (Mr. LOUDERMILK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, whatever possessed someone to think that 
a faceless, nameless bureaucrat in an ivory tower in Washington, D.C., 
who has never been to my district, who has never met with the people, 
think they know more about what is good for the family and the children 
of my people than they do?
  That was a question that was asked of me by a constituent this 
weekend.
  What makes you think you know better what is best for my family and 
my children than I do?
  He was referring to the Affordable Care Act.
  He went on to tell me that he used to have an insurance policy that 
cost $300 a month that he could use. Today, he is paying $1,600 a month 
for something he cannot use and he doesn't want, but by the force of 
law, he is forced to have.
  He went on to say: Will you please, please do something now to fix 
this problem?
  Another person said: Are you going to be able to get to a reform to 
fix America's health care that you like?
  My answer was no.
  We are not going to get to something I like, but that is not the 
issue here. Why? Because America is not ready for what I want. That is 
true Federalism, that this place has nothing to do with health care.
  We can't get there right now because we don't have the votes, but we 
can get to something we need. I call upon my brothers and sisters in 
the House: Let's fix America's healthcare system. We have the 
opportunity to do it now.
