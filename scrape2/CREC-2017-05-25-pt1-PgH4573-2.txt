                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  The Members of this people's House will be leaving for the Memorial 
Day recess. As they meet with their respective constituents, give them 
the gifts of wisdom and discernment, that in their words and actions 
they will do justice, love with mercy, and walk humbly with You. May 
they also have the attentiveness that is called for to hear the 
concerns of those whom they represent.
  On this weekend especially, we remember those men and women who have 
given their lives in service to our country. Bless them with 
everlasting peace and give consolation and peace to those who mourn 
them.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
