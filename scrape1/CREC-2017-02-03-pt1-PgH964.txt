                      ISIS AND FORCES OF DARKNESS

  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, as many have explained on this floor, 
Trump's executive order, his Muslim ban, repudiates our values and 
violates our Constitution.
  After 20 years on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I think it is 
important to come to this floor and explain how that executive order is 
harmful to our national security. Trump's executive order plays right 
into the ISIS narrative. It says that there is a clash of civilizations 
and that all Islam is our enemy. ISIS, which has, perhaps, a few 
hundred thousand followers, dreams of convincing all of Islam--dreams 
of convincing 1.5 billion Muslims--that they are at war with America 
and the West.
  We do not have a clash of civilizations. We have a clash between 
civilization and the forces of darkness bent on destroying 
civilization, whether they reside in Raqqa or at 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue.
