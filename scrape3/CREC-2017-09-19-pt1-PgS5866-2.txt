SENATE RESOLUTION 264--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2017 AS ``NATIONAL KINSHIP 
                              CARE MONTH''

  Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Casey, Mr. Kaine, and Ms. 
Klobuchar) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 264

       Whereas in September 2017, ``National Kinship Care Month'' 
     is observed;
       Whereas nationally 2,700,000 children are living in kinship 
     care with grandparents or other relatives;
       Whereas nationally more than 125,000 kinship children in 
     foster care are placed with grandparents or other relatives, 
     with more than 2,570,000 kinship children supported outside 
     of the foster care system;
       Whereas grandparents and other relatives are increasingly 
     providing caring homes for children because of the opioid 
     crisis;
       Whereas grandparents and relatives residing in urban, 
     rural, and suburban households in every county of the United 
     States have stepped forward out of love and loyalty to care 
     for children during times in which biological parents are 
     unable to do so;
       Whereas kinship caregivers provide safety, promote well-
     being, and establish stable households for vulnerable 
     children;
       Whereas kinship care enables a child--
       (1) to maintain family relationships and cultural heritage; 
     and
       (2) to remain in the community of the child;
       Whereas kinship care is a national resource that provides 
     loving homes for children at risk;
       Whereas kinship caregivers face daunting challenges to keep 
     countless children from entering foster care;
       Whereas the Senate is proud to recognize the many kinship 
     care families in which a child is raised by grandparents or 
     other relatives;
       Whereas the Senate wishes to honor the many kinship 
     caregivers who throughout the history of the United States 
     have provided loving homes for parentless children;
       Whereas National Kinship Care Month provides an opportunity 
     to urge people in every State to join in recognizing and 
     celebrating kinship caregiving families and the tradition of 
     families in the United States to help raise children; and
       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children 
     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, 
     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates September 2017 as ``National Kinship Care 
     Month'';
       (2) encourages Congress to implement policies to improve 
     the lives of vulnerable children and families;
       (3) honors the commitment and dedication of kinship 
     caregivers and the advocates and allies who work tirelessly 
     to provide assistance and services to kinship caregiving 
     families; and
       (4) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the 
     outcomes of all vulnerable children through parts B and E of 
     title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), 
     and other programs designed--
       (A) to support vulnerable families;
       (B) to invest in prevention and reunification services; and
       (C) to ensure that extended family members who take on the 
     role of kinship caregivers receive the necessary support.
