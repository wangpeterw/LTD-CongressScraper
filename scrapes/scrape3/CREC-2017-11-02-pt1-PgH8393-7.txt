                        CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS

  (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
support the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This critical healthcare 
legislation provides a 5-year extension to the CHIP program that so 
many children and low-income families rely on.
  In my district alone, over 21,000 children use CHIP for access to 
low-cost healthcare services.
  I am also proud that this legislation includes a needed 2-year 
extension of funding for community health centers. This is an issue I 
have worked hard on, as almost 95,000 people in my district receive 
critical healthcare and preventative services from these centers.
  There is still much more work to do to improve our healthcare system 
for families in the north country.
  In Congress, I will keep fighting to protect the programs our 
district depends on, and I will continue working toward the affordable, 
high-quality healthcare system that my district deserves.
