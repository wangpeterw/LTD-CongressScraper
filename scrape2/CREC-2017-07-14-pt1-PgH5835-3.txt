                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  We commend to You the Members of Congress, the President, his 
Cabinet, and all who struggle to lead Your people. May they acknowledge 
Your sovereignty over all events and times.
  Renew America in confident faith and deepen our commitment to seek 
peace--help us to work together when confronting those whom we find it 
difficult to trust, but with whom we must try to forge a common future 
of security and prosperity.
  In all, inspire the Members of this people's House with Your spirit, 
that all might seek to find first areas of agreement where possible, 
and openness to honest exchange where it is not.
  May all that is done within the people's House be for Your greater 
honor and glory.
  Amen.
