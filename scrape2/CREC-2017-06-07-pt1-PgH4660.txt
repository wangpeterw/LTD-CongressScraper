                 CONGRATULATING VIRGIN ISLAND STUDENTS

  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this month marks the end of the school 
year for students. And, of course, that means graduation and promotion 
celebrations.
  I want to congratulate all of our students on their achievements and 
their proud family members.
  To our teachers, faculty, and staff, we thank you for your continued 
commitment to educating our children. We know that there are many 
challenges in today's learning environment, but amid the challenges we 
face, you stand strong. We appreciate all of your work.
  As a representative in Congress for the Virgin Islands, I pledge to 
continue to support legislation and initiatives that make our children, 
teachers, and administrators a priority.
  To the students of the U.S. Virgin Islands, I have a message for you: 
During these summer months, please take this time to continue to learn, 
participate in the Governor's reading challenge, find a new hobby, 
work, and please explore the natural wonder of our home, the Virgin 
Islands of the United States. Be safe, and best wishes to you all as 
you continue a productive educational journey. Have a safe and fun-
filled summer.
