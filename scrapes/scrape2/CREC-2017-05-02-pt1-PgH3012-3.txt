        SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR ECONOMY

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the economic engines of 
our economy.
  There are over 800,000 small businesses in North Carolina, generating 
$800 million annually, accounting for half of all private sector 
employment in our State, and regularly creating more than 20,000 jobs a 
year.
  We have seen a 38 percent increase in minority-owned businesses in 
the last decade, and across the U.S., 85 million people rely on 25 
million small businesses for employment.
  As vice ranking member of the Small Business Committee and ranking 
member on the Investigations, Oversight and Regulations Subcommittee, I 
recognize the impact that small businesses have on our communities. 
Lawmakers must continue to encourage innovation and support legislation 
that allows local companies to grow.
  I am proud to introduce the Score Act of 2017 during the 54th annual 
National Small Business Week, legislation that authorizes the SCORE 
program, connecting experienced businessowners with budding 
entrepreneurs for advice and mentorship, and it ensures its funding for 
at least 3 years.
  Small businesses make the American Dream possible, and I am committed 
to standing up and speaking out on their behalf.
