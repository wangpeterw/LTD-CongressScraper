                      HONORING PASTOR B.R. DANIELS

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Pastor B.R. Daniels as 
he celebrates 45 years of service at Beth Eden Missionary Baptist 
Church in Fort Worth, Texas, on February 18.
  From an early age, it was his love for the Word of God that led him 
to pursue a degree in religious studies at the Southern Bible Institute 
in Dallas. In addition, Pastor Daniels graduated with a master's degree 
and a Ph.D. in Christian education from Aspen Theological Seminary in 
Denver, Colorado.
  Installed as the pastor of Beth Eden in 1972, his leadership has 
helped raise the church's profile and membership to nearly 1,000 
members. It is due to Pastor Daniels' dynamic leadership that a $3.2 
million building program was completed and celebrated in 2016.
  A pillar of the community, Pastor Daniels continues to be an active 
member of the community by leading the region as moderator of the 
Northwestern District Baptist Association while also holding various 
civic leadership positions around the city of Fort Worth and Tarrant 
County.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to celebrate his 45th pastoral anniversary 
and his years of spiritual leadership to our community.
