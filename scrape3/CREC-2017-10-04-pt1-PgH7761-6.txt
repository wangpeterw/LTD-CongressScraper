                   HONORING THE LIFE OF NOLAN WATSON

  (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life of Nolan Watson, a Georgia resident and veteran of the United 
States Air Force, who joined our Heavenly Father earlier this year 
after battling kidney cancer for over a decade.
  In 1966, Mr. Watson was one of the heroic men during the Cold War who 
was involved in the cleanup efforts after a B-52 bomber collided with a 
KC-135 tanker over Palomares, Spain, releasing four hydrogen bombs. 
After his service, Mr. Watson suffered from severe medical problems and 
was ultimately diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2002.
  Nolan is survived by his lovely wife, Nona, who has been a fierce and 
devoted advocate for her husband, working tirelessly throughout the 
years to

garner the recognition these young men deserved for the sacrifices they 
made responding to this unfortunate disaster.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to stand with me and join me for a 
moment of silence to honor the life and legacy of Nolan Watson, a hero 
who deserves our respect and who will be sorely missed.
