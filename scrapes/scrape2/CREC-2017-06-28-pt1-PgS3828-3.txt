                      REMEMBERING ALEX VILLAMAYOR

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest 
condolences to the family of Alex Villamayor, whose life was cut short 
2 years ago in Paraguay. Alex was a son, brother, nephew, grandson, and 
friend. At just 16 years old, Alex taught us that we should not lead 
our lives with cynicism and hate, but with love and kindness. Even 
though Alex is no longer physically with us, he continues to shed light 
on the unjust and save lives through his story.
  I call upon the Government of Paraguay to do everything in its power 
to guarantee an impartial, transparent, and expeditious trial so that 
justice is upheld for Alex and his family.

                          ____________________
