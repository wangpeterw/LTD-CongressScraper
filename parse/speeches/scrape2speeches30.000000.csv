Over the last 10 years, I have become fairly proficient at congratulating Mr. Today, Mr.Speaker, I am not going to tell a lot of jokes because, as we all know, at the Republican practice the Wednesday morning before, an individual opened fire on the Republican team and wounded the majority whip, Mr.Scalise; both Capitol Police officers who were part of Mr.Scalise's security detail; and two volunteers who were assisting us in our practice. So I don't have a lot of jokes today, Mr. I do want to congratulate Mr.Doyle and his team. They played fair and square. They were extremely gracious before the game. We had a unity prayer. We had a unity introduction of the players. The night before, Mr.Doyle and his team invited the Republican team, believe it or not, to the Democratic political headquarters. I went with my two sons. The food was great, and the fellowship was even better.  So I do sincerely want to congratulate him and his players for playing the best game. They deserved to win.  Mr.Speaker, I want to commend the Republican team. We had approximately 25 of our Members at the practice. Every one of them exhibited courage and composure. They all looked out for their fellow teammates.  We had an equivalent number of staff and volunteers. We had two of the best Capitol Hill police officers it is possible to have. They risked their lives.  I want to say this, and then I will yield to my good friend, Mr. The shooter that attacked the Republican baseball team, Mr.Speaker, was attacking democracy. When we are at full strength on this floor, there are 435 of us. Every one of us is a winner. We get here because we have won an election. We get here because we have got the faith of approximately 600,000 or 700,000 people who are depending on us to be their voice for democracy. We argue. We debate. But as I said in one of my interviews, before our names is United States  Last Thursday, at the baseball game, we were united. I could not be prouder of being a Member of this body, Mr.I could not be prouder of the Republican team, including our MVP, Ron DeSantis; our honorary MVP, Steve Scalise; and every member of the Republican team.  Would the members of the Republican team stand and let's acknowledge their heroism.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Michael Doyle).

7502,topic-id,931,"Mr.Speaker, May is the month when people come together across the country to acknowledge the half million young people in the Nation's child welfare system. This is National Foster Youth  The child welfare system is designed to protect children whose parents or caretakers have abused or neglected them.  I am proud to say that Members of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth are hosting over 100 young adults from 98 different congressional districts from the National Foster Youth I thank all of the Members of Congress who are allowing a young adult to shadow them this morning. They are here today on the Hill shadowing Members of Congress to share their stories, their challenges, their successes, and to help us understand how to improve the child welfare system.[[Page H4514]]  On Monday evening, the National Foster Youth Institute had a forum in which we were able to hear from many of the youth. They raised several issues. The young adults have already accomplished a lot in their life, and many are here to learn about the Capitol, their Members of Congress, the legislative process, but also to teach us.  Here are several of the issues that the young folks raised on Monday:  One individual raised the challenge of being raised in the system and being separated from his siblings. He said that he had six siblings, and even had a twin. It was very sad and upsetting to him when his twin was sent to one city and he had to live in another city. It took him many months to reestablish a relationship with his siblings.  Another individual told us about her parents having a drug problem. She didn't understand why she was removed and why her parents weren't helped. In fact, she felt as though the court system used her as leverage over her parents in a way, to tell her parents that they should sober up if they wanted to retain custody. She then told us that the result was both of her parents passed away. She believed that they passed away from their addiction, and that one of the things that made their addiction worse was the fact that she had to be removed from the parents.  Another individual raised the issue of sex trafficking. We have been discussing legislation in the We have passed several bills related to sex trafficking. But one of the things that many Members of Congress have grown to be aware of over the last few years is that a large percentage of underage girls, and some boys, who get caught up in sex trafficking are actually foster youth that have fallen through the cracks.  Any time a foster youth falls through the cracks, the government is responsible. When we remove children from their parents, we, meaning the government, become the parents and we are responsible for them. So we are working on legislation to improve that.  Another individual raised the issue that she was adopted, but the adoption didn't work out. She asked: Why don't social workers follow up after a child has been adopted, just to make sure that everything is okay? That adoption didn't work out, and she had a lot of challenges afterwards.  Another individual told us, in no uncertain terms, that, although many young people come to the Capitol and volunteer in internships, foster youth would love to be here and participate in internships as well, but when foster youth turn 18 and become an adult, we--essentially meaning the government again--wash our hands of them and put them out on the street. How can a young person volunteer? They need to be paid. She raised the issue that we should have interns at the Capitol, but they should be paid.  Those were very important issues and they all raise areas of policy that need to be addressed.  I am very honored and fortunate to have three outstanding young individuals with me. I want to tell you about them.  Doniesha Thomas is from Los She was in foster care for 20 years. She aged out of the system, but during the time she was in foster care, she was moved seven different times.  She grew up in Los She was in a foster home with her sister and brother. She was fortunate that her siblings were able to be kept together. She described her experience in the foster home wasn't the best. She said that, sadly, her foster mother was abusive mentally, physically, and emotionally.  She eventually left the home and then had to move from place to place, but she persevered and is currently a college student at Los Angeles Trade She is majoring in the administration of justice and minoring in paralegal studies. It is her dream to be a probation officer for juveniles. She also hopes to one day open up a group home so that, growing up in the system and knowing what the problems are, she can start a program where she addresses those problems.  The second individual, Leonardo Jimenez, is 21 years old. He is also from Los He was recently aged out of foster care. He decided to participate in the program because, as he gets older, he wants to learn to be a part in helping foster youth in his community.  The last individual is Michael He is from He was in foster care for 5 years and had 13 different placements, but he is succeeding in Ohio, working in the area of child support.  Mr.Speaker, I hope that we remember the foster youth in our country this month.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4513-2.txt,1996,EDUCATION FUNDING IN THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET,2017.0,24.0,June

7550,topic-id,900,"Mr.President, I am proud and honored to follow my colleague from Oregon who has been such a steadfast leader when it comes to our Nation's healthcare and insurance and particularly when it comes to women's healthcare. I have been really proud to stand side by side with him, Senator Murray, and other colleagues who have been here today.  I must say, sometimes on the floor of the Senate, at this hour of the day or night, we can feel alone, as though no one is listening, but I know millions of Americans are listening because of the voices like my colleague Senator I would join him in urging our fellow Americans to make their voices heard, to be loud, and we are going to be loud in Connecticut this Friday, at 1:30 in the afternoon, when I continue the emergency field hearing we began on Monday, giving the people of Connecticut an opportunity to make their voices and their faces known, seen, and heard because, unfortunately, that opportunity has been denied by a process that has been secretive and hasty. Secrecy and speed are a toxic recipe for any democracy. They can disguise deception and mistakes.  I am here to call attention to one of the profoundly mistaken courses that this new bill is expected to take. There is no doubt in my mind that the Republican bill will contain language to defund one of the most respected and accessible and significant of our healthcare providers in the United States; namely, Planned  I have been an advocate of women's healthcare and reproductive rights and choice since my days as a law clerk for Justice Blackmun in the 1970s. Our Nation has made progress--halting and sometimes it steps back--but Planned Parenthood has helped to improve, enduringly and profoundly, women's healthcare.  In my home State of Connecticut, Planned Parenthood has 17 sites and services for more than 60,000 women and men, and they have been covered by the Medicaid That coverage will be decimated under the measure we expect to see. Defunding these clinics could do irreparable damage to the communities that Planned Parenthood clinics serve.  As a nurse practitioner at Planned Parenthood in Southern Connecticut told me, patients trust the services they receive at Planned Parenthood because they rely on them, and they know Planned Parenthood clinics have[[Page S3694]]one interest and only one interest in mind, which is the well-being of their patients and clients. Planned Parenthood has, therefore, expanded into primary care. Not only does Amina provide family planning services and STI and cancer screenings, she now screens for and treats patients for chronic medical conditions that disproportionately impact low-income patients, such as depression, diabetes, asthma, and hypertension.  In her clinic, my friend who is a nurse practitioner there, Amina, has seen her primary care practice grow from 8 patients initially to 112 a few months later. Her clinic offers these services, in addition to the contraceptive services that are so important to many patients. Patients who will simply go unseen and uncared for have this care at Planned Parenthood, but they will not have it if Planned Parenthood is defunded.  In Connecticut, other kinds of healthcare providers, like health centers and hospitals, would need to increase their capacity to provide contraceptive care, and they would have to increase it by 228 percent to overcome the care deficit left by defunding Planned With these craven attempts to immediately and completely defund Planned Parenthood as a part of TrumpCare--really TrumpCare 2.0--it will be even more challenging for so many women to get the healthcare they need and deserve.  Defunding of Planned Parenthood also jeopardizes gains our Nation made for women of color and patients who are served in areas where there are few, if any, other options.  Planned Parenthood centers and clinics are nothing short of a lifeline for quality healthcare in the underserved communities. The fact is, the Affordable Care Act has worked for women and particularly women of color. Planned Parenthood and other women's healthcare providers are an integral part of that success story, but it isn't only women of color, it isn't only women in underserved communities, and it isn't only women. It is families who have benefited--men, women, and children--because the quality of healthcare and preventive healthcare, particularly, has been raised immeasurably.  To decimate that network of care would be profoundly destructive to our I hope my colleagues will think again before they side with the forces of degrading and demeaning women who seek those protections. We need a national effort and appreciation to make sure our conscience prevails because the repeal of these provisions would mean they are gone, and all women--including healthy women--will see insurance costs rise. It is absolutely clear to me that the Affordable Care Act repeal would be cruel. It would be mean and most particularly to the women who depend on Planned Parenthood for so many of the services that help them and their families.  I hope my Republican colleagues will cease to ignore and deny these benefits. We stand ready to work with them to improve the Affordable Care Act, not to repeal it, not to decimate or destroy it, to improve it, to mend its defects, to preserve Planned Parenthood, to make sure the women of America and their families have the healthcare they need and deserve.

7541,topic-id,294,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the invaluable work of nurses. With 3 million nurses nationwide, these men and women make up the largest providers of healthcare in the country. I am proud to acknowledge the talents and successes of these caregivers as we recognize National Nurses  These dedicated health professionals provide quality care to patients every[[Page S2913]]single day. Their dedication and passion to caregiving is constantly on display, often during critical and stressful situations. The work they do helps save lives and gives reassurance to patients facing questions about their health. While on the front lines of healthcare delivery they are also frequently the first line of communication when health problems arise. These healthcare heroes wear many hats.  Providing nurses with the resources they need to deliver quality care needs to be a priority. Last week, members of the Emergency Nurses Association from Arkansas shared with me one legislative fix to improve patient care. Amending the Controlled Substance Act to allow paramedics and other emergency medical services professionals to continue to administer controlled substances like pain narcotics when allowed by State law would improve emergency outcomes, particularly in rural areas where a medical facility may be miles away. That is why I cosponsored legislation to amend the Controlled Substance  Nurses are taking on more responsibilities in our evolving healthcare system in order to meet the needs of our aging population. They are being asked to do more with less and still provide the quality patient care they are known for.

7556,topic-id,777,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 451 provides for a structured rule to consider a bill out of the Energy and Commerce Committee pertaining to the Environmental Protection Agency's ozone standards. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the majority and the minority on the Energy and Commerce The rule further makes in order six Democratic amendments for consideration. Finally, the minority is afforded the customary motion to recommit.  Under the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards program, the EPA is tasked with setting standards and regulations for certain defined pollutants, including ground-level ozone, commonly referred to as smog. The Environmental Protection Agency has set these standards and adjusted when necessary in 1971, 1979, 1997, and 2008.  Since 1980, ozone levels have declined by 33 percent, according to the EPA, thanks in large part to diligent State oversight of industries and planning, along with weather patterns and outside temperatures, which all contribute to ozone levels.  Ozone has been a particular issue in the north Texas area that I represent, where hot summer days and prevailing southerly breezes cause air quality issues that affect outdoor activities and may create health concerns.  In 2015, the EPA proposed changing the 2008 ozone standards that had not yet been fully implemented, despite nearly 700 national, State, and local organizations and stakeholders requesting that the EPA allow the 2008 standards to be adopted before moving the goalposts on these regulated parties. In fact, the EPA did not publish its implementation regulations for the 2008 standards until March of 2015, nearly 7 years after the standards had been issued, and then promptly that same year decided to change the rules entirely.  The EPA ignored the request from stakeholders and moved ahead with lowering the ozone standard, manipulating scientific findings in order to justify the move. In fact, nearly two-thirds of the so-called benefits that the EPA claimed would result from this new standard are not based on ozone reductions at all, but instead on reductions from an entirely different pollutant regulated under a different set of rules.  H.806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017, is an important step toward focusing the EPA's efforts at science-based regulating of the environment and a rejection of the politically motivated actions of the previous 8 years.  The legislation phases in implementation of the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards, extending the date for final designation for the 2015 standard to 2025, aligning the permitting requirements of the Clean Air Act with the implementation schedule set by the This allows for a thoughtful and methodical implementation process to proceed at the State level to address the varied needs and nuances that exist in the States based upon industry and based upon weather patterns.[[Page H5928]]  The measured approach contained in H.806 will allow States to pursue cost-effective and practical implementation plans to enforce the EPA's ozone standards. Further, it utilizes a process that will benefit from the States' practical experiences at implementing previous ozone standards.  Nothing in the legislation before the House today changes any existing air quality standards or regulations. Let me say that again. Nothing in the legislation before the House today changes any existing air quality standards or regulations.  This legislation is focused solely on providing States and businesses the proper tools, time, and flexibility to implement the EPA's regulations most effectively. This is a goal we should all support.  According to the EPA's own analysis in 2015, the vast majority of U.counties will meet the 2015 standards by 2025, the same timeframe that the bill before us contemplates implementation.  H.806 is important, however, because it gives States the flexibility to focus on the most pressing environmental issues in each individual State, rather than having the EPA dictate where resources must be used regardless of need.  The Energy and Commerce Committee has been reviewing the issue of finding the correct balance for ozone implementation for years and has crafted legislation that reflects that measured approach.  In 2015, I wrote to the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee expressing my concern over the EPA's expedited implementation of the 2015 standards despite concerns on how the ozone rules could affect other pollutants, namely nitrogen oxide, which has been found to actually increase inversely when ozone levels decrease. This increase of nitrogen oxide is especially present in urban environments where many at-risk populations live.  Given the many implementation questions surrounding EPA's political decision to move forward with the 2015 standards, H.806 is a prudent and justified course that this government should be taking.  For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support today's rule and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

7559,topic-id,930,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr.Speaker, I want to reference a letter that I sent on May 23, 2014, to Christopher Frey, who was then the chairman of the EPA Clean Air Scientific Advisory  The letter reads:  ``I understand that, due in part to recommendations by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, EPA's new draft Health Risk and Exposure Assessment for Ozone concludes that''--I am quoting from the EPA here--`` `mortality from short- and long-term ozone exposures and respiratory hospitalization risk is not greatly affected by meeting lower standards.' ''  Again, that is from the EPA draft of the Health Risk and Exposure Assessment for Ozone, from May of 2014.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the letter.[[Page H5932]]                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                                     May 23, 2014.     Christopher Frey,     Chair, EPA Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee,          Distinguished University Professor, Department of Civil,          Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North          Carolina State University, Raleigh,       Dear Frey: In January 2015, pursuant to a court imposed      deadline, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is      expected to propose revisions to the current National Ambient      Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone set in 2008. The      agency's proposed revisions may well represent the most      costly standards the agency has ever sought to impose on the      U.economy. The Administrator's judgments about the      adequacy of the standard and any such proposed revisions      accordingly will be subject to close Congressional oversight      and scrutiny. A critical question will concern whether the      Administrator has fully and clearly evaluated the risk      reduction estimates associated with the standard and proposed      alternatives.       The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee's (CASAC) by      statute serves to review the information supporting EPA's      assessment of the existing NAAQS for ozone and to help assure      that EPA conducts a full and objective evaluation of risks      and risk tradeoffs in its proposals. In the context of this      review, given the potential costs and impacts of any revision      to the current standard, I believe it is critically important      that such risks and risk tradeoffs are fully evaluated.       Presently, EPA appears to be moving forward without fully      addressing important risk tradeoff questions regarding the      impact of emissions reductions of nitrogen oxides      (NOX), which CASAC has also been reviewing, on      ozone concentrations. I write today to draw your attention to      concerns that have been raised that EPA has not fully      evaluated the risk reduction outcomes identified in the      agency's risk assessments used for the upcoming proposed      rule.       I understand that, due in part to recommendations by CASAC,      EPA's new draft Health Risk and Exposure Assessment for Ozone      (HREA) concludes that ``mortality from short- and long-term      [ozone] exposures and respiratory hospitalization risk is not      greatly affected by meeting lower standards.'' According to      the HREA, this is due in part to the fact that further      reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions will      actually increase ozone levels on low concentration days in      urban areas where at-risk populations live.       For instance, in modeling a 50 percent reduction in      NOX emissions from existing levels, the HREA found      that April-to-October ozone exposures actually increased for      large percentages of exposed populations in several major      urban areas where at-risk populations are likely to live,      including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, and In      other words, even though reducing NOX emissions      may yield direct benefits by reducing NOX related      health effects, they may also lead to increased ozone      levels--the issue under review by the CASAC Ozone Review            If EPA is correct to assume that all ozone exposures should      be of concern, any increases in ozone exposure throughout the      year are important to assess. However, testimony submitted to      CASAC this past March notes that EPA's analysis likely      underestimates the potential for increases in ozone exposures      because the agency does not evaluate the effect of      NOX emission reductions on ozone levels throughout      the full year. Specifically, EPA's analysis of      epidemiologically-based short-term mortality and morbidity      risks fails to consider the likely increases in ozone levels      during the cooler months of the year when NOX      emissions are reduced. This March testimony reported that      such a full year-round analysis of the impact of      NOX emission reductions in urban Philadelphia      resulted in increases in total ozone exposures.       The EPA's analysis itself notes that wintertime increases      in ozone ``were significant in 11 out of the 15 areas''      evaluated when nationwide NOX emissions were cut      ``almost in half,'' but fails to address how increases in      wintertime ozone levels from further NOX      reductions will affect the proposed health benefits of      meeting a lower ozone standard. Potential changes in      wintertime ozone levels also pose a problem for EPA's      assessment of mortality risks from long-term exposure to      ozone.       In light of these shortcomings in analysis, we ask that you      recommend that EPA conduct a full year-round analysis of the      effect of further NOX emission reductions on the      epidemiologically-based, short-term mortality and morbidity      health benefits front meeting a lower ozone standard. This      should be done in a manner that clearly distinguishes between      exposure changes projected for urban, suburban, and rural      portions of each of the Urban Study In addition, EPA      should provide a discussion of the limitations of projecting      future mortality risks from long-term exposure given that the      epidemiological study used did not account for potential      differences in wintertime ozone levels.       Finally, I understand that transcripts of your public      proceedings may not always be preserved for future public      access and review. If this is the case, I ask that you ensure      that CASAC preserve a full transcript or recording of the      telephone conference and related public deliberations for      future public access and review.       Thank you for your attention to this request.           Sincerely,                                          Michael Burgess, M.

7565,topic-id,1822,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that was sent by Representative Joe Barton, who was then the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and myself, as the ranking member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, June 11, 2010, asking for the economic data that the EPA was supposed to provide regarding their proposed rule changes back in 2010.                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2010.     Lisa Jackson,     Administrator, U.Environmental Protection Agency,     Washington,       Dear Administrator Jackson: While the President has      repeatedly stated that job creation and economic growth are      his top priorities, in the environmental arena it appears the      Administration is allowing ideology to trump objective      science and sound public policy, and is issuing new rules      that will significantly impede economic development and      growth throughout the United States, In particular, we are      concerned that the Administration, through the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA), is promulgating a whole host of      unworkable, multi-billion dollar environmental regulations      without fully considering all available scientific      information, and without regard to, the realistic compliance      costs, job impacts, or the ability of states, municipalities      and/or businesses to implement the new regulations.       In the past we have expressed very serious concerns about      the Administration's global warming regulations and EPA's      process for developing its endangerment finding, the agency's      highly expedited issuance of that finding, and the agency's      reliance on the scientific assessments of outside groups,      including the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on      Climate Change (IPCC), without a[[Page H5933]]     careful and critical examination of their conclusions and      findings. Further, we have significant concerns about the      potentially hundreds of billions of dollars or more in      compliance costs that are triggered by the finding, the over      6 million entities that may ultimately be subject to complex      new permitting requirements, potential enforcement actions,      fines and penalties, and threats of citizen suits and other      third-party litigation. EPA itself has acknowledged that the      stationary source permitting requirements triggered by the      endangerment finding are totally unworkable, and that it      would be administratively impossible for EPA and states to      administer those new requirements, or for employers and      businesses to comply.       We write today regarding another set of multi-billion      dollar regulations proposed by the Obama Administration which      also appear to be extraordinarily expensive and unworkable.      Specifically, in January 2010, EPA proposed new National      Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone,      the main component of smog. NAAQS ozone standards have been      revised a number of times over the past several decades,      including in 1997 when EPA set an 8-hour ``primary'' ozone      standard, as well as an identical ``secondary'' standard, to      a level of 0.08 parts per million (ppm), or effectively 0.084      ppm. While EPA significantly strengthened that standard in      2008 to a level of 0.075 ppm, in January 2010 this      Administration took the unprecedented step of setting aside      the 2008 standards, and proposing its own alternative      standards based on the prior administrative record and a      ``provisional assessment,'' and without conducting a full      review of the currently available scientific and technical      information. EPA is now proposing a new primary ozone      standard within the range of 0.060-0.070 ppm, as well as a      distinct cumulative, seasonal secondary standard within the      range of 7-15 ppm-hours. EPA has also proposed an accelerated      implementation schedule.       We are very concerned about the proposed standards, not      only because there appear to be questions about the      development of the proposed standards, but also because EPA      estimates that the costs would range from $19 billion to $90      billion annually, or nearly a trillion dollars over ten      years. Moreover, it appears, based on EPA's own ozone maps      and estimates, that most counties in the country could      violate the standards, particularly if EPA chooses to set the      standard at the lower end of the proposed range. Further, it      also appears many areas of the country, including rural and      remote areas, could never be in attainment because the      standards are so low that they may exceed natural background      ozone levels, or ozone levels due to foreign emissions from      Asian or other sources.       We understand EPA plans to finalize the proposed ozone      standards by August 31, 2010. Before EPA finalizes such      standards, we believe your agency should provide the Congress      with fuller information about the EPA's process for      developing and proposing the new standards, the counties or      municipalities expected to be in violation, whether the new      standards can realistically be implemented by areas that have      higher ozone levels due to natural background ozone levels or      foreign emissions, and the potential restrictions that the      new standards will place on future economic growth and      development for non-attainment areas.       We request your responses to the following questions within      two weeks of the date of this letter:       1. Under Sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air Act (CAA),      EPA is authorized to set NAAQS for certain criteria      pollutants, including ozone, and the Act sets out specific      procedures for revising those standards.       a. In proposing the new standards, why isn't EPA conducting      a full analysis of all available data, including more recent      data?       b. In proposing the standards, why isn't EPA following the      express procedures set forth in Section 109 of the CAA?       2. Under the Clinton Administration's 1997 ozone standards:       a. What types of measures have been required by state and      local governments to come into compliance with those      standards?       b. What were the estimated costs for compliance with the      1997 standards and how do those compare with estimated costs      for the proposed new standards?       c. What analysis, if any, did EPA conduct relating to the      potential impacts on employment of the 1997 standards?       d. What were EPA's projections with regard to attainment of      the 1997 standards, and approximately how many counties in      the United States have still not been able to come into      compliance?       e. What are the primary reasons for the inability of these      counties to come into compliance?       3. Under the Obama Administration's proposed ozone      standards, we understand that EPA projects, based on 2006-     2008 data, that of the 675 counties that currently monitor      ozone levels, 515 counties (76%) would violate a 0.070 ppm      standard, and 650 counties (96%) would violate a 0.060 ppm      standard.       a. Please identify the 515 counties that would violate a      0.070 ppm standard, and the expected time needed for      attainment.       b. Please identify the additional 135 counties that would      violate a 0.060 ppm standard, and the expected time needed      for attainment.       4. According to the attached map from EPA's Clean Air      Status Trends Network (CASTNET) 2008 Annual Report, it      appears many areas of the country that do not currently have      ozone monitors would also be likely to violate the new smog      standards, including in very rural and remote areas.       a. How many counties don't currently have ozone monitors?       b. Based on CASTNET data and any other data EPA may have      regarding ozone levels in non-monitored counties, how many      additional counties could be in violation of EPA's proposed      ozone standards if a monitor were present? Please identify      those counties using the CASTNET data and any other data      available, and the expected time needed for attainment.       c. Would there be areas with monitored air quality that      attain the proposed standards but that might nevertheless be      considered to be in ``nonattainment'' because they are in a      Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) in which      one monitor or more exceeds the proposed standards?       5. According to the EPA Fact Sheet for the Obama      Administration's proposed ozone standards, the implementation      costs range from $19 to $90 billion annually while EPA      projects the value of the health benefits would range from      $13 to $100 billion per year.       a. What are the primary studies EPA is relying upon in the      development of its health benefits estimates? What are the      major uncertainties in those studies that could affect the      estimates?       b. How many of the health-based studies included in the      criteria document for the proposed ozone standards were based      on statistically significant evidence compared to those      studies that were not?       c. How many of the new health-based studies included in the      provisional assessment for the proposed ozone standards were      based on statistically significant evidence compared to those      studies that were not?       d. Can EPA provide any assurances that the value of the      health benefits will outweigh the implementation costs?       6. Under the Obama Administration's proposed ozone      standards, what control requirements, including offsets,      transportation planning measure or other measures, may apply      to nonattainment areas?       a. It appears the proposed standards would create a      significant number of new nonattainment areas in the Western      United How would nonattainment in rural or remote      Western states and tribal lands be addressed?       b. In the event that an area fails to attain any new      standards by the applicable date, what would be the potential      consequences, including any sanctions or penalties?       c. What will happen to states or localities that cannot      come into compliance with the proposed standards because of a      lack of economically or technically feasible technology      necessary to attain compliance?       d. What will happen to states or localities that have      natural background ozone levels, and/or ozone levels due to      transport from outside the United States, that are currently      close to or exceed the new standards?       i. Will such areas be designated as being in nonattainment?       ii. Will EPA require states or localities to attain      standards lower than concentrations below the non-     controllable background levels?       7. Given, as EPA recognizes, that there would be many new      nonattainment areas, does EPA believe it is realistic to      require states to provide recommendations to EPA by January      7, 2011? Is it reasonable to require State Implementation      Plans by December 2013?       a. If EPA believes these deadlines are realistic, please      explain the basis for that conclusion.       8. Does EPA anticipate requiring separate planning      requirements for a seasonable secondary standard if one is      adopted as proposed? How does EPA plan to implement this type      of secondary standard?       9. Has EPA prepared any analyses of the potential      employment impacts of the proposed standards on specific      sectors of the economy, including the manufacturing and      construction sectors? If yes, please provide copies of such      analyses.       10. Has EPA prepared any analyses of the potential      relocation of production facilities outside the United States      as a result of implementation of the proposed standards? If      yes, please provide copies of such analyses.       11. Has EPA prepared any analyses of the potential impacts      of the proposed standards on small businesses? If yes, please      provide copies of such analyses.       If the EPA withholds any documents or information in      response to this letter, please provide a Vaughn Index or log      of the withheld items. The index should list the applicable      question number, a description of the withheld item      (including date of the item), the nature of the privilege or      legal basis for the withholding, and a legal citation for the      withholding claim.

7570,topic-id,162,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr.Speaker, it is ironic that the gentleman would reference the cost of asthma inhalers. It was, after all, two Congresses ago where the Environmental Protection Agency actually outlawed the manufacture and sale of over-the-counter asthma inhalers and took them away from those of us who suffer from that disease. And, indeed, losing that over-the-counter option for an over-the-counter epinephrine inhaler for the treatment of asthma as a rescue inhaler, we have, indeed, seen the cost of prescription inhalers quadruple over that time frame.  So, in many ways, as an asthma patient, I hold the EPA directly responsible for my inability to get an inexpensive over-the-counter rescue inhaler. And for many asthma patients, who may find themselves caught short, that means a trip to the emergency room and, probably, a $1,200 or $1,500 event that otherwise could have been solved by a Primatene inhaler that sold two for $16.

Mr.Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of an important piece of environmental legislation to protect the lives and health of all Americans while providing smart tools to the States to implement the EPA's standards.  I thank my fellow Texan, Pete Olson, for his work on this legislation, which I know affects his district in the Houston area as much as it does mine in the Dallas-Fort Worth region.  I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on today's rule and to support the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 451 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     2510) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to      authorize appropriations for State water pollution control      revolving funds, and for other purposes. The first reading of      the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on Transportation and      After general debate the bill shall be considered for      amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order      against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion      of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee      shall rise and report the bill to the House with such      amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question      shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments      thereto to final passage without intervening motion except      one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the      Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to      no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day      the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of      business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the      Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.2510.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

It is a great day for this country because we and my colleagues, I believe, will confirm Heather Wilson to be Secretary of the Air  There are many reasons why it is appropriate for Heather Wilson to be Secretary of the Air She has Air Force in her Her father Doug was an Air Force veteran and commercial pilot. Her grandfather flew for Britain's Royal Flying Corps in World War I before coming to the United States and serving as a courier pilot during World War  Heather was to be no different. She was a junior in high school when the Air Force Academy started accepting women. She applied and was appointed there to be part of the Academy's third class with women. She also became the first woman to command basic training and the first woman vice wing commander.  After college she thought she was going to flight school, but those plans changed because she answered the call and was awarded the very prestigious Rhodes It was only the sixth year that women were permitted to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship, and she was a collegiate rower there and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in international relations.  Heather's assignments and accomplishments are many. During her service she was a negotiator and political adviser to the U.Air Force in England and a planning officer for NATO in Belgium, where she worked on arms control negotiations.  Heather left the Air Force because she heeded another call to serve as the Director of European Defense Policy and Arms Control on the staff of the National Security I know she worked very closely with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during the Presidency of George H.Bush, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Warsaw  Heather has always been on an upward trajectory. She left government and started her own company advising defense and scientific corporations, but public service has always called Heather back. In 1995 she was asked to be the cabinet secretary of the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, where she oversaw foster care, adoption, early childhood education, children's mental health, and the juvenile justice system. From there, again, public service kept calling her, and she was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, becoming the first woman to represent New Mexico since the 1940s and the first female veteran elected to a full term in the U.

The result was an agreement that has nearly universal support, with every party committed to reducing carbon emissions. The momentum coming out of COP21 felt unstoppable.  That momentum continued through 2016. On Earth Day, an impressive 175 nations signed the Paris Six months later, and in less than a year's time, the Paris Agreement reached the threshold for entry into force. Up until recently, the United States has led this global effort. The strength of our commitment and diplomacy spurred global enthusiasm for the Paris  Some have said that we are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it. Climate change impacts are apparent in my home State of Recently, Annapolis began experiencing routine tidal flooding. Today's generations of Smith Islanders may be the last as a rising Chesapeake Bay encroaches further ashore each year.  Around the world, climate change is expanding the range and duration of regional wildfire seasons, prolonging extreme droughts in the Middle East and Southern Africa, which I have witnessed firsthand, and has caused Bolivia's Lake Poopo to evaporate entirely, and entire island nations are being swallowed up by the South  The good news is, acting to prevent the worst effects of climate change holds tremendous economic and job growth opportunities for our The world looks toward the United States for leadership, not just in terms of domestic emissions reductions but also in our private sector and academia for clean energy solutions to power the world. Maryland is positioned to be at the forefront of U.leadership in technology innovation.  For example, the University of Maryland, in partnership with the U.Department of Energy and a number of Maryland private sector companies like Redox Energy, are leading the way in developing commercial-scale, in-demand technology that the global energy market is demanding.  In 2015, global investment in renewable energy was nearly $350 billion, which was more than the global investment in fossil fuel energy. The Department of Energy's 2017 U.Energy and Employment Report showed that nearly 1 million Americans work in the energy efficiency, solar, wind, and alternative vehicles sectors. This is almost five times the current employment in[[Page S2790]]the U.fossil fuel electric industry, which includes coal, gas, and oil workers. Even though gas and oil have hit record-low prices on the global market, current and projected price per watt for renewables is also low, making clean energy remarkably affordable and competitive in the market.  The United States stands at the crossroads of global clean energy and climate change leadership, and the policy path we take on these issues could not only shape the strength of our economic future but our overall standing in the world. Forward thinking domestic climate change and clean energy policy, including substantial investments in clean energy R&D and clean energy production incentives, have made the United States an incubator for clean energy investment and entrepreneurship.  We see these things in every State of the Nation--new innovators and investors in the clean energy sector.  Creating a robust domestic market helps U.companies develop tested records of accomplishment, skilled workforces, and scalable products to export around the world to a global energy market that is hungry for clean energy solutions. This is where domestic policy intersects with U.climate diplomacy, which is priming that export market by building good will and faith in U.capacity and commitment.  The United States must not squander the considerable time and effort it took to build the world's confidence in the United States when combating climate change.  The rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the United States severely strained a wide range of diplomacy issues for the Bush administration. That is not just a Senator saying this. Let me quote Secretary of State Colin Powell, when he stated:       Kyoto--this is not talking out of school--was not handled      as well as it should have been, and when the blowback came I      think it was a sobering experience that everything the      American president does has international repercussions.  That was General Powell warning us about the importance of international diplomacy and that our actions have consequences.  Hindsight on the impact U.participation in Kyoto would have had on the protocol's success and on the U.economy is another debate entirely--and we will leave that for a different day--but a clear lesson from the episode is that the United States must not underestimate how seriously the world takes the issue of international cooperation to combat climate change.  Should the Trump administration withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, it will be an incredible insult to our global partners and severely tarnish the trust nations have in the United That distrust will bleed over into all areas of U.diplomacy and cooperation.  While the Paris Agreement does not have enforceable, binding provisions that would punish parties for missing self-determined mitigation targets, nothing precludes other countries from acting outside the confines of the agreement to create uncomfortable conditions for nonmembers. It is worth noting here that if we were to pull out, we would be in a club with Syria and  For example, in November of last year, immediately after the election and during COP22, the New York Times reported that leaders from other countries--so deeply offended by the President-elect's ill-informed rhetoric on climate change and the Paris Agreement--were contemplating implementing border tariffs on goods imported from nations failing to account for carbon emissions.  Staying in the agreement and continuing to advocate for what is in the best interests of the United States could prevent countries from taking such actions.  Many critics of the Paris Agreement sound as though they are stuck in 1997, echoing concerns about the 20-year-old Kyoto Protocol that are simply untrue about the Paris The Paris Agreement takes a different approach to international climate change cooperation by creating an action model that allows for ambitious action and accountability through peer review.  The agreement takes a radically different approach to pollution mitigation that incorporates many conservative principles our Republican colleagues routinely espouse: increased transparency and universal reporting requirements for all parties. All parties, both developing and developed nations, commit to reducing greenhouse gas pollution. All parties determine their own greenhouse gas pollution mitigation commitments. Nationally determined commitments are nonbinding.  Let me repeat that. The nationally determined commitments are nonbinding. It is up to us, our country, to determine how we will meet our targets and when we will meet our targets, and the enforcement is solely within our own means. No international group can enforce any of these commitments on us. That was at the request of many Members of this body, and that was followed in the Paris  The Paris Agreement was forged by the lessons the United States learned from the Kyoto Protocol process. Each addressed commonly criticized elements of the Kyoto  I cannot stress enough how seriously committed leaders around the world are to the success of the Paris For example, it is the top agenda item for both the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings. As such, we absolutely cannot underestimate how thoroughly insulted our friends and allies around the world will be if the United States retreats from the agreement.  Make no mistake, callously disregarding cooperation and partnership with the global community on a crisis that is literally threatening the very physical existence of countries will have consequences for our foreign policy, diplomacy, national security, and U.economic opportunity in an undeniably globalized economy. Retreating from the Paris Agreement puts America alone, not America first, and being alone is tantamount to being last.  The expectation among our partners to the Paris Agreement is that the United States will remain engaged, although a common refrain among foreign delegations is that the world is moving ahead regardless. I take that to mean that if U.leadership falters, other countries will jump at the opportunity and fill the void we create and receive the gains which should have been ours.  U.energy policy should support the goals of the Paris We have already seen hundreds of American corporations make commitments in the agreement's name. There is infinite potential from enhanced U.production of scalable and exportable clean energy technology that the world is demanding to power our collective future. If we do the opposite and retreat from the global effort to combat climate change, then we can expect to lose out on this economic growth potential because countries like Germany, China, and India will gladly take our place as the world's leader for clean energy innovation and finance. I will do what I can to protect against this loss.  It is in our national security interests for the United States to remain actively engaged with the world community to fight climate change.

7590,topic-id,889,"Mr.President, it is good to see you this afternoon.  I rise in support of the nomination of Kristine Svinicki to hold a third term as a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, known as the Many Senators heard from our chairman on the Environment and Public Works Committee in support of this nominee last week, just prior to our cloture vote. I want to add my voice in support of her nomination as well.  Since joining the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have worked closely with my colleagues to strengthen what we call the ``culture of safety'' within the U.nuclear energy industry. In part, due to our collective efforts and the NRC leadership and the Commission's dedicated staff, the NRC continues to be the world's gold standard for nuclear regulatory agencies. However, as I say time and again, that does not mean we can become complacent when it comes to nuclear safety and our NRC oversight responsibilities, a perspective that I am certain is shared by every Member of this body.  Ensuring that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission continues to have experienced and dedicated leadership is one of the most important things that our committee, the Committee on Environment and Public Works, and the Senate can do to maintain a high level of safety and excellence in our Nation's nuclear facilities.  I am quite impressed with our NRC Commissioners, and I am encouraged with their ability to work cooperatively with each other. Each Commissioner, including our current chair, Kristine Svinicki--let me say her name again: People have a hard time saying her name. It is Svinicki.[[Page S3750]]She brings a unique set of skills to the table--something that has served the Commission and our country well.  I continue to have ongoing discussions with our friend, the chairman of the committee, Senator John Barrasso, about the strong interest I and our minority members of the committee have with ensuring parity, as the Senate looks to confirm other nominees to the This is in order to ensure that we have a balance of Democratic and Republican members on the Commission for years to come. It continues to be a priority for me and our Democratic colleagues.  At this time, I support moving Chairman Svinicki through the confirmation process. I do so out of respect for her long service to the NRC and for the need to ensure certainty and predictability within the NRC and its leadership. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting her nomination.  Mr.President, as to this particular nominee, not everybody on the committee or probably in the Senate will support the nomination of Kristine They could have held her up. No one has, and she has moved through our committee expeditiously. She, in my view, should have moved through expeditiously and will be coming before us for an up-or-down vote in a few minutes.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, I want to suggest, as we approach our business later this week with respect to healthcare legislation, that maybe the way we have handled this nomination might be a little bit of a model for the way we can actually work together.  We need to. People in this country say to me all the time and people in my State say to me all the time: Just work together. Get something done.  I know the Presiding Officer and the Senator from West Virginia, who has just entered the Chamber, want to work that way, too, and so do What I think we ought to be doing on healthcare in this body is to look at the ACA and study it up and down. God knows we had enough hearings, roundtables, opportunities to debate it, vote for it, and amend it--over 80, I think, or maybe over 400 amendments, all told, and 80-some days of working on it in 2009.  Rather than have legislation that just Democrats or just Republicans vote to put on the table and to try to push through here on Thursday, my hope is that we will hit the pause button. My hope is that we will hit the pause button, and we will focus--Democrats and Republicans--on trying to figure out what in the Affordable Care Act needs to be fixed and fix it, and figure out what needs to be maintained and preserved and preserve it. That is what I think we should do.  Lo and behold, if we were to do those things, I think we would end up with a better healthcare system with better healthcare coverage and maybe actually make true of the word of the Presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who said he favored healthcare legislation that would actually cover everybody and get better results for less money. That is not a bad goal for us to shoot for. What I have laid out here just very briefly is this: Figure out what needs to be fixed in the Affordable Care Act and fix it, figure out what needs to be preserved and preserve it, and do it not just as Democrats or Republicans, but do it together. I think if we would do that, in the words of Mark Twain, we would confound our enemies and amaze our friends.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

The House majority is, once again, substituting political ideology for sound science. Make no mistake: this is social Darwinism, at its worst, and a blueprint to make America sick again.  The intent of the Clean Air Act and its amendments couldn't be clearer: public health and science should drive public policy. And safe, breathable air must be our paramount goal.  Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to review the public health impacts of carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter, and sulphur dioxide every 5 years and update national air standards.

7393,topic-id,1808,"Madam President, last week our colleagues in the House made a first necessary step to delivering on our promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare and to restore individual choice for a health insurance product that people choose that fits their actual needs, rather than one mandated by Washington, They passed the American Health Care Act, a bill that provides relief to Americans all across the country. With the passage of the AHCA in the House, we have a way forward to do away with government mandating one-size-fits-all healthcare.  Now that the House has passed this legislation, it is up to the Senate to do our job and to keep our promises. To be specific, the promise President Obama made when the Affordable Care Act was passed--actually, he made many promises multiple times--proved not to be true. So in many ways, when President Obama promised that if you like what you have, you can keep it; that if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; that if you like your plan, you can keep your plan--none of that was true, we have now learned.  I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--was sold under false pretenses. So it is up to us to restore individual choice for healthcare products that people want that fit their needs, not one they buy because the government is holding a gun to their heads or threatens to penalize them unless they observe the government mandate to buy that healthcare.  You know, one of the biggest reasons for passing ObamaCare given at the time, back in 2010, was the number of uninsured in the country. Well, the fact is, there are still 30 million people uninsured under ObamaCare even though it has been the law of the land for the last 7 years.  I believe we can and we must do better to deliver affordable care that people choose, that meets their individual needs, and not healthcare they buy simply because the government is coercing them into doing so. We will work together with all of our colleagues who are willing to work with us. If that means Republicans are going to be working with 52 Republicans to get this bill passed, we will get it done and we will get it passed. Ideally, though, it would be better if our Democratic colleagues work with us. But so far, they have steadfastly refused to work with us even though they know that ObamaCare is in shambles and that people are finding they can't find an insurance company where they live because insurance companies are pulling out of those individual markets because they are simply losing too much money or people who can buy ObamaCare policies in the individual markets are finding that their premiums are going through the roof and that the deductibles are unaffordable, thus effectively leaving them without effective coverage.  Even though our Democratic colleagues know that ObamaCare is melting down and is not serving the public the way they promised it would or, in fact, is a positive harm to them because of unaffordable premiums and deductibles, still, so far they are standing on the sidelines and unwilling to participate in this process. I hope that changes at some point in the near future in the interests of the people we represent all across the country.                            Immigration Law  Madam President, I want to spend the rest of my time discussing a specific problem that Texans are all too familiar with; that is, people breaking our immigration laws, and not just breaking our immigration laws but then coming into our local communities and committing additional crimes--assault, murder, rape, you name it--in those communities even after they have entered the country illegally.  This is a difficult issue and one that I don't raise lightly, but it is important that when we talk about sanctuary cities and criminal aliens--these are people who have not just violated the immigration laws, these are people who have doubled down and have no respect for our laws, and, frankly, they have no respect for the communities in which they live. They primarily target the minority community in which they live and work.  We do need to be clear-eyed about this, and we need to treat it seriously. We need to remember that our inaction has some real-life consequences. I have been glad to see the new administration focus on enforcing the law and restoring respect for the rule of law generally and taking quick action to help victims of this type of crime in particular.  I want to take a couple of minutes to tell a story about one particular victim who was really an American hero, one of my constituents who lost his life at the hands of a violent illegal immigrant. That would be Houston police officer Rodney  By all accounts, Rodney Johnson was larger than life, standing about 6 feet 5 inches tall, with a smile just as big. He was a dedicated family man, a husband to fellow Houston Police Department officer Joslyn They had three daughters and two sons. His wife even called Rodney ``the glue that held the family together.''  Rodney was a hero not only to his family but to the local community as well. He was a hero for our country, too, because he was a veteran of the U.military police, the U.Of course he was a hero for the State of Texas as a former corrections officer with the Texas Department of Public  A few years ago, Rodney ran into the flames of a burning building and saved the lives of several children. For that act of courage, he was awarded one of the highest honors a law enforcement officer in Texas can receive, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement's Medal of  Sadly, all of that changed in the fall of 2006. At about 5:30 p.m. on September 21, Officer Johnson pulled over a driver for speeding near Houston Hobby By all accounts, it appeared to be a routine traffic stop, but when the driver, Juan Quintero, could not provide Officer Johnson with a driver's license, he decided to take him into custody. What Officer Johnson did not know is that Mr.Quintero was a hardened criminal illegal immigrant with an extensive record of offenses, as well as deportations and repeated illegal entries into the United Even more tragically, Officer Johnson did not know that this career thug was concealing a 9mm handgun in the waistband of his clothing.  Officer Johnson followed protocol. He handcuffed the criminal suspect, placed him in the back of his squad car, and began writing a police report. But just then, Quintero managed to move his cuffed hands in front of him, reached for his concealed weapon, and opened fire in a cowardly surprise attack, literally killing Rodney Johnson by shooting him in the back.  Quintero was a dangerous career criminal who had no respect for our laws. He had no place in our country and had been deported numerous times by the Federal But somehow he was free and on the streets alongside of our families and heroes like Officer Rodney That should be an embarrassment to everyone who believes in the rule of law and believes that it is government's responsibility at the local, State, and Federal level to keep our communities safe.  This issue is not going to go away, as much as some of our colleagues would like to ignore it. There are countless other stories across the country of victims and their families who have suffered from some of the worst tragedies imaginable because of criminal illegal immigrants.  I am not talking just about people who have entered the country in violation of our immigration laws; I am talking about hardened criminals who target people in their communities for profit or for other reasons. I have spoken about a number of them from the floor before.  In addition to Officer Rodney Johnson, I could tell you the story of Javier Vega, a Border Patrol officer killed by two criminal illegal immigrants while fishing with his family. These criminals had been deported numerous times and committed multiple crimes.  I could tell you about Kevin Will, a Houston police officer killed by a drunk driver who had entered and was living in the United States illegally and who had been deported twice before.  I could tell you more about Josh Wilkerson, a teenager brutally killed by a criminal illegal immigrant in 2010,[[Page S2793]]somebody who had been arrested numerous times before.  I could tell you about Kara Willingham, who was beaten to death by a criminal illegal immigrant; Gustavo Burr or Andres Reyes, kidnapped and held at gunpoint in South Texas; and Neri Garcia, killed by an illegal alien who caused a drunk-driving accident in the Dallas area.  I could tell you story after story after story of the tragedies wrought by a Federal policy that did not enforce our borders or make sure that people, once deported, stayed deported because of the danger they posed to our communities. I believe this really is a matter of political will, and we finally, for the first time in the last 8 years, have an administration and a President who believe in securing our borders and keeping the public safe.  There are larger and other additional discussions we need to have about our flawed immigration system, but the first thing we need to do is regain the public's confidence by securing our borders and enforcing our laws. I am glad President Trump is well on his way to beginning that process under the leadership of GEN John Kelly at the Department of Homeland  The entire point of this is to keep the first commitment that the government makes to American citizens: that we will protect you and keep you safe. That is the government's main job, and that includes protecting all Americans and everyone in the country, literally, from those career criminals who commit offenses and who thumb their noses at our immigration laws. As I said, the Trump administration is finally taking our security seriously, and I am grateful for that. By focusing on violent repeat offenders, we are protecting our citizens and making our communities safer places to live. I don't know how anyone could be against that.  I look forward to doing my part here in the Senate to continue working with this administration to make sure that our laws are enforced and not ignored, such as the one signed into law by Governor Abbott in Texas, making sure that sanctuary cities exist no more and that every local, State, and Federal law enforcement agency cooperates in enforcing the law and making our communities safe and regaining the public's confidence in their own government.

7349,topic-id,338,"Mr.Chair, this is an issue that is, I think, one of most important long-term issues that we deal with not only in California and Western States but, really, in the world, because the fact is that water is a crucial element of the sustainability of all of us, and it always has been.  With the planet clicking 7 billion people a couple of years ago, soon to be 9 billion people by the middle of this century, with climate change clearly impacting our ability to manage our water supplies, we must look at the[[Page H5086]]long-term needs of using all the water tools in our water toolbox. And this is one effort to, in fact, look at how we can provide additional storage capacity not only in California, but elsewhere, so that when we have these periodic times--and we measure water on 10-year averages.  We have had near-record rainfall and snow in the snow-packed mountains of California, which we were blessed with the last 4 months. And after five of the most extremely dry periods of time, to have this rain and snow is wonderful.  But we know that you have got to plan for the future. And so in cases like California where it is either feast or famine, having an additional water reservoir supply is one of the important water management tools in our water toolbox, along with conservation, along with better irrigation technologies which we are implementing, along with conservation of all sorts of kinds, desalinization. All of these matter, as does storage.  This year, millions and millions of acre-feet of water have gone unused because of the lack of storage. This measure will help, but there are other things that we have to do to fix the broken water system in California, in the West, and, really, we can be a template if we better manage our water resources for the entire planet in the light of climate change.  I ask that we support this legislation. It is helpful, and we must do much more.  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5082.txt,1774,WATER SUPPLY PERMITTING COORDINATION ACT,2017.0,22.0,July
7363,topic-id,438,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Marin for yielding me 2 minutes.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today to support this amendment offered by my colleague, Congressman As I said earlier, we need to fix the broken water system in California because reliability is key.  We have a water system that was designed for 20 million people. Today, we have 40 million people living in By the year 2030, we are going to have 50 million people living in  The simple truth is that in the San Joaquin Valley, where I live, which has been ground zero for the impact of an unreliable water supply because of this broken system, we have felt the devastation of the drought. This lack of reliability is due to many factors that have intensified as a result of climate change, impact on regulations, and other factors.  Luckily this year, as I noted earlier, it has been a deluge of rain and snow, and for that we are thankful. But we know in California that it is either feast or famine, and so, sadly, we must plan for the future, and that means including surface storage and using subsurface replenishment of our ground water and all the other water tools that are part of this water toolbox that is critical for the long term.  We need more storage. We need the underlying legislation that this provides. While not completely fixing or resolving our challenges, it is a small step, and, as was noted before, this does not amend NEPA or CEQA, but it simply provides a timeline, and a timeline is a good thing.  This collaboration that this legislation envisions is not too different from the collaboration that the Governor is working with the Department of the Interior on, the proposal to fix the plumbing system in the delta. They have a record of decision that has a timeline.  So if surface storage water is going to receive funding and support under the WIIN Act that we passed in December, matching State funds, along with this effort to provide the timeline, will be helpful.  Let me finally say that sustainability of our agricultural economy, sustainability of putting food and fiber on America's dinner table every night, and helping feed other parts of the world is really what we are talking about here. Reliability is key to making sure that we are sustainable under the adverse impacts of a lack of a fixed water system. We need to address this.  This legislation is a small step in providing timelines for certainty for this collaboration for this process to work better. I urge support of this amendment.

7448,topic-id,544,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about the foundation of healthy living and healthy communities: our food, which comes from our farms.  This month is both National Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month and National Dairy Although we should bring attention to the importance of eating these nutrient-rich foods, dairy and fresh fruits and vegetables play a much larger role, as we know, in the health of our communities and our country, and they do so not just by providing us food.  In California, we know that dairy products and fresh fruits and vegetables are an integral part of our healthy community and a strong economy. Our farmers also provide economic development in other sectors as businesses are created and expand, investments are made, and innovations arise to support the needs of these farmers and farm communities.  But the economic contributions of California agriculture--American agriculture--do not end at our borders. In California, we produce half of the Nation's fruits and vegetables, and we are the top milk producing State in the The men and women who own and work on these farms provide both nutritious food for our families and create thousands of jobs across the country.  We know we must make sure that our farmers have the tools to do so, but our farmers need a reliable source of water, a legal and stable workforce, and access to export markets, in other words, fair trade agreements.  We must also ensure that American agriculture is sustainable. We must continue to ensure that it is sustainable for our well-being and the well-being of future generations to come because the bottom line is food does not come from a grocery store. Food comes from our farmers and the land that they farm.  Our food supply is a national security issue, but it never really gets looked at in that light. So by investing in critical programs and infrastructure projects--by ensuring that our farmers have the water, the workforce, and the access to foreign markets--we are not only investing in our farms, but we are investing in the long-term health and security of our  What is more, people don't realize it, but less than 3 percent of our Nation's population is directly involved in the[[Page H4655]]production of food and fiber. This is part of the amazing development of American agriculture. So equally crucial for the sustainability of American agriculture are our export markets and our trade agreements. That means improving NAFTA, continuing to engage with our European allies, and not turning our back on  In fiscal year 2016, the United States exported $129 billion worth of agricultural products. We not only feed our Nation every night, but we grow more than enough to export abroad. We must maintain good relations with our top trade partners and continue to lower trade barriers to existing and new foreign markets.  So let's not just focus on healthy eating during National Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month and National Dairy Month; let's take the opportunity to discuss how we will work together to ensure that our farmers, ranchers, and dairymen and -women can continue to contribute not only to America's dinner tables, but to our communities and to our economy.

Whereas, President Nixon explained that ``People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook'' when he invited the Joint Committee on Taxation to audit his returns after the Internal Revenue Service gave him an unwarranted tax discount;  Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information to the public;  Whereas, the Chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means, Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Committee on Finance have the authority to request the President's tax returns under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;  Whereas, pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the Constitution, often referred to as the Origination Clause, the House of Representatives has the sole authority to initiate legislation that raises revenue for the national government, and the Committee on Ways and Means is considering a comprehensive reform of the Tax Code;  Whereas, according to media reports analyzing President Trump's leaked 2005 tax return, we know that had his own tax plan been in place, he would have paid an estimated mere 3.48 percent rate instead of a 24 percent rate, saving him $31.3 million;  Whereas, according to The New York Times, the President used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have allowed him to avoid paying any Federal taxes for 18 years;  Whereas, President Trump holds ``interests as the sole or principal owner in approximately 500 separate entities,'' according to his attorneys, and the President's tax plan proposes to cut the tax rate on such ``pass-through'' entities from 39.6 percent to 15 percent;  Whereas, one analysis estimated that President Trump would personally save $6.7 million from two tax breaks included in the Republicans' first tax cut, which they misleadingly call the American Health Care Act;  Whereas, without the President's tax returns, the American people cannot determine how much he will personally benefit from proposed changes to the Tax Code;  Whereas, an ABCNews/Washington Post poll found that 74 percent of Americans would like President Trump to disclose his tax returns and the most-signed petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President's tax return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause, with more than 1,097,000 signatures as of date of this resolution;  Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election better understand the President's financial ties to the Russian Federation, Russian businesses, and Russian individuals;  Whereas, after breaking his pledge to make his tax returns available, President Trump instead presented a one-page letter from a law firm giving him a clean bill of health on any business dealings with Russians, but failed to note that the very same law firm boasted of the ``prestigious honor'' of being named ``Russia Law Firm of the Year'' for 2016;  Whereas, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, before he was fired by President Trump, publicly confirmed that the Bureau has been investigating potential ties between President Trump's campaign and Russia since July and that the Russian President Vladimir Putin favored a Trump electoral victory;  Whereas, President Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, met during the Presidential transition at the behest of the Russian Ambassador with Sergey Gorkov, a graduate of a school run by the successor to the KGB and who was appointed by Vladimir Putin to head a Russian state-owned bank that is on the U.sanctions list;  Whereas, Mr.Kushner proposed establishing a secret back channel of communications directly to Vladimir Putin, even considering the use of Russian embassy facilities to do so;  Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions falsely stated during his Senate confirmation hearing that he ``did not have communications with the Russians,'' when in fact he met at least twice during the campaign with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak;  Whereas, former Director Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that President Trump had asked him in the Oval Office about ``letting Flynn go,'' referring to the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's business ties to Russia;  Whereas, President Trump stated on May 11, 2017, that he had decided that he was going to fire Comey because of ``this Russia thing'';  Whereas, former Director Comey, on June 8, 2017, testified that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could investigate whether President Trump's actions with regard to Director Comey and the Flynn investigation constituted obstruction of justice;  Whereas, in 2013, President Trump said, ``Well, I've done a lot of business with the They're smart and they're tough,'' and President Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., told a news outlet in 2008 that ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets'';  Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses;  Whereas, the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics said that the President's plan to transfer his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is ``meaningless'' and ``does not meet the standards that . . . every President in the past four decades has met'';  Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the Constitution for the express purpose of preventing Federal officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state'';  Whereas, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has hired a[[Page H4899]]``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate high-priced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations;  Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public;  Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means used the authority under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;  Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has now voted three times along party lines to continue to cover-up President Trump's tax returns;  Whereas, the House of Representatives has now refused nine times to act on President Trump's tax returns;  Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, Government contracts, or otherwise;

7475,topic-id,854,"Mr.Speaker, before I begin my own remarks, I want to commend my colleagues for continuing to aggressively address the deep wound that so many people have experienced with this form of abuse in our military. Our military prides itself on its clear goal of protecting our Nation and doing their duty even to the point of self-sacrifice. So to think that certain members of the military would abuse others in this manner is not only unconscionable, but demands that this body act. So I want to commend my colleagues for their leadership in this regard.  Mr.Speaker, our Nation recently watched in horror as flight staff at a publicly traded airline, having failed to motivate volunteers with sufficient compensation, then called Chicago Aviation Police to forcibly remove one of the randomly selected passengers so they could seat their own employees instead. After the bloodied but unbowed victim was dragged from the flight, aircraft and airport personnel claimed they acted out of concern that they would lose their own jobs if they had not removed the passenger. The stated motive--that was later proven to be false--was that the flight was ``oversold.''  Now, Mr.Speaker, bizarrely, the airline CEO initially defended these actions. The corporation's airline personnel could have offered more money to find volunteers, but they did not choose to use that option. As a result, this airline-specific issue mushroomed into something far larger as Americans unleashed long-buried resentment against distant corporate structures that too often treat them just as incidentals.  Here is the problem, Mr.Speaker: in technocratic bureaucracy, one size fits all. Management and optimization replace the art of human interaction. When entities grow too large and too distant from the persons they are designed to serve, when technical procedures rule over prudential judgment, when process is improperly elevated to an unyielding standard, persons are not only treated like cattle by airlines, but individuals--in this age of information--sense that they no longer matter.  When you treat people as abstractions, it is easier to push them around, like data points on a spreadsheet. The broken-nosed, busted-teeth, and concussed passenger could only mutter the words: ``Just kill me, just kill me.''[[Page H3059]]  One man's last stand against What he experienced on that airplane struck such a visceral chord with me and so many others. Indignity has its limits--even beyond the limits of the Big Money corporate public affairs teams to manage.  Mr.Speaker, last year, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union; and right now, similar debates are taking place across the continent most seismically perhaps in the upcoming French election.  At its core, what is at issue?  It is this: whether more and more power should be consolidated in massive and detached, centralized, and technocratic bureaucratic institutions.  Many people are demanding decentralized alternatives that better harmonize the needs of particular persons in their particular places with the shared goals of security, immigration stabilization, environmental stewardship, and economic well-being. That is what the deeper debate is in Europe and about the European  At its core, Mr.Speaker, I think the issue is this: even more deeply, economic development without a soul robs us of our capacity to fully prosper. Regular people are wondering if they have a seat at the table anymore, and home-team advantage continues to seem to go to a triumvirate class of Big Business, Big Data, and Big Government--a type of transactional aristocracy disconnected from the deeper needs of persons. That is at the core of what is being debated here.  Now, Mr.Speaker, indicting large corporate and governing structures is not merely the point I am trying to make. Certain types of development that come with larger-scale entities has been very positive as goods and services and ideas freely travel at speeds across the world that were unheard of just a few years ago.  Worldwide poverty has declined significantly as underdeveloped nations use their comparative advantage on costs to lift themselves to a higher economic standing.  Moreover, the creative disruption that accompanies technological innovation has yielded new powerful tools for communications, for medicines; and in commerce, it has helped create the sharing economy.  However, a thriving marketplace needs to work for larger swaths of America, including Nebraska, where I live, which remain distant from power centers. For more and more Americans and their families, globalized supply-side elitism has delivered downward mobility, a higher cost of living, wage stagnation, and skyrocketing inequality.  When you couple this with social fragmentation, this is a recipe for disaster, and profit-driven technocracy will not be our answer. It will not solve these challenges. Economics, Mr.Speaker, is more than math, is more than efficiency, and is more than management. It is the art of living.  Now, regarding the airlines, after much embarrassment, they settled with the passenger and instituted important reforms. Maybe this belated gesture signals that we have a better ticket forward. However, unless a new vision emerges of the proper relationship of governing economic and political systems to the persons that they serve, we will likely continue to be told: Just stay in your consumerist seat--unless we deign, yet again, to violently rip you from it.

Although not widely known, the term ``deep state'' refers to a group of career employees of the military, intelligence services, and other agencies of the United States Government who have inordinate but often hidden power to influence policy and society.  It is posited that the deep state is particularly successful when it comes to halting or slowing implementation of government edicts deemed threatening to prudent stability or its own existence. This deep state, though, turns sinister when it operates outside of transparency and oversight. This concealed, controlling force, unfettered, can create an entirely new antidemocratic branch of our government.  However, I want to propose something, Mr.This discussion about the deep state is bigger than the government itself. A broader understanding of the deep state requires insight into the network of institutions that attempt to manage society in multiple ways.  Some in the media, for instance, academia, and corporations orchestrate self-reinforcing narratives of technocratic or expert superiority. Frankly, again, this is why so many people in our country feel forgotten and are suspicious of what might be called the government-corporate-cultural complex.  The notion that elites supersede the decision of voters and their elected Representatives is contrary to our democratic tradition. It is also deeply offensive to the American understanding of the source of proper governance.  On the other hand, maintaining some consistency for the sake of order has merit. Retaining career civil servants, for instance, with strong institutional knowledge and experience is necessary for the uniquely smooth and peaceful transition of power that we enjoy in this country.  Those who have committed themselves to a career of government service and risen in the ranks, those in the media who have taken a long view of civic responsibility, those in business who have achieved outcomes and wish to share them for the betterment of society, ensuring the stability and proper functioning of our Nation's core operating systems during times of disruptive change, are the persons who make up another type of body in our culture who are taking responsibility for the systems that we enjoy.  The point is any analysis of the deep state is complex. A deep state that is mysterious and enigmatic, unidentified, that effectively triumphs over the will of the people, marginalizes our voices. At the same time, political transitions without the backup of those who maintain a continuity of service can both be volatile and destabilizing. There lies the tension.  President Eisenhower warned us of the military-industrial complex. Perhaps the challenge of today's government-corporate-cultural complex is broader: a self-affirming, closed society that says there is only one way--our way--and you have to follow. Just plug into the technocracy and know your place.  Mr.Speaker, it could easily be said that George Washington was an elite of his day. Nevertheless, Americans celebrate him along with other great leaders because they attained their status through selfless service to our country and its founding ideals to a genuine civic state.  Mr.Speaker, on my desk there is a pile of letters. At one point, it approached about a foot high. It is a little smaller now, as I am digging out. I have to be honest. I am behind because I take the time to review the content of each letter that my constituents send me.  Lately, the mail has tripled, perhaps quadrupled in size due to, frankly, the present philosophical divide that is all[[Page H3060]]over our country and manifested in this body in the breakneck pace of governmental action and the important questions about what Congress is doing in key policy areas such as health care and immigration.  This is no complaint. I stand in the seat formerly held by the great Midwestern populist William Jennings Bryan, and it is my duty, responsibility--all of our responsibility--to hear and read what our constituents are telling us. It is also my duty to make judgments on their behalf. I have an obligation to read and study and analyze the facts of any situation, to listen to the people who are effective, and ultimately to make a decision.  I think that the irony of this great moment, of great tension in our country, Mr.Speaker, interestingly, has brought a renewed and refreshing attentiveness to this body, to the legislative branch. There is now a very impassioned and healthy engagement with the centers of government about the very nature of power and its purpose. As Americans, we believe that power is justly derived from the dignity and right of each person. When properly exercised, that power rightly informs the  Vigorous interaction is beneficial to our Republic when it is cordial and constructive, when all parties in an authentic attempt seek workable consensus. This can be harmful to our Republic when interactions descend into shouting matches, rude interruptions, orchestrated ambushes, or worse, violence toward people or property.  Mr.Speaker, I have a new friend who is an ambassador here in the United States from an African country. It is a fascinating nation that rebuilt after a difficult civil war. He was kind enough to have me over for dinner recently with one of my colleagues. My colleague is a brand-new Member of Congress, and he happens to be in the other political party.  On the ride over, we talked about the very real prospect that, if we could just have a conversation, if we just had the time or disposition to have a conversation, a genuine dialogue, then perhaps things would get a bit better in  Mr.Speaker, most of us crave dialogue. Our country needs dialogue more than ever. We have multiple new technological ways to conduct dialogue. However, we have lost touch with what genuine dialogue is. If we are racing to score points or impatiently, loudly bludgeoning each other, we are not engaging in authentic dialogue. We are engaging in monologue.  Clearly, there are many differences that cannot easily be solved here throughout We have to be sober about that. The tough arena of politics occupies a unique space in our country in the quest for answers, but holding it together depends upon a commitment to this ideal of the civic state, a broad attempt at friendship and goodwill to hold together the good that should be common for everyone.  Mr.Speaker, on a visit to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, I noticed that, among its many noteworthy qualities, the beautiful, bucolic campus reflected a dignity, a call, if you will, to something higher. This special place creates a sense of place as a message for the ages, and that used to be reflected in the great tradition of American public architecture.  In one of the Academy's halls, a United States submarine commander named Howard Gilmore is honored. During World War II, Gilmore ordered his submarine to the surface of the ocean. The crew came out onto the deck. Unbeknownst to them, enemy planes were in the area and they spotted the vessel and began a strafing run.  The crew of the submarine scrambled back inside to go into dive mode, but as one crew member looked back, he saw Commander Gilmore lying on the deck, wounded. Looking at his commander in the eye, he heard him say, ``Take her down.'' The commander knew he would be left behind to drown, but everyone else was saved.  Stories like this one appear repeatedly throughout our Nation's history, particularly among those who have served in the military. They detail the brave actions of honorable men and women who have served an ideal far greater than any superficial distinctions in the political debate that might separate them, the ideal that the sacrifice for just and enduring principles is a noble thing.  In this age of anxiety and petty strife, it is worth reflecting on why we now find this so hard.  In the wake of World War I, poet-politician W.Yeats wrote this:     Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;     Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,     The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere     The ceremony of innocence is drowned;     The best lack all conviction, while the worst     Are full of passionate intensity.  Mr.Speaker, present-day Washington, as a microcosm of the Nation, routinely exhibits a lack of political community. Partisan discord and dysfunction do reflect the larger philosophical divides across America: market fundamentalists versus government fundamentalists, protectionists versus globalists, elites versus the common man--on and on and on.  We lack a unifying spirit. Part of this fracture is driven by monied interests in politics. Part of it is driven by competing world views that are earnestly derived about the core of what it means to be an American and about the core of what it means to have a functioning government for Part of it results from the lack of will and courage among lawmakers to move beyond these dispiriting constraints and find some higher ground.                              {time}  1915  But, Mr.Speaker, I will add this. Perhaps there is a silver lining. Let's think about this. On a deeper level, the vehement animosity in the Capitol and across our country could, ironically, point to something good. Washington's inability to rally around big and meaningful ideas, reflecting longstanding, again, cultural and political divides in America, it might actually signal a desire for resolution. After all, if no one cared, our situation would be far more dire.  If we can stretch to see that all of this negativity is actually a search for solidarity, then perhaps we have a shot. Indeed, there might be a chance to recapture our democratic narrative, our special American identity by embracing something larger than the insistent demands of self, party, or narrowly focused advocacy groups. We are a country whose proper aim and purpose, whose very foundation is built upon that which is good and that which is eternal: fairness, self-determination, the rule of law. Perhaps this combustible moment is actually a yearning to reconnect. Or maybe not. Perhaps it is too far gone. We have to decide.  Mr.Speaker, yet, with all these attempts at lofty sentiments here, to successfully govern requires some type of consensus around core values. And, yes, it requires sacrifice for our ideals, for each other, and for So that the center might hold. Right before Commander Gilmore died, he looked at his crew and said, ``Take her down.'' Perhaps the commander's advice to us today to America would be: ``Lift her up. Lift her up.''  Mr.Speaker, I had an incredible opportunity yesterday to meet hundreds of Vietnam veterans who came to our Nation's Capital on one of the honor flights from all over the State of I saw some people I knew, saw constituents, met many of the former troops who I had no idea they served. Isn't that the hallmark of many of our troops, doing so with a quiet selflessness, not needing to have anyone know?  But the Honor Flight actually gave them an opportunity to be welcomed home because particularly after enduring the Vietnam conflict, so many of our soldiers, so many of our troops came home to either no welcome or to, in an odd way, being blamed for the situation that they were trying to resolve. They never got a proper welcoming home.  So we spent a little time together yesterday at the Iwo Jima memorial. After a long day, they had visited the various monuments, including the Vietnam Memorial, the wall.  Of course, it was a tiring day for them, but many were, I would think it is safe to say, exhilarated by the chance to come, to be in solidarity as a community, to reconnect with the purpose of their service and perhaps, most importantly, to be welcomed home because when they got back to the Lincoln airport where I live, thousands of people were there waiting for them, chanting ``USA, USA, USA.''[[Page H3061]]  Mr.Speaker, especially in times of significant duress like we are living in, I think it is particularly important to remind ourselves that America has tremendous capacity for replenishment. Unexpected opportunities give us a chance to reassess and realign in new and compelling ways, both to preserve our most valued traditions and to restore the promise of our This understanding is especially important as we confront dysfunctional government, economic stagnation, global violence, and the social fallout from the fractures and the pain in our culture.  I submit, Mr.Speaker, that one way to lift America up in this age of anxiety might be glimpsed through four mutually supporting principles: government decentralization, economic inclusion, foreign policy realism, and social conservation.  Now, what do I mean by this?  First, we should consider that a more decentralized government will restore the local source of America's strength. I am not a person who is antigovernment, but what we have done in our society is we have federalized every conceivable level of problem, and this institution ought to be about doing a couple of big things well.  We ought to respect the authority and the institutions that are closer to the people that have jurisdiction over things that they can better provide. Those closest to an opportunity or a problem ought to be the first to be empowered to seize the opportunity or solve the problem.  Economic inclusion, as well, should help America recover from a concentration of wealth and power into fewer and fewer hands. This primarily happens through a restoration of the small business sector, giving rise to entrepreneurial momentum once again. Mr.Speaker, we are in an entrepreneurial winter. This is where most jobs come from. I am not talking about even larger small businesses. I am talking about small, microbusinesses that employ one to five persons. For the first time in America's history, the number of small businesses dying is greater than those being born.  So if you want to restore a vibrancy and create the conditions for economic inclusion, a turn of focus to the small business sector, that great gift where people are using their talents of intellect and the gift of their two hands to make things, an imprint of their own dignity, to give rise to the ability to take care of themselves and those under their authority, their employees, to create benefits for others through exchange, that reinforces a community narrative of the longing and commitment and interdependence.  Third point, foreign policy realism. Based upon authentic relationships and genuine friendships, a foreign policy realism should chart a course between passivity and ad hoc intervention. In other words, we are a globalized society. We are interconnected in extraordinary ways. We are not going to turn the clock back. We couldn't if we tried here. So isolationism is not an option. And yet, just entering into relationships that are transactional without having any authentic basis has led to the collapse of relationships and the conditions for them not to be long lasting.  Finally, social and environmental conservation preserves family life, faith life, civic life, and natural life. The ecosystem, which we all value and live, that is not a partisan issue. That is not even a bipartisan issue. These are transpartisan issues because they create the conditions in which the human heart, the human person can thrive. These are the institutions that give rise to a continuity of our great tradition, give a meaning to life and create sustainability for ourselves and our children.  We know we are confronting intensifying struggles about the direction of our country, the direction of our world. The fault lines can widen, they may widen, but we also can choose to lean into these serious challenges. We can still choose to rediscover commonsense governance, right-sized economic models, a proper foreign policy, and universal and foundational values that create the binding narrative of our country that so many persons have sacrificed for.  It is time to rediscover our purpose as a people and reclaim this sense of solidarity and to reempower our communities. As the military says: One team, one fight.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3058.txt,1793,WATER SUPPLY PERMITTING COORDINATION ACT,2017.0,2.0,July

We even have an expression in the West that says whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over.  The water scarcity in the West led our visionary forefathers to build Federal water storage projects throughout to provide water, hydropower, recreation, flood control, and environmental benefits while adhering to State water rights. These were nonpartisan endeavors, as evidenced by President John Kennedy dedicating the San Luis Dam in  Now, while the Central Arizona Project came after President Kennedy, it continues to bring prosperity to Arizona's cities, tribal communities, and ranches almost 50 years from its inception.[[Page H5087]]  The Glen Canyon Dam and other projects affiliated with the Colorado River Storage Project provided the backbone of a regional economy that produced year-round water and emissions-free hydropower.  Lake Powell, the reservoir behind Glen Canyon, allows for millions of dollars' worth of recreational boating annually and even provided the scenery for the astronaut crash landing in the 1968 science fiction classic, ``The Planet of the Apes.''  For generations, these projects provided benefits to a growing society, but what the Federal Government helped give, it has been taking away.  The current regulatory process for constructing new surface water storage is a bureaucratic maze that requires numerous permits and approvals from a multitude of different Federal, State, and local agencies. Conflicting requirements continue to cause unnecessary delays, kill jobs, and result in us failing to capture precious water supplies. Ranchers, agricultural and municipal water providers and other stakeholders in the West need a clear process without the bureaucracy.  H.1654 establishes such a process by creating a one-stop-shop permitting shop, with the Bureau of Reclamation in charge of the permitting process for these important water storage projects in 17 Western This makes a lot of sense, as the Bureau of Reclamation's multipurpose water projects made the West what it is today. Generations of our prior leaders focused on the need to capture water and deliver it to cities and fields.  Our communities always need water, and with the projected population increases, we are going to need a lot more of it in the near future.  Let's build on the good work of previous generations. Get the bureaucracy out of the way and pass H.1654 so we have a clear process moving forward for preserving worthwhile water infrastructure projects.  There is an old adage: save for a rainy day. In this case, it should be: save on a rainy day.  This act facilitates that very concept.

7548,topic-id,836,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Hawaii for her words and Senator Murray for organizing this group of speakers.  I rise today to join my colleagues in making clear that TrumpCare would be a disaster for women in New Hampshire and across the  Right now Senate Republicans continue to meet behind closed doors on their TrumpCare bill, and the reason they have not been transparent is because they know they can't defend this dangerous bill to their constituents. Throughout the process in the Senate, it has been a group of 13 men--no women--writing a bill that will impact the healthcare of millions of American women. It is not just that a small group has been writing the bill behind closed doors. It is also that once we do eventually see the bill, it is going to be rushed to the floor without a hearing. So we will not have the benefit of feedback from our constituents, from stakeholders, from people who understand what the impact of this bill will be. This is simply unacceptable.  To compete economically on a level playing field, women must be able to make their own healthcare decisions. They shouldn't have to pay more than men do for their healthcare. They should be able to visit providers of their own choice who understand and have expertise in women's healthcare needs. The health insurance that is available to women should be equal to that of their male colleagues. That means it should cover their basic healthcare needs.  To fully participate not only in our economy but also in our democracy, women have to be recognized for their capacity to make their own healthcare decisions--just as men are.  I have heard from many constituents whose lives have been changed by being able to get the healthcare they need from the providers they trust. One of those people is Carla from Newfields, As a college student, Carla suffered from significant pain. She needed immediate medical care, so she went to her local Planned  It turned out that her pain was caused by ovarian cysts, and the treatment for those cysts was birth control. As a college student on a limited budget, before the Affordable Care Act had passed, Carla couldn't afford birth control. Because she went to Planned Parenthood, though, she got the treatment she needed at a price she could afford. Her pain went away. She was able to graduate college and eventually start a family--something she might not have been able to do if her underlying condition had not been treated, caught when it was. That was the power of access to appropriate and affordable health care in her life at the right time.  Carla's story is the story of the thousands of New Hampshire women who received primary and preventive healthcare services from Planned  TrumpCare is a disaster for women. TrumpCare defunds Planned Parenthood, which would take away a critical source of care for women. This care includes birth control and breast and cervical cancer screenings. Defunding Planned Parenthood would leave many women in the Granite State and throughout the country without access to care, plain and simple. There aren't enough other providers, as I heard from medical providers throughout my State when I was Governor there, to absorb all of the patients Planned Parenthood cares for now.  TrumpCare also includes harmful language that restricts women's constitutionally protected rights to access abortion services. Additionally, under TrumpCare, if you are a mother, giving birth could now be considered a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to discriminate against you and charge you more.  TrumpCare would increase the cost to women from maternity care in two ways:  First, it would undermine the requirement that insurance companies must cover essential health benefits, including maternity care. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office says that the House-passed TrumpCare bill would increase out-of-pocket spending for maternity care for women who have private insurance by thousands of dollars per year.  Second, TrumpCare slashes Medicaid funding. Medicaid pays for nearly one-half of all births in the United States, meaning, with the 25-percent cut in expenditures over the next decade that is called for in the TrumpCare bill, that at least some of this maternity coverage would also be cut.  Any cut to Medicaid would disproportionately affect Granite State women, as 62 percent of Medicaid recipients in New Hampshire are women. These cuts would also strain at-risk families because Medicaid covers nearly one in three children across our country and nearly 30 percent of the children in my State of New  It is clear that TrumpCare would continue efforts to play partisan games with a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and control her own destiny.  It is critical that people in New Hampshire and across our Nation continue to speak out and share their stories about how TrumpCare would impact their lives, and I am going to continue to work with my colleagues to defeat this bill.

In the many years I have known Wilson, I have always been impressed by her intellect and especially by her leadership skills. Her qualifications and character are beyond dispute. Throughout her life, she has used her many talents not for personal gain or self-aggrandizement but for the public good.  Wilson was one of the first female graduates of the Air Force Academy,[[Page S2795]]which is a pretty impressive accomplishment unto itself, but she set an even higher standard when she earned a Rhodes scholarship to study at Oxford  Upon being awarded her Ph.D., she went to work for the National Security Council and then ran for I got to know Wilson through her insightful work on the House Intelligence and Armed Services Make no mistake--Wilson made a difference during her service in the As a well-respected member of the Intelligence Committee, she built a reputation as a no-nonsense legislator who was deeply committed to upholding our national security. In all things, she proved herself to be exceptionally competent, and I have to say that she proved herself to be worthy of the highest trust.  After her service in the House, Wilson became the president of the South Dakota School of Mines and There, she again set a high bar by leading a school whose alumni, I have been informed, make a higher average starting salary than do Harvard graduates.  For over 20 years, our Nation's Air Force has been involved in conflicts all over the world. Now more than ever, the Air Force needs a proven leader who can modernize the service and lead us to victory. I believe Wilson will provide that leadership. I have every confidence that she will serve with honor and integrity and make a lasting difference as the next Secretary of the Air I have known her for a long time. I have gone to her State and worked with her and campaigned with her. All I can say is that she is a very top-notch woman leader, one of the best I have seen in all of my time in the U.Senate, and I know she is going to do a terrific job. I am going to help her every step of the way, and I am sure everybody else here will.  I hope everybody on this floor will vote for Heather Wilson for this position. We cannot lose.

During the Cold War, she served in the United Kingdom and at the U.Mission to NATO in As the Cold War came to an end, she served on the National Security Council staff under President George H.Bush, working on issues concerning NATO and arms control.  Wilson later moved west to marry her husband, Jay, who is also an Air Force veteran. After a few years in the private sector, Wilson once again answered the call to service, first as the head of the New Mexico Child Welfare Department and later as a Member of the U.House of  In Congress, Wilson was the leading voice on national security. She took on the tough issues, from surveillance programs to sexual assault at the Air Force Academy, and she earned the deepest respect of her colleagues on Capitol Hill, including mine.  For the last 4 years, Wilson has been the president of the South Dakota School of Mines, enhancing its reputation as a premier engineering, science, and research institution.  Now America's Air Force needs her leadership.  The next Secretary will lead America's Air Force in confronting the most diverse and complex array of global crises since the end of World War The world is on fire, and now more than ever our Nation is counting on the global vigilance, global reach, and global power that are the hallmarks of the U.Air Force capabilities.  The next Secretary will also inherit the oldest, smallest, and least ready Air Force in its history. Twenty-five years of continuous deployments, troubled acquisition programs, and frequent aircraft divestments have aged and shrunk the Air Force's inventory. The combination of relentless operational tempo and the self-inflicted wounds of the Budget Control Act and sequestration have depleted readiness. Meanwhile, potential adversaries are rapidly shrinking America's technological advantage and holding our aircraft at greater risk over greater distances.  In short, we have asked a lot of our Air Force over the last 25 years, and the demands placed on the service continue to grow. Congress has only added to the problems with the Budget Control Act and sequestration. We are placing an unnecessary and dangerous burden on the backs of our airmen, and we cannot change course soon enough.  We owe our airmen the resources, equipment, and training they need to succeed. We also owe them proven leadership.

Jakob's father served in the U.Navy, and after retirement, he moved his family to southern West Virginia where they have been living for the last 5 years. I am happy to note that, following his Eagle Scout ceremony, Jakob and his family will be moving to Carson City, NV, where his grandparents and extended family anxiously await his arrival.  Jakob is a talented young man who excels academically and participates in a number of extracurricular activities. In addition to his academic accomplishments, he is a gifted musician who[[Page S4187]]plays the trumpet in the marching band and the French horn in the school's concert band. He is also a member of the cross-country team and participates in track and field, where he shines in sprint relays, hurdle events, and the long jump. His ability to balance school, athletics, and Boy Scouts is truly remarkable.  Furthermore, Jakob is preparing for a future in computer programming. Like many kids his age, he loves playing video games and is interested in becoming a video game programmer. Additionally, he is part of his school's robotics club and programs robots to compete in challenging competitions. With such extensive experience at a young age, I am confident Jakob will have a bright future as a computer programmer.  Jakob is responsible and dependable and understands the importance of his family, friends, and community. Boy Scouts has had a positive impact on his life, and I know that he will serve as an excellent role model for other members of his family and friends.  In closing, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in congratulating this new Nevada resident, my nephew Jakob I cannot be more proud of this young man, and I look forward to witnessing his many contributions to our community in the years ahead.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgS4186-3.txt,1863,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,25.0,May
7547,topic-id,954,"Mr.President I join my colleagues, Senator Murray and others, and I thank Senator Murray for her leadership on this important issue.  Right now, 13 of our male colleagues are sequestered away somewhere, plotting--and I use that word, and that is an accurate word because that is what it feels like to those of us who are shut out of the process of putting together the Senate bill. These 13 men are plotting how to deprive millions of women across our country access to essential healthcare--women all over our country. That is half of our population. Frankly, it is sad that we are having this debate about the need for openness and transparency that impacts half of our population and that is one-sixth of our economy.  Sadly, it isn't surprising. Republicans in Congress have fought to deny women access to healthcare for decades. Now they have a willing and complicit ally in this crusade--Donald In their zeal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the President and his allies in Congress don't appear to be concerned about the collateral damage they leave behind.  For women, this means facing a return to a time when our gender--our very gender--was considered a preexisting condition. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could discriminate against women of child-bearing age. They could charge outrageous rates for birth control and contraceptives. Under the ACA, women have secure access to care before, during, and after their pregnancies. They can no longer be charged outrageous rates simply for having a child or be denied access to mental health services if they suffer from postpartum depression. Women can now receive free contraceptive care, like birth control pills and But now the President and Republicans in Congress are determined to drag us backward, all in the name of giving the richest Americans a huge tax cut.  Let's be really clear on this. The poorest, oldest, and the most sick people in our country are going to suffer so that the richest people in our country can get a huge tax cut under this bill. We need to do everything we can to fight against all these misguided efforts.  Although we haven't seen the likely monstrosity currently being hatched in secret, we have a pretty good idea of what is going to be in this bill. In the House version of TrumpCare, States have the ability to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's essential health benefits, which include access to birth control, pregnancy, and mental health coverage.  One Republican Congressman even had the audacity to say he shouldn't have to subsidize pregnancy care because he can't get pregnant. How the heck do you think he even arrived on this Earth? I really think this is outrageous. This is an outrageous statement that speaks for itself.  The bill also makes good on a longstanding Republican promise to defund Planned Parenthood, regardless of the cost in lives. Over the past few years, Republicans in Congress have tried everything they could think of to defund Planned Parenthood--passing stand-alone bills, attaching poison pills to must-pass bills, threatening a government shutdown, and passing TrumpCare in the In March, the majority leader held the floor open for over an hour to allow the Vice President time to travel to the Capitol to break a tie to repeal a regulation on title X funding meant to preserve access to Federal family planning services.  I understand that many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have strong feelings about abortion, but I have never been able to understand how this translates into attacking an organization that uses no Federal funds to provide abortions. In fact, Planned Parenthood uses its Federal funding to provide low-cost healthcare to the people in our country who need it most but who can't afford it.  In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood provided over 600,000 cancer screenings[[Page S3692]]and over 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections. These are real facts, not alternative facts.  I have heard from hundreds of my constituents over the past 6 months about how important Planned Parenthood is to them, and I would like to share a few of their stories.  Tiffany from Honolulu made her first visit to Planned Parenthood when she was 21, under unexpected circumstances during a pregnancy scare. She felt that having a child at that time in her life would be extremely difficult and would have negatively impacted her ability to finish school. During her visit to the clinic, Tiffany took a pregnancy test and discovered she wasn't pregnant. Her caregivers were then able to counsel Tiffany about her sexual health without judgment. They walked her through the different options she had and administered an STD test. She left the clinic with a prescription for birth control.  Kim, a young attorney from my State, recently wrote to my office to tell her story about turning to Planned Parenthood when she faced an unexpected pregnancy. After having a safe and open conversation with the staff at her local Planned Parenthood, Kim decided she was not ready to have a baby and ended her pregnancy. Planned Parenthood gave her the space and opportunity to make the best decision for her. As she recounted to us, ``You don't have to like someone's choice, but you don't get to take away their freedom to make it.''  The fight against TrumpCare continues, but I am going to do everything I can to protect women's health and their right to control their bodies--to control our bodies.  I urge my colleagues to oppose any measure in TrumpCare that takes women back to the days when our very gender was considered a preexisting condition.  I yield the floor.

7340,topic-id,1293,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, we are debating today what is being called an infrastructure bill. I wish that were actually the case. Our country certainly needs Congress to take action to address our country's infrastructure needs, yet this Congress is spending its time today debating another sham infrastructure bill that won't actually provide a single cent for real infrastructure.  Our Nation currently spends less on infrastructure as a percentage of our GDP than at any time during the past 20 years, and it shows. Far too many areas around the country have infrastructure that is crumbling before our eyes. We have seen this occur with the recent tragedy and the situation for water at the Oroville Dam in California, and this bill offers no solutions for these issues. In truth, this bill is simply an environmental deregulation bill disguised as an infrastructure bill.  Now, the bill's proponents have claimed that environmental laws, and specifically NEPA, are blocking new dam construction. This claim, Mr.Chairman, simply put, is bunk. According to the Bureau of Reclamation, not a single dam has been denied construction because of a lack of coordination between Reclamation and other agencies or because of delays associated with environmental review or permitting.  So why do we not see all sorts of new dams sprouting up around the West like we did for years and years in the previous century?  Because there is no new water to be captured, and because, frankly, all the best dam locations around the West were taken in the previous century when we had a heck of a dam-building spree.  New dams don't get built because they don't yield enough water to justify their multibillion-dollar price tags. You can ask the CRS if you don't believe other experts. In 2012, the Congressional Research Service found that the most likely causes of delay for major infrastructure projects are a lack of funding and State permitting issues, not environmental laws.  Now, new surface storage may be appropriate in some cases. The fact is, however, that much of the United States is already saturated with dams because of that dam-building spree we had in the previous century. The United States built tens of thousands of dams in the 20th century. California alone built 1,400 major dams. The best dam sites are already taken. Other than extraordinarily wet years like this one, thankfully, in California we are having a hard time even filling up the reservoirs that we already built.  Despite these facts, my Republican colleagues continue to peddle this fiction that we have to gut our Nation's environmental laws to build new dams and other infrastructure. I guess we should not be surprised because this crusade against our Nation's environmental laws is being led by a President whose relationship with the truth is complicated at best.  A couple of weeks ago, President Trump claimed that projects like the Hoover Dam were built in 5 years because they didn't have to go through years of permitting and regulation that current infrastructure projects are subjected to.  Well, the independent fact checkers at The Washington Post evaluated this claim and they awarded the President's claim, as you can see to my right, three Pinocchios, which is the rating for statements that include ``significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions.''  Now, the fact checkers noted that, according to the U.GAO, 95 percent of public infrastructure projects are actually excluded from environmental reviews under current law. They further pointed out that the President ignored the many years of planning, permitting, negotiating, and preparing that was required to make sure that projects like the Hoover Dam were financially feasible and actually had public support.  In fact, dam planning on the Colorado River began in 1902, yet the Hoover Dam was not completed until 1937. Not completed, I might add, until the Roosevelt administration put actual public infrastructure dollars on the table to get that project financed and moving. The project took many years because, even despite the absence of modern environmental laws, big complicated projects take time to plan and finance, and they always have.  I am sorry that my Republican colleagues refuse to let such facts get in the way of their decades-long crusade against our country's bedrock environmental laws, but I hope we will eventually move on from this debate and get on to addressing real problems affecting our infrastructure, and that real problem is investment.  In terms of water infrastructure, our Nation is still not making necessary investments like water reuse projects and recycling projects. These are 21st century infrastructure projects that can provide us with water supplies that don't depend on the whims of an increasingly unpredictable hydrology. Given our changing climate, we can no longer rely exclusively on our 20th century infrastructure projects like dams.  Despite this, we have barely scratched the surface on building modern water infrastructure projects like reuse, recycling, desalination, groundwater storage, storm water capture, and water-use efficiency projects. Our country currently reuses less than 10 percent of our Nation's wastewater. Climate change will require us to do better. As George Bush's Reclamation Commissioner once said, the reuse of wastewater and recycled water could actually be the next river for the Western United States to tap for critical water supply.  This Congress should be working across the aisle to fully tap that next great river for the 21st century.  Reoperating existing facilities, modernizing those operations, is another example of something we should be working together on across the aisle.  All around the West we are dealing with dams and reservoirs that are being operated with the best technology from decades ago. The flood control manual at Oroville Dam, for example, hasn't been updated since 1970, which actually makes it cutting edge when compared to many of the reservoirs that are operating on 1950s flood control manuals. We are using slide rules instead of computers, with meteorological predictions that are based on historic data, backward-looking data, instead of looking up at the sky and using the data from modern satellite technology.  At Folsom Dam, we are watching a long overdue update to operations as part of a new auxiliary spillway. Forecast-informed operations, which is something that I have long advocated as part of comprehensive water legislation, is something we could work on together, and it would provide significant increases in water supply.  If my Republican friends are interested in expediting environmental reviews for infrastructure projects, then there is another thing that we can work on together, and that is we can end the slashing of budgets in Federal agencies that are in charge of environmental reviews for infrastructure projects. Budget cuts do nothing but hamper the ability of these agencies to participate in the review process and to protect our other Nation's fisheries and other natural resources.[[Page H5084]]  This bill before us today compounds the problem by further undercutting the important role these agencies play to protect our natural resources. That is why several conservation and fishing industry groups have warned that this Congress should reject this bill, that it threatens tens of thousands of jobs in the fishing industry across the Pacific  Many of our Nation's iconic fisheries are already on the brink of extinction. We have heard firsthand in our committee from the fishermen struggling to pay their mortgages, boats being scrapped because owners can't pay mooring fees, homes being repossessed, and restaurants, hotels, and other retail and service businesses struggling just to scrape by. Let's not add to these struggles by passing an ill-conceived bill that does nothing to actually improve our infrastructure.

It was a bipartisan mistake. I voted against it.  There was a bit of vindication because at least one of those stadiums ended up not getting built anyway, despite the environmental waiver, and it sort of exposed the fact that these environmental laws are often put forward as scapegoats. We are often told that if you just clear away the environmental permitting, we can do these things.  There were many other reasons why that stadium didn't get built, complicated issues involving NFL franchises and financing, which is usually the real scapegoat when these projects aren't moving forward.

It bears noting that the State of California is not asking for this legislation; and, in fact, the State of California has consistently opposed the rolling back of environmental standards and is busy passing bill after bill in this State legislative session to try to backfill for anticipated rollbacks in Federal environmental standards. So, certainly, if we are talking about the State of California and what it wants and it needs, its elected leaders are taking a very different direction than posing the false choice between environmental standards and infrastructure.  Again, the United States Bureau of Reclamation has emphasized that there are other factors, that it is not environmental review that has stopped any water projects in the The Congressional Research Service has reached the same conclusion.

It should be broadly supported, and they are not asking for any special tweaks to the environmental laws.

We have left very little flow in the rivers, and this drought only exacerbated the problem.  So I am representing people that are deeply impacted by water shortage and water management decisions that need to be part of this consideration instead of trivialized when we talk about water wasting out through the estuary. This is water that sustains these fishery runs that have been the lifeblood of the communities in my district for many years.  Now, just to inject a couple of facts into what has been called a radical environmental agenda that caused the waste of all of this water during the drought--in fact, that didn't happen. In 2014, the fact is only 4 percent of all the runoff in the entire Bay Delta Watershed flowed to San Francisco Bay solely for environmental protection. In 2015, it was even less. Two percent of the runoff for the entire watershed made it all the way out to San Francisco Bay solely for environmental purposes. The rest of that flow that made it through was to control salinity in the delta so that you could continue to serve municipal and industrial and other water-use needs.

So the coordination will mean more for the American people, more for the people of my own State, with less dollars, less delay, and they can start enjoying the fruits of this project, the fruit of their tax dollars.  So my amendment simply adds to that, State-led efforts, whether it has been a bond passed by a State or other State funding in California and other States, that they, too, can enjoy that coordination that this bill would provide.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5082.txt,2101,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 806, OZONE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION",2017.0,22.0,June
7365,topic-id,228,"Mr.Chairman, I, unfortunately, must oppose this amendment. I am not sure if it was the intent of my friend, Mr.LaMalfa, but it appears that this amendment would prioritize permitting surface storage projects under the WIIN Act and not groundwater storage WIIN Act projects.  The WIIN Act, of course, authorized money for both surface and groundwater storage projects. These projects are yet to be named and prioritized. That still needs to happen.  Yet this amendment applies this bill's streamlining provisions to WIIN's ``State-led projects for new surface water storage projects.''  Now, providing surface storage above all other types of water infrastructure projects certainly is in keeping with some of the obsession with new dams that we have heard from my colleagues across the aisle. But the truth is, there are all sorts of other worthy projects that are needed if we are going to get serious about water infrastructure in California; and to put a thumb on the scale for one particular kind is not the right way to go.  So, Mr.Chairman, I respectfully request a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa).

7370,topic-id,425,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  I rise in support of this amendment.  My colleague across the aisle just asked the rhetorical question: Why is this amendment needed?  It is needed because fishing jobs matter. The people whom I represent on the north coast of California and also other fishing communities up and down the Pacific Coast, including Oregon and Washington, their jobs matter, and their limited opportunity to have their interests considered when a dam project is moving forward is what is shortened by the streamlining in this bill.  Their interests are already subordinated oftentimes, but they get subordinated even further by the streamlining in this case, which places the Bureau of Reclamation, the proponent of the new dam, in charge of the administrative record, which places the fish agencies--which often advance the interests of protecting fisheries--in a subordinate role to the Bureau of Reclamation that controls the administrative record, which imposes shortened timelines to make it even harder for their interests to be considered.  Fishing jobs matter. And the truth is, right now, in my district and in many other fishing communities, people are hurting because they have been damaged by poorly operated and poorly permitted dams.  Let's not make things worse. This amendment is absolutely necessary, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I would first point out that commercial fisheries are controlled and regulated by the Secretary of Commerce, not the Secretary of the Interior, and yet it is the Secretary of the Interior to whom the gentleman would give the power to ignore this streamlining law and impose endless, repetitive, and duplicative delays in the consideration of these projects.  I would again point out that all of the considerations that are given to fisheries, that are given to environmental laws, that are given to engineering laws, everything that goes into the planning process in our dams under[[Page H5091]]our laws and regulations is fully respected under this measure.  All that it does is say that the agency, that the Bureau of Reclamation, when an application is provided, will pull these agencies together, and all of the jurisdictions and all of the affected parties establish a timetable according to their best judgment of what is necessary, have them talk with each other, and then stick to that plan.  That is what the bill does, and that is why it is so desperately needed in a State that has not built a major reservoir of over a million acre-fee of storage since the New Melones was completed in 1979.

7430,topic-id,549,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize Flewelling Farms, who has been designated family farm of the year and McCain's ``Grower of the Year.'' Farms and farm families are essential assets to my home State of Maine--not just for the tremendous economic benefits the agriculture industry has, but also for the rich heritage and work ethic that makes up the communities where generations have plowed the lands. Maine agriculture is more diversified than in many States, and on any given day, you can drive past acres of potatoes, grains, large dairy farms, small truck farms, and even smaller value added farms producing cheese, breads, and maple syrup, as well as conventional farms, organic farms, and even farms raising oysters, seaweed, and salmon.  From now until the farm bill is passed, I want to take the opportunity to talk about Maine farms and farmers, their creativity, ingenuity, perseverance, and ability to grow amazing food and fiber on what can often be hard scrabble land with a solid crop of rocks and trees always watching for the opportunity to creep back on to land that was cleared long ago by hard work.  I want to begin in the agricultural county of Maine, Aroostook The potato is king in Aroostook County, ME--the large farms and relatively flat fertile land produce 16 million pounds of seed, chip, and table stock potatoes on nearly 50,000 acres, generating thousands of jobs and infuse millions of dollars into the economy of the State of  While agriculture is indeed valuable and essential to tables across the Nation and the world, community and farm families are what really makes northern Maine a special place. I am pleased to honor one such family today, the Jerry and Bruce Flewelling family of The Flewelling family was named the ``2016 Farm Family of the Year'' by the Maine Potato Board and the McCain's ``Champion Grower of 2016'' as well. These recognitions are given for the quality of product and commitment to the industry, but also for the heart and hardiness of the family who, through trials and tribulations of unpredictable weather and markets, keeps their drive for excellence at the forefront of every day. The Flewellings have been doing this for six generations. The first Flewellings arrived in this country from Wales in the late 1800s, entering the United States near where the family farm is today.  They have experienced tremendous change in how potatoes are grown, harvested, and stored, but by being ready to implement best practices, new technologies, and innovation, they have grown the farm and its quality and productivity and are able to carry on the strong tradition of agriculture in  In addition to being an exceptional small business, the family members are active community members as well. They serve on municipal boards, Maine Pesticide Control Board, Agricultural Bargaining Council, as well as Maine Potato They are a strong voice for future generations of farmers and are mentors to other farmers, as well always encouraging others and sharing their expertise.  For these reasons and many more not listed here, I offer my congratulations to Jerry and Bruce and their family on the continuation of an exceptional farm and best wishes as they continue to instill a legacy of hard work and exceptional crops for future generations to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-08-pt1-PgS2798-2.txt,1724,WATER SUPPLY PERMITTING COORDINATION ACT,2017.0,8.0,August

On this date, the people of Maine celebrate our rich history in the valuable lobster trade, as well as the continuing commitment by our coastal communities to support and perpetuate our great maritime heritage.  Since 1947, The Maine Lobster Festival has provided the people of Maine and tourists with exciting events, entertainment, and Maine seafood. The festival emerged out of a community-based effort at reviving summer activities that Camden, ME, established prior to World War A small group of citizens and summer visitors came together to revel in their coastal marine community. Their small gathering, which lost money in its first year, moved to Rockland the following year and immediately became an annual staple of the coastal area's summer schedule, creating the Maine Lobster Festival to operate as a nonprofit corporation that is responsible for the festival to this day.  This nearly weeklong engagement in August is attended by both internationally recognized as well as local musicians and entertainers, who fill the concert stage with enthralling performances. A midway provides excitement for children of all ages. King Neptune and his court attend the event every year and a highlight is the crowning of the Maine Sea The festival also boasts a wide range of Maine artistry, from craftsmen to painters, as well as one of the region's largest and most popular parades. In addition, there is often a U.Navy ship that offers unique tour opportunities to festival-goers. As the highlight, there are fresh lobster dinners prepared in the world's largest lobster cooker for the thousands of hungry attendees. While you may no longer be able to get ``all the lobster you can eat for $1,'' the festival promises to have more than enough lobster to go around.  Year-in and year-out, the combined effort of more than a thousand volunteers generously donate their time makes the festival possible. Volunteers are committed to improving and showcasing midcoast Maine communities to the thousands of festival-goers that come from different parts of Maine, from across the country and around the world. Not only do they donate their time and effort, but they also donate all profits of the festival to Maine communities to provide needed support to local institutions such as food pantries, community service groups, emergency services, and college scholarships.  The Maine Lobster Festival is recognized nationwide as one of the best events in the country, and this distinction could not be bestowed on a more deserving enterprise. I wish to join the greater Rockland community, as well as the State of Maine, in congratulating the Maine Lobster Festival on its 70th year of being an historic and cherished Maine institution.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4760.txt,1724,1100,2017.0,2.0,May

7339,topic-id,426,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today, the House meets for the second day in a row to consider another infrastructure bill that has come from the House Natural Resources Committee and its Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Oceans, of which I have the honor of chairing. My subcommittee has a strong infrastructure agenda, already hearing testimony on a number of bills aimed at improving our Nation's infrastructure and advancing an all-of-the-above energy and water strategy.  Many of our bills, including H.1654, which we are considering today, apply simple solutions to expedite maintenance or construction of water and power infrastructure throughout the It is vital to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure, and one of the biggest roadblocks is the excess of regulatory red tape that applicants have to wade through before they can even move one shovel of dirt.  In Colorado, where I live, a water project was recently completed where water owned by the city of Colorado Springs was taken from a reservoir 60 miles to the south to the city of Colorado Springs for treatment and distribution. The project took 6 years to build. But before that could happen, there were over 200 permits and applications that had to be granted, any one of which could have stopped the whole thing, and that cost $160 million in application fees, lawyers' time, and mitigation. That took 8 years. That took longer than the project itself.  Congressman Tom McClintock's Water Supply Permitting Coordination[[Page H5083]]Act seeks to cut regulatory red tape by creating a one-stop-shop permitting process to the Bureau of Reclamation in order to streamline the current multiagency permitting processes for new or expanded non-Federal surface storage facilities.  However, this bill is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Mr.McClintock's bill allows water storage project sponsors the flexibility to opt out of this process and, instead, choose the agency and process that works best for them.  While the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act will allow for much-needed relief in the sponsor's State of California, this bill will benefit States throughout the West, including my own State of  Mr.McClintock's bill goes hand-in-hand with language in the WIIN Act, which was signed into law last year, that supports additional water storage capacity across the  I commend my colleague, Mr.McClintock, for bringing up this commonsense piece of legislation that simply looks to cut regulatory red tape for water storage projects that are essential to survival in the  Mr.Chair, I urge all of my House colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1445  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5082.txt,1834,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 806, OZONE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION",2017.0,22.0,July
7341,topic-id,794,"Mr.Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of California (Mr.McCarthy), our majority leader.  Mr.Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his work on this.  Mr.Chairman, I always get excited when I hear people speak on the floor, especially when they come from Mr.Chairman, it is always interesting when people want to tell us what is the best way to make things happen.  It is interesting, in California, when the legislature was controlled by Democrats, they did waive CEQA, but it wasn't for a dam. It wasn't to prepare for a drought we were going through. But they waived it twice, all for sports. One was in San Francisco, and one was in L.It seems odd, but sometimes people have their priorities, I guess, not in the right place.  Now, Mr.Chairman, California and the West recently endured the worst drought in our century. Though it was the worst drought, this was not our first. We have faced droughts for generations, and each time the rain and snow came back and delivered the water that we needed to survive.  Just like previous years, this past winter was a godsend to Californians; the wettest on record. Living in the naturally dry region that we do, you would think it would be common practice to prepare for inevitable times of drought by capturing water when Mother Nature blesses us with the rain and snow. But the fact is that we aren't doing enough to store the water we do get for the times we don't get it.  So what can we do now? What would help the people in our district and across California and across the West to prepare for future droughts that we know are coming?  We should start by building more dams and reservoirs.  So what is stopping us?  Well, some is a ridiculous permitting process that forces us to wait and wait and wait when actually we should be acting.  Just look at history. Take the High Savery Dam in It took 14 years to permit the project but only 2 years to build it. It was finished in 2004. Think about how much the world has changed in those 14 years of time.  In 1990, somewhere around 5 million people had cell phones and only about 15 percent of Americans owned a computer. By 2004, when the dam was finished, about 180 million people had cell phones and 62 percent of Americans owned a computer. In 1990, the most popular movie was Total By 2004, we were already on to Shrek 2.  Looking forward to my home State, we can't wait 14 years after starting the permitting process to finish our projects. The Temperance Flat Reservoir, once fully operational, can provide enough water to meet the needs of 172,000 households for an entire year. Finishing the Sites Reservoir proposal could provide 2 million California homes with enough water for a year. That is an astounding number. But, Mr.Chairman, I am sure on this floor we will hear those 2 million should actually wait. But I guess for a baseball stadium, no need to wait.  So fixing the process isn't just about saving some headaches or a few hours of time. This is about making sure millions of people in California and across America have the water they need and deserve.  Mr.Chairman, I want to thank Congressman Tom McClintock for this legislation. Fixing this permitting process for water storage is more than just common sense. It is about making us a nation of doers again to get the American what they actually need.  Mr.Chairman, Mr.McClintock has worked. He has tried to work with both sides of the aisle. He has been through this process.  But you know what?  Mr.McClintock has been home. He has been listening to his constituents on both sides of the aisle that don't have water. We have been through these droughts. We know these droughts will come again, and they have only been worse in the last couple of years.  Why?  Because of what has been imposed by the Federal Even in the years where we have more than 170 percent of snowpack, we don't keep the guarantee of 100 percent of the water.  So as the environmental laws continue to take water away and put it out to the ocean instead of providing for the fruits to be grown and the fiber across our country and provide the water for the citizens of California, we should build more dams, and they should not have to wait 14 years with only 2 years to build it. We can do better, we should do better, and we will do better when we pass this bill.                              {time}  1500  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5082.txt,1834,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 806, OZONE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION",2017.0,22.0,June
7343,topic-id,779,"Mr.Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock).  Mr.Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on the Water, Power, and Oceans  Mr.Chairman, droughts are nature's fault; they happen. But water shortages are our fault. Water shortages are a choice that we made a generation ago when we stopped building new reservoirs to meet the needs of a growing population.  The unvarnished truth is we will not solve our water shortages until we build more reservoirs, and we cannot build new reservoirs until we overhaul the laws that have made their construction endlessly time-consuming and, ultimately, cost-prohibitive.  For years, the Natural Resources Committee has heard testimony from frustrated water districts unable to navigate the Byzantine maze of regulations and the phalanx of competing, overlapping, duplicative, and often contradictory Federal agencies.  After years spent trying to satisfy one agency, another suddenly pops up to claim jurisdiction with an entirely new set of demands in an often endless permitting process, despite the fact they are studying the same project in the same location with the same data. The burden this places on our ability to deliver water for the next generation is crushing.  The leader mentioned the High Savery Dam in Wyoming--14 years to permit, only 2 years to actually build. The Federal Government has literally studied four storage projects in California nearly to death. One project, the Sites Reservoir, had over 50 alternative[[Page H5085]]locations studied, and there is no end in sight for the feasibility process on that potential reservoir. Similar delays have prevented the expansion of the Shasta reservoir for 39 years.  Mr.Huffman tells us that no dam permits have been denied because of this. The problem is very few dam permits have been approved because of this. And the costs are caused by cost-prohibitive delays in time that run up millions and millions of dollars in costs until the agencies simply throw up their hands and give up.  H.1654 will bring order from this bureaucratic chaos. It establishes a framework in which Federal agencies with permitting responsibilities for the construction of new reservoirs must work together, coordinate their schedules, share data and technical materials, and make their findings publicly available. The end result will be fewer delays, more efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and, ultimately, more abundant water supplies.  It is modeled on the Obama administration's approach to constructing new electric transmission lines to accommodate its reliance on wind and solar generation. There is nothing new in this process. In October of 2009, the administration formed the Interagency Rapid Response Team for Transmission, a consortium of nine Federal agencies to coordinate a single unified environmental review document for each project analysis.  It is also modeled on provisions sponsored by House Democrats that expedited improvements on the Hetch Hetchy dam serving the San Francisco region. This bill simply says, if there is a potential project on Interior or Agriculture Department lands, then the Bureau of Reclamation will be the coordinating agency for the permits. That is a one-stop permitting agency.  It will call together all of the agencies, the local and State jurisdictions and tribal governments of our Indian nations, establish a timeframe for studying decisionmaking, and then coordinate all the reviews and analyses and opinions and statements and permits or licenses and other Federal approvals required under Federal law.  It also requires transparency, assuring that all data is available to the public online so the science guiding these decisions can be rigorously scrutinized by all interested parties.  It also allows water agencies to fund the review process if Federal funding isn't provided, removing one of the excuses that Federal agencies have made in slow-walking or stalling project reviews.  I want to make this very clear: It does not bypass or alter or waive any environmental or safety laws. It doesn't waive CEQ or ESA or NEPA or any other law. It simply says the process needs to be more efficient, and the government agencies should coordinate and cooperate with each other rather than talking past each other as isolated and often inscrutable fiefdoms.  Five years of drought in California brought entire cities within months of exhausting their water supplies. The epic drought has now been followed with the wettest year on record, and we have helplessly watched our dams spilling millions of acre-feet of water to the ocean because we have no place to store the excess for the next drought.  Perhaps that is nature's way of reminding us that, if we didn't store water in wet years, we won't have it during dry ones, and the economic and social devastation have been immense.

This amendment ensures that State-led projects can also enjoy the coordination that the bill itself will do, State-led surface storage projects such as Sites These will be defined in the WIIN Act and they will be eligible under H.1654's permitting.  Doing so enables States to direct their own resources towards infrastructure needs at lower cost and improves States' ability to partner with the Federal Government on projects that provide both State and Federal benefits.  Adopting this amendment to include State-led projects will allow the development of more water infrastructure more rapidly and at no additional cost to the Federal For example, in my home State of California, the voters have approved billions of dollars toward infrastructure projects such as Sites Reservoir--not too far from my neighborhood--which will include enough water storage for millions more people in our  Now, if you know the saga of Sites Reservoir, the locals there will tell you they have been talking about it, studying it, poking it, prodding it for about 40 years. Bureaucracy plays a major role in that.  So the bill in chief is not looking to change environmental laws or get rid of environmental laws. Indeed, my colleague on the other side of the aisle talked about having an honest discussion in this area. Well, an honest discussion would show that the bill in chief is one that is merely coordinating. It is not changing the Water Quality It is not changing NEPA, CEQA, or anything else, other than getting these people all in one room to coordinate at one time.  Yes, we, indeed, have costs involved, because people give up, whether it is[[Page H5089]]private sector money or the people that pass bonds as State voters give up after a while because they don't think their dollars are actually getting to the projects, when they hear needless, endless delays, when we have this game of bureaucratic badminton being played by various agencies knocking one idea to another, taking years of time and additional costs, especially those surprise ones at the last minute.  Lake Oroville is in my own backyard. Now, what we have seen there since the crisis happened with the breakage of the spillway is that coordination under an emergency, where, even though there are some trying to throw roadblocks in there, people recognized coordination was needed, because when 188,000 people have to evacuate an area due to some unknown factors with how the infrastructure is holding up, then they saw the need to fix it.                              {time}  1530  And the spillway at Lake Oroville is going to be fixed pretty rapidly over a 2-year period and made usable in this short amount of time. So that is how coordination can work to get a needed project done when it can be an emergency.  What we need to quit doing is waiting for emergencies like this and on levee projects when we know for years and years that levee projects--highways, bridges, other infrastructure that have this bureaucratic badminton played when people are trying to get these projects done--need to be coordinated. That is what this bill does.  My amendment adds to it, again, an important ability for State dollars under State-led infrastructure projects to be included in that. So I think it makes a heck of a lot of sense and will help our voters like in California and others around the country to be able to enjoy that coordination.

7586,topic-id,1756,"Madam President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his comments. I ascribe to them.[[Page S3746]]                      Trump Administration Cuba Policy  Madam President, on June 16, in a campaign-style speech glorifying the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, President Trump spoke of freedom and democracy for the Cuban people.  Those are goals every one of us in this body shares, not only for the people of Cuba but for people everywhere. But the hypocrisy of the President's remarks in Miami, where he announced his decision to roll back engagement between the United States of America and Cuba, was glaring, if not surprising.  This is a President who has praised, feted, and offered aid and weapons to some of the world's most brutal despots. A President who, when he was in Saudi Arabia, never uttered the words ``freedom'' or ``democracy'' or ``women's rights.'' In fact, he said he did not believe in lecturing other governments about such things. Freedom House ranks Saudi Arabia as less free than  This is a President who welcomed at the White House President Erdogan, who has imprisoned tens of thousands of teachers, journalists, and civil servants as he dismantles the institutions of secular democracy in  President Trump praised Philippine President Duterte, who brags of committing murder and who defends a policy of summarily executing, without any legal process, thousands of suspected petty drug users.  President Trump says he admires President Putin, and he acts like a soulmate to President El-Sisi, both of whom show no reluctance to order the imprisonment and, in Russia, even the assassination, of critics of their autocratic rule.  Despite all of this--praising these tyrants around the world--President Trump has decided to make a point of going after tiny Cuba, whose government, for all its faults, doesn't hold a candle to these other autocracies.  If the hypocrisy were not enough, it gets a whole lot worse, because in doing so he is trampling on the rights of Americans--of the Presiding Officer, of me, and of everybody else in this country.  I wonder how many, if any, Members of Congress have read the details of the President's announcement in Miami, other than the couple of Cuban-American Members of Congress--neither one of whom has ever set foot in Cuba--even though it is only a few miles off our coast. They publicly took credit for writing the new White House policy.  Now, that, in and of itself, speaks volumes about the administration's so-called policy review. That turned out to be largely a sham. Apparently, every Federal agency recommended continuing down the path of engagement begun by President Obama, as did the U.business community and the rapidly growing number of private Cuban entrepreneurs who are benefiting from U.engagement.  It is especially ironic that those hard-working Cubans and private American citizens are the ones who will be hurt by this change in policy. Instead, the President decided to toss a political favor to a tiny minority of the President's supporters in  Now, the President's party has long claimed to be a party devoted to individual freedom, as we all should be. But let me give my colleagues a few examples of what his policy means for the freedom of individual  First, remember that Americans can travel freely to any of the other countries I have mentioned, despite the repressive policies of their governments. Americans can travel to Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, Turkey, and Egypt, as well as to Iran, Vietnam, and We can go to any of those countries without restriction.  Of course, Americans can travel freely to Russia, Cuba's former patron. I would note that Russia is now investing heavily in Cuba's transport sector and, taking advantage of the fact that we are turning our back on Cuba, they are seeking a military base there. And Americans can travel freely to the dictatorship of Venezuela, Cuba's source of cheap oil. In fact, Americans can travel freely to any country they want, provided that country will let them in, no matter how undemocratic, no matter how tyrannical, no matter how repressive. Apparently, President Trump could care less about that. But not to Cuba, whose people have far more in common with us than those of any of the other countries I named.  No, President Trump says you can go to Iran, you can go to Vietnam, you can go to Russia, you can go to Turkey, and you can go to Saudi You can go anywhere you want, but you can only go to Cuba under conditions that the White House and bureaucrats in the Treasury Department, who have never been to Cuba, permit.  Rather than make your own decision about where to take your family for a vacation or to experience a foreign culture, the White House will make that decision for you.  You must be a part of an organized group, and the purpose of your trip must fit within 1 of 12 licensing categories determined by bureaucrats at the Treasury I suspect they have never been to  You must have a designated chaperone to verify that, Heaven forbid, you do not stray from the program submitted to and approved--you hope--by the Treasury Department, whose employees and bureaucrats you have never met. If your application is interminably delayed or denied--for whatever reason--you are out of luck. There is no appeal.  Now, that is how the White House says that Cuba will become a democracy. By curtailing the freedom of Americans to travel and spend their hard earned money there. By behaving the way we would expect of a communist dictatorship--not of the world's oldest democracy, where the government's job is to protect individual freedom, not trample on it. The example we set for Cuba is by trampling on the rights of our own people.  How well did restricting travel by Americans to Cuba work from 1961 until 2014, when President Obama relaxed those Cold War restrictions, decades after the Russians had abandoned the island and Cuba no longer posed any threat to us? It failed miserably. At the same time, it treated the Cuban and American people as pawns in a political game.  Throughout those many years, the Castro government had a ready excuse for its own failings and repressive policies. They could blame it on the United States, and for many years, the Cuban people believed it because we, with our embargo, wouldn't let Americans travel to Cuba or do business there. But with the possible exception of the Pope, I don't think any foreigner has been received as warmly or engendered as much hope for the future as President Obama did when he and First Lady Michelle Obama visited It was amazing to watch the reaction of the people in  President Trump claims President Obama got a bad deal when our flag went up at the U.Embassy a little less than 2 years ago, after more than half a century. But President Trump has yet to say what the deal he believes he could obtain would look like. His so-called deal could be described in one word, ``capitulation,'' which hasn't worked for over 50 years.  The White House decries the decrepit Cuban military's role in the economy, as if it poses a threat to us or is somehow an aberration. They should look at the role of Egypt's military and Russia's and Indonesia's and Pakistan's. They have their hands in all kinds of business and real estate ventures.  They point out the number of people arrested in Cuba has increased. I have condemned the arrests of peaceful protesters. These arrests are wrong, but they are also wrong in the countries whose repressive governments the President has praised, some of which he regards as close allies of the United  Now, like Americans, the Cuban people know that fundamental change will not happen quickly and that the revolutionaries who overthrew one dictator only to be replaced by another will hold on to power while they can. But they also know that their time is ending, that Cuba is changing, and that the American people can support them best by engaging with them.  Secretary of State Tillerson says the administration is ``motivated by the conviction that the more we engage with other nations on issues of security and prosperity, the more we will have opportunities to shape the human rights conditions in those nations.'' Apparently, this administration should have added: ``except for Cuba.''  On May 25, Senator Flake and I, along with 53 Democratic and Republican cosponsors, introduced the Freedom for Americans to Travel to Cuba[[Page S3747]]It is, frankly, absurd that such legislation is even necessary to restore the American people's freedom to travel that the Federal Government should never have taken away.  Fifty-five Senators of both parties are on record in support of doing away with the restrictions in law that even President Obama could not fix; and, frankly, if there is a vote on this bill, it will pass overwhelmingly. I hope the majority leader will strike a blow for democracy and actually let us have that vote so we can show the Cuban people what real democracy looks like when people are allowed to vote.  We support freedom not only for the people of Cuba, we support it for the American people because we reject the idea that any government should deny its citizens the right to travel freely, least of all our own government. We actually believe Secretary Tillerson's rhetoric. We believe that restoring the punitive policy of the past is little more than a misguided act of vengeance rooted in a half-century-old family feud that will do nothing to bring freedom to  Who do we see now coming to Cuba to build a railroad? The Who do we see as we turn our back on Cuba planning to invest there? The Let's not repeat the mistake we made for 50 years.  The Cuban people and the American people want closer relations. Every single poll shows that. I wish President Trump would listen to the American people rather than to a tiny minority who want to turn back the clock.  If we really care about freedom in Cuba, we should flood Cuba with American visitors and make it possible for American farmers and American companies to compete there as they would in any other country.  If we really care about freedom, our government should stop playing Big Brother with the lives of It doesn't work. It has never worked. Frankly, it is wrong.  I yield the floor.

7367,topic-id,959,"Mr.Chairman, I, like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, am concerned about[[Page H5090]]the long-term prospects for water infrastructure and storage in the  As the western climate continues to get hotter, we are going to have more hot, dry, drought years. That is why many States and communities, including the cities that I represent, are doing all that they can to make their water infrastructure more resilient, to reduce unneeded runoff, to recycle water, and to store as much ground water as possible.  To support these critical activities, Congress needs to invest in our country's water infrastructure. The bill before us today does not do any of these things. It does not authorize new or additional funding for water projects. It is not an infrastructure bill.  Instead, the bill before us today makes many Americans nervous because it loosens key environmental safeguards and imposes arbitrary deadlines for the approval of dams on our rivers and streams. This bill threatens the health of our streams, our rivers, and coastlines, which could harm fish populations important to commercial fisheries.  Therefore, I am offering a straightforward amendment. It simply requires proposed new dams to go through the normal project review process if they are likely to harm commercial fisheries.  The construction of poorly permitted dams has been a major cause of mortality for California's fisheries. In California's Central Valley, they currently block Chinook salmon and steelhead from more than 90 percent of the historical spawning habitat.  My amendment will help protect my State's economically important fisheries from further harm. Commercial fisheries from my home State sustain thousands of jobs across California and the West Coast, and, currently, we have what can only be described as a fisheries crisis.  Many fisheries are at record-low population levels. According to some estimates, 78 percent of California's native salmon will be extinct or disappear within the next century if current trends continue.  Simply put, many West Coast fishermen and fisherwomen who depend on California's fish runs are hanging on by a thread. The thousands of fishermen and fisherwomen, and other employees of restaurants, hotels, and other businesses that depend on healthy fish runs, have been struggling mightily.  Even now, many fishermen and fisherwomen are still recovering from the total closure of the ocean salmon fishery along the West Coast in 2008 and 2009, because of poor California salmon returns. The closure devastated the Pacific Coast fishing industry and, ultimately, required millions of dollars in disaster aid from  In recent years, fishery managers have also had to severely restrict commercial fishing season because of low population levels. My amendment will help prevent future harm to people who are already struggling just to get by.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.  The The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, first I would point out to my friend from California, if the climate continues to warm, we are not going to be able to store as much water in our mountains as snow, and we are going to need much more surface water storage reservoirs than the laws have allowed us to build because of the delays they have imposed in planning and construction.  The gentleman's amendment gives the Secretary of the Interior the ability to ignore this streamlining law if he determines it could ``cause harm to commercial fisheries.''  Well, now, remember, this bill makes no changes to any of our existing laws or regulations. It makes no changes to the licenses and permits required for a project or the criteria for obtaining those licenses and permits. It makes no changes to any law or regulation that could affect commercial fisheries or, for that matter, anything else.  It simply says that the agencies and jurisdictions involved with these projects have to cooperate and coordinate and communicate with each other, and it requires the science guiding these decisions to be available to the public to review and scrutinize.  So why the amendment? Well, for one reason and one reason only, I think, because for the last 8 years, we have had an administration that was actively hostile to constructing new reservoirs. That administration has used the fragmented nature of the approval process as a way to delay projects indefinitely. That is what this proposal corrects.  Mr.Lowenthal's amendment would allow any administration so inclined to make a specious finding as an excuse to ignore this law. Project applicants would not know from one election to the next whether their millions of dollars of studies and investments would suddenly come to naught, and projects already well along in the planning and approval process could find their efforts coming to a screeching halt.  For our laws to work, they must be predictable and fair. Mr.Lowenthal's amendment is a poison pill to render this law unpredictable and capricious.  The irony is this: the gentleman's constituents in southern California have the most to lose from his amendment because southern California depends on surplus water from northern And let me make this very clear to the gentleman and his constituents: northern California has first claim on northern California water.  If we can't store the extra water in the north, there is no surplus for the south, and the gentleman's constituents can look forward to dead lawns and gardens, brown parks, empty swimming pools, astronomical water and electricity prices, spiraling grocery prices, and a future where they will have to ration and stretch every drop of water and every watt of electricity in their parched and sweltering homes. They might want to ask him about that some day.

Pacific Coast Federation                                  of Fishermen's Associations,                                                    June 12, 2017.       Dear Representative: The Pacific Coast Federation of      Fishermen's Associations (PCFFA) is the largest organization      of commercial fishing families on the West Coast,      representing the interests of hundreds of family-owned      commercial fishing operations who harvest and deliver fresh      seafood to American consumers and for export. Collectively,      we represent many thousands of family wage jobs and a West      Coast commercial fishing industry that contributes billions      of dollars to the U.economy.       On behalf of the hundreds of hard working commercial      fishermen we represent, we are OPPOSED to H.1654 for many      reasons, among them the following:       While the concept of streamlining permitting for federal      water projects is attractive on its face, our primary problem      in the arid west is not a lack of water storage projects, but      lack of funds for maintaining and repairing the many existing      projects that are already in place. Hundreds of existing      water projects are badly in need of repair, with many      dangerously close to failing. And as we recently witnessed      with the catastrophic failure of the Oroville Dam, an      ``expedited review process'' like what is envisioned in H.     1654 could lead to poor or rushed impacts analyses      potentially resulting in further catastrophe or economic      disruption. It is now apparent that the Oroville Dam's 2017      emergency spillway failure was predicted--but the warning      signs were ignored--in its expedited environmental impacts      review process.       H.1654 is simply the wrong approach. It would undermine      existing laws protecting both the public and public resources      by making the U.Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) the      lead agency for all environmental reviews, in effect leaving      Reclamation in control of the entire environmental review      process. However, Reclamation has neither the expertise nor      the capacity of the U.Fish and Wildlife Service or the      National Marine Fisheries Service to inform the development      of major infrastructure projects to reduce their impact on      valuable wildlife and fisheries. Under H.1654, these      agencies would be stripped of their authority and duties to      oversee and authorize water storage projects, to the      detriment of the people of the West and the American      taxpayer.       H.1654 also implements overly restricted and burdensome      project review timelines, including provisions that would      require expedited review under the National Environmental      Policy Act (NEPA)--timelines that may be inappropriate for      very complex projects like the damming of streams and rivers.      These fast-tracking provisions interfere with the ability of      agencies and the public to meaningfully analyze proposed      complex projects, and could also limit the public's ability      to weigh in on infrastructure developments that could affect      communities for decades. Further, the bill permits non-     federal public entities to contribute funds to expedite      project permitting, raising serious conflicts of interest      questions about the fairness and impartiality of the federal      review process.       H.1654 also establishes perverse incentives for western      states to cede their independent authority. Under the new      regulatory scheme, state agencies could be compelled to      adhere to the bill's procedures, thereby requiring those      state agencies to cede control to Reclamation and comply with      its timelines. This weakens the essential and independent      role that states play in reviewing proposed water      infrastructure projects within their borders.       We sincerely request that you vote NO on H.1654. This      bill will not solve the problems it purports to address, and      it would have widespread consequences far beyond water      deliveries and water storage, including adverse effects to      regional and local fishing industry economies and the jobs      and communities those economies support.           Sincerely,                                                   Noah Oppenheim,     Executive                                  ____                                              American Rivers,                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2017.     U.House Committee on Natural Resources,     Washington,       Dear Members of the U.House Committee on Natural      Resources: I am writing on behalf of American Rivers and our      200,000 members to oppose H.1654, the Water Supply      Permitting Coordination Act, which is before the Committee on      April 26, 2017. We understand that new surface storage      projects are a consideration as part of a multi-faceted      portfolio aimed at addressing long term drought in the      Western United We also share Congress' view that      long-term, balanced solutions to drought and water supply      security that support and protect local economies, the      viability of agriculture, municipal water supplies,      recreation, and the riparian environment are critical to the      future of Western communities. H.1654, however, fails to      provide a long-term, balanced solution, and goes far beyond      the scope of authorities vested in the Bureau of Reclamation      (the ``Bureau'') while undermining the critical role other      federal agencies, tribes, and states play in the permitting      of water supply projects in the We remain concerned      about the potential harmful impacts to management authorities      designed to protect streams and conserve watersheds. In light      of these concerns, we ask you to oppose H.1654.       This legislation amends the Reclamation Act, 43 U.S.371,      et seq., in a way that undermines the management authorities      of other federal agencies, tribes, and states. H.1654      allows the Bureau to preempt state laws and procedural      requirements for agency decision-making by dictating      unreasonable deadlines. It also weakens authorities under      Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Act, as well as other      federal laws, by subordinating all other State and federal      agencies to the Bureau's sense of how much time those      administering agencies should have to do their jobs.       Specifically, H.1654:       Designates the Bureau as the lead agency and allows the      Bureau to set the schedule for all federal authorizations,      including those issued pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA),      the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Federal Land Policy and      Management Act (FLPMA), the Coastal Zone Management Act      (CZMA), the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA), and other      federal authorizations, even where those authorizations have      been delegated or devolved to the states or Native American      tribes.       Forces all other federal, state, and tribal agencies to      comply with the Bureau's schedule and to defer to the      Bureau's proposed scope of environmental review.       Effectively waives the Endangered Species Act or the Clean      Water Act if a state, tribe, or federal agency cannot meet      the Bureau's schedule or misses a deadline. The Bureau and      the project applicant may simply proceed with the proposed      action and the authorization is waived. There are no similar      remedies or penalties if the Bureau or the project applicant      fails to meet a deadline, or if delay caused by Bureau or the      project applicant results in an agency missing a deadline.      The end result of this and the following provisions could be      that states and tribes may be forced to deny certification      for new projects in order to avoid potential legal liability.       It is important that federal natural resource agencies      retain the authority and responsibility to condition      operations of surface storage projects so as to protect      streams and other public resources. A key part of protecting      watersheds, especially in the arid West, is maintaining      healthy flows in streams. For years, American Rivers has      worked with the federal land management agencies, tribes,      states and other stakeholders to protect healthy river flows      on public lands. Federal land managers, states, tribes and      the public have an important role to play in protecting      streams--based on the Property Clause of the Constitution,      Section 505 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act,      and other authorities--and they also have a responsibility to      work with their stakeholders to do it right. Provisions of      H.1654 would harm the ability of federal land managers,      states, and tribes to use these authorities to protect      streams, rivers, and vital fisheries.       We oppose H.1654, and urge Congress to carefully      consider the impacts of the legislation on federal, tribal      and state authority before proceeding further and determine      if legislation is needed.

This      legislation threatens tens of thousands of fishing related      jobs and could result in severe impacts to a salmon fishing      industry that is highly vulnerable today.[[Page H5092]]          Surface Storage and California's Salmon Fishing Industry       Surface storage projects have been the leading cause of the      decline of California's historic salmon fishery. In the past      decade, surface storage projects contributed to the first      ever, historic closure of the California salmon fishery in      2008 and 2009. A fishery worth an estimated $1.4 billion in      annual economic activity to California in a normal season was      shattered. This had devastating impacts on the 23,000 men and      women whose livelihoods depend on the commercial and      recreational salmon fishery.       In significant part as a result of dam projects, the health      of our coastal fishing communities has decreased. We've seen      a decline in the number of commercial salmon boats registered      to fish from almost 5,000 in the late 1980's to just over      1,000 today. Once bustling salmon ports, like Fort Bragg and      Eureka are lined with crumbling docks and pier pilings. In      some places there aren't enough fish crossing the docks to      maintain basic infrastructure like boat repair yards, fuel      docks and ice making machines. Where once proud freshly      painted houses beamed pride of fisherman ownership, too many      are sadly in need of repair. Go to any California harbor with      commercial fishing activity and inspect the deck hardware and      rigging on boats and you'll see what deferred maintenance      looks like for people who struggle to keep a roof over their      family's heads and pay the bills.       Because of low populations of adult salmon in 2017, salmon      fishing for much of Northern California has been closed      entirely this year. For the remainder of the California      coast, the commercial fishing fleet has lost approximately      two thirds of their traditional fishing season. These low      population numbers are the result of the drought and the      impacts of existing surface storage projects.       Decision-makers should respond to this crisis by      strengthening efforts to restore salmon runs. However, H.     1654 could increase the impacts of dam projects on salmon,      with potentially devastating consequences.                           Specific Concerns       This legislation threatens to weaken analysis and      permitting for surface storage projects, with significant      potential impacts on salmon. GGSA offers the following      specific concerns.       Interfering With The Use of the Best Available Science: The      bill would allow the Bureau of Reclamation to control the      administrative record used by all federal agencies in      reviewing surface storage projects. At best, the Bureau lacks      the environmental expertise of the regulatory agencies on a      range of issues, including salmon. In addition, as a      potential applicant for surface storage projects, the Bureau      would have a clear conflict of interest, were they to be      given control of the record used by all federal agencies.      Further, the Bureau has a record of asserting dubious      environmental benefits from surface storage projects and      working to suppress analysis by federal agencies. As a      result, it is highly inappropriate for the Bureau to be given      control of a single administrative record to be used by all      federal agencies.       Interfering with Agency Review: The bill would give the      Bureau authority to establish a binding schedule for all      federal agency environmental review and permitting. For the      same reasons cited above, this is inappropriate. In addition,      this requirement would produce unnecessary, costly and time      consuming litigation, in the likely event that a schedule      adopted by the Bureau does not allow adequate time for review      by regulatory agencies.       Undermining State Review of Projects: In cases where states      chose to opt in, the bill would give the Bureau control over      the administrative record and schedule for state agencies. In      such a case, the bill would allow the Bureau undue control      over state analysis and permitting. This is highly      inappropriate, given more than a century of traditional      federal deference to state law.       Surface Storage Bias: Surface storage construction and      operation is among the water management activities with the      most severe impacts on salmon and salmon rivers. This      legislation inappropriately restricts analysis for the most      environmentally destructive method of storing water and      generating new water supplies, but not for less destructive      activities.       For the above reasons, we urge you to oppose this damaging      and unnecessary bill.       Thank you for considering our comments.           Sincerely,                                                     John McManus,                                               Executive  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5082.txt,2111,RECOGNIZING GASPERI FAMILY,2017.0,22.0,July

Mr.Mr.Chair, by that token, I will include in the Record the support of the United States Chamber of Commerce as well as the Family Farm Alliance and others in support of this bill and the jobs that will expand as a result of its adoption.                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2017.       To the Members of the U.House of Representatives: The      U.Chamber of Commerce urges you to approve H.1654, the      ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act,'' which would      streamline the permitting process for new surface water      storage projects. The Chamber may consider including votes      on, or in relation to, H.1654 in our annual How They Voted      scorecard.       H.1654 would establish the Bureau of Reclamation as the      lead agency for coordinating environmental reviews and      permitting new or expanded non-federal surface storage      facilities. The bill also would allow the Secretary of the      Interior to accept funds from non-federal public entities and      to use those funds to expedite the permitting process for      designated projects. This type of coordination and      streamlining is essential to the development and construction      of much-needed water storage projects.       The structure of H.1654 tracks the permit streamlining      provisions contained in Title 41 of the Fixing America's      Surface Transportation Act, which was passed during the 114th      The Chamber urges you to approve H.1654.           Sincerely,                                                  Neil Bradley,     Senior Vice President & Chief Policy                                  ____                                         Family Farm Alliance,                                 Klamath Falls, OR, March 8, 2017.     Tom McClintock,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman McClintock: On behalf of the Family Farm      Alliance (Alliance), we write to express our support for your      ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act''. This important      legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to      coordinate Federal and State permitting processes related to      the construction of new surface water storage projects on      lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior      and the Secretary of Agriculture and to designate the Bureau      of Reclamation as the lead agency for permit processing, and      for other purposes.       The Alliance is a grassroots organization of family      farmers, ranchers, irrigation districts and allied industries      in 16 Western states. Several of our members are mutual ditch      and irrigation districts. The Alliance is focused on one      mission: To ensure the availability of reliable, affordable      irrigation water supplies to Western farmers and ranchers.       The ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act'' provides a      critical first step towards addressing current regulatory and      bureaucratic challenges that many times will delay or even      halt the development of new water supply enhancement projects      in the Western United The recent drought has ramped      up much-needed Congressional interest to enact legislation      that will allow Western water providers to better manage and      prepare for future dry times. Now, the heaviest rain in a      decade has overwhelmed parts of the West Coast, underscoring      the critical importance of having modernized and enhanced      water storage infrastructure in place to optimize water      resources management for the future.       Family Farm Alliance members rely on the traditional water      and power infrastructure built over the last century to      deliver irrigation water supplies vital to their farming      operations. Our membership has been advocating for new water      storage facilities for over twenty years, and we have      provided specific recommendations to Congress and the White      House on how to streamline restrictive federal regulations to      help make these projects happen.       As you are aware, developing new water storage projects is      much easier said than done. For many reasons--political,      economic and social--the construction of traditional surface      water storage projects is undertaken on a much more limited      basis than in decades past. Even if federal authorization and      funding, or funding from non-federal sources, is secured for      a new storage project, the existing procedures for permitting      the development of additional water supplies can make project      approval incredibly burdensome.       By the time project applicants approach federal agencies      for permits to construct multimillion dollar projects they      have already invested extensive resources toward analyzing      project alternatives to determine which project is best      suited to their budgetary constraints. However, current      procedure dictates that federal agencies formulate another      list of project alternatives which the applicant must assess,      comparing potential impacts with the preferred alternative.      These alternatives often conflict with state law or are      simply not implementable in the first place yet valuable      resources are required to be expended to further study these      additional alternatives in the federal permitting process.       Thus, we strongly support your bill. We look forward to      working with you, the 115th Congress and other interested      parties to build a consensus for improving the federal      regulatory and permitting process. If we don't find a way to      restore water supply reliability for Western irrigated      agriculture through a combination of new water supply and      management infrastructure, other water supply enhancement      efforts and demand management--our country's ability to feed      and clothe itself and the world will be jeopardized.       This bill takes an important step towards addressing this      critical need. I encourage you or your staff to contact Dan      Keppen if you have any questions.           Sincerely,     Patrick O'Toole,           Dan Keppen,       Executive Director.[[Page H5093]]                                       ____                                         Association of California                                               Water Agencies,                                                    June 19, 2017.     Re Support for H.1654.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The      Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) is pleased to      support H.1654, the ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination      Act''. ACWA's 450 public water agency members supply over 90      percent of the water delivered in California for residential,      agricultural, and industrial uses.       As demonstrated by California's recent historic drought, it      is important that Congress take actions now that help ensure      California has sufficient water supplies for the future. Had      the streamlining provisions contained in H.1654 been in      effect prior to the drought, California's water      infrastructure and water supplies could have been improved to      help mitigate much of the current personal and economic      suffering that occurred.       Moreover, H.1654 is consistent with policy principles      ACWA has formally adopted embracing environmental and      economic sustainability as co-equal priorities for water      management in       Thank you for this opportunity to express ACWA's support      for H.1654.           Sincerely,                                                   David Reynolds,     Director of Federal                                  ____                                              Voith Hydro                                          York, PA, June 20, 2017.     Tom McClintock,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman McClintock: On behalf of Voith Hydro, I am      writing today to extend our strong support for H.1654, the      Water Supply Permitting Coordination Voith Hydro is a      manufacturer of hydroelectric equipment and technology based      in York, Additionally, we have Voith Hydro      Services facilities located in Chattanooga, Tennessee and      Springfield, Voith Hydro currently employees      approximately 680 workers across the United Water      storage issues are critical to our ability to provide both      the energy and jobs that sustain a nation.       As you are well aware, water provides multiple benefits to      communities across the country. Without an abundant supply of      water storage in the United States, hydropower production      cannot reach its full potential. These same communities have      been able to thrive in large part due to abundant water      supplies and the production of renewable hydropower,      especially in your home district in Northern      Increasing water storage throughout the country will allow      for better management during drought conditions, and thus      prevent power outages to communities reliant on      hydroelectricity.       Streamlining the permitting process to expand and develop      new water storage throughout the United States is critical to      increasing and upgrading our Country's infrastructure. I am      pleased to see that Congress continues to consider bills      targeted to improve the permitting processes and hope that      other infrastructure permitting streamlining continues,      especially as it concerns hydropower development.       I encourage the passage of the Water Supply Permitting Act      this week in the House of Representatives and look forward to      working with you on similar issues in the future. Thank you      for your leadership on water storage and other critical      issues.

Tom McClintock,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman McClintock: The Municipal Water District      of Orange County (MWDOC) is pleased to support your measure,      H.1654--``The Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act.''      We applaud your efforts to streamline the permitting process      that relates to the construction of new surface water storage      projects on lands. This coordination is long overdue and will      ultimately benefit the entire state.       The rains this past winter emphasized the critical need      California has for surface water storage. We cannot let this      resource slip out to the ocean due to lack of places to put      it. Allowing the Bureau of Reclamation to be the coordinating      agency for projects on Interior or Department of Agriculture      lands will make the process more efficient and speed up the      process for critical water infrastructure projects in our      state.       The Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC), a      water agency serving the needs of more than two million      residents and 28 retail water agencies, voted unanimously to      support your legislation and to assist with its passage.

7391,topic-id,1557,"Madam President, in December of 2015, nearly 200 nations gathered in Paris in order to reach an agreement that each country would make a commitment to the reduction of dangerous greenhouse gases that were warming the planet and causing more and more havoc across this entire world.  That agreement is something that was hard-won. It took the leadership of the United States because so much of the CO2 that had been sent up into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age was red, white, and blue. It called upon each nation to make a commitment, and they did. The countries making commitments equaled 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emitters.  The Trump administration has many advisers telling the President that he should pull out of this Paris Agreement, that he should cede leadership to[[Page S2791]]the Germans, to the Chinese, and to other nations rather than having the United States continue to be the leader. That would be very dangerous for our country because we would be ceding leadership in this clean energy revolution to other countries around the planet.  There are still many who do not understand the role this clean energy revolution is already playing inside our country. In 2016, we deployed nearly 24,000 new megawatts of wind and solar on our planet. To put it another way, in 2005, the total amount of solar energy that was deployed in the United States was 79 megawatts--79. In 2016, we deployed 14,000 megawatts of new solar power.  Wind--last year, we deployed another 8,000 megawatts in our country. We are heading toward a point where we have an incredible number of people who are working in these industries. Remember, there are no more than 65 to 75,000 people who are still working as coal miners in the United In Massachusetts alone, we now have more than 100,000 people who work in the clean energy sector. In wind and solar alone in our country right now, we have 360,000 people who work in those sectors.  By the year 2020, if we just continue at the pace at which we have been moving over the last several years, there will be 600,000 people working in the wind and solar sector. That is the future. That is where we should be going. Those are the goals we should be trying to reach.  Instead, what President Trump is saying is that the United States is a technological weakling, that the United States cannot do it, that the United States can't find the capacity to be able to meet this challenge, that we have to give up.  The President says he is going to revive the coal industry, a 19th century industry, instead of trying to have the United States be the leader in this world on the production of clean energy technologies.  Last night, I was at the Kennedy Library, and we were celebrating the 100th birthday of President John On that occasion last evening, the library presented to Barack Obama his Profile in Courage Amongst other things that were cited was his commitment to dealing with this challenge of climate change that is affecting our planet and the role that the United States can and should play in the solving of that problem.  President Obama promulgated last year a Clean Power That Clean Power Plan was intended to reduce greenhouse gases in the utilities sector by 32 percent by the year 2030. President Trump has already said: We can't accomplish that. We can't figure that out. We don't know how to reduce those greenhouse gases.  In 1961, President Kennedy said that we were going to put a man on the Moon in 8 years and return those pilots back to Earth safely. We had to invent new metals. We had to invent new propulsion systems. President Kennedy said that we were not going to do it because it was easy but because it was hard.  We were threatened by the Soviet Union for supremacy in outer space. President Kennedy challenged our Nation to respond to the threat of the Soviet Union, and we won.  Here we are, nearly 60 years later, with another challenge, a challenge that threatens this planet. President Trump says that as a nation we are not up to the challenge. As a nation, we can't figure out how to solve this problem, even though the solutions are already out there and being deployed across this  Another example of solutions like wind and solar: Elon Musk has a new all-electric vehicle that is going to cost $35,000 and is going to be deployed next year; 400,000 of these vehicles are to be sold. That is a game-changing moment in the history of the automobile, going back to its invention. It is a game changer. To a certain extent, for existing industries, it is a game-over moment unless they get into this all-electric vehicle revolution.  What is Elon Musk doing? Elon Musk is creating a Darwinian, paranoia-inducing environment within which all of the rest of these automotive companies are now going to have to operate--go electric or perish economically as a company.  This is how far it has come: Right now, Tesla has a market value that for all intents and purposes is equal to Ford and to General That is how much the American people have given in terms of confidence in this company, in this man.  We can do it. It should be the President of the United States who is saying we can do it. The rest of the world expects us to do it.  Why do we continue to import oil into our country from Saudi Arabia? Why do we continue to import oil from other countries around this planet? Why can't the President set as a goal that we are going to have 100 percent renewables in our country by the year 2050, that we are going to accept it as a national challenge in the same way that President Kennedy accepted the challenge in 1961 to put a man on the Moon, to control, to dominate in outer space?  This is a letter to President Trump, which is in today's New York The full-page ad says:       Dear President Trump,       As some of the largest companies based or operating in the      United States, we strongly urge you to keep the United States      Paris Agreement on climate change.  What are the names of these companies? Adobe, Apple, Danfoss, Facebook, Gap, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Ingersoll Rand, Intel, Johnson Controls, Mars Incorporated, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, National Grid, PG&E Corporation, Salesforce, Schneider Electric, Unilever, VF  This isn't the President challenging companies in our country to respond to the challenge. These are the companies in America challenging the President to respond to the challenge. It is the Kennedy era on its head; it is like JFK in reverse. He is saying we can't do it when the private sector is saying we can.  Ultimately, this challenge to our competitiveness globally is something that Donald Trump is going to forfeit for our workers. This opportunity to create jobs and markets and growth is going to be something that we lose.  We need a President who is going to stand up for this stable, practical framework, which is giving an incentive to the private sector to solve this problem. We will be creating jobs while saving all of creation. That is what the winning formula is going to be.  This Paris Agreement is going to lead to increased competitiveness in jobs, in economic growth. By remaining a party to the Paris Agreement, rather than retreating, we will give Americans the opportunity to harness that can-do spirit and technical know-how to create new businesses and jobs. We will give our Nation the opportunity to be a leader in the global effort to address climate change. We will give America the opportunity to lead in this century and into the next.  I urge the United States to remain in the Paris We can either be the leader or the laggard internationally in developing the new clean energy technologies that will drive our economy and help combat climate change.  It is a sad day for our Nation when the President of the United States is challenged by the private sector to step up, especially when he calls himself the CEO President of our country. He is turning his back on these innovative companies that want to be able to create jobs here in our country in order to save our planet. I pray for the well-being of our planet and that the President honors this commitment.  I think that the French made a huge statement yesterday in electing their new President, He was saying to the French people: We must engage the rest of the planet. We must work with the rest of the planet.  The Paris Agreement was signed in France in December of 2015. That election yesterday, I think, should be taken as a signal that we should not be retreating from our global leadership.  I urge this administration to adopt an approach that does unleash further this wind and solar and all-electric vehicle revolution.  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

7546,topic-id,929,"Mr.President, since the first day of this administration, I have heard from women in my home State and nationwide who are fearful of what President Trump will do to their health and rights--from appointing a Supreme Court Justice who has made clear that he opposes the historic ruling in Roe v. Wade, to trying at every turn to undermine women's access to safe, legal abortion here in the United States and abroad, to proposing a budget that would defund Planned Parenthood and devastate investments in women's health. I know from letters, calls, emails, tweets, rallies--you name it--that across the country women feel under attack because of this administration's policies and the willingness of Republicans in Congress to make sure they are carried out.  Women are worried and, unfortunately, they have a right to be, especially in this moment. In a matter of[[Page S3691]]days, Senate Republicans could bring their version of TrumpCare to this floor. As many of us have said, this is the worst bill for women in a generation. It will cut off access to critical healthcare services at Planned Parenthood, our Nation's largest provider of women's healthcare. It will allow our insurance companies to go back to charging women more and interfere with women's constitutionally protected reproductive rights. In fact, at literally every stage of life, TrumpCare would stand in the way of women's access to the healthcare they need.  Under this bill, young girls nationwide would lose Medicaid coverage. College students across the country who go to Planned Parenthood for contraception would find the centers they rely on shuttered. Women would pay $1,000 more a month for maternity care, and women battling cancer and women who are survivors would have to look ahead to being discriminated against for having a preexisting condition. Senior women would watch their premiums spike by as much as 850 percent because of the age tax Republicans have inexplicitly chosen to include in this bill.  I could go on, but let me just say that since President Trump and Republicans first began trying to jam this bill through, I have heard from countless women who would be impacted by the cruel policies I have just described.  One of them is Her son has a developmental disability and he gets Medicaid coverage. There is Jennifer, who is fighting cancer tooth and nail and is now worrying about what is going to happen if the Medicaid expansion goes away. There is Tammy, whose congenital heart disease made pregnancy life threatening and who was able to afford safe and effective contraception because of her insurance coverage. Those are just a few examples. I am so grateful to them and to the many, many others who have spoken out and shared their stories.  We might think that with so many women thinking about how this bill would impact them, with so much at stake for women's health, rights, and financial security should TrumpCare be signed into law, Senate Republicans would want to see what women thought of their version of But they have made it abundantly and offensively clear that they do not.  They put together a working group of 13 men to draft their version. They negotiated in secret. They wrote this bill in back rooms. Now Senate Republicans are keeping it under lock and key until the very last minute so that women have as little time as possible to see just how badly this bill could harm them and their families. Women aren't going to put up with that, and Democrats aren't either.  I am proud to be here this evening with a number of my Democratic colleagues to call on Senate Republicans to stop hiding their bill from women and bring it out in the light for the scrutiny it deserves.  My Republican colleagues are right, I think, to be ashamed of this version of But that doesn't mean it should be hidden from view, and we are not going to stop until women across the country get to read the fine print, instead of taking 13 male Republican Senators' word for it.  While this is a truly difficult and frightening time for anyone who believes that women should be able to make their own decisions about their own healthcare and who think politicians should not be able to interfere with those decisions, I have also been truly inspired by the response I have seen to the extreme agenda President Trump and Republicans are pursuing.  Since the first days of this administration, when I was so proud to march with millions of women across this country and the world to stand up for women's health and women's rights, women have continued to lead the fight against this administration's constant efforts to take our country backward. That is exactly what TrumpCare would do.  So let me be very clear. If Senate Republicans continue down this path, if they choose to jam a secret bill through Congress and get it signed into law instead of listening to people in this country and to us and working with us on real solutions to fix our healthcare system, you can be sure that women across the country--who will be forced to pay more for their care or lose it altogether--are going to be ready to make sure Republicans own every ounce of the harm they cause.  So I am here tonight to urge Republicans to make the right choice, and I will join women across the country in holding them fully accountable if they don't.  I yield the floor.

7386,topic-id,1852,"Mr.President, I want to talk as well about the Republican healthcare plan and point out why it is moving on very treacherous territory when it will affect the funding of Medicaid by lessening the amount of Medicaid money that will be spent in the States, because so much of that Medicaid money is going to address the opioid crisis.  The opioid crisis, we found last year--you know, there was a lot of talk about it being in New Hampshire when the eyes of America were on New Hampshire in the New Hampshire primary. But the fact is, it is in every State now. It is particularly so in my State of There are something like 2,600 deaths that have occurred in Florida as a result of opioid overdoses. So the seriousness with which we are addressing this issue ought to be of extreme concern, and we ought to be doing something about it. Yet a bill just passed by the House of Representatives is doing exactly the opposite. It is going to cut It is a fancy term, cutting Medicaid with a block grant. What it means is that it is going to be capped. That means a State is not going to get any more Medicaid once that cap has been hit, unless the State responds. So, in essence, it is going to cost the States more money. I don't think you will find many States that are in such a fiscal condition that, in fact, they could do that.  So what are we doing? We are harming poor people and the disabled who get their healthcare from Medicare and In fact, we are not only harming all of them, but addressing the opioid crisis will be particularly hurt.  What I want to talk about today is the Republican healthcare plan that passed out of the House last week. This plan is going to increase costs for older Remember, it is going to go on a ratio. Instead of 1 to 3, or older Americans being charged three times as much in health insurance as younger Americans, it is going to go up to a ratio of at least 1 to 5, and maybe more. So it is going to increase costs for older It is going to cut Medicaid, and it is going to take healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of people.  Right now as a result of the ACA, there are 24 million people who have health insurance coverage who did not have it before this law was passed in 2010. It is going to reverse that. Do we want to take away healthcare from people who can now have healthcare through Medicaid and/or health insurance because they can now afford health insurance? Is that really a goal the United States wants to do--to take away healthcare through private health insurance? I don't think that is what we want to do, but that is what the House of Representatives' Republican healthcare bill has done.  If we just look at my State of Florida, there are almost 8 million people who have a so-called preexisting condition. This includes something as common as asthma. That is a preexisting condition. As a former elected insurance commissioner of Florida, I can tell you that some insurance companies would use as an excuse as a preexisting condition something as simple as a rash and say: Because you have a preexisting condition, we are not going to insure you. Under the existing law, the Affordable Care Act, an insurance company cannot deny you with a preexisting condition. Just in my State alone, there are almost 8 million people who have a preexisting condition. Are we going to turn them out on the streets because their insurance company says they are not going to carry them anymore? I don't think that is what we want to do.  The bill allows insurers to charge older Americans at least five times more than what they charge younger adults. Is that what we want to do?  What is the principle of insurance? The principle of insurance is that you spread the risk. You get as many people in the pool as you can--young, old, sick, healthy--and you spread that risk.  If you get fire insurance on your home, you are paying a premium every month and the insurance company has calculated in an actuarial calculation what it is going to cost you to insure, and you are part of hundreds of thousands of people in that pool who are also insuring against fire damaging their house. It is the same principle with health insurance. So you get young and old, sick and well, and some people with preexisting conditions, and you spread that risk over a lot of people. One of the fallacies we hear is that we can create this by creating a high-risk pool. In other words, we are going to set up some money for people who have really sick conditions, and we are going to take care of them. That is the most inefficient way to do it because insurance is about spreading risk, not concentrating risk, which is what a high-risk pool exactly is. So the House of Representatives, which has concocted this thing called the Republican healthcare plan, has come up with exactly the opposite idea of funding--instead of spreading the risk, concentrating the risk, and then saying that they are going out and getting $8 billion and that is going to pay for it. It is not even going to touch it. It is the most inefficient way to approach the subject of spreading risk, because they don't spread the risk. They concentrate the risk.  What this bill does is that over 10 years it cuts over $800 billion out of You start doing that, and you are going to lose what we know of as Medicaid, a healthcare program primarily for the poor and the disabled.  By the way, isn't it interesting that they cut over $800 billion and save it out of Medicaid, and what did they do in the same bill? They give upwards of $600 billion in tax breaks to those who are at the highest income levels. Let me get this right. It is kind of a reversed Robin I am going to take from the poor by cutting $800 billion, and I am going to give to the rich by tax breaks for the highest income folks. Is that what we want to do? I don't think so.  Medicaid is a program that guarantees healthcare for millions of Americans, including children, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and seniors on long-term care. Think about that. What am I talking about? It is seniors in long-term care, seniors in nursing homes, who don't have enough resources or enough assets in order to pay for their care in their twilight years. Therefore, they are being paid by Medicaid, and that is the only source of income to take care of them. Is that what we want to cut in order to give a tax break for the highest income group? It ought to be the reverse. That is upside-down thinking.  Last week the Florida Medical Examiners Commission released new data[[Page S2789]]showing that over 2,600 Floridians have died from opioids in just the first half of 2016 alone. Over the entire year before, 2015, fentanyl, an opioid, killed 705 Just in the first half of 2016, almost the exact same number, 704, died. We have a problem in the State of Florida, and there are a lot of other States that have the same.  Last month I went to a research institute down in Palm Beach They are using NIH grant money to research new nonaddictive opioid drugs. If they can come up with this, that is certainly all for the better to help people with pain and so that they are not being given an addictive drug. But we are not there yet, and we are using NIH money that is going into that research.  Last month I sent a letter to the Republican leadership pushing for more funding for the opioid fight and for the National Institutes of Health, or  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States Senate,                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: As negotiations      over the latest stopgap government funding measure continue,      we urge you to focus on securing substantial funding in the      appropriations legislation currently being negotiated for two      of our most essential national priorities: fighting the      opioid epidemic and investing in our nation's biomedical      research programs.       Every day, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose, and      despite the tireless work of many in our communities, this      public health epidemic is only getting worse. Currently, only      10 percent of individuals who need specialty treatment for      substance use disorder actually get it--not because we don't      know how to help, but in large part because there aren't      enough funds to provide these services. We need substantial      additional resources to fight this epidemic and fund      prevention, treatment, and recovery activities.       It is also essential that we increase our investment in the      National Institutes of Health (NIH), our nation's premier      research institution. NIH funding supports innovative,      cutting-edge research that plays a critical role in the      development of lifesaving cures for diseases. Our ability to      fight Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, heart disease,      and many other diseases depends on our willingness to invest      in science. While investments in the NIH have consistently      produced tremendous value, funding for the NIH has failed to      keep pace with inflation over the last several decades.       It is essential to provide new funding to fight the opioid      epidemic and support biomedical research at the This new      funding should not fill in for cuts made elsewhere to opioid      and NIH funding. It is also essential that opioid funding be      distributed to the communities that need it must and that      have been hardest hit by this terrible public health      epidemic.       While past Congresses have made promises about providing      states with additional funding to address the ongoing opioid      crisis, appropriations legislation like the pending budget      deal is where the bill comes due. Americans are counting on      Congress to live up to its commitments by supporting funding      for the priorities that matter most in their lives. Funding      to fight the opioid epidemic and support research into      lifesaving cures through the NIH rank at the top of this      list, and we urge you to include substantial additional      funding for these areas in the appropriations legislation now      being negotiated.

7387,topic-id,270,"So what we need to do is to take a comprehensive approach to helping our State and local governments respond to this opioid epidemic.  I was very happy to be an early part of putting together and sponsoring a bill called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 and of the funding included in the 21st Century Cures Act to start putting more resources into our States right away for this opioid epidemic. Those laws have resulted in Florida's receiving more than $27 million to help our State respond to the opioid crisis. Yet a lot more action is needed, as you can see by just the first half of last year alone, with 704 people dying from opioid overdoses.  Last week, in Florida a local paper reported about how the opioid epidemic is affecting our Nation's children. In 2015 alone, 167 babies were born in opioid dependency in just one city--Jacksonville--contributing to Duval County's being tapped as having the second highest number of babies born addicted to opioids in the Isn't that sad that children come into this world and they are already addicted?

7435,topic-id,773,"Mr.President, I want to talk about a subject that is near and dear to the Presiding Officer's heart, as well as to this Senator, because we both have had the privilege of serving on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation  Congress finds itself facing a year of deadlines, and the two most talked about are the debt ceiling and continued funding for the government. But if that were not enough, a very important deadline is looming that affects the safety of the traveling public. By the end of September, Congress must reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration or risk the shutdown of the agency's core safety mission.  This Senator has the privilege of being the ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, and I have the privilege of working with the chairman, Senator Thune, on a comprehensive and long-term FAA reauthorization bill. Unfortunately, what prevented the long-term bill from passing Congress last year is threatening to do the same again this year.  This morning, the White House formally announced its intention to privatize the air traffic control function of the FAA, a move the White House claims will be self-sustaining. This so-called plan for ATC privatization includes an entity that would be run in large part by--you guessed it--the major airlines, and that entity would receive, free of charge, government-owned FAA assets, and that entity would collect user fees to finance its operations.  Well, this is how many of us interpret this proposal: Let's hand over to the airlines all the people and the equipment essential to the safe operation of our Nation's air traffic control[[Page S3238]]system and trust them--the airlines--to manage our skies and the increasing air traffic. On top of that, here on the other side, they say: Well, let's finance the airlines' control of our skies through user fees paid for by the general aviation community.  We know that several airlines in the past year have had to cancel thousands of flights and strand passengers at airports for hours because they couldn't effectively manage their IT systems. How can we trust airlines to govern an entity that manages our skies when they can't even manage their own basic IT systems?  The FAA, our government's Federal Aviation Administration, safely and effectively manages the largest and most complex airspace in the world. Supporters of air traffic control privatization can cite other countries all they want that have privatized, but none of those privatized systems hold a candle to the complicated and densely populated air traffic system the FAA has accomplished.  Rather than helping the FAA continue its progress toward modernizing our air traffic control system through NextGen--that is being implemented as we speak, and in 3 years, the process of handing off most of the air traffic to satellites instead of ground-based radar--that is in just 3 years. On the other hand, the transition to a privatized air traffic control entity is only going to disrupt and delay the FAA's modernization efforts.  One has to ask, if it isn't broken, what exactly is the administration trying to fix?  We actually have real issues that need to be addressed in this FAA bill, such as continuing to safely integrate drones into our Nation's airspace, reforming the process for aircraft certification, and, very importantly, helping the FAA hire more air traffic controllers. We need to work to ensure that consumers, the flying public, have real protections in place that protect them when things go wrong. I wish the administration would focus on those issues, which received nearly unanimous support in the Senate last year, rather than try to up-end the world's safest air traffic control system.  Let's not get sidetracked by proposals that have neither bipartisan consensus in Congress nor agreement among aviation stakeholders. Last year we came very close to enacting a bipartisan and comprehensive FAA bill. It passed the Senate 95 to 3, although it didn't have air traffic control privatization. I know we can do it again, and I look forward to working with Senator Thune and the members of the committee, who will have the first crack at this when we bring up the FAA bill. Hopefully we can go with a consensus bill that will give us an authorization for the FAA for many years--5 to 7 years into the future--so that we can have the certainty of the authorization with which to continue to build a safe airline and air safety record and implement the next generation of air traffic control.

7588,topic-id,2433,"Mr.President, last week, I spoke with a very brave mother. She had endured what not one of us ever wants to have to endure while she watched her child go through cancer, over and over and over again. That mother is Elaine Geller from my State of I want to show you her daughter. This is her daughter She was working as a kindergarten teacher when she was diagnosed with leukemia in 2013 at the age of 26. At the time Megan was admitted to the hospital, her blood count was four. She had pneumonia, and she had water on her heart.  She ultimately checked into one of the very good cancer centers at the University of Miami, and she stayed there for 7 months. She went through the regimen of chemo. She spent months in the hospital, receiving multiple rounds of chemo, biopsies, and various other treatments. Eventually, Megan's doctor told her she had to have a transplant, which required a $150,000 upfront payment. I think you see where I am going with this story. Very few families would be able to afford a 150-grand payment, especially a single mother.  I heard this story last week from Megan's mother. She said that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, she didn't have to write a check for the transplant. In fact, she didn't have that money. Because that transplant was provided for under the Affordable Care Act coverage, she knew that was one worry that could be taken off of her mind. She had enough to worry about as a mother, what she should be doing in such a situation, and of course she wanted to give all of her attention to her daughter.  The cancer went into remission after the transplant; however, after leaving the hospital, 63 days later, the cancer came back. This time, they went to MD Anderson Cancer Center in I asked the mom why she wanted to do that. She said: ``When your child is dying, there's nothing that you won't do.'' I think all of us as parents can identify with that, but we are so very fortunate that we haven't had to go through it.  Maybe, as we get ready to vote on this healthcare bill, on the Republican alternative--which, by the way, just came out of CBO today--the Congressional Budget Office--and they said that if the Senate bill were enacted, 22 million people would lose health insurance coverage. Remember, that is not too much different from what CBO said when the House bill was passed a couple of months ago, the bill to which there has been such a negative reaction. CBO said that 23 million people in this country would lose their coverage as a result of the House bill. We just got the score from CBO minutes ago. Twenty-two million people. Is that the direction we want to be going in?  Megan is still going through treatment, and the cancer was only in remission for 32 days before it came back again. Megan received multiple blood transfusions. Remember, this is a single mom trying to keep her daughter, a schoolteacher in her twenties, alive. This time, all of the blood transfusions started to take another toll on She became so weak. When trying to walk, she faltered, she fell, she hit her head, and at age 28, she passed away.  Let's get to the bottom line of this discussion, other than that our hearts go out to all the Megans all across The bottom line is, that whole treatment over 2 years cost $8 million. There was not a cap on the total amount of money that could be paid under the existing law, the Affordable Care An insurance company cannot put a cap on the amount of your medical bills that can be reimbursed. Suppose before the ACA that cap was $50,000. This single mom could not even have come up with money for the initial transplant, which looked as though it worked and did work for several months. In fact, $8 million over time--2 years--how in the world could any one of us afford that?  A lot of people say: Well, the ACA isn't doing it. Well, why don't we all get together in a bipartisan way and fix it? And one of the fixes would be, because certain healthcare problems, like Megan's, cause the insurance company to pay out a lot of money--do you know what we can do about it? We can create a reinsurance fund, which is a bill that I had filed, and it is to reinsure against that catastrophic healthcare problem like Megan's of $8 million, to reinsure the insurance company. Do you know what that would do in the State of Florida, if we passed this as a fix to the ACA? It would lower the premiums in the ACA in Florida 13 percent. That is reinsurance.  It is not unlike what we have done for hurricanes. A catastrophic hurricane could cost so much more than the insurance company has assets for, and therefore they buy insurance from a company like Lloyd's of London or other reinsurance companies. They buy insurance in case of a catastrophe--the insurance company does that. If an insurance company did not have to pay out this $8 million because it had insured against that kind of catastrophic loss, everybody else's premiums are going to come down. Otherwise, they have to make premiums actuarially sound, and they have to raise them in order to take care of the cases that are prohibitively expensive.  All of this sounds down in the weeds, but the bottom line is this: If we want to fix the ACA, we can fix it, but we can't do it one party against the other. We have to have the will to come together in a bipartisan agreement to fix it.  Of course, if the mom of this girl had been faced with this without insurance coverage, she would be bankrupt. She wouldn't have been able to even afford the first transplant, much less the 2 years of extra life her daughter had while fighting for her life. Anybody who goes through something like Elaine and her daughter Megan did knows that every second counts.  That is what this healthcare debate is about--giving people peace of mind, giving them that financial security, that certainty, putting people's health ahead of other things, such as company profits. You can do it all and solve everybody's problem, including the insurance company's, which obviously is in business to make a profit. You can do it.  Elaine said her daughter would be proud to know that we are telling that story today. It matters. It matters to her, albeit deceased. It certainly matters to her mom. It matters to their It matters to a lot of other people.  The ACA, the existing law--the one there was such a fractious fight over 5 to 7 years ago--is working. Here is a good example. Then we see that the aim of our friends on that side of the aisle is--they want to repeal it. They don't want anything that has the taint of ObamaCare, and so they concoct something in the You see what kind of greeting that has gotten in the country. I think it was in the upper teens--a poll that showed it was viewed favorably. In other words, it is viewed very unfavorably.  In order for the Senate majority leader to come up with something that he can repeal ObamaCare with, in the dead of night, in secret--even the Republican Senators didn't know what it[[Page S3749]]was until they hatched it in the public last This bill is just as bad as the House bill.  They will claim, in trying to stand up this bill--by the way, it is going to wither, the more it is examined in the glare of the spotlight. They claim that it maintains the ACA's protections for those with preexisting conditions. Can anybody really say that with a straight face? It leaves it up to the  Before I came to Washington and the Senate service, I was the elected insurance commissioner, State treasurer of It was my job to regulate the insurance companies--all kinds of insurance companies, including health insurance companies. I can tell you that I have seen some insurance companies use asthma as a preexisting condition, and therefore that was the reason they would not allow the person who needed insurance to be covered. They said: If you have a preexisting condition, we are not going to insure you. I have even seen insurance companies use as an excuse a rash as a preexisting condition, and that means they are not going to insure you. Under the existing law, the ACA, they can't do that. You are going to have the security of knowing you are going to have coverage.  Do you know something else you are going to have the security of knowing? You are not going to deal with some of those insurance companies that I regulated. Of your premium dollar for health insurance, they would spend 40 percent of that dollar not on your healthcare, but they would take 40 cents of that premium dollar that you paid and that was going to executive salaries. It was going to administrative expenses. It was going to plush trips. Don't tell me that is not a true story. I saw it over and over in the 1990s as the elected insurance commissioner of  You know what the existing law says? It says that of every premium dollar you pay, 80 cents of that premium dollar has to go into healthcare. It can't be commissions. It can't be executive salaries. It can't be the executive jets for the corporate executives. Eighty cents of that premium dollar has to go into healthcare so you get what you pay for in that premium dollar. At some point there is going to be an attempt to undo that. If you start leaving things up to the States, watch out.  When Megan was in the ICU, she had a respiratory failure that cost thousands of dollars more, and thanks to the ACA, her insurance carrier covered it. But under the Republican bill that has been now released, States could let their insurance companies pocket more of those premium dollars to pay for those things I just shared, which I had seen back in the decade of the 1990s as the insurance commissioner. Well, we shouldn't be padding their pockets. The premium dollar for health insurance ought to go to healthcare.  The Senate bill cuts billions in We haven't even talked about that. Who gets Medicaid? Millions of people in this country do. It is not only the poor. It is not only the disabled. It is 65 to 70 percent of all seniors in nursing homes who are on Medicaid, and it is also some children's programs. Let me just give you one example. I went to the neonatal unit at Shands Hospital in Jacksonville, a hospital affiliated with the University of Florida, but in The doctors and nurses were showing me how miracles occur for premature babies; they keep them alive.  Then what they wanted to show me was--with the opioid epidemic, which has hit my State just like all the other States, they wanted me to see and understand that when a pregnant mom is addicted to opioids, she passes that on in her womb to her unborn child. When born, that baby is opioid-dependent. The doctors showed me the characteristics--that high, shrill cry, the constant scratching, the awkward movements. Do you know what they use to wean those little babies off opioids over the course of a month? They use doses of morphine.  Do you want to devastate Medicaid? Do you want to take over $800 billion over 10 years out of Medicaid? What about those single moms? The only healthcare they get is And what about those babies I just described, who are also on Medicaid? If you start capping the amount of money that goes to the States on a Federal-State program for healthcare--Medicaid--you are going to throw a lot of people off any kind of healthcare, including senior citizens in nursing homes.  A Medicaid block grant, or a cap, would end the healthcare guarantee for millions of children, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and seniors on long-term care. There are 37 million children in this country who rely on Medicaid for care. The seniors, the poor, the disabled, the children--they are all vulnerable to the cuts that would occur.  If that is not enough to vote against this bill that is coming to the floor this week, the Senate bill actually imposes an age tax for older Americans, allowing insurance companies to charge older Americans up to five times more for coverage than a young person. You say: Well, older people have more illnesses and ailments; older people ought to cost more. If that is your argument, well, that is true.  The age rating in the existing law, the ACA, is three to one. This changes it to five to one, and five to one means one thing: higher premiums for senior citizens--I am talking about all insurance policies--until they reach that magic age of 65 and can be on Do you want an age tax on older Americans as a result of this bill? I don't think so. But that is what is in there.  Fixing our Nation's healthcare system shouldn't be a partisan issue. That is why I have joined--bipartisan--with colleagues to introduce a bill that I described a moment ago, which would lower healthcare premiums by 13 percent. That bill would stabilize the ACA's insurance marketplace through the creation of a permanent reinsurance fund. I have seen the policies work, as I described, with catastrophic hurricane insurance. There is nothing magic about my idea. It is just an obvious fix to the existing law, and ideas like that can bubble forth in a bipartisan way to make the existing law that we have sustainable.  What we ought to be doing is trying to look for ways to help people like that single mom Elaine and her daughter We should be working together to make the ACA work better. We shouldn't be plotting behind closed doors in the dead of night with a secret document--a secret document that we now know will make it worse.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to both this rule and the underlying bill. Instead of coming up with new thoughts or new ideas, here we have another recycled and careless bill that has been through this body before that takes away protections for our sick, for our children, for pregnant women, and for the elderly. It is the wrong way to go for our country.  This bill is called the Ozone Standards Implementation Act, but it is actually a political stunt for a special interest, in this case the oil and gas industry. It will hurt our air, our environment, and, frankly, have a negative impact on the health of It will increase healthcare costs at a time when healthcare costs are already too high.  We see that, the way the House Republicans are trying to jam through the Affordable Care Act repeal, which I remind my friends passed here in the It is only in the Senate where they are finally realizing the error of their ways.  In Colorado, 500,000 people have benefited from the Affordable Care Act, and the number of people without insurance has been cut in half from 6.7 percent to 2.5 percent. Of course, it is not perfect, and I hope that now is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together, rather than Republicans seeking to go at it alone with a plan that provides less people with healthcare rather than more.  The Affordable Care Act made sure that no one can be denied coverage for a preexisting condition. That benefited over 750,000 people in Colorado, including people with cancer and asthma, the rates of which would both increase if this bill that we are discussing under this rule were to become law. Yes, that is right. More people would suffer from asthma and more people would suffer from cancer if this bill were to pass.  This reckless Republican healthcare bill even eliminated the Prevention and Public Health Fund at the end of fiscal year 2017, slashing funding for the Centers for Disease Control by 12 percent, singling out certain providers, like Planned Parenthood, from even participating in the Medicaid program; preventing patients from receiving preventative care services, like cancer screenings and STD testing and contraceptive care from their provider of choice, often, in many cases, the only provider in town.  So it is no surprise that we have yet another bill that would increase healthcare costs before us, lead to more people having to pay more for what they already have for healthcare.

It is why over 700 healthcare professionals signed a letter in opposition to H.806 dated July 17, 2017, which I include in the                                                    July 17, 2017.       Dear Member of Congress: We, the undersigned physicians,      nurses, environmental health professionals and other health      professionals, urge you to protect our patients' and      communities' health from dangerous air pollution. Please      oppose any legislation or administrative actions that would      block, weaken or delay work to implement and enforce strong      safeguards for healthy air.       Our patients, families, and neighbors need healthy air to      breathe, particularly those who are at greater risk of      getting sick or dying prematurely due to air pollution,      including children, older adults, and people with asthma,      COPD, and heart disease.       Thanks to the Clean Air Act, the United States has made      enormous progress in cleaning up ozone and particle      pollution. The American Lung Association's 2017 ``State of      the Air'' report found that cities across the U.have made      continued improvement in reducing these pollutants, with many      reaching their lowest ozone levels yet. However, 125 million      people still live in areas where they are exposed to      unhealthy levels of air pollution.       Clean Air Act protections must continue to be implemented      and enforced to ensure that all Americans have healthy air to      breathe. In addition, evidence shows that climate change will      make it harder to clean up ozone and particle pollution. The      nation must reduce the carbon, methane, and other pollutants      that lead to warmer temperatures, and work to protect our      communities against the many health impacts of climate      change.       As health and medical professionals, we call upon you to      protect the health of our patients and our communities by      opposing measures that would block, weaken, or delay      protections under the Clean Air Act, or other protections      that reduce harmful air pollution and protect public health      from the impacts of climate change. Our communities are      counting on you.

This bill will increase healthcare costs. That is the economic side. The human side is it will lead to suffering and even death. That is why it is important to stop this bill now by stopping this rule from passing.  Not only will this bill harm millions of Americans, but, in addition, they have offered it under a way to limit amendments and ideas that Republicans and Democrats had offered. This rule does allow several amendments, one of which is mine, and we will discuss that later, but it doesn't allow for amendments from Democrats and They only made in order 6 of the 11 amendments, including germane amendments that were submitted to be debated.  For instance, why wasn't Mr.Cooper's amendment, which clarified that State implementation plans can incorporate local land use policies, allowed any debate on the floor?  All Members with amendments should be given the opportunity to bring them to the full House and get a fair up-or-down vote on the merits of their amendment. That is how we craft better legislation, and that is how we fix bills, Mr. I assure you, this bill needs to be fixed, because all it does is it repackages a bunch of bills that make our air dirtier and our health worse and healthcare more costly, all bills that we have seen here over the last several years, bringing them all together in sort of a Frankenstein bill where you assemble all these horrible body parts from different bills, each of which is bad, creating a huge monster that will kill people and increase healthcare costs for every  Instead of trying to weaken the Clean Air Act, putting Americans' health at risk, which is what this bill does, we should be talking about the way to close loopholes that exist in our Clean Air Act; to make our air cleaner, not dirtier; reduce asthma and cancer, not increase asthma and cancer.  That is why I am glad that my amendment was made in order. My amendment is based off of the BREATHE Act, which I introduced with several of my colleagues earlier this year. It would close the oil and gas industry's loophole to the Clean Air Act's aggregation requirement. We will be discussing that in more detail later today, but, very simply, when you have small sites for oil and gas extraction, they don't have to aggregate their pollution, even though in the aggregate, when you have 20,000 wells in a county, cumulatively it can release a large amount of air pollutants, even more than a larger power plant. This amendment would simply hold all sources of emission to the same standard for the impact on the Nation's air quality. I hope that my amendment will be adopted, it is common sense, so we can improve the Clean Air Act rather than eviscerate it.  This bill takes apart a law that is one of the most successful in the history of our country in protecting our most vulnerable and strengthening our economy. A stronger economy means less sick days from work, it means less hospital visits, it means less premature deaths. This bill will increase all of those, sick days, hospital visits, and premature deaths, because it takes away protections for our clean air.  I am proud to say that between 1980 and 2014, emissions of six air pollutants controlled by the Clean Air Act have dropped 63 percent. We should be proud of that. While those six toxic pollutants dropped 63 percent, our gross domestic product increased 147 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 97 percent, energy consumption increased 26 percent, our population grew by 41 percent. That shows over the last several decades how we can have clean air, a healthy population, and a strong economy--not one at the expense of another.  These emission standards have already generated dramatic public health benefits. A recent peer-reviewed study estimates that the Clean Air Act will save more than 230,000 lives, prevent millions of cases of respiratory problems in 2020 alone. It also enhances our national productivity by preventing 17 million lost workdays. These public health benefits translate into $2 trillion in monetized benefits to the economy.  If this bill were to be scored by that metric, this bill would cost $2 trillion by eviscerating the protections we have in the Clean Air Act, but instead of maintaining and strengthening these important life-saving laws, instead, they are delaying the implementation of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards set by scientists, an update that is long overdue and has economic benefits of $4.5 billion annually in 2025 alone. This bill would suspend that, which are particularly important for the pregnant, for the elderly, for those who suffer from asthma.  25 million Americans suffer from asthma, 7 million of whom are children. For many, the condition lasts a lifetime and sometimes can be life-threatening. In 2014, about 4,000 people died due to an asthma attack. The connection between air quality and asthma is extremely well documented and incontrovertible, and it shouldn't be understated.  Clean air is an integral part of quality of life, and we shouldn't be tearing down protections that simply allow kids or the elderly to go outside, kids to play outside on a playground in a neighborhood, without worrying about respiratory problems or asthma.  Another problematic provision of this Frankenstein bill is that it changes the criteria for establishing a NAAQS from one that is based solely on protecting public health to one that includes consideration of technology.                              {time}  1245  Now, that is the core of the Clean Air Act and necessary to protect public health. The NAAQS determine what level of air pollution is ``safe'' to breath. That is just a matter of fact. What is safe is safe, what is not safe is unsafe. Scientists need to determine that. This change would allow polluters to override scientists and is analogous to a doctor making a diagnosis based on how much a test cost.  I don't want my doctor telling me I don't have condition X or Y because I might have a high cost to treat. I don't think anybody else does, either. We demand, and we deserve, safe air. We should be safe breathing the air in our country, period.  The problems go on and on with this bill. I will stop there for now because the Republicans have wasted enough time even bringing this Frankenstein bill to the floor that cobbles together a number of other terrible bills that they have already passed.  Let's move forward with making our air cleaner, not dirtier; with reducing cancer and asthma, not increasing them; and with reducing healthcare costs, not increasing them. This bill is the wrong direction.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgH5927-3.txt,1910,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,18.0,May

7568,topic-id,672,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.DeFazio), the distinguished ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his initiative here to actually create some jobs.  Mr.Speaker, the premise of the legislation before us today is that if we allow more pollution--particularly ozone pollution, which is very detrimental to the health of asthmatics; I mean, bad for the health of everyday Americans, but particularly to the 25 million asthmatics, seniors, and others--the premise is that by polluting the air more with ozone, we will create jobs.  Now, actually, I have got to agree with the Republicans on this. They will create more jobs by polluting the air. Pulmonary specialists will be very busy. And then, oh, the inhaler manufacturers. There has been some great press about the inhaler manufacturers in the last year, where they are quadrupling and sextupling the price to price gouge people. Well, they are going to have a heyday. In fact, I believe they have endorsed this legislation.  And then we are going to have a whole new group of people working on the streets in It is going to be a whole new entrepreneurial class. There are actually people in Beijing doing this now. The air is so polluted in Beijing that on many days they say: Don't go outside. But, I mean, you have to go outside sometimes, you have to go to the grocery store, or you have to go to work. They now have a very large industry of street vendors who sell oxygen; so, as you are about to collapse on the street in Beijing, someone will sell you a good whiff of oxygen for whatever they charge for it. We are going to bring that industry to So this bill does have phenomenal potential to create a whole new bunch of jobs with oxygen street vendors and then, of course, the pulmonary specialists, the inhaler manufacturers, and others.  The President actually, as a candidate, said that he would triple the amount of money that would be spent on clean water State revolving funds; he would triple it. Now, interestingly enough, the Congressional Budget Office came out with an analysis yesterday of the President's proposed budgets over the next 10 years, which theoretically is going to increase investment and infrastructure. And they said: Actually, not so much. Actually, in fact, his cuts basically would lead to a reduction in investment in clean water and a reduction in investment in ground transportation.  So, instead of tripling the investment and putting many people to work, the President, actually, is going to cut investment in clean water in his proposed budget. Now, I know he didn't write the budget. You know, he has got this rightwing guy running the CBO--Mulvaney, founder of the Freedom But Trump is somewhat responsible for a budget that has his name on it, even if he didn't write it, even if he didn't know what was in it, and even if he doesn't know that it contradicts promises he made as a candidate, which he is not going to deliver as  But, that said, I want to help the President out here. So, this bill simply delivers on the President's promise to triple the amount of investment to $25 billion.  Now, do we need it? Heck, yeah, we need it. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2017 infrastructure report card, America's wastewater treatment systems got a grade of D-plus--not too good. And there is a backlog of more than $40 billion in clean water infrastructure.  The Federal Government needs to become an honest partner with our cities, counties, and others, who have needs to invest in their wastewater systems. We did it before when we cleaned up our rivers back in the sixties, seventies, and eighties with the Clean Air Act, and we need to do it again. We need the Federal partnership. We need this investment.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgH5927-3.txt,1910,WATER SUPPLY PERMITTING COORDINATION ACT,2017.0,18.0,June

But it would be an appropriate bill to include, as Mr.DeFazio pointed out, ironically, there are some jobs that this bill will create: people selling oxygen on the street, pulmonologists, and, yes, asthma inhalers because more people will suffer from asthma, and kids with asthma won't be able to spend as much quality time outside if this bill were to become law.  Instead of continuing this kind of work that raises healthcare costs, and increases asthma and cancer, we should be focusing on issues that create jobs we want.

7611,topic-id,3147,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for leading us in this Special Order to discuss President Trump's tax proposal, which we received this morning--or last night. The public discussion on taxes has been going on for several weeks now in anticipation of the release of the President's proposal.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets, from the East to the West, the North to the South, all over Hundreds of thousands of people marched with a very simple demand to President Trump, which is that he follow the precedent and the policy that was pursued by the last nine Presidents, going back to Richard Nixon, for a half century of releasing his tax returns, something that President Trump promised to do as a President, saying he would do it after his audit was completed, and then he got into office and then just changed his mind and said this would be, I guess, another one of the broken promises that he would deliver to the American people.  So why is this a big deal? Why is it important that we get to see the President's taxes?  Well, America was conceived in popular democratic revolution against royalty, against monarchy, against aristocracy. We, as a people, overthrew a king who imposed tea taxes on small businesses, on the little people, but exempted his tycoon buddies in the East India Corporation, a king who constantly sweated the commoners with high taxes to pay for his lavish expenses and traveling jaunts and vacations around the world with the royal family and the royal court, a king who never paid any taxes and never disclosed his own entanglements with foreign governments. We rebelled against that kind of government.  We demand accountability. We demand transparency here.  Mr.President, please read the We have no kings here. We have no slaves here. We have no czars here. We have no serfs here. We have equal citizens, free citizens with equal rights.  We allow no titles of nobility here, which is a point you might mention to your Secretary of State, who still carries that disgraceful title conferred upon him by Vladimir Putin, the Russian Order of  In America, no one is above the law and all of us are subject to it. As Tom[[Page H2934]]Paine put it, in the monarchies, the king is law; but in the democracies, the law is king.  The President of the United States owes an undivided loyalty to the people, the laws, and the Constitution of the United States, not the oligarchs of Russia, not the businessmen of Azerbaijan, not the hotel owners of the world, not the Bank of China, not the dictators and kleptocrats and tyrants of the The President owes undivided loyalty to the people of the United  So we ask the question: Where are your taxes?  How can we determine whether the President has conflicts of interest or is collecting illegal emoluments from foreign governments if he won't show us the names of the people and the corporations that he is in active partnership with all over the world? We simply can't do it.  How can we dream of undertaking to completely reform and revise the tax policy of America unless we see the President's tax returns in order to determine whether or not he is going to benefit from the policies that he is now advancing? We can't do it.  Forgive me, but is there anyone left in America who thinks that this President would propose a tax reform that would hurt his own individual, personal, or business interests? If you believe that, you are too innocent to be let out of the house by yourself at this point in the Trump administration.  So then we arrive at work and we receive this. This single piece of paper is the Donald Trump tax plan. It is not a bill. It is not a study. It is not a plan. There are not even complete sentences in it. There are sentence fragments in it. It is not even a press release.  But it has got a few key ideas, apparently, that he is asking the Republicans in Congress to lead us to pass by tomorrow in order to make the 100-day deadline which the President has disdained and castigated. But he wants to make the 100-day deadline because he understands now that there is some kind of milestone that he wants to suddenly be able to achieve.  Well, what is in here?  Well, first, the Treasury Secretary, Mr.Mnuchin, set out a test for tax reform in which he said there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class. Well, this plan totally defies that promise. It betrays that promise. It provides a huge tax cut for the wealthy, while middle class families receive very little benefit, at the same time that social programs are being sliced and diced all over the Federal  We also know that the tax plan will provide a huge benefit to Donald Trump himself. Now, we know this only because one of his tax returns leaked out, suspiciously, and some think, from the White House, the 2005 plan, which appeared on TV--nothing before that, nothing after.  But even taking this 1 year which, presumably, is most in the President's favor, President Trump would save over $28 million in taxes under the 1-page plan that got passed around Congress today. Most of that money comes through the reduction of the pass-through business income tax rate, reducing it from the 30 percent range to 15 percent.  But then it also proposes abolishing, and I know it because it says right here, bullet 3 under bullet 5, repeal the alternative minimum tax. He wants to repeal the alternative minimum tax.  Now, what is this AMT? AMT does not stand for ``all money to Trump.'' AMT stands for the alternative minimum tax. And what it means is, if you are superwealthy and you have got an army of lawyers on your side and you can structure your corporate bankruptcies and your personal business losses--of which President Trump has many--in such a way as to make it possible for you not to pay any taxes for a long time, the alternative minimum tax says, well, there is something that everybody has got to pay. There is an alternative minimum tax. We are not going to let anybody's clever lawyering bring them below a certain rate.  On that rule, we know that Mr.Trump, in that 1 year we know about, 2005--you probably saw it on Rachel In that 1 year, he paid millions of dollars only because of the existence of the alternative minimum tax. In other words, all of his deductions and corporate bankruptcies and clever lawyers' tricks that got him down to zero, presumably, in all these other years that he won't show us, none of them could stop him from having to pay something, because the alternative minimum tax says let's not press a good joke too far. We understand you are very wealthy. We understand that there are loopholes that have been injected to the law, but we are not going to let anybody fall below a certain minimum threshold.  You could think of it kind of like equivalent to the minimum wage for working people. The alternative minimum tax is kind of the minimum wage that the wealthiest people in the country pay us, as opposed to escaping all of their taxes.  Well, Donald Trump now wants to abolish the alternative minimum tax. He just wants to get rid of it. That doesn't sound like a very good idea. It is going to dig a superbig hole for us and dig the deficit much further.  Let's talk about the deficit. Well, I thought--look, I love the fact that we have got two parties. We should have more parties. It is great that we have got a left and a right. A bird can only fly if it has got a left wing and a right wing, all right?                              {time}  1700  But I thought that the heart of Republican Party orthodoxy is you don't blow up the deficit with outrageous tax proposals or spending proposals. They call us tax-and-spend liberals. They are cut-the-taxes-and-spend conservatives. I don't even know what makes them conservative anymore. I call myself a liberal because the heart of the word ``liberal'' is liberty. I call myself a progressive because the heart of the word ``progressive'' is progress. And if we are not making progress, then what are we doing in government?  But after seeing this plan, I realize those of us on our side of the aisle can call ourselves conservatives, too, because we want to conserve the land, the air, the water, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, political democracy, our alliances with foreign governments and foreign democracies, Social Security, health care for the people, and we want to preserve as much of a balanced budget as we can get to. On the other side of the aisle, they are calling themselves conservatives, and I don't know why because if they back this proposal, then they are blowing a multitrillion-dollar hole in the deficit.  This plan is not remotely revenue neutral. The earliest estimates are that it will blow a 6 or $7 trillion hole in the deficit. That, of course, is a way to put unsustainable pressure on the other commitments we have made as a Congress, as a people, Social Security commitments to the people, and Medicare commitments to the people for health care. We cannot afford this irresponsible and reckless tax plan that has been sent to Congress by the It is a return to discredited, failed, supply-side economics. All they can say is they will blow a $7 trillion hole in the deficit, but they are going to make so much money back through all the economic activity that we will be able to make money on that. If you believe that, then you will believe Mr.Trump's promise that he is going to release his tax returns next year or the year after that.  Look, we do need tax reform in America because this system is regressive, and this system is opaquely complex. We need some real reform. But this is not remotely the answer, this one-page mimeographed sheet of some really bad ideas.  Let me just say one other thing that seems to have snuck in there: repeal the estate tax. They want to repeal the estate tax. This might be the greatest betrayal of all--not because President Trump has ever supported it, but because the Founders of America were determined to have an estate tax. I am talking about Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine, and Ben The original Americans wanted this to be a country of economic opportunity and freedom for people. But they thought the idea of inherited wealth passed down from generation to generation was a major threat to the idea of political equality and democracy for all. They saw that it would be unsustainable if you had huge fortunes--nowhere near as huge as they are today--but huge fortunes being[[Page H2935]]passed down from generation to generation. That would lead us to an aristocracy; that would lead us to a monarchy; and that would lead us to Presidents of the United States who would think that they don't have to show you their income taxes, Presidents of the United States who think it is okay to spend public money on fancy vacations for their family and Secret Service all over the country and the world and having a winter or a summer escape at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, and so on. Go back, please, I beseech the citizens of America, read Thomas Jefferson about inherited wealth.  Now, our laws today don't even have the estate tax or the inheritance tax starting until millions of dollars. The vast majority of Americans are not even affected by it. It applies right now only to the smallest sliver of the wealthiest I think--and forgive me for not having the facts in front of me--again, we are just getting this all right now, but I think we are now somewhere around $4.5 million. So if you die with $4.5 million, your estate is not going to be taxed. That is enough to send the kids and the grandkids to college. It is enough for people to inherit a house or two houses. That is not bad. But the fact that we would tax beyond that means that we are not going to get a society that is based on inherited wealth and deep, profound political and economic inequality which were totally anathema to the Founders of the country, and also, by the way, totally antithetical to the vision of Adam Smith who is the big hero to my conservative friends on the other side of the aisle.  Adam Smith was someone who said: You don't want to have inherited wealth in a society like that. That is dangerous. It will promote idleness and irresponsibility among the people who inherit hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. It will increase political inequalities and class tension in the society, and it will lead to irresponsible behavior by the people who have that kind of wealth.  People will get the idea that they can buy a public office. In America, public office is something that you earn. It is not something that you buy; but, right now, there is a model for elective politics around the country which is you don't have to be involved in politics, you don't have to be involved in social movements, you don't have to be involved in public service, and you don't have to do anything for anybody. As long as you have got enough money, you can go in, you can buy the consultants and the pollsters, and you can go right to the head of the class, and then you can get into office.  What is so dangerous about that? Well, look around the world. What is happening? There is a whole new model of government that is popping up from Putin's Russia to Duterte's Philippines to Orban's Hungary to Le Pen's And the model is this: that people get into office, and government becomes a moneymaking operation for them and their friends, for a tiny elite. That totally contradicts the promise of Our Founders were concerned with making sure that there would be public virtue, that we would put people in office who were committed to the common good, to the public interest of everybody, not to the goal of enriching themselves or their hotel partners or people they are in business with in Russia or in Saudi Arabia or all over the world. That is not the model. In America, the government has got to be devoted to the people.  So, America, read the fine print here. This tax plan contradicts everything that we were founded on as a country. It upsets the very idea of democracy--abolishing the estate tax, abolishing the alternative minimum tax, driving all the wealth up the income and wealth ladder. That is not We have got to stand up for what American values really are. We are not We are not a kleptocracy. We are not We are not Saudi This is the United States of We need a government that is committed to the economic success of every family and of every person.  So I am urging the public to do exactly what you did with that terrible health proposal they came forward with that would have thrown 24 million Americans off health insurance in order to create hundreds of billions of dollars of tax breaks for the wealthiest Reject it. Don't accept it.  America needs to know that all of the protests and the popular participation is working. The Women's March set the whole context for discussion about what is going to happen here because we know that President Trump campaigned like William Jennings Bryan, like he was a big populist. He was going to be on the side of the working people. But he got in, and the very people he denounced, like Goldman Sachs, have come to run his government.

7398,topic-id,982,"Madam President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of Heather Wilson to be Secretary of the Air  The Secretary of the Air Force is an important and influential position within our national security structure. As the head of the military Department, the Secretary of the Air Force oversees recruiting, organizing, training, and equipping of the force. The next Air Force Secretary will oversee the Defense Department's most complex and costly acquisition programs in history. The Secretary will also lead 495,000 Active-Duty, Guard, and Reserve members through the challenges of rebuilding long-term sustainable readiness, while contending with ongoing operational demands around the globe.  Wilson has the knowledge and expertise to serve in that role. She is a graduate of the U.Air Force Academy and a Rhodes scholar. She served in the House of Representatives and on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Currently, Wilson is president of the South Dakota School of Mines and  Without question, Wilson has notable credentials, but I have significant concerns about certain of her past actions. First, Heather Wilson & Company, LLC, founded by Wilson following her tenure in Congress, had contracts with four National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, laboratories--Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Nevada National Security From January 2009 through part of 2011, Wilson's company received $464,000 in payments from these laboratories for consulting services.  However, due to claims of contracting irregularities involving the company, the Department of Energy inspector general conducted two investigations into this matter. As a result, the contractors that operated the laboratories on behalf of the government paid back at least $442,877 to the Department of Energy with respect to payments made to Wilson's company. The rationale for the repayments was the absence of any appreciable evidence of work product. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin, which operated Sandia National Laboratories, agreed to an overall settlement of $4.7 million for their management failures.  Let me be clear. Wilson was not found culpable of wrongdoing. Nevertheless, the allegations that were levied are serious and directly involved her company. As such, during her confirmation hearing, I asked Wilson about these contracts and the allegations of impropriety. Unfortunately, I did not receive a satisfactory response. Wilson deflected any suggestions that she bore any responsibility for these contracting irregularities.  As concerning as these allegations are, there was another incident that I found even more problematic as we reviewed Wilson's qualifications to serve as Secretary of the Air In October of 2006, while serving as a Member of the House of Representatives, Wilson contacted a sitting U.attorney, David Iglesias, who was appointed by President George Bush, regarding the status of Federal corruption cases in New This action was highly unusual and contrary to guidance in effect at the time from the House Ethics In fact, the House Ethics Manual provided that a request for background information or a status report from a U.attorney ``may in effect be an indirect or subtle effort to influence the substantive outcome of the proceedings.'' The guidance provided by the manual stated that the best way to communicate any inquiry or question was in writing, in order to make it part of the proceedings.  As a former Member of the House myself, I have deep concerns about this action in terms of House ethics rules and the possibility that a Federal prosecutor may have felt pressured by Congress in an ongoing investigation.  In September of 2008, a joint report by the Department of Justice inspector general and the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigated the removal of nine U.attorneys, including Mr.Iglesias, concluded that ``the evidence we have developed so far shows that Wilson . . . in fact called Iglesias before the election, and that the substance of the call led Iglesias to believe he was being pressured to indict the courthouse case before the upcoming election.''  During her nomination hearing, Wilson testified that she called Mr.Iglesias because, in her words, ``an individual or constituent with knowledge of ongoing investigations told me that the U.Attorney was intentionally delaying corruption prosecutions, and I felt as though I had to address that allegation in some appropriate way.'' However, as I previously mentioned, contacting a U.attorney in this manner was clearly contrary to the ethics rules that govern the conduct of Members of the House of  Perhaps Wilson, though, does deserve the benefit of the doubt. Maybe her intention, when she called Mr.Iglesias, was not to pressure him. However, when I asked Wilson the name of the individual who made the allegation about Mr.Iglesias's intentionally delaying corruption prosecutions, she refused to provide the person's name. Wilson argued that she had an obligation not to reveal who it was who made a highly politicized and unusual charge against Mr. I think providing the name of the person is important because it helps us to understand the purpose of Wilson's call to Mr.It is one thing if a concerned constituent with no ties or interests in corruption cases under investigation innocuously contacted Perhaps her subsequent call to Mr.Iglesias could be excused. But because we do not have the name, we have no way to verify the motive. It remains very possible that the person who contacted Wilson wanted to pressure Mr.Iglesias to move forward with these pending corruption cases. If that is the case, it casts Wilson's call to Mr.Iglesias in a much different light. Unfortunately, without further information from Wilson, I will not be able to resolve my concerns about this incident.  The two issues I have just discussed have reluctantly led me to conclude that while Wilson has excellent academic and professional qualifications, I must vote against her nomination before the full  I yield the floor.

7587,topic-id,1301,"Mr.President, I come to the Senate floor, once again, to urge my colleagues to work in a bipartisan, transparent fashion to improve our healthcare system and help bring down costs.  Over the weekend, members of the American Medical Association--the Nation's largest organization of doctors--had a chance to finally read the proposed Republican bill and found it violates their ``do no harm'' principle. According to a letter they wrote to Leaders McConnell and Schumer, ``Medicine has long operated under the precept of Primum non nocere, or, `first do no harm.' The draft legislation violates that standard on many levels.''  That is the conclusion of the American Medical Association, and they are correct. This bill will not lower costs, and it will not improve our healthcare system. Instead, it will remove health insurance coverage for millions of Indeed, the CBO has just released their estimate that 22 million Americans will lose their health insurance coverage. It will increase costs for everyone and decimate State budgets, creating a ripple effect throughout our economy.  The bill my colleagues worked in secret to craft is, in a sense, a sham. It will not lower costs, and it will not improve our healthcare system, as they insist. Instead, it will remove health insurance coverage for millions of Americans--22 million, according to the CBO--increase costs for everyone, as I said, and decimate State budgets. In fact, their bill essentially is a huge tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans at the expense of everyone else.  If you need any further proof of the real driver of this bill, one of its biggest giveaways is a retroactive tax break on investment income for people making at least a quarter of a million dollars. Dozens of leading economists, including six Nobel laureates, have criticized this plan as, in their words, a ``giant step in the wrong direction'' that prioritizes tax breaks averaging $200,000 annually per household in the top 0.1 percent of Americans over the well-being of working families. In fact, President Trump himself will get an estimated $2 million tax break each year from the giveaways in this bill. Let's call this bill what it is: a massive giveaway to the wealthiest Meanwhile, the rest of the country--all of our constituents--will be the ones paying the price for these tax breaks for those well-off. So much for the President's claim that he would end a rigged system.  Now, how do Republicans pay for these tax breaks? For starters, they are proposing to end the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which is providing health insurance to nearly 15 million Americans, but then they go even further by effectively block-granting Medicaid, cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from the program over the next decade. These are not reforms designed to lower costs. This is a cut, pure and simple, which will sharply curtail and eliminate needed healthcare services to many across this country. In fact, the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities published data that shows a stark contrast of who gains and who loses under this bill. The 400 households in the country with the highest incomes will get tax breaks totaling $33 billion because of the Senate TrumpCare bill. As a result, over 725,000 Americans will lose Medicaid coverage in just four States to equate to that $33 billion: Alaska, Arkansas, Nevada, and West That doesn't even scratch the surface as to who will lose access to care in the remaining 46  Medicaid has played a critical role in ensuring access to care for millions of Americans, including children, seniors, and people with disabilities. In fact, across the country, and in my home State of Rhode Island, about half of all Medicaid funding is spent on nursing home care. Over 60 percent of nursing home residents access care through If you think nursing home care will be protected, you are in for a rude awakening because the math just doesn't work. It will be impossible to cut Federal funding for State Medicaid programs by hundreds of billions of dollars and not impact the most significant Medicaid expenditures, which are nursing homes.  I would also like to talk about the role Medicaid plays in emergencies like a recession or public health crisis. We know all too well how an economic downturn impacts communities. With job loss, comes loss of health insurance, pensions, and other benefits. The tax base shrinks, and State budgets suffer. Medicaid, as currently structured, is able to adapt to this. As the need increases, the program grows to cover everyone who is eligible, including those who have just lost jobs. This saves families from having to choose whether to take their kids to the doctor or put food on the table.  Under the Senate TrumpCare bill, States will be hamstrung by arbitrary caps and limits on In fact, States will be unable to expand coverage during a recession to those in need, and they will likely have to make cuts across the board, from healthcare and education to transportation infrastructure, to make up for the lost tax revenues. This is not strictly going to be an issue of healthcare policy in The cuts are so dramatic that after they have taken all they can from other healthcare programs, they will inevitably go to education funding--the biggest expense most States have--and then to transportation and then to public safety. Even then, I don't think they can keep up with these cuts.  Like most of the country, Rhode Island was hard hit by the recession. It took many years for the economy to even begin to turn around in the right direction. It seemed my colleagues are forgetting how Medicaid has been a critical safety net through tough economic times.  I am also concerned that my colleagues are not aware of the impact Medicaid has on our Nation's veterans. The uninsured rate among veterans has dropped by 40 percent since implementation of the Affordable Care Nationwide, nearly 1 in 10 veterans is covered by Medicaid, including approximately 8,000 veterans in my home State of Rhode The cuts to Medicaid that have been proposed by my Republican colleagues put the care of our veterans at risk. We have all promised to provide the best care possible to our brave men and women when they leave the service, but the Senate TrumpCare bill would do the opposite.  That is not the only way this bill would damage veterans' care. Many[[Page S3748]]veterans seek help for mental health care by going outside of the VA system. TrumpCare puts mental health and substance abuse treatment at risk by saying insurance companies no longer need to cover these services. For the over 15,000 veterans in Rhode Island who access mental and behavioral healthcare outside of the VA, they would be out of luck. For all the bipartisan work in this Chamber to increase veterans' access to these services, it would all be for naught if Senate Republicans pass their TrumpCare bill.  These are just some of the things Republicans are sacrificing in the name of tax breaks for the wealthy. It is, frankly, unconscionable. More importantly, this will not be lost on the American people. I have heard from thousands of my constituents since the beginning of this year, and if Senate Republicans press forward with this legislation, I think we will all hear from many more of these constituents for many years to come.  TrumpCare is fundamentally flawed and cannot be fixed. We would welcome the opportunity to work across the aisle on improvements to the Affordable Care Act, like those to lower costs, especially prescription drug costs, any time.  I, once again, urge my colleagues to drop their efforts and to work with us to instead make improvements to the  I yield the floor.

We all, all of us in California, have experienced what happens when you have radical environmentalist nonsense determining policy. We have just gone through one of the worst droughts in our history, yet during that drought, those wonderful California environmental planners saw to it that billions of gallons of freshwater were dumped into the ocean instead of being redirected towards producing food crops in our Central Valley area or providing water to drink or providing water so that people could afford to have water throughout our Instead, it was dumped into the ocean.

Now we need to think about what our policies will impact on average people. And what we have in this radical environmental approach is opposition to storing water, now that we have some extra water, right after a drought.  Now, whose side are you on?  You can't tell me you are on the side of ordinary people, because when water prices go up and there is not enough water for the crops, the price of food goes up and the price of water goes up.  Who is the worst hurt?  America's lowest income people are the ones who are hurt the most, the ones who can't afford to pay the little extra for food that it costs when it costs more money to grow crops in the middle of a drought.                              {time}  1515  So with that said, I dramatically support doing something for the people, not some environmental theory--nonsensical theories in most cases--that we are facing doom if we store water.

Unfortunately, the elections in France were victim to a malicious attempt to distort the results through a coordinated cyber attack on one of the candidates, much as Hillary Clinton's campaign was targeted in our elections. In the waning days of the French election, according to reports, Macron's emails were hacked and leaked to the public, potentially with some altered information included, by agents believed to originate in The hack was then promoted and spread by far-right activists around the globe, some of whom reside here in the United It was deja vu all over again.

The goal of this alliance is not necessarily to promote one candidate over another, one party over another, though that is part of it.

Despite Macron's win yesterday, we would be foolish to think that this unholy alliance will not use the same tactics again in upcoming European elections and, even more important to those of us in this country, in upcoming American elections.[[Page S2787]]  Make no mistake about it--Mr.Putin has no loyalty to any one person or Whatever is good for Russia at the moment, whatever hurts the United States the most, that is what he will pursue.

I sincerely hope these two committees will cover these issues in their hearings and beyond.  We should begin an extended bipartisan discussion about how to combat foreign information operations campaigns and safeguard the integrity of democratic elections all over the world and, most importantly, in our own country. It is no less serious than this: The integrity of our democracy, which has thrived, blessedly, for over 240 years could well be at stake.                               TrumpCare  Now, Mr.President, on healthcare, last week House Republicans passed the latest version of TrumpCare after a failed attempt earlier this year. When they see this version, the majority of Americans will think it is even worse than the first version.  This partisan bill will dramatically increase the cost of health insurance for those who need it most, including older Americans, and lower the quality of coverage.  TrumpCare would mean 24 million fewer Americans will be without health insurance.  It would hike premiums by 20 percent in the first few years, and average costs for the middle class could go up by more than $1,500 a year. Middle-class people can't afford that kind of money. If you are struggling to make it into the middle class, TrumpCare could raise your costs by up to $4,000, putting you in an even worse pickle.  It makes it possible for insurers to charge older Americans as much as five times the amount they charge younger people, and States could make this ratio even greater if they wanted. Under the first TrumpCare bill, someone making about $20,000 could have his or her--someone who is 63 years old--premiums go up from something like $1,500 or $2,000 all the way to over $10,000 a year. This will be devastating for senior citizens, those 50 to 65. At 65, they get They are in decent shape. But when they are older and not under Medicare, they could get clobbered by this bill after working so hard. And that is the time when you start getting susceptible to so many serious illnesses.  TrumpCare would devastate our rural areas by decimating Medicaid, which rural areas rely on. Limiting subsidies to lower income Americans, many of whom live in rural areas, TrumpCare would put insurance for rural Americans even further out of reach.  Many rural hospitals are the largest employers in their areas. We have many in New York State, in Upstate New They would be shortchanged by this bill. These hospitals--often the largest employers in our rural counties and the only providers of healthcare for scores and sometimes hundreds of miles around--might be forced to lay off thousands of workers. Many of these rural hospital leaders say that if TrumpCare passed, they would have to close. There would be hundreds out of work in an area where it is not easy to find work, and for those who don't work in the hospitals, it would be harder to get to the hospitals. We all know how important it is to get there quickly when, God forbid, a stroke or some other serious illness occurs.  Maybe most troubling of all, TrumpCare would now eliminate crucial consumer protections in our healthcare system, including the ones that protect Americans with preexisting conditions. Every family in this country knows someone who has a preexisting condition. That sounds like a fancy word. What does it mean? Diabetes, chronic asthma, cancer, things like that. If you live in a State that opts out of this requirement, you will have to jump through so many hoops to maintain access to care, and even then it likely won't be affordable. It is unimaginable. You are a parent. Let's say you are 40 years old, husband and wife, and your child gets cancer. You can't get the coverage that under present law the insurance company has to give you or keep with you, and you watch your child suffer. That is inhumane.  How, for ideological purposes, the folks in the House could have first eliminated it and now made it almost unattainable for so many millions of Americans--unfathomable. We fixed the problem in our healthcare system because we had heard so many horrible stories. The Republican bill brings it back from the dead.  The way the House bill was put together in such a secretive and slapdash way, it is barely legislation. It well could be a menace to millions of American families. It means that the Senate should not even come close to passing a bill like this. It makes healthcare for working families, rural Americans, older Americans, and veterans much poorer and at the same time gives massive tax breaks to the wealthy. Some say that is the motivation of some in the To pay for these tax breaks for people making over $250,000 a year--and they get a big break--cut back healthcare on everybody else or on so many others. That is wrong. That is wrong.  It does, frankly, exactly the opposite of everything President Trump promised he would do on healthcare. He said: Lower costs, better care, insuring everyone. His words. President Trump said he would not cut Medicare or His bill does both. TrumpCare is a giant broken promise for the working people, the hard-working people of this great country of ours.  House Republicans rushed it through without hearings and without much debate or even a final CBO score. The final version was posted 8 hours before Members had to vote on it. Some of the very same Republicans who during the ObamaCare debate chanted ``Read the bill'' didn't even look at the final legislation, let alone study it. That is a breathtakingly irresponsible thing to do on a bill that will affect almost one-fifth of our economy and the healthcare of millions of I am not surprised our Republican colleagues wanted to rush it through. The more the American people see it, the less they will like it, just like with their first bill, which is why the first bill didn't pass and why the second one is in so much trouble here in the  To borrow Speaker Ryan's catchphrase, there is a better way to reform our healthcare system. Instead of a partisan process, rushing through bills in the dead of night--no hearings, no debate, no score, no input from the other party--both parties could start working together on improving our healthcare system.  Now that the bill is in the Senate's hands, we hope the Republican majority will pursue a bipartisan approach. If they drop their repeal efforts, which are already causing such uncertainty that insurers are pledging to hike rates on Americans next year, we Democrats are willing to work with our Republican colleagues to improve our healthcare system.  In the last few years, we have made a good deal of progress. We have made major improvements in our healthcare system, expanding coverage for over 20 million Americans, bending the cost curve, and protecting folks with preexisting conditions. Why don't we keep all the good things we have in the system and work on making it even better in a bipartisan way? We want to improve quality, lower costs, reduce the price of prescription drugs, and expand coverage for all Unfortunately, the House bill does exactly the opposite.  I hope my Republican friends toss this House bill out the window and resist the temptation to follow the same partisan, rushed process. I hope my friends on the other side of aisle drop repeal, which is hurting our healthcare system right now--just the threat of it--and start working with Democrats to make our healthcare better.                            Paris Agreement  Finally, Mr.President, a word on the Paris climate agreement. Reports have indicated that the Trump administration is leaning toward withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement. This would be a historic misstep that would massively disadvantage both American businesses[[Page S2788]]and diplomats. It would damage our standing on the world stage and allow China to take the high moral ground and the economic upper hand in combatting climate change. Most importantly, a great step forward made by President Obama to get the entire world community to work in a coordinated and concerted effort to reduce carbon pollution so that the United States does not have to bear the burden and so that China would do much more than it has done--all that would be undone in one fell swoop.  Europe and other countries have warned the Trump administration that abandoning the Paris Agreement could lead to carbon tariffs on U.goods, stymying access to global markets for our companies and undercutting our trade position. That is why hundreds of American companies, including 28 Fortune 100 CEOs representing 9 million jobs, support the climate agreement.  There is a giant difference between putting America first and making America an international pariah. The latter approach only undermines our power and erodes our standing in the world. Right now, there are only two countries in the world that are not parties to the Paris Agreement--Syria and Nicaragua, the latter of which objects because they feel the agreement is not strong enough.  Climate change is real. It is driven by human activity. It is happening right now. These are facts. They are not in dispute. Our scientists know it, our businesses know it, the world knows it, and the American people who have experienced such changes in weather and climate know it too. The United States needs to have a seat at the table as the world works together to solve this existential challenge.  I strongly encourage the administration to rethink its position and remain in the agreement.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from                       Republican Healthcare Bill  ",CREC-2017-05-08-pt1-PgS2785-7.txt,1036,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 806, OZONE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION",2017.0,8.0,July
7433,topic-id,2572,"Mr.President, let me first express the profound sadness that we all felt this past week about the terrorist attacks in My heart is with the people of that great city and with the victims of this string of attacks and their families. They are all in our prayers.  The morning after the attack, I was walking down the street in New York, and I saw a husband and wife--they looked like out-of-towners--with three beautiful little girls, and the girls were skipping along happily. When they are with their parents when they are little, they get so happy. I thought: God, what if a bomb blew up and killed them. It just got to me.  So we really feel for these people who were just taken from us much too soon by vicious, almost inexplicable viciousness.  In this moment of trial for one of our fiercest friends and allies, the United States also stands shoulder to shoulder with the citizens of the UK in our joint fight against terrorists and those who support them.  We wish a swift recovery to the injured and comfort to the victims and[[Page S3236]]their families. We certainly hope the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.                             Infrastructure  Mr.President, on infrastructure--another matter--we know President Trump will spend this week unveiling his infrastructure proposal in several phases. We will have to wait and see what the full details of the plan are before we judge it, but we Democrats welcome a discussion on infrastructure.  We believe the Federal Government ought to invest more, not less, in rebuilding our roads, bridges and highways, our schools, electric grids, and our water and sewer systems. We should be investing in expanding broadband, which is so vital for our rural areas and a number of urban areas that are still underserved.  So we have several concerns about the President's upcoming proposal, considering the President actually cut infrastructure investment significantly in his budget proposal to How can you be for infrastructure and then cut all of these proposals in your budget? That is what he did.  Now, unfortunately based on recent reports, the entire focus of the President's infrastructure proposal this week is on privatization, which sounds like a nice word. But when you scratch beneath the surface, it means much less construction and far fewer jobs, particularly in our rural areas. It also means Trump tolls from one end of America to the other.  If President Trump wants the private sector to finance the construction of infrastructure, it is going to demand a price. That is how the private sector works. The financiers will look to turn a profit. Let's remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch. If the financiers put in money, they are going to want to take it back.  How are they going to turn a profit on infrastructure? Tolls, tolls, and more tolls--tolls paid by American workers, salesmen, truckdrivers, vacationers, and commuters; tolls paid by working families, middle-class families, and consumers of all stripes. A private-sector-driven infrastructure plan means tolls, tolls, tolls paid by average working  It also means that infrastructure that can't be built with tolls--like repairing our crumbling schools, for instance--will get left behind. Moreover, a scheme that relies on private investment will leave rural areas of America behind. My friend the Republican Senator from Wyoming, a member of the Republican leadership, Mr.Barrasso, who understands the needs of his very rural State said: ``Funding solutions that involve public-private partnerships do not work for rural areas.'' That is not Chuck Schumer speaking, although New York has the third largest rural population in That is Senator Barrasso speaking.  Let me repeat what he said: ``Funding solutions that involve public-private partnerships do not work for rural areas.''  That is the Republican Senator from Wyoming, saying an infrastructure proposal that involves privatization ignores a huge portion of the United States--rural areas--where infrastructure investment is greatly needed. When a Republican Senator says that, we all ought to pay attention at both ends of Pennsylvania  Privatization also ignores the ongoing maintenance needs of many of our Nation's more populated areas. Sure, maybe if the toll is high enough, a private company could build a shiny new bridge, but they won't do anything to fix the crumbling railroad switches, potholes, and water main breaks that are plaguing so many of our cities, particularly in the older areas--the Northeast, the  One aspect the President highlighted today is privatizing our air traffic control systems. This would put the same airline companies that have added baggage fees and change fees and shrunk leg room in charge of the air traffic control system. Worse still, it would let the airlines charge consumers even more than they charge now.  If air traffic control is privatized, where are the protections for consumers? What will prevent costs of flying from going way up? Under a private system, what stops airlines from raising fees and taxes on consumers?  So privatization, whether it is for the construction of roads and bridges or in aviation, often leaves the average American with the short end of the stick and gives big corporations way too much power.  So, again, we will wait and see what the President proposes. We want to discuss infrastructure. We want to work with him on infrastructure. But if it is all or mostly privatization with minimal public investment, it will not be an effective way to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure. It will cost middle-class families more, and it will not create the kind of jobs our economy needs.  Let's not forget that the President proposed a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill in the campaign. We Democrats were encouraged to hear this. It is one of the first things I talked with President-Elect Trump about on the phone, but so far we have been disappointed.  Senate Democrats put forward a real, trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would create millions of jobs and actually fix our crumbling roads and bridges while investing in every corner of We stand ready and willing to work with the President on a real plan that actually achieves what he promised on the campaign trail. But, unfortunately, if this week, on infrastructure, is all about privatization, it is going to be another broken promise that President Trump made to the working people of                         James Comey Testimony  Mr.President, later this week, former FBI Director James Comey will be testifying before the Senate Intelligence I am glad he is doing so in the open and on the record. I hope he is as forthcoming as possible. Transparency and openness is absolutely vital if we are to get to the bottom of the events of the past few months. Knowing James Comey a little bit, transparency and openness have always been his way.  I would expect that Mr.Comey's appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee will not be his last appearance before I know the Senate Judiciary Committee has made a similar request of Mr.I support their request, and I hope he will go before them as well.                            Paris Agreement  Finally, Mr.President, a few words about the Paris climate accord. I was deeply disappointed by President Trump's decision last week to start the process for withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, an agreement signed by every sovereign nation, except Syria and Nicaragua--Nicaragua, by the way, because they thought the agreement didn't go far enough.  The decision will ultimately be viewed--the decision by Trump to pull out of the Paris climate accord--as one of the worst decisions of the 21st century because of the huge damage it will do to our economy, our environment, and our geopolitical standing.  Pulling out of the Paris Agreement doesn't put America first. It puts America alone and last. It puts America last in recognizing science, in being a world leader in protecting our own communities and working in concert with the family of nations in safeguarding the planet we all inhabit for future generations.  Climate change is an issue where time unfortunately is not on our side. Every year that we don't work toward lowering our carbon emission standards is another year of irrevocable damage to the environment. Future generations will look back on this decision as a failure of historic proportions.  President Trump's decision to withdraw is also a sucker punch to American workers, who should be building the next generation of wind turbines and solar panels. Now other countries, including China, our economic rival, will seize the mantel of innovation and clean energy away from  Listen to this. This astounded me. Just last month, Ernest & Young published the latest edition of a report ranking nations by how attractive they are for renewable energy investment. For the first time, China and India both outrank the United So on one of the newer technologies that will ultimately be cheaper than the existing technologies, we are already falling behind and will fall further behind. Imagine that China and India are now ranked by Ernst & Young as being better places for renewable energy investment. That is not going to help American jobs next year and certainly over the next decade.[[Page S3237]]  It is a devastating loss to our economy, and the workers who would have benefited greatly from America's leading the way forward in a new industry will lose out.  Moreover, if the United States doesn't have a seat at the table with the nations in the Paris Agreement, other nations could agree on policies that hurt American businesses and American workers, even more than this self-inflicted wound by President  Now, I am glad that States like my State of New York and cities and businesses across the country are already stepping up, reaffirming their commitment to the goals set in Paris and pledging to continue to make progress in the fight against climate change. Our economy and our communities will be better for it.  I seriously hope that the President reconsiders his decision for the sake of our planet, for the future of the American economy, and for the future of American jobs, which thrive on the kind of innovation President Trump has just turned his back on.  Thank you, and I yield the floor.                   Recognition of the Majority Leader  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.                          London Terror Attack  Mr.Mr.President, over the weekend, our friends and allies suffered yet another tragic loss as terrorists struck in London, claiming several innocent lives and injuring dozens more. Our steadfast allies, the British, have confronted terrorism for decades, and our friends have endured so much these past several months at the hands of terrorists. Our hearts go out to them.  The Senate holds the victims of the attack and their families in our thoughts, and we once again express our gratitude to all of the first responders, medical professionals, and citizens who bravely stepped in to help.  Our fight against terrorism will go on, and together we will target terrorist networks and propagandists. We will continue to stand by the British people, especially in this time of great difficulty.  Mr.President, this week marks the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Six-Day Confronted by the massing Arab armies and the closing of the Tiran Straits, Israel responded, and in a fight for survival, ultimately prevailed. As a result, the city of Jerusalem was finally reunified after years of division. The reunification of the city allowed for people of all faiths to worship and to access the respective holy sites throughout  In honor of this significant anniversary for our close ally, many Senators from both sides of the aisle--including the Democratic leader and myself--are joining together in a resolution to mark the occasion today.  While we know Israel continues to face a number of threats, bipartisan adoption of this resolution will serve as yet another indication of the commitment of the United States of standing by our friends in I look forward to supporting it later this afternoon and working to strengthen our relationship with that nation in the years to come.                        Remembering Jim Bunning  Mr.President, on May 26, the Commonwealth of Kentucky lost a legendary figure with the passing of Senator Jim For more than two decades, Jim was my colleague here in Before that, he was a storied Major League Baseball pitcher, earning him a spot in Today, I remember Jim Bunning, a Hall of Famer in life.  Jim's career in the majors spanned 17 seasons, where he pitched primarily for the Tigers and the In that time, he earned 224 career wins and struck out 2,855 batters. Of his many impressive accomplishments on the diamond, Jim's two greatest pitching achievements were his no-hitter in 1958 and the perfect game he threw in 1964, a feat that has only been accomplished 23 times in all of baseball history.  In recognition of his career with the Phillies, the team retired Jim's 14 jersey, and his baseball career was finally capped off by his election to the Hall of Fame in 1996 by the Veterans  Anyone would be proud with such a resume, but for Jim it was only the first act. Jim moved back to Fort Thomas in northern Over the next three decades, he served at all levels of government, from the Fort Thomas City Council to the Kentucky State Senate, to both Chambers of the U.Congress, including 12 years in the House and 12 in the Jim dedicated his life to serving the people of Kentucky, and Kentuckians are truly grateful for his work.  He was a man of principle from start to finish. He stayed true to himself. As Congressional Quarterly once wrote, ``All agree . . . that [Bunning] is unafraid to go his own way.'' Throughout his career, Jim took many principled stands, even if it meant standing alone. In his farewell address to the Senate, he said: ``I have been booed by 60,000 fans in Yankee Stadium, standing alone on the mound, so I never cared if I stood alone in Congress, as long as I stood by my beliefs and my values.''  That summed up Jim Bunning, but in his life, Jim really never did stand alone. Through trials and hardships, he always had his loving wife Mary by his side. Jim would have been the first to tell you that his success in life would not have been possible without She stood with him through both the glory and the hardships of his baseball career, and was, in Jim's words, his ``rock,'' his ``best fan,'' and his ``best friend.'' Together, they helped raise the nine children Jim is survived by today. He is also survived by 35 grandchildren--one of whom, by the way, once worked in my office--and 21 great-grandchildren. It is clear the two most important things to Jim were always his family and his deeply held Catholic faith.  Jim was a man of strong beliefs and good character. Never one to make excuses, he worked hard at whatever he put his mind to; first, in baseball as a legendary pitcher and then as a voice for the people of Kentucky for over 30 years. With an unshakeable commitment to his family and the firm principles guiding him, Jim was truly a ``hall of famer'' in life.  On behalf of the entire Senate family, I would like to offer heartfelt condolences to Mary, their family, friends, and all who knew and loved Senator Jim  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

7583,topic-id,985,"Madam President, this week, the eyes of the American people should be and are on the The Republican majority endeavors to pass a massive remake of our Nation's healthcare system with the votes of only one party and the ideas of only one wing of one party in just 4 short days.  The Republican majority kept their healthcare bill shrouded in darkness for as long as possible, only dragging it into the light last Thursday morning after it was forced to because there was so much outcry over the secrecy. That was only a week before it was set for a vote. There are still no hearings and no opportunity for a robust discussion of amendments. Just a few hours ago, they released a revised version, which, at the moment, is what we will apparently consider on the floor.  There is a reason my Republican colleagues labored in secret. There is a reason they forsook the committee process and regular order and open debate. There is a reason they want to jam this bill through in just 1 week. They are ashamed of their bill. Now that we have seen it, we finally know why.  The Republican healthcare bill--this new TrumpCare--unwinds the healthcare protections and programs that are designed to help the Americans who need it the most in order to give a tax break to the Americans who need it the least.  The bill would gut Medicaid, making it harder for families with a loved one in a nursing home or for families with a disabled child to afford his care, so that they can give a massive tax cut to the wealthy.  This bill would defund Planned Parenthood, making it harder for millions of women to obtain care, so that they can give people who make over $1 million a $57,000 tax cut, on average.  The bill would slash tax credits, which help families afford health insurance, in order to give a nearly $1 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest  The bill would also punish any Americans who experience a gap in coverage, locking them out of health insurance for 6 months. Every year, tens of millions of Americans have a gap in coverage through no fault of their own. Some lose their jobs, and others have temporary financial problems. It is inhumane to say to those Americans: You now have to wait an additional 6 months without insurance.  Imagine someone who is struggling with cancer, and he has a lapse in coverage. The 6-month wait this Republican penalty imposes could well become a death sentence.  That is why Republicans are ashamed of this bill--it carries a staggering human cost. You do not have to take my word for it; the bipartisan National Association of Medicaid Directors came out today in opposition to the bill, saying it would ``divert critical resources away from what we know is working today,'' particularly for opioid treatment.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that their statement be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  [From the National Association of Medicaid Directors, June 26, 2017]Consensus Statement From the National Association of Medicaid Directors (NAMD) Board of Directors on the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017       Washington, DC.--The following statement represents the      unanimous views of the National Association of Medicaid      Directors (NAMD) Board of NAMD is a bipartisan,      nonprofit, professional organization representing leaders of      state Medicaid agencies across the country.       Medicaid is a successful, efficient, and cost-effective      federal-state partnership. It has a record of innovation and      improvement of outcomes for the nation's most vulnerable      citizens.       Medicaid plays a prominent role in the provision of long-     term services and supports for the nation's elderly and      disabled populations, as well as behavioral health services,      including comprehensive and effective treatment for      individuals struggling with opioid dependency.       Medicaid is complex and therefore demands thoughtful and      deliberate discussion about how to improve it.       Medicaid Directors have long advocated for meaningful      reform of the program. States continue to innovate with the      tools they have, but federal changes are necessary to improve      effectiveness and efficiency of the program. However, these      changes must be made thoughtfully and deliberately to ensure      the continued provision of quality, cost-effective care.       Medicaid Directors have asked for, and are appreciative of,      improved working relationships with HHS and are working hard      to streamline and improve the administration of the program.      The Senate bill does formalize several critical      administrative and regulatory improvements, such as giving      Medicaid Directors a seat at the table in the development of      regulations that impact how the program is run, and the      pathway to permanency for certain waiver programs. However,      no amount of administrative or regulatory flexibility can      compensate for the federal spending reductions that would      occur as a result of this bill.       Changes in the federal responsibility for financing the      program must be accompanied by clearly articulated statutory      changes to Medicaid to enable states to operate effectively      under a cap. The Senate bill does not accomplish that. It      would be a transfer of risk, responsibility, and cost to the      states of historic proportions.       While NAMD does not have consensus on the mandatory      conversion of Medicaid financing to a per capita cap or block      grant, the per capita cap growth rates for Medicaid in the      Senate bill are insufficient and unworkable.       Medicaid--or other forms of comprehensive, accessible and      affordable health coverage--in coordination with public      health and law enforcement entities, is the most      comprehensive and effective way address the opioid epidemic      in this country. Earmarking funding for grants for the      exclusive purpose of treating addiction, in the absence of      preventative medical and behavioral health coverage, is      likely to be ineffective in solving the problem and would      divert critical resources away from what we know is working      today.       Medicaid Directors recommend prioritizing the stabilization      of marketplace coverage. Medicaid reform should be undertaken      when it can be accomplished thoughtfully and deliberately.

I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 American Medical Association,                                       Chicago, IL, June 26, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,     Charles Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer: On      behalf of the physician and medical student members of the      American Medical Association (AMA), I am writing to express      our opposition to the discussion draft of the ``Better Care      Reconciliation Act'' released on June 22, 2017. Medicine has      long operated under the precept of Primum non nocere, or      ``first, do no harm.'' The draft legislation violates that      standard on many levels.       In our January 3, 2017 letter to you, and in subsequent      communications, we have consistently urged that the Senate,      in developing proposals to replace portions of the current      law, pay special attention to ensure that individuals      currently covered do not lose access to affordable, quality      health insurance coverage. In addition, we have advocated for      the sufficient funding of Medicaid and other safety net      programs and urged steps to promote stability in the      individual market.[[Page S3745]]       Though we await additional analysis of the proposal, it      seems highly likely that a combination of smaller subsidies      resulting from lower benchmarks and the increased likelihood      of waivers of important protections such as required      benefits, actuarial value standards, and out of pocket      spending limits will expose low and middle income patients to      higher costs and greater difficulty in affording care.       The AMA is particularly concerned with proposals to convert      the Medicaid program into a system that limits the federal      obligation to care for needy patients to a predetermined      formula based on per-capita-caps. At the recently concluded      Annual Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates, representatives      of more than 190 state and national specialty medical      associations spoke strongly in opposition to such proposals.      Per-capita-caps fail to take into account unanticipated costs      of new medical innovations or the fiscal impact of public      health epidemics, such as the crisis of opioid abuse      currently ravaging our nation. The Senate proposal to      artificially limit the growth of Medicaid expenditures below      even the rate of medical inflation threatens to limit states'      ability to address the health care needs of their most      vulnerable citizens. It would be a serious mistake to lock      into place another arbitrary and unsustainable formula that      will be extremely difficult and costly to fix.       We are also concerned with other provisions of the      legislation beyond those directly affecting insurance      coverage. The Affordable Care Act's Prevention and Public      Health Fund was, according to the Department of Health and      Human Services, established to ``provide expanded and      sustained national investments in prevention and public      health, to improve health outcomes, and to enhance health      care quality.'' These activities are key to controlling      health care costs and the elimination of support for them      runs counter to the goal of improving the health care system.      We also continue to oppose Congressionally-mandated      restrictions on where lower income women (and men) may      receive otherwise covered health care services--in this case      the prohibition on individuals using their Medicaid coverage      at clinics operated by Planned These provisions      violate longstanding AMA policy on patients' freedom to      choose their providers and physicians' freedom to practice in      the setting of their choice.       We do appreciate the inclusion of several provisions      designed to bring short term stability to the individual      market, including the extension of cost sharing reductions      payments. We urge, however, that these provisions serve as      the basis of Senate efforts to improve the ACA and ensure      that quality, affordable health insurance coverage is within      reach of all       We sincerely hope that the Senate will take this      opportunity to change the course of the current debate and      work to fix problems with the current system. We believe that      Congress should be working to increase the number of      Americans with access to quality, affordable health insurance      instead of pursuing policies that have the opposite effect,      and we renew our commitment to work with you in that      endeavor.

7585,topic-id,936,"Madam President, even several Republican Senators are expressing concerns.  Republican Senator Heller said: ``The bill doesn't protect the most vulnerable Nevadans--the elderly, Nevadans struggling with mental health issues, substance abuse, and people with disabilities.''  He continued: ``The goal of healthcare reform should be to lower costs here in Nevada, and I'm not confident--not confident--it will achieve that goal.''  Republican Senator Susan Collins said about the bill: ``I'm very concerned about the cost of insurance for older people with serious chronic illnesses, and the impact of the Medicaid cuts on our state governments, the most vulnerable people in our society, and health care providers such as our rural hospitals and nursing homes.''  Even my friend the junior Republican Senator from Texas said that under this bill, ``premiums would continue to rise.''  My Republican friends are right to have these concerns. The bill will not lower costs for working families. It will leave the most vulnerable Americans out in the cold, devastate rural areas, and set us even further back in combating the opioid epidemic.  This week, the Senate will witness a political exercise in that the majority leader will attempt to coerce the votes of these Senators and any other holdouts by adjusting the dials on the legislation a bit. There will be buyouts and bailouts and small tweaks that will be hailed as ``fixes'' by the other side.  The truth is that the Republicans cannot excise the rotten core at the center of their healthcare bill. No matter what tweaks they add, no matter how the bill changes around the edges, it is fundamentally flawed at the center. No matter what last-minute amendments are offered, this bill will force millions of Americans to spend more of their paychecks on healthcare in order to receive fewer benefits simply so that the wealthiest Americans can pay less in taxes. That is why our Republican colleagues are ashamed of this bill and are rushing it through in 4 short days.  Before we vote on the motion to proceed, I would ask my Republican friends to do one simple thing: Reflect on how this bill would impact your constituents. We are all sent here to serve the people of our States--to do right by them, to ease their burdens where possible and make sure our laws reflect a country that gives everyone an equal opportunity to succeed. The first rule of medicine is ``do no harm.'' So it should be with government. So it should be with this healthcare bill.  But this bill will harm the middle-class family with a parent in a nursing home. It will harm the father whose son is struggling with opioid addiction and who is having trouble finding the money to put him through treatment. It will harm the child born with a preexisting condition, who may hit the lifetime cap on healthcare coverage before he or she even enters kindergarten.  As the American Medical Association said today, this bill violates the ``do no harm'' standard on many levels. I believe my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle are men and women of good conscience. I would ask that they think with their conscience before they vote on the motion to proceed on  Any bill that does this much harm to the American people ought to receive a ``no'' vote.                            Russia Sanctions  Finally, Madam President, I have a word on Russia sanctions. President Trump has spent the last few days firing off tweets that point fingers at President Obama's handling of Russia's interference in our election. It is good that the President has finally acknowledged--albeit implicitly--that Russia interfered in our election, something that the intelligence community has long agreed upon.  Let me give the President some heartfelt advice. Mr.President, you have to stop the name-calling, finger-pointing, and deflection when it comes to something as serious as Russia's meddling in our democracy. This is very, very serious stuff.  Whatever President Trump thinks of President Obama's actions during the election is moot. Mr.Trump is now President, not Barack Obama, and the Russian threat is still there. If President Trump is concerned by Russian interference in our election, he can step up to the plate and try to stop it. Blaming Obama is not going to solve the problem, even though that blame may be wrongly placed.  The best thing President Trump can do is to support the Russia sanctions bill the Senate passed 2 weeks ago by an overwhelming, bipartisan, 98-to-2 vote--a bill that is currently languishing at the clerk's desk in the House, at what appears to be, at least, the request of the White  It would be unconscionable--unconscionable--to let sanctions stay where they are or, worse, to weaken them, when Russia has interfered with the wellsprings of our democracy and, if not punished, will likely do so again.  If President Trump doesn't support the bill and tries to block it or water it down, Americans are going to be asking: What is his motivation? What is the reason President Trump is afraid to sanction Russia after they interfered in our elections? The American people are going to ask a lot of questions.  I would advise the President to stop casting blame and step up to protect the vital interests of this country, to get tough on Russia, get serious about safeguarding our elections, and tell Speaker Ryan to pass our Russia sanctions bill so that President Trump can sign it.  Otherwise, President Trump is going to be in an even deeper hole with the public on the matter of  Thank you, Madam  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-26-pt1-PgS3744.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,26.0,July
7551,topic-id,1367,"Mr.President, I am joining my colleagues on the floor this afternoon because I share their concerns about what will happen to women's healthcare. I am concerned about what will happen to everyone's healthcare, but particularly this afternoon we are talking about our concerns with respect to healthcare for women.  If the Senate passes legislation like the House passed recently--the American Health Care Act--that legislation has been widely described as cruel and poorly crafted. Just last week, President Trump described it simply as mean. Republican leaders in the Senate are now writing a companion bill that reportedly makes mostly cosmetic changes to the House bill. By some accounts, it would make the House bill even more extreme.  Obviously, any legislation that, by design, takes health insurance away from tens of millions of Americans, I believe, is deeply misguided. I am particularly concerned about the harmful effects this legislation would have on women's health. Indeed, I received countless emails and letters from women who are offended that, once again, powerful men are meeting behind closed doors to make critical decisions regarding women's health, and we have been excluded from the room.  This Republican bill would take us back to the days before the Affordable Care Act, when insurers could charge women more just for being women, with no other reason needed. It would take away the Federal protections against discrimination based on preexisting conditions. Bear in mind, some of these conditions apply mostly or exclusively to women.  In the days before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies treated pregnancies, sexual assault, domestic violence, and cesarean sections as preexisting conditions. Insurers routinely charged higher premiums to women with these ``preexisting conditions'' or they denied coverage all together. For example, more than 30 percent of mothers have a cesarean section. Once again, if this House-passed bill passes, and if we see something out of the Senate that does the same, women would face discrimination, mothers would face discrimination from insurance companies.  The American Health Care Act would also harm women by allowing insurers to opt out of the 10 essential health benefits that all insurance plans must cover under the Affordable Care These benefits are called essential because that is exactly what they are. They are essential, not only to good health but, in some cases, to actually staying alive. A number of these essential health benefits apply exclusively to women, including contraception, maternity and newborn care, mammograms, and cervical cancer screenings.  Several months ago on Facebook, I asked people across New Hampshire to tell me their stories--stories about how the Affordable Care Act has made lifesaving difference or otherwise improved their lives. I heard from many women across New Hampshire who have written about how the Affordable Care Act has ended discrimination against them by the health insurance industry because of their gender. In particular, they are grateful that the Affordable Care Act includes maternity care and contraception.  This is a picture of Maura Fay, of Exeter, She writes:       My husband and I are self-employed. Before the ACA we were      paying rates that were simply unsustainable for a middle-     class family like ours. When I was pregnant in 2013, we were      forced to pay a maternity rider of an additional $822 a      month.  That is in addition to her premium. She says:       I'm worried about the rollbacks in regulations around      Essential Health Benefits, especially since so many of them      impact women. Maternity coverage shouldn't come with an      additional $800 a month price tag.  Well, I appreciate that letter from Maura, but I am worried she may actually be underestimating the cost of maternity care coverage if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. According to one analysis, women who seek maternity care under the American Health Care Act--the legislation passed by the House--could pay up to $17,000 in surcharges to their insurance company.  The American Health Care Act that the House passed also makes draconian cuts to Medicaid, and this will disproportionately harm women--nearly 40 million women--who make up the majority of Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid provides healthcare for nearly half of all pregnant women in the United States, supporting them through their pregnancies and ensuring that their babies get a healthy start in life. This coverage is directly threatened by the Republican legislation.  The American Health Care Act the House passed, if we combine that with the administration's budget proposal, it would cut Medicaid by a staggering $1.4 trillion by the year 2027--so, in 10 years, a $1.4 trillion cut. This would reduce Medicaid funding by nearly half and mean that tens of millions of people would lose coverage, including many women of reproductive age.  Let me also point out that both the American Health Care Act passed by the House and the President's budget terminate all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and we just heard Senator Blumenthal speak eloquently about the importance of Planned This would leave millions of[[Page S3695]]women and families with fewer healthcare options. In New Hampshire, it would mean that between 12,000 and 13,000 women and men would lose access to basic primary and preventive health services, including lifesaving cancer screenings and HIV testing.  According to poll after poll, the American people all across the political spectrum strongly support Planned Parenthood and oppose efforts to defund it. Despite efforts by Republican leaders in the House and Senate to misrepresent the facts, Planned Parenthood does not use taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. Indeed, Federal law expressly forbids the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions except under extremely narrow circumstances that have been agreed to by Congress, so the real issue here is not abortion. This is about ensuring that American women have access to the basic healthcare they need where they want to receive it. Remember that Planned Parenthood plays an especially important role in delivering essential health services to low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable individuals, including in rural areas.  Earlier this year I received a letter from Samantha Fox of Bow, NH, and she writes:       In 2007, I was a 19-year-old just barely starting out when      I was denied health insurance due to a preexisting condition.      Had I been able to access affordable coverage, my preexisting      condition, a reproductive system disorder, would have been      easily manageable. . . . [A]t that time, I was able to access      care through Planned Parenthood which likely preserved my      ability to conceive in the future. Flash forward 10 years: I      am expecting my first child and I have coverage which, thanks      to the Affordable Care Act, includes prenatal care.  Now, here in Washington, some people think that repealing the Affordable Care Act is all about politics and notching a win on their scoreboard. But for ordinary people in New Hampshire and across the country, including millions of women, repealing the Affordable Care Act isn't about politics, it is about life and death. We need to listen to the women and men in each of our States whose lives and finances would be turned upside down if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.  Furthermore, it is just wrong to exclude women, to exclude their colleagues, to exclude Democrats, to exclude the public and to pursue a strictly partisan approach to healthcare--the same approach that produced a terrible bill in the And it is deeply misguided to bring legislation to the floor that we all know would hurt tens of millions of Americans and do particular harm to women.  There is a better way forward in the Let's put ideology and partisanship aside. Let's work together. Let's strengthen the elements of the Affordable Care Act that are working in the real world, including Medicaid expansion, and let's fix what is not working. It doesn't matter what we call this. It doesn't have to be called We can call it whatever we want. The important thing is to have legislation that would provide access to healthcare for Americans, healthcare they can afford, that is quality, that is there when people need it. This is what the great majority of the American people want us to do. It is time now to respect their wishes. Let's strengthen the Affordable Care Act so that it works even better for all  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgS3690-5.txt,1901,WATER SUPPLY PERMITTING COORDINATION ACT,2017.0,21.0,July

7443,topic-id,522,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the distinguished career, service, and leadership of Augustana University president Rob  His 11 years of leadership as the 23rd president of Augustana University in Sioux Falls, SD, have highlighted his servant's heart, visionary attitude, and passion for higher education. As he prepares for this next chapter in life, I would like to honor Rob's dedication and efforts to not only continue the university's rich history of providing students with a quality, liberal arts education, but also for his commitment to ensuring future students are given the opportunity to advance their studies and given the foundation to live a life of purpose at Augustana  President Oliver joined the university after being incredibly involved in the Sioux Falls financial, business, and philanthropic community. For many years, Rob pursued efforts to improve the economic vitality of the region and was also active as a board member and devoted volunteer for many organizations, including the board of trustees of then-Augustana  Rob's presidential tenure occurred during a time of uncertainty for many colleges and universities across the country. With the rising costs of higher education, enrollment challenges, nationwide economic troubles, and a growing discourse regarding the value of a college degree, many traditional institutions were struggling to chart a sustainable path forward.  However, through President Oliver's ability to inspire others, offer a strategic vision, and execute a thorough plan of action, he has responded to those difficulties and strengthened Augustana's mission to deliver a quality, well-rounded experience for students, faculty, and staff.  Under Rob's direction, Augustana has attained a number of accomplishments. Many will point to the critical investments in the Froiland Science Complex and Mikkelsen Library and others will point to record-setting monetary support and vastly increased endowment and scholarship programs as remarkable accomplishments; yet it is also worthwhile to note the university's advancement of the Civitas honors program, new academic majors and curriculum, expanded undergraduate research, and an expansion of online offerings for undergraduate, graduate, and adult students. Additionally, the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and the Student Success Center were created to provide important strategic partnerships and vocational engagement.  Knowing the university's ability to attract students also depends on factors and opportunities outside the scholastic realm. President Oliver's era of leadership also included growth in the performing and visual arts, study abroad programs, and the construction and renovation of first-class, athletic facilities such as Kirkeby-Over Stadium, Ronken Field, and other projects through unprecedented, charitable gifts.  The university has already seen the fruits of Rob's diligent work. With enrollment at a 26-year high, scholarships and financial aid for 100 percent of its fulltime students, two NCAA national championships, a well-respected place among the Nation's top educational institutions, and additional projects already staged for the future, there is little doubt his 25 years as part of Augustana University, whether as a trustee, member of the faculty, or finally as president, President Oliver's outstanding legacy will leave an impact for many years to come.

The Colorado Water Congress, who supports this bill, stated in their letter:       The economic viability of the State of Colorado is      dependent on safe and reliable water supply. In recent years,      the ability of water managers to meet growth demand and to      create water storage has become more challenging.  In Colorado, the Windy Gap Project, whose formal environmental permitting process began in 2003, won't see construction start until at least 2019, with water storage ready by 2022--16 years to permit, 3 years to build.  For too long, Federal agencies have failed to properly coordinate and time their reviews of water supply project applications, resulting in missed opportunities for increased water storage during our wetter seasons.  Water is the lifeblood of Western communities. Without it, most communities in the Western United States could not survive, so it only makes sense to store as much of it as we reasonably can during those wetter years. Yet the Federal Government presents roadblock after roadblock that prevents a timely and cost-effective completion to many of these projects.  This legislation will streamline the permitting process and increase agency accountability by placing the Bureau of Reclamation at the center of the process and ensuring all other agencies are required to report to it in a timely fashion.  It is an effective piece of legislation, an effective approach to a problem that should not exist. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

7549,topic-id,1262,"Mr.President, I am very pleased to follow my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator She said it very well. This is an extraordinarily important part of the debate.  A Senate vote on TrumpCare is now days away, and that is the case even though the bill remains hidden in the Senate shadows. I am here tonight with my colleagues to try to shine some light on the extraordinary harm TrumpCare is going to do to women's health across the country and also to call on the American people to stand up and say, and say loudly, that this is wrong--wrong because it would be a partisan process that takes away important healthcare rights from women across this country.  First, TrumpCare says that health insurance in America ought to be based on what men need and what women need ought to cost extra. You look back a few years to when the Affordable Care Act set in stone guaranteed insurance benefits to protect everybody who shops on the open market, the private open market, regardless of their gender, no price gouging women just because they are women. Now, however, the Republican plan lets States hack away at those essential[[Page S3693]]health benefits, and it always seems that maternity care is the first benefit that then gets cut.  If TrumpCare goes through, what will happen in America is insurance companies will carve maternity care out of the plans they offer on the open market. It would, in effect, become an add-on--an add-on that would come with a higher price, as if a pregnant women's healthcare is a luxury item like a sunroof on a new car.  Let's set aside the fact that every man in the country was born to a woman. My colleagues on the other side have spent 7 years telling Americans that they were laser-focused on bringing costs down for everybody. Apparently, that notion of ``everybody'' that we are hearing from Republican Senators doesn't include mothers because their costs are going to be going up in a number of instances.  Second, the public has heard time and time again that nobody would be hurt under TrumpCare and that repeal and replace is all about putting the patient at the center of care. Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of women who will lose their right to see the doctor of their choosing as a result of TrumpCare defunding Planned Just unpack that for a moment. I think one basic, almost sacred principle for women is that they ought to be able to make the choice of the physician they trust for their healthcare. Yet what we are talking about here--apparently tomorrow--is a real prospect that women will lose the right to see the doctor they trust.  This ideological campaign against Planned Parenthood ignores the fact that there are already laws on the books that prevent tax dollars from funding abortions. It ignores the fact that Planned Parenthood doesn't get a dime of taxpayer funding above what is available to other comparable healthcare providers. It ignores the fact that women rely on Planned Parenthood to get routine medical care from the doctors they know and trust--basic checkups, cancer screenings, preventive care, HIV tests.  It is long past time to end this crusade against Planned Parenthood, which is taking away from women in this country the ability to make their own judgments about whom they want to see and the doctors they trust.  Finally, the TrumpCare plan would significantly slash Medicaid, and this is a special threat to women. Medicaid is at the heart of women's healthcare in the country. Women live longer than men on average, and Medicaid helps pay for two out of three seniors living in nursing homes. Women are more likely than men to have a disability, and Medicaid is the key to helping millions of Americans with disabilities live successful, independent lives in their communities. The Republican healthcare plan would slash Medicaid so deeply year after year that States would be forced to cut benefits and access to care. Women would be hit the hardest by those cuts.  The public needs to know that right now, it is go time in America on healthcare. This vote is right around the corner. And because my colleagues on the other side have in effect locked into this ``our way or the highway'' approach--the Washington word for it is ``reconciliation,'' and my guess is that in a lot of coffee shops in North Carolina and Oregon and points in between, people aren't that up on Washington lingo like reconciliation, but they really want Democrats and Republicans to work together. That has been the cornerstone of my work with respect to healthcare. That is what Chairman Hatch and I have done with respect to the transformation of Medicare, to update the Medicare guarantee. I have worked with my colleagues in a bipartisan way in terms of independence at home, more care for older people at home, and on a host of issues, particularly with respect to holding down pharmaceutical costs in a bipartisan way. The reality is, that is the only way you come up with approaches that are sustainable--build on principles that both sides feel strongly about and lock it into a bipartisan agreement.  What we are looking at, again, not in 6 weeks but tomorrow, is the Senate Republicans saying: We are going to use this reconciliation--not the bipartisan approaches that I think yield the real dividends but a partisan approach. It is called reconciliation. It means ``It is our way or the highway.'' And then what you are going to do is you are going to have one of the most consequential debates about domestic policy in decades. It is going to fly through the Senate with hardly any public input and debate.  A big part of what I wanted to do tonight is come to the floor of the Senate to say to Americans that this is the time to get loud, to get very loud and to tell your friends and your neighbors and your relatives to get out there and be loud with you. This isn't some mundane debate where the two sides couldn't square their differences, the kind most people choose to ignore; this is an out-and-out attack on the healthcare of millions of Americans and especially women.  I think that when the facts get out to women in this country, they are going to say this is wrong, and they are going to say this is personal. The people in Washington, DC, talk about lots of things and throw around lots of Washington lingo like ``reconciliation,'' but I think they are going to see through exactly what these proposals mean for them. It is a significant rollback of their rights on matters like being able to choose the doctor they trust.  I will close with this, and I have felt this way since the days when I was co-director of the senior citizens at home in Political change hardly ever is top-down--top being it comes from government buildings and then trickles down to people--it is almost always bottoms-up, where the voices of Americans are heard and they tell their elected officials when they are off base, when they are doing something that will hurt them rather than help them.  I close by way of saying that I hope this has provided at least some useful information so Americans--particularly women--can get engaged, get loud, and do it now.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.
