                 RECOGNIZING DR. LESTER B. JOHNSON, JR.

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of Dr. Lester Johnson, Jr., who passed away on November 29, 2017, 
at 91 years of age. Dr. Johnson's work to provide a high-quality 
education to all students in Savannah, Georgia, has truly made our 
community a better place to live.
  His teaching career spanned 43 years, with 20 of those years teaching 
at Alfred E. Beach High School, a place where he was a student himself. 
Dr. Johnson passionately taught industrial arts and mathematics 
classes, and he received the Beach High School Teacher of the Year 
Award in 1961.
  In 1969, Dr. Johnson began to teach students at Savannah State 
University, where he later received the university's Distinguished 
Teaching Award in 1991.
  Dr. Johnson's accomplishments don't stop with education. A few of his 
many accomplishments include being a former State representative and 
the first African-American Eagle Scout in Savannah.
  Dr. Lester Johnson's students leave his legacy throughout the First 
Congressional District and the rest of our Nation. He will truly be 
missed.
