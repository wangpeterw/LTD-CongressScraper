                      E-VERIFY SAVES AMERICAN JOBS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House Judiciary 
Committee approved the Legal Workforce

[[Page H8230]]

Act, a bill I introduced that saves jobs for citizens and legal 
workers. It requires U.S. employers to use the E-Verify system to check 
the work eligibility of all future hires.
  A September 2017 Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that 82 percent 
of voters favor requiring business owners to check the immigration 
status of prospective employees.
  E-Verify is the most popular immigration reform that reduces illegal 
immigration. E-Verify is a free and quick system that already is used 
voluntarily by employers to cover one-third of the workforce.
  The Legal Workforce Act has the backing of both national business 
organizations and immigration enforcement groups. This bill deserves 
the enthusiastic support of all Members of Congress who want to put the 
interest of American workers first.
