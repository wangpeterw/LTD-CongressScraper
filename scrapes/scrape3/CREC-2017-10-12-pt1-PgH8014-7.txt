                            CLEAN POWER PLAN

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Clean 
Power Plan. This rule was intended to combat and mitigate the effects 
of climate change and create first-ever limits to carbon pollution from 
U.S. power plants.
  As we deal with the devastation created by some of the strongest 
hurricanes in recorded history and the wildfires that are raging 
through Western States, we can't stand idly by while

this administration eliminates the Clean Power Plan, condemning future 
generations to scarce resources, harsher climates, and economic 
uncertainty.
  Extreme weather has cost the U.S. economy at least $240 billion over 
the past 10 years. Climate change increases the frequency and severity 
of extreme weather. Shouldn't we focus on hardening and securing our 
infrastructure and making it more resilient to climate change?
  The Clean Power Plan would also reduce plant pollutants that cause 
asthma attacks and respiratory illnesses, and it is projected to 
prevent thousands of premature deaths, tens of thousands of asthma 
attacks, and provide at least $20 billion in total health benefits.
  The denial of science by this administration is alarming and 
dangerous. I urge my colleagues to stand up for clean energy and our 
environment and take positive action to address climate change.
