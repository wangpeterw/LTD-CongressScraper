                 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. BRADY of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Pulmonary 
Hypertension Awareness Month and the outstanding work of the Pulmonary 
Hypertension Association.
  It is hard to believe that just over 20 years ago pulmonary 
hypertension patients were given less than 3 years to live and no 
treatment options. Today, there are 14 FDA-approved treatments for 
patients with this rare condition, and they continue to live longer.
  I am proud of the work of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association and 
their volunteers and leadership over the past decade and a half, and I 
am glad to be a small part of it.
  My inspiration was a 5-year-old patient named Emily, the daughter of 
my dear friend Jack Stibbs. Thanks to medical advancements, Emily 
graduated from Vanderbilt University and is leading an amazing life.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to continue to support 
critical research efforts to improve the lives of our PH patients.
