                   REJECT ATTEMPTS TO REPEAL THE ACA

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, in a bizarre rant yesterday, President-
elect Donald Trump said he would be ``the greatest jobsproducer that 
God ever created.'' Mr. Trump might need to rethink that statement, 
given his top priority is to repeal theAffordable Care Act.
  Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, while the Republicans haven't given us 
any details about an ACA replacement policy at all, weknow exactly what 
will happen if they repeal it: millions of jobs will be lost.
  Since the ACA was passed in March 2010, the U.S. economy has added 
more than 15 million private sector jobs and theunemployment rate has 
been cut in half. In fact, the longest streak in private sector job 
growth began the month the ACA waspassed. Now, folks on the other side 
of the aisle want to risk all of that going away by repealing the law.
  A recent study has found that repealing the ACA would kill 2.6 
million jobs in just 1 year, including 45,000 in my homeState of 
Oregon. Thirty million Americans will lose access to health care, and 
$350 billion gets added to our budget deficit.
  Mr. Speaker, we can't afford the reckless ACA repeal policy. I urge 
my colleagues to reject attempts to repeal the law andfocus on ways we 
can fix and improve our healthcare system while creating jobs.
