                            ATTACK ON SYRIA

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, outrage is certainly not a tough 
enough word to watch the children of Syria, and innocent civilians, be 
attacked by poisonous gas. Assad is a vicious dictator, and Russia has 
propped him up.
  It is important for the American people and for Syrian Americans to 
know that we will not tolerate the kind of vile violence, particularly 
against children. But Congress must stand for its constitutional 
responsibility of debating an authorization to use military force. We 
must not, at any time, recklessly ignore actions by the administration 
that really should be a collaborative thought-provoking discussion and 
debate on the strategy for dealing with the crisis in Syria, but, more 
importantly, the propping up of Assad by Russia and its supporters.
  The children need us in Syria to be able to stop both the bloodshed 
and the terrible tragedy of gas attacks that immediately cause life and 
injury. It is time for us--the Members of Congress--

to come to this floor and debate our strategy in Syria.
