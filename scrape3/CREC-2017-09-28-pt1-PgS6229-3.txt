       (1) was the first permanent constitution in the world

     separation of powers, and the rule of law; and
       Whereas the Constitution of the United States has been 
     amended 27 times since its adoption and includes amendments

     day with appropriate ceremonies and respect, including by 
     reading the Constitution of the United States and reflecting 
     on the enduring structure of government built by the Founders
