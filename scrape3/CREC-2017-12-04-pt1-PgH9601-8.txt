                              DUE PROCESS

  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this Congress, with a unanimous 
voice vote, passed a resolution that mandates antisexual harassment 
training for Members and staff.
  Of course, it is about time. But here is the thing, Mr. Speaker: it 
is pitiful and embarrassing that a Member of Congress would need an 
instruction manual that tells them that they must keep their pants on 
in their office.
  What we need is to create an environment of a safe and respectful 
workplace and policies and procedures that will allow victims to come 
forward to be fully compensated, for Members to be held accountable, 
and to have fair due process.
