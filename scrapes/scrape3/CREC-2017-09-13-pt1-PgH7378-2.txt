                        NATIONAL FRANCHISING DAY

  (Mr. RUSH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to invite my colleagues to join 
me in supporting my resolution expressing support for the establishment 
and designation of National Franchising Day.
  Franchising is an important tool to bring jobs to communities around 
our country. The franchise business model, in fact, is the largest 
vocational training industry in America and is responsible for directly 
creating 7.6 million jobs and influencing the creation of 13.3 million 
jobs in the United States.
  Franchising is an industry of entrepreneurs, many of whom are small 
businesses. These entrepreneurs have directly contributed $674.3 
billion in economic output to the U.S. economy, and the franchise 
system, as a whole, has generated $1.6 trillion of economic input. In 
short, Mr. Speaker, it is clear how significant a role franchises and 
the people who operate them play in our economic landscape.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support this bill. Franchising 
is one important tool to make the American Dream happen.
