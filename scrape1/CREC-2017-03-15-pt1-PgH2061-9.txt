         RECOGNIZING SHELBY TOWNSHIP, MICHIGAN, POLICE OFFICERS

  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an act of 
bravery from police officers in an incident occurring just miles from 
my district office in Shelby Township, Michigan.

[[Page H2062]]

  In mid-February, Sergeant Troy Titchenell and Officer Paul Fox 
responded to a call that a boy had fallen through the ice on Iroquois 
Lake. Sergeant Titchenell, without concern for himself, first on the 
scene, immediately got a life ring from a local resident and walked 
onto the ice. Officer Fox then arrived and walked onto the ice to take 
the rope attached to the life ring.
  While towing the young man to safety, the ice broke and Sergeant 
Titchenell was submerged in the water up to his chest. With Officer Fox 
pulling on the rope and Sergeant Titchenell supporting the boy in the 
water, both were able to rescue the young man. I believe they saved a 
life that day.
  This incident exemplifies the risks police officers will take to 
protect all of us. Their daily acts of bravery must be recognized. I am 
proud to highlight the actions of these courageous officers, and I am 
grateful to recognize their service to our community.
