                  HIGHLIGHTING THE 2018 MATZAH MITZVAH

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight the 2018 
Jewish Community Services of South Florida Matzah Mitzvah, which will 
take place on Sunday, March 25, at Temple Israel of Greater Miami.
  Every year, Madam Speaker, this wonderful event brings together 
volunteers and staff from the Jewish Community Services to prepare and 
deliver Passover holiday baskets to homebound seniors and other members 
of the Jewish community in need.
  Those who take part in the Matzah Mitzvah do far more than just 
deliver meals: they help foster a sense of community amongst Jewish 
residents of south Florida and help to ensure that everyone who 
observes the Passover holiday does so with a full heart.
  Volunteers will start assembling the food at 9 a.m., and the delivery 
of the food baskets will follow at 10 a.m.
  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Jewish Community Services of South 
Florida for its dedication to creating a better and more inclusive 
community. I also encourage everyone in south Florida to come out this 
March 25 to Temple Israel of Greater Miami at 9 a.m. and take part in 
the 2018 Matzah Mitzvah.
