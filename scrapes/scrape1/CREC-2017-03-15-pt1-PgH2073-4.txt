                             BULLY BUSTERS

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of a group of 11- 
and 12-year-old girls from my district who have noticed an unsettling 
trend in modern politics and who are absolutely determined to do 
something about it. They see bullying from leaders who are supposed to 
be their role models. They witness fear, intimidation, and vitriol 
being thrown at religious minorities, LGBTQ people, women, immigrants, 
communities of color. And, yes, I am also somebody else's baby.
  In the face of this hate, these girls have decided to take action by 
forming the D.C. Bully Busters. These change-making girls, not even old 
enough to vote yet, but certainly old enough to make their voices 
heard, have vowed to stand up against the bullying they are seeing in 
American politics.
  Mr. Speaker, if grade-schoolers can say that bullying, intimidation, 
and silently standing by are cowardly tactics that have no place in 
politics, then the adults who represent them must be courageous enough 
to do the same thing.

  On Friday, I will be proudly signing the D.C. Bully Busters pledge, 
and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me so that 
we can let everyone know at every level that bullying is never 
acceptable.
