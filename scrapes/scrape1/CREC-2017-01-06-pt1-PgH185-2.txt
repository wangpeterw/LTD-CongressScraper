                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We thank You again today for Your divine inspiration, which led to 
the creation of the Republican democracy we enjoy today, mindful that 
our responsibility is to faithfully carry forward this legacy to all 
those Americans who will follow us.
  By law, the Congress meets this day in joint session to count the 
electoral votes for President and Vice President of the United States. 
May all who attend to these proceedings, and those responsible for the 
management of government, be mindful that something greater than each 
and any of us gathered, or affected by these events, is coming to pass.
  Bless our great Nation and those entrusted with its care throughout 
this first session of the 115th Congress, the 226th session of the 
Supreme Court, and the imminent administration of the 45th President. 
May all, by their actions, remember that we are a Nation which claims 
to put our trust in You.
  And may all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.

                          ____________________
