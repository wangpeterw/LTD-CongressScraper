                         THANKING SHARON LOLLIO

  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
an inspirational constituent and friend in my district, Sharon Lollio. 
Sharon is working tirelessly to plan a Michigan Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial Monument in our capital city of Lansing.
  This is important because Michigan remains one of the last States to 
have a law enforcement memorial, and Sharon is making it her mission to 
see that this important project does not fall by the wayside by raising 
awareness to the issue of violence against law enforcement and the 
importance of honoring the fallen through a permanent memorial in 
Michigan's Eighth District.
  Once constructed, the memorial will be a place of quiet refuge for 
Michigan residents to reflect on the ultimate sacrifice made by the men 
and women who keep us safe.
  We have lost many Michigan officers in the line of duty over the last 
few years, and we owe it to them, their families and friends, and the 
entire law enforcement community to honor them with this special 
tribute.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend Sharon Lollio for her hard work raising the 
funds and awareness for the Michigan Law Enforcement Officers Memorial 
Monument. I thank Sharon for her enduring commitment to our men and 
women in blue and their loved ones.
  I am grateful to all those who put their lives on the line to protect 
our community.
