               FIREFIGHTER SCOTT DEAN, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the hot Texas sun set in the west 
last night at about 10 p.m., the brave first responders of the San 
Antonio Fire Department answered the alarms as a strip mall went up in 
a fiery inferno. Sixty-one fire trucks with lights and sirens sped to 
the scene. The firefighters dashed into the buildings performing a 
search-and-recovery operation, making sure no one was there.
  As the fire grew, the intense smoke and heat became suffocating. Two 
firefighters were injured, but their lives were saved by other 
firefighters. But Firefighter Scott Dean was trapped in the inferno. 
This 6-year veteran of the force's life was stolen by the hellish 
blaze. He gave his life while saving others from harm.
  Texas lost another one of its finest last night. Firefighters such as 
Scott Dean are a rare and tenacious breed. They are the American breed. 
They run into the flames that everyone else desperately flees from.
  Firefighters restore order from chaos, answering the alarm. Mr. 
Speaker, they always answer the alarm.
  It has been said that all people are created equal, but a few turn 
out to be firefighters. One of those rare breed was firefighter Scott 
Dean. So the last alarm has sounded for Scott Dean. He answered the 
call, and he gave it all for the people of San Antonio, Texas.
  And that is just the way it is.
