11188,topic-id,3352,"Mr.President, tonight the Senator from Maryland, Mr.Cardin, and I and a bipartisan group of U.Senators, have submitted a resolution reaffirming the strong alliance between the United States and I wish to speak about that for a few minutes.  I don't know what happened during last week's telephone call between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Australia, but I do know this: The people of the United States do not have better friends than the people of  We are more than friends. As one Australian told me when our family lived there thirty years ago, ``Well, we're mates all right. The English may be our ancestors but you Americans are our cousins. First cousins. We started out the same kind of people. Underprivileged, a long way from home, doing the same kind of thing, looking for a new life. Found a hard life. Hoped it would be a better one for our children. Each wave of new ones lifted up the last ones. A pioneering spirit in the countryside here. In America, too.''  Even though they live down under on the other side of the world, for a century Australians have stood with us every time we are at war, and we have stood with them. During World War II, when Australian troops were fighting in North Africa and Europe, and the Japanese were bombing Darwin four times a day, the United States came to the rescue. In 1992, Dick Cheney and I, as members of President George H.Bush's Cabinet, traveled to Australia to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, when the U.Navy stopped Japan's advance. Today, no two countries trust one another and cooperate in security arrangements more than Australia and We trade, we visit one another, and our[[Page S749]]students study in each other's universities.  Thirty years ago, our family lived an American dream and we moved to We arrived on Australia Day, January 26, 1987, 199 years after the first fleet of English settlers sailed into Sydney After 8 years of swiveling in the Governor's chair, on the very day I was sworn out of office, my wife Honey and I and our four children flew to Sydney for Six Months Off in the ``Land Down Under.'' It was my wife's idea: an opportunity for a retreat from the merry-go-round of power and to discover what really was important.  We rented a home in view of the most beautiful harbor in the world, bought an Australian car, and I learned to drive on the wrong side of the road. Our four children walked to Australian schools, and we all sank deeply into the culture of America's favorite cousins. I attended Chester Arthur Society meetings, where Australian Parliament members competed to show that they know more about American history than United States Senators do. We spent the night in the South Wales bush. We saw 9-foot crocodiles in the Northwest We traveled by train to see the Melbourne Zoo and took a horseback trip across the Snowy It didn't take long for us to understand what Mark Twain meant when he wrote: ``When a stranger from America steps ashore in Sydney . . . the thing that strikes him is that it is an English City with American trimmings.''  We made friends then that exist to this day. Last year, four of those friends, the Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr and the Australian Ambassador to the United States Kim Beazley and their wives, spent the weekend with us at our home outside the Great Smoky Mountains in We cherish those friendships and our country's relationship with It is always appropriate for the U.Senate to reaffirm the importance of that relationship, and I am glad to join Senator Cardin and a long list of bipartisan U.Senators to do that again today.  To offer a more complete understanding of what makes the Australians our favorite cousins, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record chapter 30 from my book ``Six Months Off,'' written after our time in  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Chapter 30--First Cousins       ``When a stranger from America steps ashore in Sydney . . .      the thing that strikes him is that it is an English city with      American trimmings.''--Mark Twain, Following the Equator       You would have thought the Sydney taxi driver, who was      English, was speaking of his barely grown-up stepchildren.       ``They hate the English, the Why? Because they      realize we're superior. Minute they find out you're from      England they've got a chip on their shoulder. It's the      convict thing--you know they came from convicts. It's the      darndest thing I've ever gotten myself into. I've been here      four years and now I've got a superiority complex.''       The taxi paused at the entrance to the harbor bridge, but      no one was waiting to take the toll. I had read in the      morning Herald how toll-takers were striking in support of      the postal workers, who had stopped carrying mail while they      bargained for a pay increase. We sped on across without      paying and the genealogy lesson continued. ``Master the      little quirks of living here and you know it's not a bad      place, but the Aussies still need convincing of the fact.      They'll find their own identity one day. Then they won't have      to come on so strong. Over the years England ruled a bit too      heavily here, but the Aussies are their own people now. They      don't have to always prove themselves to anybody, but they      do.''       The Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton Wentworth Hotel was      crowded with guests, black-tied and long-gowned for the      Australian-American Bicentennial Honey and I found      our places and introduced ourselves and found that the other      ten who were dining with us at large round table number 27      were all We sat down and then were immediately      invited to rise so that the American ambassador could toast      the queen of The governor-general of Australia      responded with a toast to the president of the United States,      and we sat again.       ``He is the only man in Australia for whom everyone will      always stand,'' explained the lady on my right, as the      governor-general began speaking so gently that the raucous      table talk in the ballroom quieted.       ``It is a happy accident of fate that the Constitution of      the United States was being signed in 1787 just as our first      fleet was sailing eastward across the Atlantic from Rio to      Cape Town on the third leg of its ten-months long voyage. The      fleet carried a cargo of convicts who would have been on      their way to Georgia had not the American Revolution      succeeded and denied the British the opportunity to send      their prisoners to America.''       The lady on my right, who wore a white dress and dangling      gold earrings, whispered, ``It's the 'in' thing now, you      know, to trace back to see if your ancestors were on the      first fleet. A lot of people have always known they were      descended from lawbreakers, but very few had been willing to      spend money to prove it.''       The governor-general was proceeding toward a triumphant      conclusion. ``The links between our two nations have evolved      from earliest times. Out pioneers, like yours, were as      unlikely a band as one could conceive. Your gold rush spilled      into ours. Our constitution has been built on yours. Our      soldiers have died together and we have shared freedoms of      speech and of associations and of laws and of humanities and      of civil liberties--and now both of us are a melting pot. We      read your prose, we speak your poetry and watch your plays      and films. We even watch your terrible TV dramas!''       Applause and generous expressions of affection erupted all      around, and the governor-general smiled, cautiously      retreated, and sat, and Dame Leonie Kramer of the University      of Sydney rose and strode to the microphone and spoke      bluntly.       ``We are profoundly interested in one another, but we are      more profoundly ignorant. Americans, for example, are      enchanted that this is the land of the crocodiles but they      don't seem to have enough sense to stay out of the water when      they are here.''       Dame Leonie Kramer then sat, and our table plunged into      grilled fresh fish and boiled asparagus tips and hot      conversation.       The car dealer on my left said, ``When I was in America,      they thought we had roos hopping in the streets and crocs in      the swimming pools and abos behind the fences.'' His short-     cropped hair and narrow tie and innocent eagerness would have      made him a perfect candidate for the role of father in a      1950s American family television series.       His plumpish wife agreed. ``Most Americans can't find      Australia on the map, and even when they do you always have      to prove to them that it's as bi as the United States.''       Her husband laughed. ``One bloke coming to the America's      Cup almost went back when he found out Perth is as far from      Sydney as L.is from New York.''       A tanned young blond woman, sitting between the car dealer      and me, said, ``I was skiing in Denver once, was on the lift,      and an American man was in the next seat and he was trying to      come on to me, and so he asks me, `In Australia it's summer,      isn't it?,' and I say `Right.' And then in a minute he says,      `And what month is it in Australia?'''       The Australians especially enjoyed that, which encouraged      the blonde, who turned to me and asked, ``How do you like      Australia?'' She asked this in the same worried way      Californians used to question visiting New       I said, ``It's beautiful and friendly, but what surprises      me is how much like America it is. Sometimes I think I'm at a      family on another planet.''       The blonde said, ``It is another planet, orbiting in sight      of the big ones but never to be one.''       The plumpish wife of the car dealer agreed. ``We always      seem to be missing something.''       I said, ``But, for an American, coming to Australia is      almost better than going home again. When you try to go home      again it's a disappointment. It's only nearly perfect. But      when you come to Australia it's such a pleasant surprise how      nearly perfect it is.''       The car dealer said, ``I reckon everyone in America must      have heard about your family reunion. Three hundred thousand      of 'em coming this year. That's what the telly said.''       The lady in the white dress and earrings on my right asked,      ``Isn't Australia just the flavor-of-the-month in America?      Couldn't we just as well be Timbuktu?''       ``It's more than that,'' her thin and red-faced husband      said. He was a member of       Honey, who was sitting on the right of the member of      Parliament, suggested, ``Some Americans come here looking for      `The America that Was.' ''       The M.said, ``Some of us hope America is the ``Australia      the Might Be.' ''       The car dealer leaned across the table and said to them,      ``And you'll both be disappointed. Australia's the land of      bushmen and sheepshearers and croc hunters in about the same      way America's the land of Hopalong Cassidy and the cowboys.''       His plumpish wife supported him. ``Crocodile Dundee's a      fairy tale, isn't that right? And America's not really like      Miami Vice.'' She didn't seem entirely sure.       I said, ``Sometimes we don't know so much about ourselves.      Sometimes we're visitors in our own countries.''       Waiters arrived with plates of an Australian dessert called      a Pavlova--whipped cream and fresh papaya in meringue shell--     and exclamations over its fluffiness only temporarily      diminished the conversation.       ``Well, we're mates, all right.'' The car dealer could not      tolerate a lull. ``The English may be our ancestors, but you      Americans are our cousins''.       ``First cousins,'' said the thin, red-faced member of      Parliament, whom I sensed correctly was preparing to make a      statement. ``We started out the same kind of people,      underprivileged, a long way from home, doing[[Page S750]]     the same sort of thing, looking for a new life. Found a hard      life. Hoped it would be better for the children. Each wave of      new ones lifted up the last ones. A pioneering spirit in the      countryside here. In America, too.''       ``I love America!'' exclaimed the wife of the Australian      bicentennial chairman who was sitting across the table. Her      cheerful face had been hidden behind an enormous centerpiece      of flowers. ``When they sing `New York, New York' I get      excited with the best of 'em. It's our second home. It opens      your eyes a bit, doesn't it, to get out of your own      country.''       ``When you do, we look awfully small.'' The speaker was a      dour bald gentleman sitting next to her, who might have been      seventy, a plywood manufacturer who was rather obstructed by      the centerpiece. For the moment, he held the floor. ``Our GNP      is about the size of the GNP of Los Angeles.''       The blond woman said, ``Australia's a village, same names      always popping up.''       The plywood man said, ``Americans have got a head start and      size and location and better education, and they have more      self-confidence.''       This resonated with the blond woman's male guest, whose      name I never got in all the din and who now decided to talk      to me. ``We follow You regulate the stock market, so      we do it, too. You change school curriculum. We do it, too.      Don't think about it. Just do it.''       ``We'd have been better off to start with pilgrims and a      revolution, instead of convicts,'' said the plywood      manufacturer.       ``We could have used an Alamo,'' suggested the car dealer.      ``We had Gallipoli,'' said the blonde's friend.       ``Wouldn't it have been nice to have something in the      center besides a red desert?'' sighed the plywood man's wife.       The last of the fluffy Pavlova had been scraped from the      plates, and the coffee and mints arrived.       The young blond woman suddenly turned to me and insisted,      ``I reckon I ought to have a quarter of a vote every time you      elect a president. I should. After all, we sit here half our      time waiting for American to do something. Our prime minister      can't make a deal with No one's wondering what      Australia's trade policy will be. We have to depend on you.''       ``We already do,'' said the member of ``Do      what?'' asked the blonde.       ``Depend on For defense. For things we really      enjoy. Ask any of our school kids. I've done it. `Where would      you like to go on this planet?' and nine out of ten say,      `Disneyland.' The script for every Australian Tonight show      was prepared by an American until recently.''       The car dealer was saying to Honey, ``We never can have      anything like the things that you have in There're      not enough of us Disneyland and interstate      highways--things that are ordinary to you--are a wonder to      us. Space stations. All the museums in Washington, D.C.''       ``Another reason we can't is what's happening on Pitt      Street,'' intoned the plywood manufacturer.       ``The esplanade work?''       ``The lack of it. Did you hear the workers complained about      passersby harassing them for leaning on their shovels? And      that yesterday the arbitration board awarded them a twenty-     seven-cent wage increase because of the harassment!''       The blond woman's date said, ``Watch them on MacQuarie      Street, at the restoration, the workers smearing suntan oil.      It would make a good frame for `still life.' I watched them      from my club window yesterday at lunch.''       The car dealer said, ``Sunday's Herald said United stewards      works twice as much as Qantas stewards.''       I said, ``You see that on flights to The same Qantas      crews going up on Monday and coming back on And      last month the Bridgestone Tire Company president told me his      tire plants work three hundred forty-five days in Japan and      America, and the Bridgestone plant in Adelaide works only two      hundred ten.''       The plywood man looked positively funereal. ``We're      unusual, all right. We pay double time for afternoon work,      for overtime, for vacation. We pay for days off on a      butchers' picnic and a bakers' picnic--everybody has a picnic      and we pay for that. How are we going to compete with the      rest of the world when we're on a picnic?''       Now the men were enjoying long cigars and the ladies were      doing their best to survive the haze, and my watch said the      dinner had already lasted three hours.       Honey said. ``I see a lot of Japanese cars and American      fast foods, but I don't hear much proper Is it      because I'm American and just don't notice it?''       ``It's because we've changed,'' said a lady across the      table who up till now had been mostly listening. ``We moved      here in 1978. We decided Sydney winters were better than      English summers, so we sold our house in Then,      Australians still spoke of `going home' to Now, no      one talks about `going home.' Australianness is coming out      all round. We're more American, too, but mainly we're prouder      of being Australian.''       The wife of the member of Parliament said to Honey, ``Read      our children's books. I'll send you some for your children.      Instead of stories about English hobgoblins, there are more      about aborigine spirits and stories full of the sounds of      frogs croaking and of the didgeridoo, hostile and growling      like the bely of the earth.''       Honey said, ``The new Sheraton in Yulara was lovely, brown      like the desert and built like sails.''       The wife of the M.said, ``Our Australianness came out      all right when they tried to kill the brumbies in the Snowy      Put a stop to that.''       Honey said, ``We've seen a lot of Australia in David      Williamson's plays and Mary Gilmore's poetry and Ken Done's      bright splashy painting . . .''       ``. . . and Fred Elliot's old marine watercolors even if he      was drunk a lot,'' I added.       The wife of the plywood manufacturer said, ``And I believe      we're learning that our harsh vast spaces and distance from      everyone sometimes can be a wonderful advantage.'' Those were      the first words she had uttered in nearly two hours.       From behind the centerpiece of flowers came the cheerful      contribution of the wife of the bicentennial chairman.      ``Eight hundred ten of our eight hundred thirty shires have      bicentennial committees.''       The member of Parliament added, ``At least now we toast the      queen of Australia instead of the empire.'' His wife, on my      right with white dress and earrings, asked me, ``Have you      tried the wichety grubs, the moth larvae the abos used to      eat? They're all the rage. Large and crispy and in all the      best restaurants.''       ``No,'' I said, ``but I have been to the beaches and I have      thought about those convicts who were laughing at the      aborigines standing there sandy and naked and greasy. Now,      the descendants of some of those first-fleet convicts are on      the same beaches, sandy and naked and greasy.''       The member of Parliament had arranged himself into speaking      position. ``The English left us. We didn't leave      them. They joined the Common Gave us five years to      adjust our exports.''       This roused the car dealer, who said, ``It goes back to the      last war. Churchill said, `Let them have We'll win      it back.' Our boys were on the other side, fighting in North      Africa and in Europe and the Japanese were bombing Darwin      four times a day. The Americans saved us.''       His wife, who was finishing off his mints, too, agreed.      ``Two Christmases ago there were ten thousand American      sailors in Perth and some family took every one of `em home      for the holidays.''       The lights dimmed and the official bicentennial film began.      Trumpets heralded the arrival of the first fleet of      ``settlers'' on Australia's Identity Day, January 26, 1788,      and violins moved the story quickly along into the nineteenth      century, and then lingered amid the excitement of the gold      rush at       I whispered to the wife of the member of Parliament, ``It      didn't mention that the `settlers' were convicts.''       ``No worries,'' she said. ``The first bicentennial logo      forgot Had to make a new one. But it's a good      thing, our bicentennial. Helps us remember important      things.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgS748.txt,1695,GRIFF,2017.0,6.0,February
11135,topic-id,184,"Mr.Speaker, since January I have received hundreds of messages from constituents who are panicked that they will lose healthcare coverage with the Republican plan, where people will pay more for less.  Although the talking points of the Republican plan references access to health care, care will only be accessible for people with enough money to pay.  A message I received from Vera Caldas:       My husband has leukemia, and if it wasn't for the ACA, he      would be dead by now. I am living in fear that if he loses      ObamaCare, that will mean his death sentence since he won't      be able to afford insurance to continue his treatment.  A message from Lee Portillo:       The ACA allowed my wife to start her Silicon Valley beach      business in Venice, California and still have access to      health care.

11328,topic-id,643,"Mr.Speaker, it is heartening that a few of our Republican colleagues are urging caution on the recklessapproach to repeal the Affordable Care They are acknowledging that the only reasonable way to proceed--if that is theobjective--is to, at the same time that they repeal, provide the American people with a replacement, a replacement that meetstheir criteria.  One reason they have not done so is that Republicans don't really agree, don't really know how to do that. The new Presidentpromises that a repeal-and-replace program will be better. It will have lower costs and better coverage--a tall order--and we haveseen no details.  The troubling fact for the Republicans bent on repealing the Affordable Care Act is that the ACA is working, and most of themajor provisions are wildly popular: no lifetime limits on health care; no denial for preexisting conditions to almost 130million Americans who would otherwise have their health care at risk; allowing children to stay on their parents' healthinsurance until they are age 25; not charging women higher premiums than men simply because of their chromosomes.  These elements are absolutely essential going forward, and the American public wants this to continue. Sadly, even if theydo slow down and try to do it right, there is much damage that is being done with the uncertainty in the air. They haveunsettled 18 percent of our economy--over $3 trillion of annual expenses--disrupting the 6 years of progress in making the systemwork better.  I have been talking to people in my community, finding out about some of the damage that is being done, their concerns andapprehensions. The largest employer in the city of Portland is Oregon Health & Science They already have feltcompelled to implant a hiring freeze, dial back some of their programming, trying to reconfigure, preparing for the worst.  The local government, partnering with the private sector to treat the poor and the elderly, people with mental healthissues, are having their important reforms put at risk, and they are scrambling to try and figure out how to do it.  The State of Oregon, not unlike many States around the country, is facing some budget challenges, and there is a $1.7billion question dealing with the uncertainty going forward with  Rural hospitals are especially vulnerable, and they will explain it to any Congressman who chooses to ask. Most importantfor many of them is the fact that this approach that is being pursued on Capitol Hill with this question mark puts at risk oneof the greatest achievements of the Affordable Care The vast amounts of money spent on uncompensated care, charity care,has been dramatically reduced. People are getting their health care earlier, and it is being paid for. And those uncompensatedcare levels are falling dramatically. They are getting better care, more timely.  The health providers in my community are concerned they are still going to have to provide the care, but it will be donelater in an emergency room, not in a clinic setting, and they are left holding the bag financially. It is not hard to find outhow damaging this approach has been.  Certainly, the Affordable Care Act could use refinement and improvement. We have been trying to do that for the last 6years. The local medical associations, community clinics, hospitals, health plans are all willing to say how that could be done;but at the same time, they will explain what is at risk and why we owe it to them and the people we serve to understand thedamage that is being done and try and minimize it.  The course that is being followed will make America sick again, and that is not the way to start a new administration, a newWe should do what we should have been doing for the last 6 years: working together, cooperatively, to build upon,refine, and improve the Affordable Care Act and give the American public the health care they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH394.txt,99,THE,2017.0,12.0,February

11309,topic-id,602,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, H.274, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Congressman Seth Moulton of Mr.Will Hurd of Texas and Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina have all come together on this bill. It is a good bill.  This bill came up in the 114th The same bill passed through the committee by regular order, and then in a close vote--much like the Clemson-Alabama game last night--when we voted on this bill last session was 415-0. I think there was a pretty good sense from the past Congress that is a good bill, and it should pass.  Federal employees' current transportation options on official travel are limited. While some agencies allow employees to be reimbursed for the use of sharing economy services, such as Lyft or Uber, not all of them do. As a result, the whole Federal Government does not benefit from the cost savings that can occur while being associated with these services.  The Modernizing Government Travel Act allows the Federal Government to reap the benefits of the sharing economy. The bill ensures that new transportation services as they emerge, Federal employees can quickly take advantage of the efficiencies of the new technologies that may be offered.  By opening up a new market for transportation services, H.274 will also help spur innovation and competition, creating greater cost savings. We have some 2 million Federal employees. So this is an important part and it shouldn't be glanced over. There could be considerable savings along the way.  We must ensure that there is accountability for travel expenditures. Our committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and other watchdog groups outside of government are looking at these expenses. We have a duty and obligation to ensure that we are dealing with Federal taxpayer dollars responsibly. This bill mandates that agencies report their travel costs for each type of travel service to the General Services Administration, the The GSA must publish that data, helping make the Federal Government more transparent and accountable. The GSA will also report to Congress on agency official travel costs in order to make sure that they inform future transportation policy decisions. I urge passage of the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I was trying to think of a BYU football analogy to go with the Clemson-Alabama analogy, but I haven't been able to come up with one yet. I will work on it.  I rise in support of H.274, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, as amended. I appreciate the good work of Representatives Moulton, Hurd, Meadows, Bustos, and Swalwell on this bipartisan measure.  H.274 would expand the transportation options for Federal employees on official government travel by allowing them to be reimbursed for the use of ridesharing services such as Uber and This bill would also allow for the use of future mobility technologies not yet known or available to be covered as by reimbursable travel expenses. The General Services Administration would be directed to issue implementing regulations. The bill would require Federal agencies to submit to GSA detailed information on their travel costs, including breakdowns of costs by transportation type by November 30 of each year.  GSA would be required to submit annual reports to Congress containing an analysis or survey of agencies' travel costs as well as descriptions of new or revised regulations.[[Page H280]]  H.274 is a commonsense, good government bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH279.txt,1956,NORTH KOREA STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM DESIGNATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,January

I appreciate what Mr.DeSaulnier and our ranking member on our committee, Mr.Cummings, have done, too, to help move this bill forward.  So there was good, broad, bipartisan support, strong support in the 114th Congress, passing unanimously, with 415 votes. I think it is worthy to bring this up early in the Congress and get on with the idea of saving money and taking advantage of technology, as Mr.Hurd said and as Mr.Moulton talked about as well, save some money and tap into the technology that is available to save money for the government and, ultimately, for the taxpayers. It is their money indeed. So I would urge its passage.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

11148,topic-id,859,"Mr.Speaker, the form of the remainder of the resolution is as follows:  Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the executive branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first;  Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President after Richard Nixon has disclosed their tax return information to the public;  Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information including whether the candidate paid taxes, what they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have made any charitable donations, and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes;  Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the President's financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed, and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures, or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians;  Whereas, it has been reported that President Trump's close senior advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and General Michael Flynn, have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their ties to the Russian Federation;  Whereas, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax, a Russian media outlet, on November 10, 2016, that ``there were contacts'' with Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, and it has been reported that members of President Trump's inner circle were in contact with senior Russian officials throughout the 2016 campaign;  Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world;  Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses;  Whereas, the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics said that the President's plan to transfer his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is ``meaningless'' and ``does not meet the standards that . . . every President in the past four decades has met'';  Whereas, the the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state'';  Whereas, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has hired a ``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate high-priced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations;  Whereas, the Trump International Hotel could receive up to $60,000 from the Kuwaiti government for a party it held at the hotel on February 22, 2017;  Whereas, the President used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have allowed him to avoid paying federal taxes for 18 years;  Whereas, the public still does not have a thorough understanding of the influences and conflicts President Trump has due to his various foreign and domestic business interests;  Whereas, on January 30, 2017, President Trump publicly issued an executive order announcing that pipeline makers in the U.must use American-made steel in their projects;  Whereas, on March 3, 2017, President Trump quietly reversed himself, issuing an order allowing the steel for the Keystone pipeline to be imported from foreign countries;  Whereas, without direct knowledge on the conflicts this President has due to his business interests, he could be advancing policies that create an uneven playing field for working Americans;  Whereas, the public should be able to examine his business interests, relationships, and conflicts to ensure that all policies put forward by the Trump administration solely benefit the American public and not his corporate business partners;  Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President's tax return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause, with 1,082,000 signatures as of the date of this resolution;  Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President's tax returns under Section 6103 of the tax code;  Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public;  Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;  Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise:  Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives shall:[[Page H2069]]  One, immediately request the tax return information of Donald Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives;  Two, support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns.

11151,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, under rule IX, clause 1, questions of the privileges of the House are ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''  I would argue there is nothing more of a threat to the integrity of the House of Representatives than ignoring our duty to provide a check and balance, as our Founders expected of us, of the executive branch.  To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request President Trump's tax returns and give the American people the transparency that they deserve.  The American people know full well the scope of the President's financial background, as related by television and the media; but they don't know the details.  Article I, section 9 of the Constitution includes a clause prohibiting foreign emoluments to the The Office of Government Ethics has warned us about the President's decision not to divest or set up a blind trust, and there is a need to fully understand the President's ties to  Mr.Speaker, we are seeing the President saying one thing, such as mandating the use of American-made steel on American pipelines, then quietly reversing himself to allow the use of foreign-made steel on the Keystone Pipeline, which is being built by a Canadian company.  The resolution I am offering can provide the transparency to help ease the concerns of Americans in every corner of our country. The Internal Revenue Code includes language laying out a path for the Ways and Means Committee to obtain the tax returns and review them in a respectful way. There is the precedent that I have stated earlier that provides for this to be used.  A growing number of Members and Senators from both parties have been saying we should have the President's tax returns. One of those is Congressman Steve Knight of California who announced to his constituents that the President's tax returns should be made public, so I look forward to his support of this resolution.  The House must demonstrate that its Members are listening to our constituents' concerns. The House must demonstrate that it cares about protecting the integrity of the House, of our government, of our Constitution, of our system of checks and balances. Let's shine a bright light on the President's conflicts together.  We, as the elected Representatives of our constituents and the broader American public, can judge whether his decisions are being made for himself,[[Page H2070]]his business, or for the greater good of the American people.  At the end of the day, if President Trump has nothing to hide, then he should be willing to do what every President since Richard Nixon has done, and that is, release his tax returns.

In the years since the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution was founded on October 11, 1890, the organization has kept its focus on the preservation and promotion of the ideals, principles, and values that are reflected in our Charters of Freedom--the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of They knew what a great gift we have been given with our citizenship in the United States of America and they wanted to show their great pride in those who had fought for our freedom as a nation and won it.

Year after year, more and more people are drawn to join the DAR and help to promote the principles and values of our That is why it is really no wonder that the DAR can now boast of over 185,000 members all over the world.

11203,topic-id,2268,"Mr.President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for March 2017. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the[[Page S1537]]amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, 3. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act,  My last filing, which was based on enforceable levels relative to the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution, 11, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.114-74, can be found in the Record for November 16, 2016. The information contained in this report for fiscal year 2017 is current through February 27, 2017.  Tables 1-3 of this report are prepared by my staff on the Budget  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, All committees are in compliance with their allocations assumed in the budget resolution and match the levels that I included in the allocation enforcement filing of January 17, 2017.  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for fiscal year 2017. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the As the Federal Government is currently operating under the terms of the latest continuing resolution and temporary funding is not included in enforcement totals, this scorecard shows $543.5 billion in security and $415.2 billion in nonsecurity budget authority remain available for full-year appropriations.  Table 3 tracks compliance with the fiscal year 2017 limit for overall changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPS, in appropriations bills, established in the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. The limit for this fiscal year is $19.1 billion. To date, there are no recorded CHIMP entries on this scorecard. Division A of the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, P.114-254, included a qualifying CHIMP, $170 million, but the Appropriations Committee included a provision to prevent its budgetary effects from being entered onto the scorecard. This exclusion was the first of its kind since the creation of the new rule in 2015. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 of that resolution.  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting tables from CBO, which I will use for enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017. This information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the  For fiscal year 2017, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the latest continuing resolution that provides funding through April 28, 2017. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views current-law levels as being $953 billion and $583.2 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are consistent with the levels assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in 3.  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. Following passage of the budget resolution in January, I reset the Senate's PAYGO scorecard to zero. Since passage of the resolution, there have been no laws enacted that have a significant effect on the Federal Government's budget deficit over either the 6- or 11-year periods. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 201 of 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.  Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor. No budget points of order have been raised since the passage of the budget resolution.  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.

11216,topic-id,631,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am really pleased to rise today in support of this legislation, the Energy Efficient Government Technology  I want to thank my colleague and friend, Mr.Olson, for his wonderful description of the bill and his important support of it. I want to thank the new chairman of the full committee, Mr.Walden, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr.Pallone, for their support, and my legislative partner, Adam Kinzinger, for his partnership on this bill.  I hope that this, the 115th Congress, is going to be the magic charm. I have introduced this bill now in three Congresses, and it passed in each Congress, but it didn't make it to the President's desk. I hope this time it will.  The bill is really a very simple one. It is about bringing the Federal Government's IT and data centers into the 21st century. The Federal Government is the Nation's largest energy user. I want to say that again. The Federal Government is our Nation's largest energy user, and we should lead by example in this area.  By requiring Federal agencies to utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies, this bill will reduce the government's energy use. Very importantly, it is going to save taxpayer dollars, and it is going to also set an example for the private sector.  Today, the world generates more data in 12 hours than was generated in all of human history prior to 2003.  I can tell by the look on your face, Mr.Speaker, that that takes your breath away.  This data must be stored and processed at data centers, which are the backbone of the 21st century economy, but can be highly energy inefficient. While we now routinely hear about data centers, this was not the case when I began examining this issue over a decade ago. In those days, I had to explain to my colleagues what a data center was.  In 2005, I offered language in the Energy Policy Act which mandated an EPA study on the energy use and energy costs of data centers. This report was then transmitted to Congress in 2007, and today most Americans understand that data centers are a critical part of our national infrastructure and are found in nearly every sector of our economy.  According to the GSA, the Federal Government, alone, has more than 2,000 data centers which store everything from Social Security and tax records to e-books at the Library of  Several Silicon Valley companies have taken the lead in developing efficient, sustainable data centers, but we can do much, much more across the private sector and the government.  The Department of Energy estimates that the 70 billion kilowatt hours of electricity that are used by U.data centers annually could be slashed in half simply through implementation of best practices and existing technologies.  This bill, H.306, will drive energy efficiency improvements across the government's IT and data centers by requiring Federal agencies to, number one, utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies; two, formulate specific goals and periodically review their energy efficiency--it[[Page H268]]is very important to track the efficiencies--and, three, make government center data energy usage statistics public in a way that empowers further innovation.  Importantly, the bill requires government agencies to formulate specific performance goals and a means to calculate overall cost savings from implementation.  Mr.Speaker, as I said, I first introduced the legislation in 2013. It has passed the House by wide margins in each of the last two It is noncontroversial. It is bipartisan. It makes sense. I want to urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.  I thank my colleagues on a bipartisan basis at the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I reserve the balance of my time.

11199,topic-id,340,"Mr.Speaker, for the past several days, this morning during our morning-hour debate, I have been listeningto my colleagues across the aisle talking about the dire consequences the repeal of ObamaCare will have. Well, I have got totell you something. It is already having dire consequences. The law itself is having dire consequences.  Americans like my constituent Dotty Legg from Victoria, Texas, wrote to my office with a desperate plea to get relief fromthe effects of In 2012, Dotty's coverage was around $400 a month with a $2,500 deductible. In 2014, it went up toalmost $600. In 2015, $700 a month, and that is coverage for just one person.  Well, in 2016, Dotty's carrier told her they could no longer cover her, so she had to go somewhere else. She went to anothercarrier and they only had an option that was almost $700 a month, and her deductible skyrocketed to $6,500. That is prettyunaffordable for something called the Affordable Care  I have got to tell you, back before ObamaCare, back before the Affordable Care Act, a policy with a $6,500 deductible wouldhave been one of the least expensive policies you could have bought. It would have been a catastrophic policy. We have got tofix this.  It gets even worse. We don't see what goes on in 2017. The company is pulling out. Dotty can't find coverage at all.  The Affordable Care Act is not affordable, and it is full of broken promises. Most of the promises made were broken withIf you like your doctor, you can keep them. She hasn't been able to keep her doctor. Prices are going to go down? If you like your policy, you are going to keep it. Didn't happen.  We have got to fix this, and Republicans have a plan. We are going to work the plan. It is at better.gop. It is one of thosenew top-level domains, better.gop.

11200,topic-id,203,"Mr.Speaker, I would also like to talk about our military spouses.  We often overlook the tremendous sacrifice our military spouses make to support their husbands and wives. They often movefar from home and family to be with their spouse on military orders, but they give up their friends, the comfort of home, andeven some of their Second Amendment rights.  The Gun Control Act of 1968 limits citizens' rights to purchase a handgun by requiring that it only be bought in the Statewhere they are considered residents. Exceptions were made for Active-Duty military members but not their spouses; and that iswhy I have introduced H.256, the Protect Our Military Families' Second Amendment Rights Act, which allows spouses of Active-Duty servicemembers to purchase firearms in the State where they live under their spouse's military orders.  Military spouses should not be denied their Second Amendment rights because they choose to live with their husband or wifewhile they are deployed. Spouses have the right to defend themselves and their families, just like everyone else. While Ibelieve we must continue to push for things like constitutional carry, H.256 is a good step in ensuring Second Amendmentrights are respected.                              {time}  1030       Congratulating Coach Jason Herring and the Refugio Bobcats  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH396.txt,2067,ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF,2017.0,12.0,March

11260,topic-id,221,"Mr.Speaker, since first being elected to Congress, I have been fighting for our veterans to get the care they were promised and earned.  After hearing veterans tell horror story after horror story of long wait times, canceled appointments, and having to travel miles to distant cities to get treatment, Congress got something right when they passed the Veterans Choice and Accountability Act in 2014.  It created the Veterans Choice Program that allows any veteran who is unable to obtain an appointment with the VA within 30 days or has to travel more than 40 miles to a VA facility for care to see a private doctor who can see them faster and closer to home.  Though the implementation of the Veterans Choice Program has not been without hiccups, it is proving very helpful for getting veterans faster, more quality care.  I hear time and again from veterans in the district that I represent that this is working for them.  Soon, in fact later today, the House will vote on H.369, to eliminate the sunset of the Veterans Choice Program and ensure the program continues after August 7.  I encourage all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill to continue Veterans I look forward to continuing to hear the great successes it provides for our veterans and for our doctors.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2704.txt,2067,RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,5.0,January

However, like so many around the Nation, Carlos got involved with drugs during his time at school and even spent some time in jail. But with the strength and support of his family, he began receiving treatment, and his life improved.                              {time}  1030  He helped others by volunteering at a recovery house. He brought people suffering in similar situations into treatment programs.  In early December, Carlos walked his mother, Pamela, down the aisle for her wedding. He was getting ready to go back to school. He had a steady job, and he had a girlfriend. It would seem to so many that Carlos' battle with addiction was heading in the right direction--a needed point of hope in a war that has caused so much devastation.  Then on December 23, just 2 days before Christmas, two police detectives showed up at Pamela's door to tell her the devastating news that no mother can prepare for: Carlos had overdosed on a drug laced with fentanyl, and he was unable to be saved.  Mr.Speaker, Carlos' life and his death cast light on the fact that addiction is nothing short of a chronic disease.  I share this story with Members of this Chamber because last week Carlos' mother, Pamela, visited the White House to share her family's personal experience as the President established the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, a worthy effort that deserves our support.  The fact is our Nation's opioid crisis transcends politics, and so must our response. I applaud the President's executive order to investigate the roots of this epidemic and outline tangible actions we can take to fight back.  Any response to this challenge must treat the whole person, not just the addiction. We must focus on the underlying issues driving people to seek opioids, while increasing the accessibility and affordability for prevention, for education, for treatment, and for recovery of this disease.  As Pamela shared, every life is a precious life, and every life is worthy of being reclaimed. I agree. I believe everyone in this Chamber agrees as well.  Let's get to work together to support these brave families that need our help.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2702-2.txt,1797,RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,5.0,January

11228,topic-id,1671,"Mr.Speaker, indeed, we do have an extraordinary country. Down through the last 230 years, this Congress has met, has discussed, decided, voted upon, and set in place policies that advanced our country. And we are so very fortunate, all of us Americans, to be living here with all the promise that this incredible history has given us.  But at this period of time, we also have some profound questions about where this country is going. We wake up and we say: What is happening here? What is happening in the international scene? What is all this about Russia hacking? What is all this about trying to influence the American election? Did they really, and did it really happen, and was it effective?  Well, we know it really happened. The American public is scratching their head and they are saying: What is it?  And then all this talk about change, all this talk about we are going to change things; we are going to repeal ObamaCare, and we are going to replace it with something great. I wonder what that might be. And I suspect all across this Nation there are men, women, families that are also wondering: What do they mean it will be great? What is it that is great?  Well, if you were to go around the Capitol, if you were to talk to Members in the House of Representatives or over in the Senate and say: So it is gonna be great; what is it?  Well, we will tell you tomorrow or we will tell you later, but it will be great.  Maybe, maybe not.  Right now, the Senate is working on a piece of legislation that will set the stage for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act--and some would derisively call it Repeal it.  Oh, yeah, get rid of that thing. But not to where it is going to be great as soon as it is gone.  Really? I don't think so.  I know that in my part of California, a lot of people--in fact, more than 20,000--don't think it is great at all. They are going to lose their health care. And there are a whole lot of seniors in my community that are going: Wow, it is going to be great.  Really?  But I will lose my annual check-up. And that awesome drug doughnut hole that was so frightening just years ago is going to come back? That is not so great.  I drove into town or into the Capitol today. I don't live so far away, but it is 20 degrees, and I decided I would rather drive than freeze. So I drove in and an advertisement came on the radio, and it said: You are going to get a trillion-dollar tax cut. The middle class will have a trillion-dollar tax cut. I said: Well, that is not what I saw last night when I read the statistics about the great repeal of the Affordable Care In fact, I read something quite different from the tax committees, from Americans, various people.  Let me put something up here. Here it is. Who gets that trillion-dollar tax cut? Who is it? Is it the middle class? Well, I don't think so, because when you look at the numbers, it goes to the very wealthy. They are the ones who are going to get the tax cut with the repeal of  When the Affordable Care Act is repealed the way it is presently going, the bill that is over in the Senate will require that the taxes that were put in place to support the Affordable Care Act and to provide insurance for 20 million people--that is both the government insurance, the Medicaid, Medi-[[Page H291]]Cal in California, and the subsidized insurance from the various programs that exist State by State--that money was raised from the wealthy.  When the tax cuts come into place, here is the real story. The top 1 percent--do you remember the 1 percenters? Do you remember all that discussion about the 1 percenters and the 99? The 1 percenters get 57 percent of that trillion dollars, and everyone else gets to split the remaining 43 percent. The top one-tenth of the taxpayers in California--we are talking about the superwealthy. We are talking about the folks that are actually going to be in the President-elect's Cabinet, you know, the billionaires that he is going to put in the We are talking about those guys--oh, roughly a $200,000-a-year tax break. But after all, they are hurting. They need a few more hundred thousand dollars along the way.  So the trillion-dollar tax break that is the foundation of the repeal, if you eliminate the money, the program is not working. There will not be annual visits for seniors so that they can stay healthy, so that they can control their blood pressure, diabetes, mammograms, and all the rest that go with it. There won't be money for the 3.7 million Californians that presently are able to get coverage under the Medi-Cal program. There won't be money for the almost 2 million Californians that are in the subsidized pool called Covered That money won't be there. Those folks are going to be out.  And by the way, the repeal will remove the insurance for 30 million Americans all across the country. But who gets the real benefit here? The superwealthy, the top 1 percent will get 57 percent of that trillion-dollar tax break, and the rest of us will share in the 43 percent remaining.  Another way to look at it, folks. It will be great, but for whom? Well, if you break the American public into the five sectors, the first 20 percent, next 20, next 20, next 20, and then the top 20--so these are the real poor down here in the lower 20 percent, and these are the superwealthy in the top 20 percent.  So what happens? When you repeal the Affordable Care Act, as is now happening in the Senate--and it will be over here either this week or early next week; and then this House will take it up and it, too, will vote on that very same budget bill that will create a trillion-dollar tax cut over the next decade--who will get the money? There you go. The top 20 percent will wind up with a full 74 percent of that.                              {time}  1930  Despite that little advertisement that I heard on the radio, which said, ``Oh, the poor and the middle class are going to get it,'' really?  Let's see. Of the bottom 20 percent--6.7--oh, and the next will get 5.9 percent of it--do you have any idea what they are going to lose?  They are going to lose the subsidies on their insurance programs. They won't be able to afford it. They will lose their insurance. For some of them, they are on the Medicaid or the Medi-Cal program in California, and they will be out of luck unless, of course, the State of California can find $16.8 billion to replace the money that just disappeared with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and that money is then transferred to the top 20 percent.  These folks down here, the bottom 20 percent--actually, the bottom 60 percent of the American public are the losers.  Who are the winners?  The ones who are already able to buy insurance. I love this trick. I was the Insurance Commissioner in I loved this little trick: ``Not to worry. We are going to give an opportunity for people to buy their own insurance and give them a tax break.''  Do you mean these people down here have enough money jingling around in their pockets that they are going to be able to go out and buy the insurance and get the tax break?  Uh-uh. It is the folks up here on top who will, once again, benefit.  This really is a massive shift of $1 trillion from those people who are now insured, for those people who are now able to get care in the clinics that have been established across America--in outlying areas and in rural areas in my district. It is a massive shift from the ability of those people to get health care, for those people who are on the exchanges and are able to get subsidized insurance so that they can afford it, for those people who are seniors and are able to get their free annual checkups and have their drug costs reduced as the doughnut hole shrinks. It is a massive shift of money being taken directly out of their benefits and their pockets and going to the wealthy of That is what is happening. That is what this repeal of the Affordable Care Act is.  Then you look at the implications of that. What about the hospitals that have been able to ramp up their services? What about the reforms that were in the Affordable Care Act--the insurance reforms--that said to the insurance companies: ``Oh, no, no, no, you can no longer discriminate because that person happens to be a woman or has a preexisting condition''?  This is important, Mr.If you are scratching your head and wondering what is going on here, listen carefully because this super rapid train is about to come into the House of Representatives and sweep through here, wiping out the healthcare benefits of 30 million For those who are not directly affected, they, too, are going to wind up in a very precarious situation because the reforms will also be repealed.  Joining me tonight to discuss this and Social Security--oh, by the way, Social Security is also on the chopping block--are two of my colleagues: Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, who has been an extraordinary leader on the issues of manufacturing, of making it in America, of looking out for seniors, and for people who are in need of help and support.  Congresswoman Kaptur, would you care to join us and share with us your thoughts on what is happening in Washington?

11236,topic-id,1248,"Mr.Speaker, it is always a pleasure for me to be on the floor with Representative Tonko because of his passion, his knowledge, his ability to articulate with clarity, in this case, the importance of the Social Security program, Medicare, as well as the Affordable Care The gentleman makes a compelling argument.  I want the public of America to really grasp the importance of what is happening here in Yes, we are going to have a new President, and there will be an inaugural and all of the celebration that goes with that.  Let me put it this way: When that is done, there is a majority of the Congress and the Senate, together with the President, that fully intend to embark on unraveling the very critical safety net for more than 30 million And for everyone else who has insurance at every age--Medicare all the way down who has insurance--they will also see a dislocation and an unraveling of their insurance benefits because this market could seriously unravel. So as the gentleman said so clearly, be academic, study the facts, and study the pros and the cons of the various alternatives that are out there.  I know, as an insurance commissioner and having been dealing in the issues of health care for many years now, that there are improvements needed in the Affordable Care There is no doubt. We have been saying that since shortly after it became law. And even when it became law, I said this should be done this way or that way a little differently. We are 8 years into this and, as you say, millions, tens of millions actually--around 30 million directly--are involved and benefiting from the program, either through Medicaid, through the exchanges, or through the various benefits that are out there. So it is really, really important.  I want to also pick up on something that Representative Kaptur brought to our attention. I am going to put one more chart up here. I was surprised and a little bit appalled, just before we broke for Christmas, that the new chairman of the subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee who deals with Social Security introduced a piece of legislation. We looked at it.  It was just before the Christmas holidays, so I picked it up and started looking at it. I go: whoa, wait, wait, wait. This is a major step to unravel the Social Security system. Remember, back in the George Bush administration, in the first 3 years of his administration, he tried to privatize Social He failed miserably at that. Thankfully, he failed. Congress wouldn't stand for it. At least, the Democrats in Congress wouldn't stand for it.[[Page H294]]  I see this piece of legislation introduced in the last session, in the last days, and I am going: Whoa, what does this mean? This man becomes the chairman of the subcommittee that deals with Social Security, and I am going: oh, no, they wouldn't; they wouldn't go after Social Security again. But the bill does. It does it in a way that, once again, gives enormous benefits to the wealthy and not so much for the others.  This is a little chart about what happens if that piece of legislation by Mr.Johnson actually becomes law. These are the benefits that would be received today. In 10 years, these would be the benefits. This is the top 20 percent rather, and right here is the middle. That is about a $3,000 a year reduction.  Keep in mind that, I think, well over 50 percent of the seniors in the United States depend upon Social Security as their principal source and, in many cases, their only source of income.  So you get a decline. What do they want to do? They want to increase the age to 69 before you could apply for full Social They want to radically change the cost-of-living index. I know what I heard from my constituents when there was no cost of living over the previous 2 years--and a very small one this last year--the cost of care for seniors continues to rise because they are on the expensive side of things. There are some other provisions in it. So this is a wake-up call. This is a wake-up call.  Clearly, the majority party here in the House and in the Senate have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which we have talked about. They have also made it clear that in the past--and we believe in the months ahead--they will attempt to privatize a large portion of the Medicare program. So Medicaid will be largely gutted, and the increases that we have seen through the Medicaid program will be wiped out.  The Medicare program will have significant benefit reductions, and, if they intend to voucherize it, which they have talked about, then as Representative Kaptur said, they will throw the seniors to the mercy of the insurance companies.  My basic point tonight was to raise the alarm and to begin to discuss here amongst our colleagues the reality of what is being planned for Don't look at this as a partisan issue, Republican or Look at this as a personal issue.  Look at this as an issue that was given to me by a woman who is a farmer in the community I represent north of Sacramento who never had insurance. She was an entrepreneur, a self-employed farmer. She never had insurance. If she needed care, she would go to the emergency room. That worked when she was young, but then she became a little older, and then cancer.                              {time}  2000  The treatments for her cancers were unaffordable. She would go bankrupt. The Affordable Care Act came along with guaranteed coverage and an insurance policy through the exchange in California that she could afford that would provide her with unlimited medical services for the rest of her life. No cap, no annual cap, no lifetime cap. She got her cancer treatments, and she has moved along. She said: I still need care. And if they repeal the Affordable Care Act, I won't get it and I will die.  That story is repeated across It is repeated in my district. I can give many more examples. So this really is, in her case and in many others, a life-or-death situation. So, yes, we will be academic as Mr.Tonko has said. We should be. We should understand the implications of one policy versus another. We should understand when you start with repealing a trillion dollars of taxes, that will have a profound impact on health care in And the benefits will go to the wealthy. That is academic.  But it is also this woman, a small farmer who developed cancer. She had no hope. The Affordable Care Act comes along, and she is able to get insurance and she is able to get the chemotherapy necessary to save her life. She is back on the farm.  Repeal the Affordable Care Act and this woman, along with millions of Americans, are in serious jeopardy. So be aware. Social Security on the chopping block; Medicare on the chopping block; the Affordable Care Act is on the chopping block. Tax reductions for whom? Yes, mom and pop would get $130 a year from the tax cuts. The billionaires in the Trump administration would get $200,000 a year in tax cuts. Mom and pop are likely to lose their insurance.

The discussion today from my two colleagues here indicates another path, and that is, make it better. Make the Affordable Care Act better.

We have judges who have ceased to abide by the They have widely applied themselves as politicians, though they do not run for office.  A true judge, a conscientious and ethical judge, would review a document such as the President's executive order for what it is, what it says, what it does. Intent is not an issue. What does it do?  The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was seeking and is seeking to protect Americans, but we have judges who are not interested in protecting Americans so much as they are patronizing and sucking up to the liberals in the country: those in the media, those in entertainment, those in their highbrow circles. They are not interested in following the Constitution or the law.  We had a hearing in the Committee on the Judiciary on the Ninth Circuit this week. The Ninth Circuit apparently is the most overturned circuit in the country. It has a massive number more cases filed in their circuit than any other circuit. In fact, I have now filed a bill that would divide the Ninth Circuit so that the Ninth Circuit would be comprised of California only, and then all the other States--Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming I believe is in, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and territories--I may have missed a State, but all of the other States and territories would be in a new 12th The judges who are currently on the 12th Circuit Court in my bill--who are currently part of the Ninth Circuit would remain with the Ninth We would have a new circuit, and the judges would be appointed by the current  I know there are a lot of people in California who have great sympathy for that, have been begging for years to be carved out of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because their destructive, unconstitutional decisions are doing great harm to those who believe in the Constitution as written, not as some liberal judge thought it might should be as he tries or she tries to play up to friends at their get-togethers. They would be hailed as being so wise, but the truth is, as Scripture talks about, these are people who are wise in their own eyes, but they are doing great harm to the United States of  When anyone in any kind of leadership position loses their common sense, they are educated beyond common sense--they educate common sense completely out of some folks in the United States now--we have problems. And anytime people are educated and taught to believe that what instinctively they knew or were taught was not the right thing to think, and those people become leaders in the country, that country speeds up in its travel down the road to the dustbin of history.  No nation has ever lasted forever. No nation ever will in this world. It is not going to happen. So the question is, from its founding, how long does it go? It depends on how long the leaders of that nation can keep good sense within their consideration in making decisions. That is not happening. Good sense is not being used by judges who have assumed powers they never had, were never given.  Under the Constitution, the powers regarding refugees, immigration, those decisions are left to the Some judge may say, oh, you can't consider religion, but indeed any judge that so says is completely wrong. Thank God religion has been considered many times, as when Jews were being persecuted and killed, it was appropriate to say that we want to welcome Jews out of those horrors as refugees, bring them in. But this Nation is being put at risk by judges who are wise in their own eyes.  Now, there is an article here about the Hawaii judge. It is in The It was written by Les Carpenter, Oliver Laughland, and Liz It was written apparently before the decision was made.  ``U.district judge Derrick Watson is one of several judges hearing arguments over the ban in the final hours before its implementation. He said on Wednesday afternoon after hearing oral arguments that he would issue a written ruling before 6pm Hawaii time. Hawaii was the first state to challenge the second version of Trump's travel ban, after the first was halted by court order.  ``The state has argued that the ban is unconstitutional, and that it will suffer damage to its local economy and to various educational and religious institutions. It also argued that some Hawaiians will be prevented from reuniting with family members swept up in the ban.''  That is heart rending, but the fact is none of those are a basis for reversing a Presidential executive order that Congress and the Constitution together gave the President to issue.  We also find from comments that the courts didn't look to the four corners of the document and look what the document says because many of us know that as long as the Constitution is the foundational bedrock for the[[Page H2176]]country, we have a solid foundation. But when we have judges like this Derrick Watson or the judge from Maryland or James Robart, who issued a ban in the first travel order, when they don't pay attention to the Constitution but pay more attention to what they hear from their liberal friends who are disgusted by the elected President of the United States, and they know they will be heroes, and they long for the accolades of the intelligentsia, which actually isn't the intelligent--educated, yes; intelligent, no.  The Constitution gives certain powers to certain parts of the government. Congress has the power to make decisions on immigration, migration, naturalization, but it has the power to delegate those responsibilities as it sees fit to the President, and it has done so. The President has certain powers of his own office, of his own right to protect the United States of But these judges think that you should not consider the fact that one of the most educated people in the world on what Islam is and what it isn't says the Islamic State is He has a Ph.in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad, as I recall, and he happens to be the head of the Islamic  But the judge would have us disregard the fact that a man who spent his life studying Islam, Koran, the Holy Koran because the Koran that is brought around to some of our offices, they take out verses that have to do with violence against those who are not Muslims, but the Holy Koran he spent his life studying, but these judges would say, oh, no, no, you can't consider the fact that these radical Islamists claim to be Muslim or Islamists, you can't consider that.  One article out this week pointed out that somebody should tell these judges that the terrorists coming in from the nations designated by the President are They are not They are not They are not secularists. They are radical It is ridiculous to have to continually state the obvious that we all know, that all Muslims are not a threat to the United States, but it is absurd not to understand that those who in the name of Allah are killing, beheading, torturing, trying to destroy a free society in the name of Allah, they should not be allowed into the United If they are U.citizens and their goal is to supplant the U.Constitution with sharia law, that is treasonous.  That is why I was so pleased with President Sisi, as a Muslim leader, telling a room full of imams: We have got to stand up to the radicals who have hijacked our religion. President Obama didn't know that. He kept continuing to say that, oh, no, the Islamic State, it is not Islamic, these Islamic terrorists are not Islamic, when actually wise Muslim leaders like President Sisi, they understand, yes, these people are They claim it in the name of They claim it in the name of the Holy Koran, but they have hijacked our religion, and it is time to stand up to them. As long as we have world leaders who are, metaphorically speaking, without clothes, and nobody has the nerve among the world leaders to say: you are naked, put on some clothes. Again, for those who are educated beyond their intellectual level, that means you have got to call it like it is and don't just go along to play to the crowd, the media, the Hollywood types. Stand up and call it like it is. We have a President who is trying to do that.                              {time}  1300  There is no doubt, as Justice Scalia said about one of the ill-advised decisions previously made by the Supreme Court, this will end up costing American lives. These decisions, if they are allowed to stand, by these unconstitutional judges will cost American lives, and the blood will be on the judges' hands in their pursuit of accolades and popularity among the neo-intellectual elite. They left common sense behind and put our Nation at risk. It is tragic.  I have the two decisions from the courts--one from the District of Hawaii and one from the District of But it is interesting. In this article I was reading, Mr.Speaker, it says the judge, within just a matter of brief hours, was going to have this 42- or 43-page decision made. Let's see. This is the Hawaii decision, 43 pages. It seems to me somebody must have been working on that before oral arguments. The decision must have been worked on before that to have a 43-page decision just within a matter of a few hours.  But let's face it, the litigant surely knew before they ever had a hearing what the judge surely knew before the hearing--that he was biased, prejudiced, and was in no way going to have a fair hearing. He was going to end up ridiculing the President of the United States, and unwittingly, witlessly, putting America at risk.  We have testimony here from the FBI Director saying: We will vet these people, but we have nothing against which we can check the information they give us. Yeah, we will vet them, but we got nothing to check their information against.  As Director Comey pointed out: At least in Iraq, we had government records from Iraq, we had the criminal records. But in Syria, since the Obama administration was so diametrically opposed to the Assad administration in Syria, well, the official government certainly wasn't sharing information. And since this administration said we were going to stop the Islamic State--even though we did nothing from the administration decisions, at least, but help the Islamic State grow bigger and strong, and kept sending weapons, material to what the Obama administration thought or said were our friends and allies, but actually ended up repeatedly allowing the weaponry, the heavy artillery tanks, to fall into the hands of the Islamic State--well, the Islamic State was not sharing the information they had about the people of  And, in fact, Mr.Baghdadi made clear that they were going to get some of their best warriors mixed in with refugees, and they surely have. When you have judges who close their eyes, wet their finger, and hold it up for liberal friends to blow on so they know which direction they should move, well, we get bad decisions that put the Nation at risk.  For those of us who spent much of our lives studying history, it is very clear. Since you know no nation lasts forever, then you look at important milestones along the rise and along the demise, and these are the kind of decisions that lead to a country's demise. When you refuse to recognize what your enemies say--that they are your enemies, they are going to destroy your way of life, they are going to get refugees who are terrorists into your country--because you are so stupid you don't know how to defend yourself, you want to pat yourselves on the back for being so open-minded and open-doored that you allow your killer to come in and kill you, just like the proverbial song and tale taking in a snake, warming it, bringing it back to life, and it bites the rescuer; or the tale of the tortoise carrying the scorpion across the water and then getting stung. When people tell you they despise your way of life, they are going to bring your way of life down. When their documents tell you that they believe that you are infidels and need to be destroyed, there has to be somebody at the top of the country's leadership that understands the risk and stands up to protect the country.  And when people like these judges take the Constitution into their own hands, rip it up, and say, ``I don't care what restrictions we have on us, I don't have any restrictions, I am a Federal judge for life,'' well, that is only so long as the judge has good behavior. And these judges have not had good behavior. They have taken powers under themselves--their name might as well be Chavez or Morsi--taking power into their own hands that they were never supposed to have.  But at least in the case of Chavez and, possibly, Morsi, they won elections. There was a great deal of fraud involved in Morsi's election. It was questionable whether he actually won. The threats eliminated any contest to the election results. But the 30 million or so that went to the streets and demanded his ouster in Egypt, the greatest public step in world history, demanded the removal of an unconstitutional leader in world history. There has never been 30 million people go to the streets peaceably. It wasn't all peace. But the part that wasn't peace was caused by the Muslim That is why they have been labeled as a terrorist organization, and that is why the United States should label them as a terrorist organization.  Regardless of what anybody thinks about President Trump, his order was[[Page H2177]]an attempt to protect Americans against judges who think they are unaccountable because we haven't impeached near enough and who become dictators and seize power that was never given to them.  I have got a bill we are preparing that would eliminate any jurisdiction for any Federal court other than the Supreme Court to take up an issue involving immigration of refugees, other than immigration courts, but not on a constitutional level, not to issue an injunction to stop a congressional action or a Presidential action. That would have to come from the Supreme Court, and that is the way it ought to be.  When the Constitution was written, there was only one Federal court provided for. That was the United States Supreme Any other court that is Federal in this country owes its life, its jurisdiction, to the U.As some have said in other applications, ``We brought them into the world and we can take them out,'' as far as their courts are concerned; and we need to do that. We need to take their courts out of the business of making decisions that overrule congressional and Presidential action on refugees and our national security when it is involved with those refugees.  At a hearing that Alid Perez and Steve King, my friend from Iowa, set up and held yesterday, there were very touching stories of Christians, Yazidis, the persecution of Jews in the Middle We heard from people that know what it is to be persecuted by radical They see how stupid the policies have been in this country.  We heard from one of the people in the Homeland Security Department that with the massive millions of dollars that Congress appropriated to be used in countering violent extremism, an inarticulate euphemism, that we have spent millions on things like teaching young school choirs Muslim songs. Now, that is one of the contributing factors to the senseless Orlando killings, the San Bernardino killings, the Boston marathon killings--choirs. A contributing factor is that we have wasted millions of dollars, maybe billions, on outreach programs that should not necessarily be the role of some parts of our law enforcement.  I challenged FBI Director Mueller that they had not even gone to the mosque where Tsarnaev went to find out if his pattern had changed, if his behavior had changed, you know, if he was memorizing more and more scripture than he ever had.  We often hear after these shootings, these killings, or these bombings take place: Well, he was becoming more and more religious.  Well, that can be an indication that somebody has become radicalized. There are a number of factors.  Kim Jensen from the FBI, who prepared 700 pages or so on training people how to spot radical Islamists, well, he had his 700 pages purged from training materials for a long period of time. Finally, they realized somebody really needs to know what radical Islam is. They allowed some of the training materials to be used again--maybe all of them--but only for a limited number of FBI agents, as I understand it. We had material that was removed during the purge of our State Department, Homeland Security Department, intelligence departments, agencies, during the purge of their training materials, removed what our Federal agents need to know in order to be able to spot if somebody is no longer a peace-loving Muslim but now has been radicalized and wants to kill American infidels.  There are things that can be spotted if you know what to look for. We have people that know how to train for those things. Phil Haney with Homeland Security knew. With this scientific methodology of finding the connections between radical Islamists, as we have heard publicly, he had identified 800 who may have terrorist ties--reviewed 400, where nearly every one of them ended up being named on the terrorist watch list, but the other 400 were not ever analyzed.                              {time}  1315  No telling how many of those potential terrorist individuals may actually kill people, kill Americans some day, if they haven't already.  Although Secretary Napolitano said we get pinged and we connect the dots, yet she was Secretary when somebody high--maybe her, but probably someone else--was eliminating the dots, thousands of pages of dots, dots representing terrorist ties. They wiped them out. They erased them.  Phil Haney saw it as it was happening, was able to capture much that was being deleted, that would allow us to know who in the United States has terrorist ties. Under President Obama, our ability to identify our enemy was greatly weakened, and now we have judges that will put us even further at risk.  But you see it repeatedly through history. When a nation's leaders begin to think they are so wise, so above the fray that they refuse to recognize a direct threat to the nation, then the nation is--it speeds up its trip to that dustbin of history. My continued hope and prayer is that this administration will reverse that slide.  I know there are many that say that you have a cycle--whether it was ancient Greece, Rome, other societies--where they pursue freedom, they have some freedom, they begin to lose freedom, they fall under a dictatorship, a totalitarian regime, and then the cycle goes on. But my reading of history leads me to believe perhaps it is more like, can be like, bell-shaped curves where you can go up, create more and more freedoms, have periods where you lose freedoms, but if you have a generation or two that stands up and recaptures those freedoms, you could have another bell-shaped curve. It doesn't have to be a cycle where you completely lose your freedom. But the way we are headed, this will happen.  I was hearing from my friend Secretary Tom Price yesterday that there are 76,000 employees in Health and Human Services, and we are not talking about people that even put Band-Aids on those who need medical care. We are talking mainly about bureaucrats. That is one of the things that contributed so mightily to the increased cost of health care: so many more bureaucrats were being hired, had to be hired, more and more regulations.  You had IRS agents, by the thousands, that had to be hired in order to implement They weren't going to help anybody's health. They might actually cause problems with people's health--ulcers, at least.  But this Nation is at risk. We have gotten a reprieve, a chance to catch our breath, restore freedom.  As I have said before, for those who have read ``Nineteen Eighty-Four'' by George Orwell, the main thing that Orwell got wrong was the date, because we now have eyes in our homes wherever we are that are staring at us, allow the government to stare at us through our own computers, through our own smartphones. When watching the movie of ``1984,'' it actually is an eye like a picture, but what it really is these days, they are computer screens, smartphone screens. The government can watch any time it wants.  We were assured that the government would not be watching like that unless they followed the law or got a FISA court warrant, but Edward Snowden showed that--those of us who heard testimony and heard statements from people in authority about what they would do and not do--has been proven to be false.  That became clear to me when I saw the affidavit seeking a warrant for all of Verizon's data on all of their customers, all of their calls, all of the information, because the Fourth Amendment says it has to be with particularity. You have got to be specific, what it is you are seeking, make sure there is probable cause to believe a crime is being committed and this person committed it, and that there is evidence to show that that is being sought, and then you get the warrant.  That is the way I reviewed applications for warrants repeatedly when I was a judge, but not anymore. No, no. A guy comes in, swears to a FISA court judge that at one time I had great trust in because we were assured, hey, these are appointed--nominated, at least--confirmed Federal judges. They would never violate the Well, we found out that is just not true. They became a rubber stamp.  So the particularity in the affidavit we saw was: We need all the information on all the customers Verizon has. The FISA judge, supposedly out there to protect Americans' private information, said: Oh, well, that is particular enough. You want everything, all of the numbers, all of the information.[[Page H2178]]Okay, here is the order. Here is the warrant. Verizon, turn over everything you have got on all the numbers you have.  Well, so much for protection of our rights by the FISA court. We now know we are not protected by the FISA court. We can't trust the FISA court.  As I said in our hearing last week--well, I have said it publicly--unless our intelligence agencies produce the culprits who violated the law and did not follow the law in masking the name, minimizing the transcripts, unless our intelligence agencies can root out the people that have been violating the law, I will vote against a reauthorization of 702.  I know they say: Well, we need all of this power to keep us safe. But we have competing interests here. On the one hand, we have a government that yearns to be bigger and bigger and know more and more until it knows everything about everybody; and on the other hand, we have got people wanting to be safe and wanting their government to protect them. So there has to be a balance.  But when government officials can get every bit of information about your private life, then why do we even need a Congress? You have got bureaucrats making your decisions, know all about you. Might as well let them make the rest of your personal decisions. They know everything else you know.  So we are living in a dangerous time, but the judges have got to be reined in. I hope that my colleagues will join us in restricting the ability of a district or circuit court, any Federal court other than the Supreme Court, taking up these types of national security issues involving refugees or immigrants, because it looks like that is the best thing we can do at this time.  In the meantime, I do intend to review more information about these two judges from Hawaii and Maryland--any others that may join hands as they jump off the cliff--and see if their conduct seems to be sufficiently bad conduct to require their removal from office.  I know this will be looked at as a political thing, but it is not. We are talking about the freedoms of every Democrat, every Republican, everybody that is not identified with a party--every The judges have overtaken the  In the name of political correctness, we have ended up, apparently, according to the information that is coming out, allowing people who happen to be Muslim to have total access to our congressional computer systems. This article from March 15 in the Conservative Review by Luke Rosiak--and apparently, he has done a great deal of digging on this story. He seems to have more stories about it.  Well, let me touch on the one from March 13:  ``Congressional IT staffers who are the subject of a criminal investigation into misusing their positions had full access to Members' `correspondence, emails, confidential files,' and there was almost no tracking of what they did, a former House technology worker said.  ``Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldn't be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so Members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said.  ``Awan ran technology for multiple House Democrats, and soon four of his relatives--including brothers Abid and Jamal--appeared on the payroll of dozens of other Members''--of Congress--``collecting $4 million in taxpayer funds since 2010.  ``U.Capitol Police named him and his relatives as subjects of a criminal probe on February 2, and banned them from the complex's computer networks. But Members of Congress for whom they worked have downplayed their access or publicly ignored the issue.''  And, of course, the reason is no one wants to be seen as a racist. Islam, being Muslim, is not a race; it is a religion. And for some, it is not only a religion, it is a form of government that some--fortunately, a minority--think should replace our own  Anyway, the article goes on: `` `They had access to everything. Correspondence, emails, confidential files--if it was stored on the Member's system, they had access to it,' the former House Information Resources technology worker with first-hand knowledge of Imran's privileges told The Daily Caller News  ``Technology employees who work for Members must initially get authority from HIR, a component of the House's chief administrative officer, which maintains campus-wide technology systems.  ``There were some things--like access to the House email system that were totally controlled by the technicians at In order for certain permissions to be granted, a form was required to ensure that there was a paper trail for the requested changes. Imran was constantly complaining that he had to go through this process and trying to get people to process his access requests without the proper forms. Some of the permissions he wanted would give him total access to the Members' stuff.''  And again, he used the threat of calling someone bigoted because he was Muslim if he was not given the total access that this person now being investigated as a criminal said he needed.  And it is amazing how many people gave him the full access he wanted without the proper credentials, without the proper background investigation, because no one wanted to be called bigoted since he was                              {time}  1330  `` `IT staff at HIR can be tracked for every keystroke they make,' the worker said. But by comparison, `when these guys were granted access to the Member's computer systems there is no oversight or tracking of what they may be doing on the Member's system. For example they could make a copy of anything on the Member's computer system to a thumb drive or have it sent to a private server that they had set up and no one would know.'  ``That raises questions about why Members are so quick to brush off the seriousness of the investigation.''  Mr.Speaker, as you know, we are not hearing a lot of people talk about it. We are not seeing a bunch of stories about it. But this is critical to the ongoing of Congress' actions. You can't have privileged communications that allow us to know what is going on in the departments, agencies, over which we have oversight--you can't have access to that kind of information.  The wrong people know everybody we talk to, everything that is said. They know how to fend off and best come after They know how to manipulate us and do so so much easier and better. You don't have to be Russian, apparently, to get access to the Democratic National Committee's emails.  I am still really interested to know if any of these five who didn't have proper background investigations, that worked on so many of our Democratic friends' computer systems, if they possibly helped set up the Democratic National Committee's computer system.  `` `After being notified by the House Administration Committee, Abid was removed from our payroll.' '' This is a quote. `` `We are confident that everything in our office is secure,' Hilarie Chambers, chief of staff for Democratic Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, told  ``Multiple House IT workers said it is impossible for Members' offices to make that judgment, and that Capitol Police--who are running an investigation that involves cybercrimes and current and potential international fugitives, despite their primary duties being providing physical security--aren't capable of determining what actually occurred either.  ``The Capitol Police web page listing their authority, scope of work, and expertise does not mention the word `computers.'  ``A Fairfax County, Virginia, police report shows that the brothers' stepmother called the police on them in January, and a relative said Imran has been out of the country attempting to access assets stored in Pakistan in his deceased father's name. The relative said they forced her to sign power of attorney documents against her will.  ``After naming them as suspects in a criminal investigation, the Capitol Police have not taken their passports or arrested them. The brothers previously took a $100,000 loan from a fugitive wanted by U.authorities, Ali Al-Attar, who has fled to Iraq and been linked to Hezbollah.''[[Page H2179]]  Just gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling, Mr.Speaker, that we have got people with ties owing money to known associates of the Hezbollah terrorist organization and their having full access to Members' computers.  This says: ``Imran ran technology for Florida Debbie Wasserman Schultz--who resigned as head of the Democratic National Committee after a disastrous email hack that was blamed on Russians--and had the password to an iPad used for DNC business.  ``Politico described the investigation this way: `Five House staffers are accused of stealing equipment from Members' offices without their knowledge and committing serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network.'  ``But it later said Hill staffers were downplaying the information security component, writing, `Sources close to the House investigation said the former staffers, while able to view some Member data, did not have access to any classified information.'  ``That description rankled multiple House IT workers, who told TheDCNF those semantics misleadingly made it seem like they didn't have access to extremely sensitive information.  `` `Classified' is a terminology used by spy agencies and other executive branch agencies, not generally Congress, with the exception of the Intelligence The full email correspondence and hard drives of Members of Congress are nonetheless sensitive, extremely private, and likely to contain privileged information of the utmost import.  ``And an email need not deal with national security to open that Member to blackmail or extortion. All a rogue IT staffer would need to do was threaten to release emails that were politically embarrassing.  ``The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers' access didn't span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions.  `` `When a new Member begins, they guide them on everything from which computer system to purchase to which constituent management system to go with and all other related hardware purchases. Then they install everything and set up all the accounts and grant all the required permissions and restrictions,' the staffer said.  `` `In effect, they are given administrative control of the Members' computer operations. They then set up a remote access so they can connect from wherever they are and have full access to everything on the Member's system.'  ``Numerous Members of Congress who employed the suspects wouldn't say whether they've been fired or what steps they've taken to examine whether their information is safe.''  Spokesmen for a number of Members of Congress ``all ignored requests or refused to say.  ``The central IT worker said they were ignoring the problem in the hopes that it will go away, but that their apathy speaks to the problem.  `` `Unfortunately, as the recent election has shown, security of computer systems on the Hill is not really taken seriously.' ''  So we are told now, this article from March 15, says that the Capitol Police are getting outside help. We will see.  Might I inquire how much time I have?  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

11345,topic-id,919,"Mr.Speaker, in my remaining time, I want to address the question of  Two years ago when Joe Biden was Vice President, making him President of the Senate, there was a compromise. Instead of doing complete and full repeal of ObamaCare as Republicans have been promising for years, there was a compromise: All right. We will take out all but the regulatory authority, those things that actually caused the greatest increase and expense.  But it didn't change the fact, Mr.Speaker, that we had made a pledge to America that I didn't help write but our leaders of the Republican Party in the House did, and it said: Because the new healthcare law kills jobs, raises taxes, increases the cost of health care, we will immediately take action to repeal this law. Then it goes into some detail about that.  Then we know we had A Better Way, Speaker Ryan, our leadership, current leadership's Better And this was from June 22 of 2016.  The plan begins by laying out five principles. It begins by repealing That is all of it as its first principle. And the last sentence of the paragraph says: ``We need a clean start in order to pursue the patient-centered reforms the American people deserve.''  That is exactly right, and I was glad that our leadership of our party put that in there because we needed a full repeal.  But 2 years ago, it wasn't a complete repeal. More so than what is being done now, in what we are being told is the new bill. It was more repeal then. But even then we wanted to do a full repeal, but we were told because Joe Biden could come over from the White House, come down Pennsylvania Avenue and take the presiding officer's seat straight down the hall, that he would likely rule that other part was not in compliance with the Byrd rule.  In essence, the Byrd rule basically means, if something is merely incidental in its effect on the budget instead of a direct effect on the budget, then it may not be considered under the procedure that was being used, and that procedure only requires 51 votes.  So the thing that everybody knew back then is, if it were a Republican in the presiding officer's seat, of course, would say all of this, especially the part that was taken out, would survive the Byrd rule because it is not just an incidental effect on the budget. It is the most dramatic effect on the budget of most any bill that Congress has ever taken up--dramatic and not incidental, dramatic.  And so now we are told: Look, everybody needs to get on board with this new bill that doesn't go as far as the one 2 years ago, and it leaves all these regulations and things, all that power. 1,400 times it says the Secretary will make the rules, regulations to implement the bill. But we are being told it is okay; you don't have to knock those out because now we have Secretary Price that can do that.  Well, for one thing, if he could, then that would mean when the next Secretary of Health and Human Services comes along and it is a Democrat, you can put them all back. We hadn't done anything. We didn't accomplish anything. We just had a little breather.  But we are also told the prices will likely continue up. There may be a 10 percent drop of the two to four times the healthcare costs, health insurance costs, at least, are increasing.  But since we know it will be a Republican in the chair, then the Republican in the chair in the Senate will be free to do the right thing and say, honestly, truthfully, absolutely, the repeal of all this regulatory massive mess is dramatically going to affect the budget, not incidentally. So it survives the Byrd rule. It stays in.  There are things that are in the new bill that probably won't survive that analysis that have been added.  Why don't we do what we promised for 7 long years, repeal all of ObamaCare? But we are told there is a second bucket, a second stage, where Secretary Tom Price--in whom I have got great faith because he knows health care, he knows healthcare law--can change those regulations.  Well, we also know that this is going to be taken to court very quickly. And even I, as the conservative appellate chief justice that I was at one time, would probably look at that and say wait a minute.  The law gives you the power to create regulations to implement the bill; it doesn't give you the power to make regulations that will destroy the bill. So it won't have to be a liberal judge that can knock down regulations.  I remember my late friend Justice Scalia not talking about a particular case, but talking about the issue of when Congress doesn't do something and has a lawsuit to do it instead, Justice Scalia said: If you guys in Congress don't have the guts to stop something you have the power to stop, don't come running over to the Supreme Court to demand we do it. You do your job. That is not our job.                              {time}  1345  And this is the case with It needs to be repealed--as Mitch McConnell said, root and branch.

Adherence to decades-old policy regarding technology costs our taxpayers billions of dollars, stifles creativity, and needlessly prevents our government from utilizing private sector technologies.

Last Congress, as the chairman alluded to, this bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, 415-0.  Private sector companies have had a tremendous impact on the way that people travel, and we should allow our government to recognize these changes. By widening the scope of reimbursable forms of transportation, we are encouraging the adoption of innovative technologies and promoting competition.  The bill also requires agencies to report what type of transportation their employees are taking while on official travel, and this data will be publicly available, thus increasing transparency and accountability in how taxpayer dollars are being spent.                              {time}  1645  H.274, as amended, is a sensible piece of legislation that can help modernize our government and ensure that the United States is moving seamlessly into the 21st century.

11322,topic-id,5310,"Mr.President, I think tomorrow President Trump is going--or at least is planning--to sign an Executive order rolling back the Obama Clean Power I will have a lot to say about that, but I think it is important at an appropriate time to discuss the history of this issue. It has been going on a long time.  At the start of the 114th Congress, the Senate voted 98 to 1 in support of the Inhofe-Whitehouse amendment, stating that climate change is real and not a hoax. That is something we can actually agree on; that climate has been changing since the beginning of time, and there is all the archeological evidence, there is the Scriptural evidence, the historic evidence. Climate has been changing and will continue to change.  The hoax is that some on the far left believe man controls changes in the climate. We have endured 8 years of an administration that buys into the alarmist mentality that the world is coming to an end, and it is due to manmade gases. That is what the hoax is. Even though individuals--occasionally you will find some scientists who agree with this, but they will say that there may be some contribution, but it is minimal. It is not even measurable.  The Obama administration has used climate change as justification for taking unauthorized actions, such as the so-called Clean Power Every administrative entity under Obama was forced to embrace his climate change agenda as a top priority and used it as a convenient sounding board.  We have seen agencies such as the Department of Defense divert resources away from their core responsibilities and instead spend them on finding ways to justify statements from the President that climate change is the greatest threat, a greater threat than terrorism.  So other agencies have spared no taxpayer expense in supporting the outcome-driven science in an attempt to bolster their claims. In fact, the Congressional Research Service has reported that the Obama administration spent $120 billion on climate change issues. That is a total waste of money. I don't think anyone can tell me what that $120 billion was spent for. It was not authorized, it was not appropriated, but it was spent.  This comes from the Congressional Research So this is a total waste of money, money needed to defend Despite the administration's efforts, as research and data around climate change continue to improve, the results do not support their claims but instead call them into question. This is especially true for all of the ``hottest month'' or ``hottest season'' or ``hottest year'' in history. This is something that is often claimed by those who are reading the script and trying to make those claims.  So 2014 was previously the warmest year on record, until a reporter pressed NOAA and NASA on the claim and the agencies were forced to admit they were only 38 percent sure that claim was accurate. A December 2015 study from the American Geophysical Union concluded that after analyzing over 1,200 ground-based weather stations: ``The warmest-ever claims by government scientists are inflated due to compromised U.temperature stations impacted by encroachment of artificial surfaces like concrete, asphalt, and heat sources like air conditioning exhaust.''  Because of NOAA's methods, they failed to account for these factors. Additionally, surface thermometers continue to be at odds with satellite data, which shows essentially no warming for the past 18 years, continuing the hiatus the Economist magazine originally wrote about in 2013.  In fact, just a few weeks ago, a whistleblower alleged that a June 2015 NOAA report manipulated data in an attempt to discredit this 18-year pause. Now, the 18-year pause has been agreed to. People understand, this is what they call the hiatus. This is a time when temperature has not changed, but they have done this to influence the public debate surrounding the Clean Power Plan and the Paris climate conference. Conveniently, the computer with the data suffered a complete failure and none of the data was saved.  It is not just the inflated temperature claims that can be called into question. A growing body of scientific study suggests variations in solar radiation and natural climate variability have a leading role in climate change. That is a novel idea, that the Sun has something to do with warming. A number of the incident studies assessing the impact of clouds have even suggested that water vapor feedback is entirely canceled out by cloud processes, as global data shows no increase in the number or the intensity of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods, in spite of what they say on the Senate floor.  Even the IPCC's 2013 report concluded that the current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century. No robust trends in the annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes--major hurricane count--have been identified in the past 100 years in the North Atlantic Basin, but we still hear it over and over again.  When it comes to droughts, the IPCC report indicated that previous conclusions regarding global increase trends in drought since the 1970s were probably overstated.  The increasing observations from scientist Craig Idso suggests a much reduced and practically harmless climate response to the increased amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Further, there are benefits from the increase in carbon that have led to a greening of the planet and contributed to increased agricultural productivity. Now, this shows that the progression that has taken place--the green parts are the part where they have an increased amount of CO2 activity.  The trend is in the annual gross productivity per decade by percentage. This is from 1982 to 2011. So you can see the great benefits. In fact, many people still remind us, over and over again, that CO2 is actually a fertilizer. It helps things grow. But these points were kept out of the Obama administration's press releases, and the media has been more than willing to go along.  None of this is surprising. As I have given a lot of speeches on climate change, my message tends to be one that the alarmists on the far left do not want to hear and do not want to believe, but they have been proven wrong time and time again.  Despite millions of dollars of the Tom Steyers of the world, Americans do care about climate change, but it is not high on their list. Right now, which I will state in just a moment, some of the polling activity that has taken place has surprised a lot of people. This is Tom We keep hearing about the Koch brothers and other people who are putting money in the campaign, but Tom Steyer is the one who has said--that was his statement--that prior to the 2014 races, he was going to put $100 million in there to elect people to promote such things as Obama's plan.[[Page S1801]]  The Environment and Public Works Committee last Congress--and this is when I chaired that committee--held 10 hearings assessing the President's climate agenda, where we heard from a diverse group of expert witnesses who testified to the enormous costs, especially for low-income minority communities, the economic consequences, the legal vulnerabilities, and the miniscule environmental impacts. We had the president of the Black Chamber of Commerce, Harry Alford, come to a hearing. He was the one who talked about how disproportionate the harm is that is done to poor people. He talked about the Blacks and the Hispanics who are at risk. I will elaborate on that in just a moment.  Taking committee action is a further step that Democrats and Republicans in both Houses of Congress rejected Obama's and the radical left's key climate regulations. Then, in February of last year, the U.Supreme Court put a stay on the so-called Clean Power Plan because they too had significant legal questions surrounding the validity of this.  Well, needless to say, there is a well-documented, substantive rejection to Obama's climate actions across the institution designed to keep the executive branch in check.  I have not attended one of the United Nation's climate conferences since 2009, when I was kind of a one-man truth squad in Let me mention what this is. The United Nations, they are the ones that started the whole thing in the very beginning in talking about global warming, talking about all the problems that were out there. We have a pretty documented case. In fact, there is a book that was written--I will not mention the name of the book--that comes to the conclusion that the United Nations was right in the middle of this whole discussion as far back as 1972. So what the United Nations does is every year they have a big party. This is the big party of the year. It is in They have had 21 in 21 consecutive years.  What they do is invite everybody to come in who says that we will voluntarily reduce targets for CO2 emissions. Of course, most of them who come in are coming in to get some of the billions of dollars they say they are going to be distributing. This is really interesting because these parties--I can remember one time I was talking to someone I know from Benin in West In fact, the Chair knows this individual too. I saw him at one of these meetings. I said: Now, you don't go along with all of this.  He said: No, but this is the biggest party of the year.  So they have these every year. That is what I think is important for people to understand. Anyway, I hadn't gone to any of these since the big event in Copenhagen, but the message I carried to the international bureaucrats then is exactly what happened: Congress did not then and does not now support the radical climate change actions, and the U.role in any associated international agreement will be limited accordingly.  The outlook for environmental activists and climate change alarmists is grim. With the significant losses in the White House, the Congress, the Supreme Court, and a persistently skeptical public, their political leverage and relevance has dwindled.  For the past 8 years, the Obama administration and the American economy have suffered under the effects of the climate agenda. That era is over, and President Trump is already delivering on his campaign promises.  Just a few weeks ago, I was at the White House when President Trump signed an Executive order instructing the EPA to roll back the waters of the United States rule. This is the rule that would have allowed the EPA to regulate waters in the United I think most people know this has always been regulated by the States, but the true liberals, they want to have regulation taking place not by the States but in  A guy named Tom Buchanan is the Oklahoma Farm Bureau chairman. He was talking about all the problems farmers have throughout America, farmers and ranchers. The biggest problem they have is overregulation by the Do you know what he singled out as being the most onerous of all of these regulations? It was the regulation on water. Of course, I was in there when the President did away with that particular rule.  As I previously mentioned, President Trump has also committed to rolling back the Clean Power Plan and its $300 billion pricetag. This rule would lead to dramatic increases in energy prices and reduce the reliability of the grid. These two rules are examples of major expansions of Federal power and a departure from the core functions and responsibilities provided by Congress to the  The steps taken by the Trump administration will return the rules of those agencies to their statutory intent. We have seen great successes in our air and water quality based on the EPA operating within its statutory limits. I can remember the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Right now, our pollution has dramatically dropped down. This is at a time when vehicle miles have actually doubled. So we are doing some things that are successful, and I look forward to continuing that success.  That is the end of my prepared remarks. I want to visit just a little bit about what is going on and what we have been doing over the last quite a few years now. I think it is important. People ask me: What are the motives of those individuals who are promoting all of these regulations that are on greenhouse gases? There has to be a motive for that.  I suggest, and this will surprise a lot of people, you go back originally--and I can remember when Koyoto first came out. Koyoto was the first regulation--they tried to get all the countries to join in. In fact, that was at a time when Clinton was President of the United States, and they were trying anxiously to get this thing--to join in the Koyoto treaty.  The ones who originally were involved in it--and I could go back to people who have forgotten about this. The former European Union Minister of the Environment, Margot Wallstrom, said: ``Kyoto is about the economy, about leveling the playing field for big business worldwide.''  Then the French weighed in; that was President Jacques He said during his speech at the Hague in November of 2000 that Kyoto represents ``the first component of an authentic global governance.''  You know, it hadn't really changed that much. Christiana Figueres was the one in charge of the Paris convention that took place where they were talking about the great successes they had there, and she said the real goal was ``to change the economic development model''--in other words, redistribute wealth among the nations.  So let's keep in mind that is what the original motivation was.  Then the United Nations weighed in. This goes all the way back to 1972. In 1972, the United Nations held a conference on human environment in Stockholm, Fifteen years later, in 1987, the U.published the report ``Sustainable development: Our Common Future.''  ``Sustainable development'' is a word that they changed--a phrase, because it is easier to sell to the public. That was 1987, and then you go forward to 1992 and the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, They announced their intention to pursue sustainable development through the Kyoto  It is kind of interesting because Reuters wrote an article in 2012 that said:       The ``sustainable'' branding for this year's summit, rather      than climate, is by design, said Ambassador Andre Correa do      Lagos, who headed Brazil's delegation to the U.climate      talks in Durban and will be a chief negotiator for Brazil in       That is behind us now, but this is an article that came out in 2012.       Sustainable development is an easier sell globally than      climate change, even though sustainable development is a way      of tackling global warming and other environmental issues, he      said.  He said the end goal is not about the environment but about the redistribution of wealth.  Again, if anyone doubts that he was accurate in that statement, the Secretary General of the United Nations at that time was Ban Ki-moon, and he proposed how the challenges must be addressed. In talking about what they were going to do at these annual meetings, he said:       More than $2.1 trillion a year in wealth transfers from      rich countries to poorer ones, in the name of fostering      ``green infrastructure,'' ``climate adaptation'' and other      ``green economy'' measures.[[Page S1802]]  So there again, after all these years, it is still about the same thing.  Now we go into more science and the different weather events. I notice when people come to the floor and they talk about all the bad weather and the hurricanes and the tornadoes and the fires and that all that is as a result of these events, I would like to remind people that George Mason University reported that 63 percent of the weathercasters believe that any global warming that occurs is a result of natural variation and not human activities.  Here is another one too. The Democrats will like this because Martin Hertzberg was a lifelong liberal Democrat, a retired Navy meteorologist with a Ph.in physical chemistry. He also declared his dissent of warming fears in 2008. This is a quote from this guy. He said:       As a scientist and life-long liberal Democrat, I find the      constant regurgitation of the anecdotal, fear mongering clap-     trap about human-caused global warming to be a disservice to      science.       The global warming alarmists don't even bother with data!      All they have are half-baked computer models that are totally      out of touch with reality and have already been proven to be      false.  That is coming from a very liberal  So you start looking at some of the things they say are linked to NOAA, the scientists, rejected the global warming link to tornado. NOAA said that no specific consensus or connection between global warming and tornadic activity exists.       According to NOAA, hurricanes have been in decline in the      United States since the beginning of records in the 19th      century. The worst decade for major . . . hurricanes was in      the 1940s.  Journal of Geographical Research: Since 2006, global tropical cyclone energy has decreased dramatically to the lowest levels since the 1970s. Global frequency of tropical cyclones has reached a historic low.  On droughts, the same thing: Severe droughts in 1934 covered 80 percent of the country, while the one they talk about in 2011--it was just 25 percent.  On sea level, the Journal of Geographical Research: There is no statistically significant acceleration in sea level rise over the past 100 years.  Again, these are the people who know, and we are talking about in this case the Journal of Geographical  So enough of that. That is something that is a fact in terms of the weather events.  The other thing I want to mention here, going back to my notes on Antarctica, this is kind of interesting because in September, according to NASA and the data on the National Snow and Ice Data Center website, Antarctic ice hit a new record high in recorded history as it has increased to more than 19.4 million square kilometers. That was happening in terms of the data center information.  In January of 2010, Time magazine talked about the Himalayas melting. I remember people on the floor of this Senate standing up and talking about how the Himalayas are going to melt because of global warming. The article in Time magazine said: ``Himalayan Melting: How a Climate Panel Got It Wrong.''  Glaciergate is a black eye for the IPCC and the climate science community as a whole.  Sometimes some humorous things do happen. They were trying to build their case back in 2013. This was a research expedition to gauge the effect of climate on the It began actually on December 24. There was a Russian ship carrying climate scientists, journalists, tourists, and crew members for the expedition until it became trapped in deep ice up to 10 feet thick. Now, here they were going up there to show that things were warming in The whole crowd was wanting this to happen. They got stuck in ice. Well, they were stuck there for 6 days. Then an Australia icebreaker was sent to rescue the ship, but efforts were suspended due to bad weather. On January 2, they were still there. A Chinese icebreaker sent out a helicopter and airlifted the 52 passengers from the Russian ship to safety on an Australian icebreaker. The Chinese vessel was also stuck in the ice, along with the Russian vessel. There were 22 Russian crewmembers onboard the Russian ship, and an unreported number of crewmembers remained on the Chinese ship. Finally, the U.Coast Guard came along, and they were able to get in there and pull them out. The ship was called Polar  I remember when that happened because they were going there with the express purpose of explaining to the world the problems they have in the  Let's talk about bears. You don't get people talking about this without dancing out the polar bears and talking about what is happening to polar bears.  It is kind of interesting because when we look at the bear populations, they say that in the Davis Strait, they have flourished despite the shrinking Arctic Sea ice since the 1970s. In fact, in 2007 they escalated up to 2,158 bears, and they only had 1,400 in 1993. Another way of looking at it is, when Al Gore was born, there were 5,000 polar bears. In 2005, that number grew to 22,000. Today, there are 30,000 polar bears. So don't worry about the polar bears. If there is a serious problem there, it is because of overpopulation. But it looks so good. It is such good theater to dance out the polar bears and say the polar bears are all going to disappear.  When Climategate happened, I was convinced that this whole issue was over.  I can remember when we had Lisa Jackson before the committee that I chaired. This was actually in 2009. In 2009, we had sent over all of these people to tell the 192 people at the U.meeting in Copenhagen that the world was coming to an end, that they needed to all join in and sign an agreement on what they were going to do about So the day before I left for Copenhagen, Lisa Jackson happened to be in our committee. On tape, with live TV, I asked the question--I said: Well, Madam Administrator, I am going to leave town. I have a feeling that when I leave town, you will have an endangerment finding. For you to get the authority to do something about global warming, you have to have an endangerment finding. An endangerment finding has to be based on science. What science are you going to use?  She said: Well, the  That is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate That is the United They set it up for that purpose.  So as luck would have it, it happened in a matter of days after that, after she said everything is put on the science of the IPCC, the worst scandal--some people say the greatest scientific scandal in history--took place. It took place at the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit located in the It revealed the scientific fraud. They have tapes and emails of individuals who were saying: We are going to have to rig this in order to come up with some facts to show that there is warming taking place.  These were the scientists of the It was such a scandal that one of the UN scientists resigned, and he said: The result is not scientific.  Here is a good one. Clive Cooke of the Financial Times said:       The closed-mindedness of these supposed men of science,      their willingness to go to any lengths to defend a      preconceived message, is surprising even to me. The stink of      intellectual corruption is overpowering.  Then we had Christopher Booker of the UK Telegraph say: ``This is the worst scientific scandal of our generation.''  So I had thought that since everything was based on that particular science, that would do it in, but it didn't happen.  If you look at all the damage that has been done in the last 8 years by the concentration of all these issues, the defense is one that took the biggest hit. A lot of people don't really believe or don't understand or don't appreciate what has happened to the defense during the time Obama was In fact, we have been watching very carefully what our new President is going to do to try to undo the damage--what I call the disarming of America--the damage that was done to our military.  They will say: Well, wait a minute, the Obama budget for the military was the same as the budget was before that, so it isn't any great reduction.  The difference is, they changed the function of the military. How many people are aware that despite all of the problems, they wasted money on the Green Remember the Green Fleet? They were actually paying $59 a gallon for biofuel to try to convince[[Page S1803]]people that we could use the military to experiment for other more pleasing sources. Twelve million dollars for operation and maintenance to exercise painting ships, printing hats, and transforming fuel to show off the Green Fleet at the foreign military show, and $3.7 billion in solar panels and wind power. Why should the military be paying that? We have a Department of As I read the function of Energy, that is what they are supposed to be doing.  Then we have Tom The reason I bring this up is because we keep hearing about the Koch brothers. And yes, the Koch brothers are in production. Their job is to try to find energy to run this machine called America, and they have done a very good job of it. But they get criticized all the time. So I think it is important that people realize that there are a lot of liberal billionaires who have made pledges. In this case, this individual, Tom Steyer--I am sure he is a fine guy. He actually made a commitment of $10 million personally to try to promote the message that Obama had. Here is something interesting that we just found out or I just discovered: Even though this man is trying to kill fossil fuels, he made his money in fossil fuels. Since 2003, Steyer's hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, has played a pivotal role in financing the tremendous restructuring and growth in thermal coal production in Jakarta and All of this took place under Mr.Steyer's tenure as founder and senior partner of The coal mines that Mr.Steyer has funded through Farallon produce an amount of CO2 each year that is equivalent to about 28 percent of the amount of CO2 produced in the United States each year by burning coal for electricity generation. So it is worthwhile to note that he now is putting huge investments out to defeat the very people who were the source of his wealth.  The other question I get quite often is, Why aren't more people talking about this? I have made an accumulation of various threats. There are two groups of people out there. We have those who are for the whole program that President Obama had, and they are the ones who are questioning and talking about the various science, and then we have threats coming from people such as James Hansen, who said that these are ``high crimes against humanity.''  Robert Kennedy, Jr., said: ``This is treason and we need to start treating [people] as traitors.''  Barone: ``The warmists have `a desire to kill heretics'--Calls for capital punishment for `global warming deniers.' ''  So it is not fun, and there are a lot of threats out there. If they don't have logic on their side and don't have science on their side, then the threats are what people use.  We talked about cap-and-trade legislation. They tried for a long period of time to get legislation through, and when that didn't work, we might remember the first bills that were introduced were the McCain-Lieberman bills in 2003, 2005, and 2007. The first of those bills was a cap-and-trade bill that was defeated in this Chamber by 43 to 55. Two years later, they tried it again, and it was defeated by 38 to 60. Each year, the margin went up. President Obama came along and decided: Well, if we can't pass this stuff through legislation, let's do it by regulation. So we had cap-and-trade regulation.  I have already talked about going to Copenhagen after Obama, Pelosi, Barbara Boxer, and John Kerry had gone there to a big United Nations party in 2009 and went with the idea of convincing everyone that we were going to pass legislation over here, and, of course, we didn't do it.  In 2010, Japan under no uncertain terms refused to extend the Kyoto They dropped out when they said: If we don't have India and China, we are not going to be a part of it. Canada finally went through. Canada was one of the first countries to join in on the Kyoto Protocol, but they dropped out in 2011 and 2012.  That brings us to the Paris party that they had. They tried to make it look as if it was a success, when in fact it was a miserable, dismal failure. Our President said that we would reduce our CO2 emissions by 27 percent by 2025. Obviously, we couldn't do it. We even had a committee hearing asking how were we going to do that? We had the EPA in, and they admitted that it couldn't be done.  Then they talked about the commitment that China made at the Paris conference. China has actually produced more--this diagram gives you an idea of where China is going. They are building a new coal-powered generation plant every 10 days, and they are not about to try to restrict their They said: Ok, we will do it. Let us increase our CO2 emissions until 2025, and then we will agree that we will do a waiver. That is the extent of the regulations that have not worked.  The polling and the truth are coming out. The polling is now different than it was at first. I can remember when global warming was one of the first--either in first place or second place in the polls as to the dangers that face Look at the polling today. The FOX News poll last week said that 97 percent of Americans don't care about global warming when they stacked it up against terrorism, immigration, healthcare, and the economy.  The Washington Post-ABC News poll just found that fewer Americans think climate change is a serious problem.  On March 12, 2015, the Gallup poll said that climate change came in dead last of national problems of concern to Shortly after that, the Gallup poll did their annual environmental survey, and global warming came in dead last in terms of environmental issues--15th out of 15 concerns. So I am stating that the people of America have caught on. It is something that people are aware of now.  When we stop, look, and think about the cost of the Clean Power Plan, that is what this whole thing is about. I think that tomorrow the President is going to come up with a plan to do away with the Clean Power The compliance costs would be between $29 and $39 billion a year, up to $292 billion over 12 years with double-digit electricity price increases in 40 It would be an absolute disaster, and it is not going to happen.  What is worse than that is not just the cost but how it is hitting the most vulnerable people. Harry Alford, who is the president of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, found that the proposed Clean Power Plan would increase Black poverty by 23 percent, Hispanic poverty by 26 percent, reduce Black jobs by 200,000 and Hispanic jobs by 300,000, with a cumulative job loss of 7 million for Blacks and nearly 12 million for Hispanics by the year 2035. I have to state also that the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association found that high energy costs force seniors to forgo meals, medical care, and prescriptions in order to comply.  I am very proud of the He is keeping his commitment. He is not going to allow our most vulnerable citizens to be taxed, and I thank him for his help.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

11298,topic-id,360,"Mr.President, this bill has a complex backstory, but it serves a simple purpose--to allow a small daycare facility in Virginia to undertake routine repairs and maintenance.  For more than 20 years, the Plains Area Day Care Center in Broadway, VA, has served children from moderate-income families in Rockingham This facility sits on a 3-acre parcel that was once Federal land before the National Park Service conveyed it to Rockingham County in 1989[[Page S869]]under the Federal Lands to Parks The county in turn leases this land to the center for $1 per year, with a contract that runs through the year 2027.  The center is in need of repairs and maintenance, including a new roof; however, it has had difficulty in securing private financing for these activities because of the complex land ownership structure--Federal land conveyed conditionally to a county and leased to a private company. Due to Virginia's status as a Dillon Rule State, Rockingham County cannot execute a loan either.  This bill would specify that the 1989 land conveyance is transferred in fee simple, with no further use restrictions. I appreciate the goal of the Federal Lands to Parks Program to preserve land as open space, particularly after having overseen the preservation of 400,000 acres of open space in Virginia during my time as Governor of the There are no plans to develop the open space on this site, only to fix the daycare center building--a former Forest Service garage that has been on the site since before its transfer from Federal ownership.

11349,topic-id,385,"Madam President, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson shared a combined 95 years of experience in the field of aeronautics and space exploration. Katherine Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist from 1953 until she retired in 1986. Dorothy Vaughan worked as a mathematician and programmer from 1943 until her retirement in 1971. Mary Jackson also worked as a computer and an engineer from 1951 until her retirement in 1985. Over the course of their careers at NASA, Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson coauthored more than three dozen scientific papers.  In her role as a ``computer,'' Katherine Johnson calculated the trajectory for Alan Shepard, the first American in space. Even after NASA began calculating trajectories with electronic computers, John Glenn personally requested that Johnson recheck those calculations before the Friendship Seven flight in which he became the first American to orbit the ``If she says they're good, then I'm ready to go,'' Glenn said during the preflight check, and once he got the word from Katherine Johnson, Friendship Seven roared off a launch pad and into American history. Katharine Jackson later would play key roles in the success of America's Apollo and space shuttle programs.  Dorothy Vaughan left her job as a math teacher at Prince Edward County, Virginia's segregated Moton High School in 1943 for what she thought would be a temporary job with the agency that would later become Vaughan became NASA's first African-American manager in 1949 and the first African-American supervisor at the fledgling space agency. When NASA[[Page S1091]]transitioned to electronic computing, Vaughan transitioned with it, becoming an expert FORTRAN programmer and training others within her department on the early computer programming language.  Mary Jackson was first hired at NASA by Dorothy Vaughan, and after 2 years in the segregated computing pool, she was provided an opportunity to work with internationally recognized engineers in Langley's wind tunnels. That exposure led to her interest in engineering, and she successfully petitioned Hampton City Council for permission to enroll in graduate level coursework offered only at night and only at the then-segregated Hampton High Not only did she successfully complete the coursework, Mary Jackson became NASA's first Black female engineer in 1958. Twenty years later, she would cap her career by working to further improve hiring and promotion opportunities for women across the entire space agency.

11229,topic-id,1371,"Thank you, Congressman You are such a rare and talented I thank the people of California for sending you here. You serve them every day of the week, 7 days a week--24/7. It is a privilege to appear with you tonight and also with Congressman Paul Tonko, one of our most talented Members from upstate New York--a region like my own that has just been battered by the global economy and the outsourcing of jobs. We all are just honored to serve in this Congress, and we respect it and its history and its potential.  Mr.Speaker, as I travel my own district and State, I am finding I have to reassure people. Anytime there is a change, I guess, in public life, people need to be bolstered that everything is going to be okay. We are here to be that squad and to say to the American people that they have power, too, and that it isn't just the super rich of this country or the billionaire class.  We can label them ``wealth power.'' And that has power; yes, it does. Sometimes extraordinary power. But there is also ``people power.'' I consider myself having been lifted here by people power over many years, and I appreciate the people of my region for allowing me to serve our country and to learn every day, to learn from them, to learn how to make the instruments of the Nation work better for them.  There is also ``spiritual power.'' I am amazed at how people's spiritual groundings help them through difficult situations and transitions.  Then there is ``intellectual power.'' We hope to use some of that here once in a while. That is a power in and of itself.

So we find ourselves helping to heal our Nation by being Members here, and we all hope for the best for our people and for our country. I think the Members here are very well motivated.  I rise to defend, really, and to support two foundational programs of our society: Social Security and I will try to be brief so others can comment.  I am very proud to say that our family is one of those families who would have been completely destroyed had it not been for Social Security and Those didn't exist when my parents were born and grandparents were[[Page H292]]living in our country. But in 1935, after our country crashed economically and there were major bank failures and the stock market crashed and wiped out the savings of millions of Americans, the Nation turned to the Federal Government, to the President, to guarantee for a large segment of our society--senior citizens--decent incomes.  The Social Security Insurance Act was enacted at the urging of Democratic President Franklin Delano He was regarded as a saint in our household because what happened around our country was that seniors before that time--many of them--were living in what we called poorhouses. They were dying in terrible circumstances, and there was no security as a person aged.  Can you imagine how revolutionary it was at that time to create a social insurance program--probably the largest insurance program America has ever had--to ensure that as people aged or if workers became disabled in the workplace or if they died that their children would have sources of income?  The program did all of that. In thinking back, gosh, over 70 years, how transformational was that?  As for our grandpa, who died in a county hospital in Ohio before the enactment of Medicare, I know the conditions that he died under. And I know that, when our mother died, it was a different situation. She had Social Security and Medicare, and we were able to take care of her. The same was true with our father.  Intergenerationally, I see our country getting better. I am proud of that. I am also proud to be a Democrat and a member of a party that has created Social Security, which has become an indispensable part of our way of life. As I have said to seniors and to workers, it is an earned benefit. People pay for it every time their paychecks are nicked, and their employers match it.  Obviously, to survivors--and, obviously, I have neighbors who have lost spouses, whose children then benefit from the survivor benefit--what an incredible gift this idea is to the American people. There are 35 million people today in our country who depend on Social Security--one out of every six Every day, Social Security lifts 20 million people out of poverty--people who used to live in poverty.  Can you imagine what that was like?  We don't ever, ever want to go back to that world.  In 2014, the latest data show us that more than 6 million children under the age of 18 live in families who receive income from Social Security, lifting more than a million children out of poverty. Social Security has never been a welfare program. It is an earned benefit, and all Americans who contribute to it during their working lifetimes receive benefits. Social Security is a compact of trust between generations. It is the ever-present sentry at the economic security gate for retirees, for those hurt on the job, or for their survivors, and it is America's greatest insurance program ever.  I happened to be living when Lyndon Johnson helped to create the Medicare program, which provides health insurance coverage now to over 55 million people in our country--essential health security for seniors. Today, only 2 percent of the elderly in our country lack health insurance compared to 48 percent--half the people of this country--in 1962, after World War II, before Medicare even existed. That seems sort of modern times, the 1960s; yet it really was not. I would say that that is a ``wow'' by any measure.  Yes, people are living longer. Thank God the program is working. People are getting free preventative healthcare screenings and are lowering the long-term costs of care because of early diagnosis. Seniors don't have to pay for mammograms or diabetes or cancer screenings, thanks to the Affordable Care Act; so we keep trying to make the system better.  Since House Republicans won the majority in 2011, every House Republican budget has tried to end the Medicare guarantee and turn Medicare into a privatized voucher program.  Do you know what that is going to do?  It is going to shut out millions of Americans who are elderly--or who are about to be elderly--from insurance. The reason we have Medicare is that insurers weren't insuring seniors--that is the reason it exists in the first place--or they will make the price so high that people won't be able to pay for it; or they will cherry-pick only the healthy people. Then those who have diabetes, those who have had prior cancers, those who have multiple sclerosis, those who have Parkinson's will be cast aside.  What kind of a country would this be, for heaven's sake?  The American Association of Retired Persons and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare completely opposed the Republicans' plan to voucherize and let every senior go out there in the market and try to find a plan of his own, because they know what that means. These two programs are the most pro-life programs this Nation has ever created. We should be so proud of what we have been able to do as a country over the last century.  The Republican attacks on Social Security and Medicare need to stop. They are America's bulwark for millions and millions of people, and they have proven themselves to be America's most important, lifetime security programs.  I thank Congressman Garamendi and Congressman Tonko for being down here tonight. I know how passionately you care about the people of our country way beyond just your districts and why we are here.

11239,topic-id,505,"Mr.Speaker, I am honored to join Mr.Garamendi and Mr.Tonko, and I want to place in the Record, since both of you have talked so eloquently about the Affordable Care Act, you know how you will be walking through your district, maybe at a parade or some public event, and someone will break from the crowd and run toward you. I am thinking about one particular woman who came up to me in one of my smaller communities. She was in tears. This was during the summertime. She has cerebral palsy, and she never was able to get care. I don't know why she didn't qualify for insurance, I don't know all of that, but she hugged me and thanked me.  And then around the corner from where we live, there is a little produce market that I go into all the time. I am friends with one of the women who works there. This little business couldn't afford insurance, so their employees, when the Affordable Care Act passed, went to the private marketplace to get a plan. This particular woman who works long hours and lost her husband to cancer told me: Marcy, why are people complaining about the Affordable Care Act? Guess what, now I have cancer.  She said: I was able to go and get all of the tests, and now they have me on chemotherapy.  So, with cancer, this woman is working. She was only able to get insurance through the Affordable Care Multiply that times 10,000, 20,000, 1 million, 20 million, whatever the number is. Think about the number of people in our country who were without insurance. Sometimes I am speechless when I meet these citizens because I think: Where were you hiding before? Where were you?  Another place I was, a woman was mixing up. She said: Well, I have health insurance, right? I pay car insurance.  I said: Car insurance doesn't cover health insurance.  People sometimes don't act in their own self-interest. She didn't even know that because she had auto insurance, that didn't cover health insurance. Can you believe that? So she was in a job where, with the Affordable Care Act, she could go out to the exchange and buy a plan.  It is amazing to me some of the things that have happened and how I see the Affordable Care Act off to a very good start.  As Mr.Tonko said, don't just repeal it until you have something to replace it with. You cannot pull the rug out from under these people's lives. It would be unconscionable to do that.  We have several Christians, several other denominations in this It would be very unChristian to do that, for those who are And for those of other denominations--pick your denomination--I just think it would be very cruel.  I thank the gentleman for allowing us to speak out this evening on behalf of citizens who can't speak for themselves and to try to help perfect what we as a Republic can do for our citizenry.                              {time}  2015  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH290.txt,616,RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,10.0,April

She told me, she said: You know, Marcy, I have to cut my pills in half. Can you help me try to find pills so that I can afford to pay for all the medicines that I need to take care of myself?  Rather than repealing, can't we find a majority of Republicans to help us, to help our citizens be able to get medicine at prices they can afford?  Why can't we have competitive bidding for pharmaceuticals? Why can't we have that? We have it for the We have it for the Department of Why can't we have it for the rest of our citizenry so that we can get the best price?  But I thought: Cutting your pills in half?

And I thought, this is crazy. This is crazy.  Can't we do better as a country than this for our people?  I have never understood why the price of pharmaceuticals has shot up so much.

Now, with just a few taps on a phone, we can access a variety of new transportation options like rideshare, carshare, and bikeshare that complement rapid transit, take more cars off our congested roads, and reduce fuel emissions. According to a recent study, 52 percent of people using transit for work-related travel chose to use ride-hailing services and other innovative technologies.  While the General Services Administration allows agencies to authorize the use of these transportation options by Federal employees, it has not nor is it required by law to issue comprehensive guidance across the Federal  H.274 would require the General Services Administration to implement regulations to allow Federal employees to use transportation options like rideshare and bikeshare for official travel.

11191,topic-id,4073,"Mr.Speaker, I rise tonight to ask my colleagues to join me in the legislation that I have submitted today, which is the Respect State Marijuana Laws  For too long, Washington's decisionmakers have pursued the same policies over a whole range of issues without regard for whether those policies are actually beneficial to the American people. In fact, they continue to support policies that have utterly failed--many of these things--because the intent sounds so good.  So, over and over again, we see failed policies remain in place, wasting money. Rather than evaluating the reason for the policy failures and ultimately deciding to change course in Washington, the habit has been simply doubling down on regulations, personnel, and tax dollars spent, believing that that will have and bring a different outcome.  Last November, the American people registered their dissatisfaction with this way of thinking by electing Donald Trump to the  President Trump's statements on the campaign trail loudly and aggressively challenged the status quo. We haven't had someone here shaking up the status quo for a long time, but he did so by promising to revisit a whole host of failed Federal policies that have been crying out for attention for years and, in some cases, decades.  Once such failed policy has been the U.Government spending billions of dollars and wasting the time of Federal employees--hundreds of thousands, if not maybe tens of thousands of Federal employees--in order to prevent adults from smoking a weed, marijuana.  Candidate Trump told the voters this was an issue to be left up to the States, especially when it comes to medical marijuana.  At a 2015 rally in Sparks, Nevada, then-Candidate Trump said:  ``Marijuana is such a big thing. I think medical should happen--right? Don't we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states.''  It should be a State situation, I think.  ``In terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state.''  I could not agree more with the Indeed, it is the very approach that I have advocated for several years.  In this vein, I have reintroduced today, as I said, the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act earlier today, along with Republican colleagues Tom McClintock, Ted Yoho, Don Young, Duncan Hunter, Justin Amash, and Tom Massie, as well as Democratic colleagues Steve Cohen, Mark Pocan, Earl Blumenauer, Dina Titus, Jared Polis, and Barbara  My bill, which has not received a designation yet but is entitled the ``Respect State Marijuana Laws Act,'' will permit residents to participate within the confines of a State's medical and recreational marijuana program without running afoul of Federal law.  Admittedly, my personal preference would be to lift the Federal Government's prohibition on marijuana entirely. However, I understand that this approach would be a nonstarter for many of my colleagues, which is why I have promoted an approach that simply gives the States and their residents the room they need to take a different approach to this issue, should they choose to take that different approach.  Under my proposal, if a resident or business acts outside the boundaries set by a particular State, or if a State has chosen not to allow medical or recreational use of marijuana by their residents, the Federal Government would still be empowered to enforce Federal law in those instances. If that is what the people of the State want--it to be legal--the Federal Government can still get involved.  Of course, the number of States that have resisted the shift in national opinion on this issue is small. To date, 44 States, including D.C., Guam, and Puerto Rico, have enacted laws that allow, to a varying degree, the cultivation, sale, and use of marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. For those States and territories that have discarded strict marijuana prohibition, my bill would align Federal policy accordingly.                              {time}  2000  This is to those States and the people of those States who have decided they don't want the marijuana prohibition. My bill would then make sure that Federal law is aligned with the States' and the people in those States' desires so that the residents and businesses wouldn't have to worry about Federal prosecution. For those few States that have thus far maintained a policy of strict prohibition, my bill would change nothing. I think that this is a reasonable compromise that places the primary responsibility of police powers back in the States and the local communities that are most directly affected.  Over the past few years, the disparity between State and Federal marijuana policies has confused and stifled banking, proper taxation, research, natural resources development, law enforcement, and related activities. A plethora of bills, many of which I have happily cosponsored, have been introduced in the House to tackle these problems on an issue-by-issue basis. However, my bill is the only one that would solve all these problems in one fell swoop.  My bill is short, straightforward, and easy to understand. It amends the Controlled Substances Act to add a new rule that reads as follows: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the provisions of this subchapter related to marijuana shall not apply to any person acting in compliance with State laws relating to the production, possession, distribution, dispensation, or administration or delivery of marijuana.''  The major difficulties that landlords, dispensaries, banks, and others find themselves in in those States where the majority of people--maybe the vast majority of people--have voted to make marijuana legal in their borders stems from the fact that the Federal Government law considers that activity still illegal. By explicitly stating that as long as these folks are following the State law, their actions are, by definition, not illegal to the Federal Government, if we do that, many of these obstacles, many of these confusions that people have to deal with in those States, in the States where people have voted to make sure they don't want marijuana illegal, well, their problems and the complications, the banking rules and everything else would be solved immediately.[[Page H1076]]  Now that we have established President Trump's policy preference as it relates to this issue, which is he believes it should be left up to the States, as well as my legislative proposal, let us turn to the reasons why Federal policy ought to change.  First, as a matter of philosophy, I, as a constitutional conservative, have great faith in the ideals articulated by our Founding Their experience with the British monarchy, an all-powerful, centralized British Government in which people had little representation and no right to control their own lives and liberty, led them to establish--meaning, led our Founding Fathers to establish--a decentralized system of government, totally different from that of the British, that their government was meant to protect the freedoms of the citizenry.  One of the most important tenets of this system of government was the idea that nearly all police power should be reserved to and exercised by the State and local governments. Yet today, Congress continues to fund an enormous Federal bureaucracy that is built around the idea that we--meaning, the Federal Government--can and should regulate what people may or may not choose to consume and has justified the Federal Government's establishing a Federal police force and justified Federal police actions directly on the citizens throughout our country.  This is totally contrary to what our Founding Fathers meant. There was never an intent to have criminal law being taken care of by the Federal All of our Founding Fathers would have opposed it and today would be supporting my legislation by bringing things back to the ideals which they had in mind of limited government, especially limiting the Federal Government's control directly over our lives.  Tragically, these laws, the laws which have been implemented and the laws that have been encouraged by the Federal Government, these laws concerning marijuana, disproportionately impact on the poorest communities in our country. There is an incorrect perception that poor people, particularly people of color, disproportionately break Federal marijuana laws, leading to their disproportionate representation in Federal prisons. However, as I indicated, that is an incorrect perception.  Statistics show that affluent citizens are just as likely to grow, sell, and use marijuana illegally as poor citizens. The sad difference between these two, however, is that the poorest among us are somehow unable to avoid prison time for similar offenses.  There is much that can be said about why this is. Some may respond to this unfairness with the idea that we should just lock up more of the affluent young people and older people as frequently as we lock up their poor counterparts.  Well, I happen to believe that the Federal Government shouldn't be locking up anyone for making a decision of what he or she should privately consume, whether that person is rich or poor, and we should never be giving people the excuse, especially Federal authorities, that they have a right to stop people or intrude into their lives in order to prevent them and prevent others from smoking a weed, consuming something they personally want to consume.  We have been down this path before, of course. In the 1920s, a coalition of progressives and evangelical Christians thought it would be a good idea to institute a national prohibition on alcohol, which was something else that people can do in excess--and do in excess--which hurts them when they do it in excess or when they do it when they are not totally in control, and they hurt their lives.  People do hurt their lives on alcohol, no doubt about it, just like in all these other drugs and just as some people do on sugar, for example. But the motives of the movement, no matter how well intended, indeed, certainly they wanted to help the people that they were going to stop from drinking. But like most efforts to limit freedom, the freedom of Americans, they ultimately succeeded in convincing--they did convince--the country to enact an amendment to the Constitution that actually prohibited the production and sale of alcohol in the United  What happened? Well, predictably, the policy failed at achieving its intended goal, which is trying to prevent people from consuming a liquid intoxicant, alcohol; and instead of just achieving that goal, instead it resulted in a torrent of collateral damage that harmed everybody in this country and created problems that we still have today. The rise of organized crime, the death of people consuming booze that was contaminated or otherwise deadly, that is what was going on during  The mobster scene first arrived in We had organized crime. We had people who were consuming alcohol from stills, and they had no idea what company or what people were making this stuff that they were consuming. They ended up dying in great numbers, and we ended up with the  Does that sound familiar?  Fortunately, for future generations, the country wised up and repealed the Prohibition amendment just about a decade after it was put into place.  Today, the scourge of marijuana prohibition has fueled organized crime here and south of our border and in our inner cities and throughout the world. We now have organized crime on steroids, and there is little that we can do to stop that because we keep feeding them with money by having outlawed drugs that people want to consume, and especially that drug that we are looking at tonight, which is marijuana.  Yet despite the well-documented death and destruction permeated by organized crime, the two groups who are most tragically harmed by the Federal Government's intransigence--it is not necessarily the groups that they are trying to save, but, in reality, they are trying to save these people. They are putting them in jail. They are destroying people's lives in that way, but they are also victimizing American seniors and our veterans--yes, our veterans.  The Federal Government remains so fixated on the need to restrict marijuana use that it has effectively promoted an opioid addiction. The possibility that marijuana might be a viable alternative to the management of pain and certain chronic disorders has been ignored and, yes, suppressed. Thus, we have senior citizens who are in their senior citizens homes, people over 70 and 80 years old, and they are being prohibited from using marijuana that might make their day a little bit easier or might bring back their appetite. Marijuana is now, instead, designated as a schedule I substance and has prevented any meaningful use that might be, as I say, for our senior citizens.  It has also prevented a robust research of the drug to find out exactly what it could be used for in a positive way. Last year, to the credit of the Obama administration, at the insistence of myself and others here in Congress, the Drug Enforcement Administration announced a policy change to expand the number of DEA-registered marijuana manufacturers. That meant that they were able to expand that number.  Historically, only the University of Mississippi had been registered with the DEA to produce marijuana for research purposes. Well, what we have had in the past has limited the research supply of marijuana both in quantity and in quality, making access particularly difficult to legitimate scientists and practitioners. Thus, we have made it very difficult, if not impossible, for us to get a full understanding: If there are dangers, what are they? If there are some potential positive uses of marijuana, what are they?  Through the policy that we have had, it has been a negative impact on those people who are suffering who, needlessly, don't need to suffer. They do not need to suffer, whether they are our veterans coming home or whether it is our people who are basically older or are suffering from other types of diseases. The policy change that we have made is a positive step in the right direction so that now there can be more research into marijuana to find out what the dangers are and what the benefits can be.  We now can expect that research to pick up to some degree, although barriers remain. It is unfortunate that barriers remain because a plethora of anecdotal evidence suggests that this plant and its constituent parts may offer relief from ailments such as post-traumatic stress disorder, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis; and, yes, we know[[Page H1077]]that in some cases they have noted childhood problems where people go into seizures, and it has been effective in that.  Why have we held marijuana back and not researched it even?  This paranoia has had severe negative consequences on the American people, and that is not even considering the number of people whose lives have been affected. You arrest some person who doesn't have the money for a lawyer and they can't get it expunged from their record, for the rest of their lives they have lower pay and they have trouble getting jobs. We have trapped people in our poorer areas because we have put this stigma on them when what we are talking about is the consumption of a weed--not hurting somebody else, the personal consumption.  I can't think of anything that our Founding Fathers thought that some people have a right to control their lives, especially what they consume. I, of course, don't agree that we should outlaw cups bigger than this because some people might drink more soda pop if we have bigger cups, no. People need to be responsible for their own lives. That is what freedom is all about, and that is when people will start being more careful about what they do.                              {time}  2015  Yes, we also know that marijuana can adversely affect the mental development of an adolescent brain. As such, it is vitally important to discourage our youth from chronic use. Right now the youth won't even believe what we are talking about half the time when it comes to marijuana. So now we need to establish our credibility that we are not being paranoid, we are being responsible, and we are being realistic. We need to discuss with our young people and discourage the chronic consumption of marijuana, just like we do when we discourage them from the chronic consumption of alcohol use, which also is bad for young people's brains.  But the fact is we do not know more, and we need to know more, about the use of medical marijuana and the use of marijuana, period--both positive impacts and negative impacts. The fact that we don't know what it can be used for positively or what the negative impact is because we haven't done the research, that is a travesty. That is a travesty.  It is a crime against older people who sit there and are being denied the use of something when they are over 70 or 80 years old that might enlighten their day and might bring back their appetite after they have had some sickness.  It is a travesty when our veterans come home and they are given opiates instead of maybe something they can derive from marijuana. We need to research that. And our veterans end up killing themselves because now they are addicted to an opiate. The Federal Government should not stand in the way of the scientific community in learning more about marijuana.  Many who oppose the change in course for Federal marijuana policy will cite any number of excuses: Oh, but it is dangerous if people use marijuana and then get behind the wheel of a car.  Well, that is something that needs to be worked out. We need to make sure that we understand there are other challenges we have to face once marijuana is legal and how we are going to protect people from being in a situation. Well, I happen to believe that there will be no more people smoking marijuana and driving a car if it was legal than they are today. However, that may be an issue we need to look at.  What we need to do is find ways to discourage young people from driving while drinking. Let's have drug testing in our schools not aimed at putting young people in jail, not aimed at saying: Oh, you have tested positive for marijuana, you are going to get arrested. By the way, you can't do that because you can't force these kids to testify against themselves by giving them a blood sample or a drug test. But you can do it in order to say: If you test positive for drugs, we are going to talk to your parents about it. If you test positive for drugs and you are in school, you are going to have to take a class to show you what you are doing to your brain.  Ultimately, this is all about freedom. It is all about whether adults, not children, can use their decisionmaking process. This is the land of the free and the home of the brave. Too many people get so wrapped up in micromanaging our lives for our own benefit--of course, it is always for our own benefit--that sometimes they end up causing great harm to the people that they want to control for their own benefit.  Well, many of my Republican colleagues have joined me in letting the States do this. That is right. I understand it. I respect them. I hope more will go along with the constitutional provision that those things not enumerated in the Constitution are powers that should be granted to the  I hope that my Republican colleagues will join me in recognizing that, when we talk about individual freedom, this is what individual freedom is. It also includes individual responsibility on the other side of the coin. When we talk about limited government, we want limited government and we want government that is closest to the people, the State marijuana laws in the name of helping people. So that they won't consume a weed by their own choice, we are destroying all of those principles which we claimed as  I believe in those principles. I think my fellow Republicans do as well. That is why we need to talk about it and have this type of discussion that I am opening up tonight on the floor of the In fact, if someone says they believe in the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution--we have heard it, and we will hear it in this body over and over again--let's send that back to the That is supposed to be a State rule of who is going to control the environment, who is going to control the gun laws or marriage laws, et cetera. We are going to hear that. But if someone really believes in the Tenth Amendment, they will respect the State marijuana laws, and let the States decide, and the people therein decide, what the laws should be.  Remember, as we discuss people's health care, Republicans over and over again say: You shouldn't get in between a doctor and his patient. We believe in the doctor-patient relationship. That is true for medical marijuana as well.  Do we believe in these principles?  I say the Republican Party does believe in those principles. We need to have a discussion and we need to make sure that the American people understand that we are not just down here saying that we can control their life when we think it is best. We are down here because we do believe in liberty, we do believe in freedom, we do believe what our Founding Fathers had in mind when they decided not to follow the dictates of the king, not to permit the British government to establish control over their lives here in the United States that they had in Great Britain where they had fled from to get away from that type of authority. We do not want to have Federal police--no matter what they call them, DEA or anything else--down in our cities and our towns conducting law enforcement operations.  That is not what our Founding Fathers had in mind. They had in mind also that people would be responsible for themselves. Yes, when people are free, some of them are going to make wrong decisions in their lives. We need to make sure that we understand that when we legalize medical marijuana, or even recreational use of marijuana, some people will hurt themselves, just like with alcohol.  It is up to us not to try to put them in jail, not to try to hurt them, not to try to force them to do what we want, but to try to reach out to them, to help people who are in need, help people make the right decision in our churches and our schools. This is the way to conduct when you have a problem that threatens to bring down the society, not establishing a Federal Gestapo to go and enforce laws that are going to make everybody just prim and proper. I am sorry. What we need is to reassert what our Founding Fathers had in mind for America: limited government, personal responsibility, individual freedom, and, yes, the Tenth  I would ask my Republican colleagues to join me in supporting the Respect State Marijuana Laws It presents us with a unique opportunity to support legislation that responds to[[Page H1078]]our constituent demands because across America, people are understanding the reality of this. They don't want to put people in jail, they don't want to have Federal law strike forces in their community just to prevent adults from consuming a weed in their backyard. It makes no sense at all. They know that people, once they are arrested for just smoking a weed that is not hurting anybody else, their lives are damaged and it is harder for them to become a decent citizen. Americans are concerned about each other, and we know we can't just leave it up to the government to control our lives.  With that said, I hope that my colleagues support this legislation and support Congressman Blumenauer and myself and others in the Cannabis Caucus that is being established in order to be consistent with the goals and ideals of American liberty to make sure that we have limited government and unlimited freedom in this country. That is what America was supposed to be all about.

11131,topic-id,587,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to support H.479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017.  I want to associate myself with the chairman's remarks. He summarizes well the need to adopt this legislation. I want to commend Judge Poe for introducing this legislation. I was very pleased to introduce it alongside him.  We earlier considered 92. In that debate, we discussed the nuclear and missile program of North Now it is time to focus for the next few minutes on their use of terrorism.  We need to consider North Korea's obvious state support of terrorism around the world. North Korea has engaged in kidnappings, targeted assassination, cyber attacks, and support to terrorist organizations in various regions.  North Korea was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1988, but it was taken off that list in 2008, following commitments by Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. We dismantled their status as a state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea certainly has not dismantled its nuclear program.  Kim Jong-un has only increased the pace of his nuclear ballistic missile testing and is nowhere near dismantling that program. So now it is time to focus again on North Korea's terrorist actions around the world.  We can go back several decades when the North Korean Government kidnapped Japanese civilians--some because of their talents in making movies; most in order to force them to[[Page H2613]]teach Japanese etiquette to North Korean spies.  Now, you may say: Well, that was decades ago. Why are we designating them as a state sponsor of terrorism now?  Well, those people still have not been released to this day. And, if they have passed on, their bodies have not been returned to their families.  We are all aware of how North Korea engaged in cyberterrorism against Sony Pictures because Sony Pictures made a movie they didn't like.  We know that, just a month or so ago, a North Korean agent killed Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This act of terrorism took place at the airport in Malaysia and was summarized by the chairman.  In the case of Chaim Kaplan v. Hezbollah, a United States District Court found that, in 2014, North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization.  And finally--and this list is incomplete but last on my list--is North Korea's assistance in helping Assad try to develop nuclear weapons of his own. We are aware that Assad's nuclear facility, built almost entirely based on North Korean technology and using North Korean equipment, was destroyed in 2007. Assad has murdered hundreds of thousands, it looks like the figure is now half a million, of his own citizens. Imagine the destruction Assad would have engaged in had he been able to develop nuclear weapons with the support and technology of North  H.479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act, expresses the sense of Congress that North Korea likely meets the criteria to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and requires a determination by the Secretary of State within 90 days as to whether or not North Korea meets that standard.  This bill is an important step in confronting North Korea's support for terrorism around the world and for the danger that it poses to the civilized world.

I rise today in support of the Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety This bill will require the VA to implement a standard identification system for biological implants that is consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's unique device identification system. This system will allow for the tracking of implants from donor to recipients. This bill will also require VA to procure biological implants only from vendors using the system and only through competitive procurement processes.  The GAO has testified that the Veterans Health Administration is one of the largest purchasers of surgical implants, which include biological implants such as skin and bone grafts, and nonbiological implants such as cardiac pacemakers and artificial joints. The GAO has raised valid concerns regarding VA medical centers complying with VHA requirements for documenting surgical implants purchased from the open market and VHA's ability to identify veterans who received an implant that is being recalled by the manufacturer or the Food and Drug  Patient safety is our number one concern.

11235,topic-id,1187,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Garamendi for bringing us together in this Special Order format to talk about some key critical components that address American families significantly. Representative Garamendi and Representative Marcy Kaptur, who both do their homework, are a great addition to the House because they challenge us with facts, not fiction. They care deeply and passionately about improving and enhancing the quality of life. So to stand with both on this issue is a good feeling for me.  Just a couple of observations: I think it is okay for government to have a heart. We speak to the heart and soul of working families across this country by understanding that health care is not a privilege; it is a right.  So let's begin with that fundamental basic observation, a right. What we have seen with this right is that over 30 million Americans have been added to the rolls of the insured over the course of the Affordable Care  Now, Representative Kaptur did a great job of speaking to history of[[Page H293]]Medicare, of Social Security, and of the Affordable Care Act, as did Representative I remember being at the 75th anniversary celebration of Social Security, and people were talking about the discrediting going on before Social Security was enacted into law. There were those who demonized it before it became law. There were those who have fought it ever since. They don't want that right for working families.  I would suggest that Social Security, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act are rock solid elements of a foundation upon which to grow quality of life and longevity. It is a basic fundamental additive that, when brought to our working families across this country, we are providing a service and we are addressing them with dignity. That is what this is about.  The demonization of the Affordable Care Act is interesting. Because if you look at polling, you will find that people say that ObamaCare is destroying the Well, what about the Affordable Care Act? That is working. My friends, it is the same issue, it is the same concept, and it is the same program.  So what we have tried to do is discredit a program that took on a major challenge, took on major industries, and needed to provide a balance and an actuarial outcome that is providing a go-forward and accomplish what you have enacted as a mission. The actuarial science has got to be precise.  So for those who want to repeal, they are talking about, in cases, pulling a brick out of the foundation and having it get wobbly, and it is going to crash the marketplace. We are going to have all of these people who have been enrolled or have been forever enrolled in health care impacted by rising costs and disruptive outcomes that will put them at risk.  So like the Social Security Program before the ACA, like Medicare before the ACA, as you floated these boats, as you went forward with time, you learned where you needed to tweak, and you adjusted, by amendment format, to make the program stronger. That is what we have been asking for in a partnership here in the House and with the Let's work on those areas that may need improvement, but do not repeal because repeal without replacement is a disaster. It is a disaster waiting to happen.  We have provided hope for working families across this country. We have had the testimony presented to us, anecdotal evidence, that this is working, that for the first time families have enjoyed a connection to a system, a standardized approach. What was the program?  People say: Well, I don't want to pay for someone else's health care. You have been paying for it before the It was called the emergency room. It wasn't standardized because whoever you got at that emergency room in whatever location, as you traveled looking for assistance, didn't provide a steady flow. It was a wasteful outcome for taxpayers and an insufficient outcome, a cruel outcome for those consumers who were impacted by being underinsured or uninsured.  So let's set the record straight. We have had a program up and running for 8 years now. The Republicans have chastised this program saying it needs to be repealed. We have taken over 65 votes, or 65 votes, I believe, to repeal, but there has never been a replacement plan. So what kind of gimmick is this to pull away a program that is working for tens of millions of families added to the rolls but not replace? That is disaster waiting to happen.  So we challenge our colleagues here in the House and in the Senate down the hall to be academic about this, to be compassionate about it, to be passionate in our resolve, and to make a difference by putting together the improvements that we require and not repealing.  Now, we look at the Affordable Care Act and what it means to our health care. But if you repeal, you will wreak damage on the budget. You will destroy our economy. You will have a huge workforce displacement, and you will slash care for America's working families. Is this the outcome that we want?  Remember, we were the last industrialized nation to come to the table and provide guaranteed health care for our families. That is not something of which we are proud. That was destructive. That was insensitive. It was not effective. It was a waste of tax dollars the way we did it.  So now we go forward with a program that allows us to now take a look at the history, albeit brief, on the Affordable Care Act, but understanding where we need to fine tune. We do that, and the challenge is there for all of us: take the cost out of the system for a stronger future and provide at least the same level of quality, if not enhanced quality, as we go forward. That should unite us in a common cause, cutting the cost of the program and enhancing the quality of services provided. What a great mission for all of us to embark upon.  So let's not play politics with the health care for tens of millions of people who are new to the system and for all of us who have been covered routinely by the system. We can do better than that.  Let the lessons of Social Security and Medicare, which, as my colleagues indicated earlier, address the American public with dignity, improvement, enhancement, and hope, the best commodity we can deliver as a government to her people.  So I thank Representative Garamendi for the opportunity for us to speak to these issues. Frankness is required right now. The lack of theater would be an improvement. No theater on this. Let's settle for facts, not fiction, and working together to bring about what is a sound resolve that allows us to provide stability and success for the American public. That, I don't think, is too much to ask.  So I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) for bringing us together.

11237,topic-id,955,"Thank you, Representative  As you talk about public sentiment about Social Security, the Affordable Care Act, and hearing the evidence you have provided from your constituent within your district, it becomes very apparent where the American public is.  When polled recently, only 20 percent of the American public is in support of efforts to repeal without replacement--20 percent. So the great, great majority understands what is going on here.  We have also seen during the recent campaign season, which probably went a year and a half to 2 years long, a lot of talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, undoing the act. That happened in the same timeframe as 11.5 million people were added to the rolls for 2017. So there is an appeal here that is drawing the American public toward the coverage provided by So the sentiment here is to get things done and provide, again, the stability.  I am also a cosponsor of legislation entitled Strengthening Social Security Act that would improve how we calculate the benefits for Social We are not advancing reducing those benefits or raising the retirement age to 69 or whatever level; we are talking about enhancing benefits. When you talk to seniors, they will say we either have got nothing or we got just a bit of an increase that was taken away with the other hand for some other purpose.  So, yes, we need to revisit just how we give that green light to a COLA adjustment, and we need to calculate that approval with items that are truly essential for the senior citizens, not big screen televisions or certain items that are adding to a luxurious note, but one that speaks to their basic core needs to live day to day. So the Strengthening Social Security Act does just that. It takes into account all of the essentials in that calculus that will determine whether or not a COLA adjustment is given that given year. So that is important.  I also believe it is time for us to look at that cap that we have created, that we have placed on contributions to Social You know, some people by February 12 or 14, whatever date it is, are done paying. They are done contributing by that point in the year. Well, the standards of $118,000, or $127,000 coming this year, are just capturing most of those revenues. The hardship is placed on the working, middle-income community, those looking to ascend the middle class. There could be a far greater contribution from other income strata that we ought to look at to provide stability.  A point needs to be made that Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act are all intertwined. There were strengtheners that were provided for these programs. There was a partnership of revenue stream that was calculated and assumed that again provides for the quality of response to the consuming public, and especially those in senior years.  I have a large percentage of senior citizens in the makeup of my constituency. It is important to recognize that many who are on Medicare end up getting Medicaid assistance because of situations that are called upon where they are perhaps placed in nursing homes, adult homes, or the like. So we have to be cognizant here of the public sentiment, where is their thinking, and we know exactly what they want. They want stability for these programs. They want strengthening of the programs. They want to make certain that all of these efforts that have lasted for decades, or were introduced as late as 2010, will continue so they have a future that is that more secure, that more certain.  So tonight we talk and implore our colleagues to please help improve the Affordable Care Let's not repeal, and certainly do not repeal without a replacement plan. That is a disaster that will really cause havoc in the marketplace. It is one that doesn't prove to be actuarially sound. Also, let's make certain that we don't have these efforts again to voucherize Medicare, to privatize Social These are programs that have provided stability.[[Page H295]]  When I came into the House in 2009, it was at the lowest point of the recession which President Obama was handed upon his entering into the There were 700,000, 800,000, 900,000 jobs lost a month in the deepest, darkest moment of the recession. What did we see? We saw individuals who took their lifetime's worth of savings and entrusted them to a marketplace, and they lost everything for which they had ever worked, and others realized they didn't lose a single cent of Social Therein lies a tremendous bit of testimony as to the meritorious achievements of a Social Security system, one that provided that safety net for all families, one that made certain there was some sort of continuous flow, a backup, a reinforcement, as you went into retirement years.  We are reminded of Medicare and what the results were for retirees, how long they were expected to live and what their quality of life was like. It was tremendously, favorably turned around with the benefits of  So with an impassioned plea, I encourage this House, the Senate, to do the right thing: stand for the American public and allow them to be addressed with dignity with these programs that have proven themselves. And where there is a need to further assist, as there has been time and time and time again with Social Security, as there has been time and time again with Medicare, let's provide that same approach to the Affordable Care  I thank the gentleman from California for bringing us together and being able to share our thoughts and advocacy to do the right thing.

Some of the most cherished efforts of the Affordable Care Act are about preexisting conditions. Being a woman, being a pregnant woman, or being a woman or a man fighting cancer made it very difficult for people to get that insurance, and lifetime caps. You know, people being rolled into surgery, wheeled into surgery, and being told that they were discontinuing their plan.

11276,topic-id,160,"Mr.Speaker, after only 24 days in office, President Trump's National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned in disgrace.  Why?  He had direct contact with the Russian Ambassador, assuring him, in likely violation of U.law, that the Obama sanctions against Russia would be reversed. And then he lied about it.  There is evidence of Trump campaign officials having regular contact with Russians officials, and we know Russia hacked into DNC files and doled out stolen information with the goal of aiding the Trump campaign.  So the question is: What is the Russian connection?  Congress must do its job. We should conduct a full-scale, no-holds-barred investigation of the links between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. There is a mountain of evidence we cannot ignore.  The American people have a right to know, of course. But even more importantly, the enduring strength of our democracy is being tested. Congress must maintain our constitutional protection of checks and balances. Investigate now. Investigate fully.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1281-3.txt,1879,RELIEF FROM EXCESSIVEEXECUTIVE ORDERS,2017.0,16.0,January
11165,topic-id,535,"Mr.6 years ago this month, more than 100,000 Bahrainis of all ages and backgrounds joined together to protest their government. Although these men and women took to the streets peacefully, they were met with violence as the regime unleashed its state security forces. Using threats and intimidation, tear gas, live ammunition, and even torture, the regime brutally repressed the peaceful demonstrations. Following widespread international condemnation, the regime agreed to create an independent body to look into the crackdown and propose reforms--the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry or BICI--and when the BICI came back with 26 recommendations, the KING promised to urgently implement them all.  Six years later, the regime has not upheld that commitment. When our own State Department last reported on each BICI recommendation, it could only identify a handful that had been fully implemented--a far cry from the regime's claim of full implementation. The chairman of the BICI admitted last year that most recommendations have not been fully implemented. NGOs following these issues have been even more critical, noting with alarm that the regime has actually reversed BICI recommendations. Earlier this year, for example, the regime restored the power to arrest and detain Bahrainis to Bahrain's National Security Agency--a power that had been stripped following the BICI report's recommendation in 2011.  That decision follows a year in which the regime has moved aggressively to close the space for peaceful opposition. Since last February, the regime disbanded the largest opposition party, al-Wifaq, doubled the prison sentence of the party's leader, Sheikh Ali Salman, and detained numerous human rights advocates like Nabeel Rajab simply for speaking out. Advocates told my staff recently that the regime's escalating violence over the past year reached levels unseen since the 2011 protests.  The United States should not hesitate to raise its voice when foreign governments clamp down on speech and expression. This is even truer when the government in question is a U.ally, as the Bahrain regime is. I was disappointed that more administration officials did not appear to share this view with respect to Bahrain Indeed the State Department chose to lift self-imposed holds on weapons sales to Bahrain in 2015, a decision that I and many in the advocacy community saw as rewarding bad behavior and incentivizing more of it. In fact, I introduced bipartisan legislation last Congress that would have reinstated the ban on certain weapons sales until the administration could certify that the regime had implemented all 26 BICI recommendations. Congress adjourned last December without passing our bill, but I intend to resume my efforts this  As I sometimes remind my colleagues here, my goal here is neither to insult nor to undermine a U.ally. My hope is that someday I will be able to stop reading these statements into the record every February because the Bahraini regime has stopped repressing its citizens and has instead entered into a real and inclusive dialogue with them. Unfortunately, this regime has shown itself so unwilling to pursue dialogue and reconciliation that I must continue my calls for accountability. For that reason, I speak out today, on the sixth anniversary of the peaceful uprising, to call again for reform in Bahrain and an end to further oppression.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgS1494-2.txt,1247,TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE JOHNSON AND REMEMBERING MARY JACKSON AND DOROTHY,2017.0,28.0,January

Perry was born in Arcadia, Florida, in 1937, and went to school at the University of Florida, where he became an all-star standout in both Gators football and baseball. His contributions on the field earned him entry into the prestigious Hall of Fame as a Gators Great in 1969.  Perry was married to his wife, Noel, for 57 years, raised four children--Jana, Mark, Keith, and Matthew--and enjoyed the joy and laugher of their 15 grandchildren.  A tremendous family man, Perry was also successful in business. He was an insurance agent for 48 years. He had the honor of being the youngest person ever elected as mayor of Gainesville, and he was a representative for the State of  He was a tireless volunteer and doer in Gainesville, receiving countless awards and recognition for his community service. Two of those particularly stick out to me. He received the first ever Ethics in Business Award and the Service Above Self Award, given by the Gainesville Rotary for his lifetime of service. In addition to his time, Perry donated more than 60 gallons of blood and set an example for all to follow.  For all the things Perry was and all the good things Perry did, I will always remember him most for his smile, his great attitude, and his notorious reputation to have his camera at the ready. He was always snapping pictures of people enjoying life and making sure to send to each individual a copy so they could remember the happy moments in the life that he captured.  To Noel and the McGriff family, thank you for sharing Perry's time. Thank you for sharing your husband and father with all of us.
