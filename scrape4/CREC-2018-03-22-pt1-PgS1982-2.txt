                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 5247

  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk, 
and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 5247) to authorize the use of eligible 
     investigational drugs by eligible patients who have been 
     diagnosed with a stage of a disease or condition in which 
     there is reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a 
     matter of months, or with another eligible illness, and for 
     other purposes.

  Mr. JOHNSON. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to 
my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative 
day.

                          ____________________
