                CONGRATULATING FOOTBALL STATE CHAMPIONS

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate three State high 
school football champions in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional 
District: Westfield High School, North Hunterdon High School, and 
Somerville High School.
  Westfield High School finished its year with its third consecutive 
State championship and with its 37-consecutive-game winning streak 
intact. The North Hunterdon Lions won their division, and Somerville 
High School finished as State football champions with award-winning 
Coach Jeff Vanderbeek at the helm.
  I congratulate the communities and families supporting our student 
athletes. I also congratulate all of the faculty and coaches who devote 
themselves to cultivating and nurturing the talent of these athletes.
  Each of those public schools, in addition to athletic achievement, 
has also been recognized for academic achievement regularly across the 
Nation, highlighting that New Jersey's reputation of having among the 
best public schools in the Nation continues.

                          ____________________
