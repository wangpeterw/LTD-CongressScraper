                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Spirit, today we praise You with our whole heart. You 
continue to exceed our expectations with Your bountiful blessings and 
tender mercies.
  Inspire our lawmakers to remember Your generosity to them and this 
land we love. In these days of stress and strain, continue to be the 
shepherd who will guide them to Your desired destination.
  Lord, thank You for forgiving our sins, healing our sickness, filling 
our lives with good things, and surrounding us with Your love. Continue 
to be a celestial parent to our Nation and world, sustaining us all 
with Your tender compassion and mighty power. God of mercy and grace, 
transform our dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows.
  We pray in Your marvelous Name. Amen.
