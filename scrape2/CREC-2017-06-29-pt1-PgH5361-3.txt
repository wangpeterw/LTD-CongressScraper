            THERE IS NO HEART IN THE SENATE HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, the Senate version was supposed to be the 
one, according to the President, with heart. There is no heart in this 
bill.
  Sixty percent of my constituents live in Los Angeles County which, in 
total, has about 5 percent--one county in the country has about 5 
percent--of this country's Medicaid recipients. The proposed Senate 
bill cuts to Medicaid would put more than a quarter of those currently 
receiving Medicaid assistance in L.A. County, nearly 900,000 people, at 
risk for losing health insurance.
  This is not a healthcare bill. This is a tax cut for the wealthy, 
dressed up to look like serious legislation. The rich get richer, while 
everyone else is left to get poorer and sicker.
  This is not who we are as Americans.
