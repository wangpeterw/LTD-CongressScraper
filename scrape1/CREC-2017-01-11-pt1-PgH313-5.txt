                    DATA IS BETTER THAN PREDICTIONS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, whenever you see climate change in 
the news, remember the difference between actual dataand exaggerated 
predictions. For example, much coverage was given yesterday to the 
predictions by the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService that polar bears now 
face extinction because of climate change. That prediction is 
contradicted by the evidence. Thepolar bear population has been 
increasing and is now around 26,000, probably the highest number in 
many years.
  Climate alarmists want to scare people with extreme predictions. 
Better for Americans to look at the scientific evidence anddiscount the 
wild tales. Climate change has many causes and has occurred throughout 
the history of the Earth. Real scientistsacknowledge this and are 
hesitant to make long-range predictions.
