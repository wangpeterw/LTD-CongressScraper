                              H. Res. 726

       Whereas, on January 30, 2018, Representative Paul Gosar 
     tweeted a series of statements that included ``Today, 
     Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as 
     well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking that they 
     consider checking identification of all attending the State 
     of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in 
     attendance.'';
       Whereas Representative Gosar went on to tweet ``Any illegal 
     aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext 
     of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and 
     deported,'' said Congressman Gosar;
       Whereas Representative Gosar's comments explicitly targeted 
     the DACA recipients that Members of Congress brought as their 
     guests to the State of the Union;
       Whereas DACA recipients have been granted deferred action, 
     are contributing to this country, and have been thoroughly 
     vetted by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services;
       Whereas Representative Gosar's actions to inappropriately 
     pressure the U.S. Capitol Police to detain and deport 
     Dreamers, who are staying in the country according to U.S. 
     Department of Homeland Security regulations, intimidated 
     these young people who are already facing fear and 
     uncertainty;
       Whereas Representative Gosar abused the power in an attempt 
     to interfere with and politicize the United States Capitol 
     Police's efforts to provide for a safe, secure, and open 
     environment during the State of the Union;
       Whereas Representative Gosar has violated clause 1 of rule 
     XXIII of the Code of Official Conduct which states that ``A 
     Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer or employee 
     of the House shall behave at all times in a manner that shall 
     reflect creditably on the House'': Now, therefore, be it:
       Resolved, That the House of Representatives strongly 
     condemns Representative Paul Gosar for his inappropriate 
     actions that intimidated State of the Union guests and 
     discredited the House of Representatives.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution qualifies.
