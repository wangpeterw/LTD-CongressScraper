                   HELPING OUR CONSTITUENTS GET AHEAD

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1minute.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I am Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi 
fromthe Eighth District of Illinois. I have the honor to represent the 
hardworking families of Chicago's west and northwest suburbs.My 
constituents, like so many other Americans, are finding it harder and 
harder to get ahead.
  Creating good-paying jobs ismy number one job, and growing and 
strengthening the middle class is my primary mission. I believe working 
and middle classfamilies must be able to earn a living wage, have 
quality health care, and educate their children well.
  These challenges arenot insurmountable, but we must address them 
immediately. We need to make sure that working and middle class 
families canachieve economic security. I believe that, if you work hard 
and play by the rules, you and your children can and should succeedin 
America. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in this 
Chamber to make that a reality.
