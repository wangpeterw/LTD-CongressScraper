17482,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,17482,topic-id,2457,"Madam President, I rise this afternoon to supplement some remarks I made on the floor last evening about the Affordable Care Last night, I talked about my own experience as a young staff member in the U.Senate 43 years ago when, because I had an insurance policy provided by my employer--that policy had preventive care as part of the policy, just as Affordable Care Act policies do today--I had a routine physical checkup. It was the first I had in a number of years, which caught malignant melanoma, a particularly virulent form of cancer. Because it was caught early and because I was treated, here I am today.  As I mentioned last night, it has always haunted me that someone who didn't have insurance, a young man or a young woman somewhere in the country who was in exactly my situation, because they didn't have insurance, they didn't have preventive care, didn't get the checkup, the disease wasn't caught, and they are gone.  I find it very hard to justify that, to understand that. It doesn't seem fair. It doesn't seem ethical. It doesn't seem moral. Today I wanted to also bring to the attention of the Senate some stories from today about the effect of the Affordable Care Act in Maine, where we have over 80,000 people enrolled, many of whom had never been able to have insurance before.  A young woman, Whitney, who graduated from college in 2013, said:       I graduated . . . with a degree in wildlife ecology, [but      it was very difficult to find a job.]       Thanks to the ACA, I was able to stay on my family health      insurance plan through this period of unemployment. I did      finally get employed in my field, but permanent, year-round      jobs with benefits are the equivalent of winning the lottery.[[Page S194]]  Many young people are in that situation. It even has a name. It is called the gig economy, people who work gigs, who work short periods of time, several months here, several months there, but there are no benefits attached to those jobs. She said:       Many of us work seasonal jobs, building trails on the      Appalachian Trail, rescuing lost hikers, managing volunteers,      and running programs for veterans to reconnect with Maine's      woods. We do good work in this state. Before the ACA we      worked dangerous outdoor jobs that only provided minimum      worker's comp. . . . But with the ACA and the tax credit, I      could afford a silver plan, I could get dental for my teeth,      could go to the doctor again, get flu shots and get my joints      looked at.  It is important to realize that without the ACA, this young woman would have literally no options. A health savings account is unrealistic for somebody who is making $15,000 to $20,000 a year. Buying insurance across State lines isn't going to help this young woman.  She said getting the ACA coverage ``was life changing. I know it is not perfect but I am terrified of going back to [where we were] before, where health and financial ruin was one wrong step away.''  Another letter from an older adult:       My wife is sixty-three years old she is no longer able to      work full time. She has had major back surgery and has      arthritis in her neck. Because of these health issues she had      to reduce her work hours.  Here is the catch-22. She had to reduce her work hours. Therefore, her employer dropped her from her health care coverage.       We were fortunate [enough] to obtain coverage for her      through the Affordable Care It is expensive and is not      the best coverage--  Nobody in this body says it is best possible result and that the law is perfect. We all agree it needs to be repaired and fixed and modified. The writer goes on to say--     but it is good enough for us to know that a major health      issue will not bankrupt us.       We are appealing to you as our representative to insure      that a reasonable replacement will be put in place when the      Affordable Care Act is ended. Better yet, improve it, don't      destroy it.  I couldn't have said it better myself. Donald, in his letter to me, says: ``Better yet, improve it, don't destroy it.'' That is what we ought to be talking about.  This letter is from a fellow named Ryan in North Central He also makes an important point about the Affordable Care The term that I refer to is ``job lock.'' There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in this country who are locked into the jobs they have that they don't really like, that isn't giving them the satisfaction they want because they can't afford to leave their health care.  One of the hidden benefits of the Affordable Care Act is it has allowed those people to follow their dreams, to start a business and not have to worry about having health insurance. This is an entrepreneur in Maine, a small business person. He said:       Affordable healthcare is a major roadblock to those      calculating whether they can take the leap to become self-     employed. As we prepare for next year's ice cream season, I      am about to leave my benefit-providing job in order to commit      to making the volume of ice cream we need. This is a scary      and questionable decision given our financial situation and      the fact that we are raising our two small children of four      and seven years old. The first comment I hear from everyone      who finds out I am leaving my job is, ``Are you sure? What      are you going to do about health insurance??''  The answer is, the Affordable Care It enables this young man, this gentleman, to follow his dream, to start his business, to commit to his business, and this is good for the country. This is a hidden benefit that is rarely discussed about the Affordable Care Act to allow people to give vent to their dreams and their innovation and their contribution to the economy.  Here is how he ends his letter. He says:       Please don't let me down. Please don't let my family down.      Please don't let down the millions of families who really are      on the bottom of this country and are the very ones that all      of you from every party claim to support. I don't care about      the details of how it gets done, whether the ACA is thrown      out, or just revised, or what compromises have to be made by      either party, but please make sure there is a health care      option available and that it is at an affordable price for      those of us with the guts to take a stab at our own small      business. The key is ``Affordable Care.'' It matters.  As in my own case, health insurance also saves lives. There was a study done by the Journal of Public Health in 2009, which basically concluded that for every million people without health insurance, there are a thousand premature deaths. It is pretty easy math. Before the Affordable Care Act, we had 45 million people without health insurance in this country. The calculation in this extensive study was that 46,000 deaths were attributable to not having health insurance. I am living proof of that. If I hadn't had health insurance, I would be gone. With the disease that I had, either you catch it in time or you are a goner. That is why I am so passionate about this.  We would not let people die in our front yards. If we saw somebody who was in danger of losing their life, we wouldn't stand by. Nobody in this body would stand by and say: Sorry, we can't help you. But not providing health insurance to people is a death sentence to 10, 20, 30, 40,000 people.  The Affordable Care Act is now covering something like 25 million people. That is 25,000 lives saved. If we take it away, it will be 25,000 lives lost.  Here's the letter:       I am a Maine woman in my late 30s, who works 2 part-time      jobs and also run my own business.       Because we were on [ACA] health insurance that had an      affordable deductible, after not feeling well for a while, my      husband went to a doctor and had a CT scan of his lungs. . .      . It turned out he had a very rare form of an illness, even      though he was only 38 at the time. Had we not had this      insurance and such an affordable premium and deductible, he      would never have gotten that CT scan done. This insurance      saved his life and covered every expense we've had over the      last 2 years with multiple stays at MidCoast Hospital and      Maine Med, 2 surgeries, pick-lines, medications, therapies,      the list goes on. There is no cure for what he has but he's      doing better now, thanks to the  Another person from Maine:       My sisters and I watched my mom die. We were physically in      the room when it happened. We cried for probably half an hour      straight.       Before the Affordable Care Act, most of her illnesses were      considered pre-existing conditions. She survived cancer three      times . . . but had to pay exorbitant monthly premiums just      to have to pay most of her treatment out of pocket.  He said:       I don't care about the ACA because of some theory or      ideology. I watched my mom die, sooner than she needed to,      because she couldn't afford to get preventative care early      enough. I watched my mom die because market solutions refused      to solve her problems. An open insurance market actively      refused to compete to cover my mom. The insurance market      before the ACA is one of a number of factors that led to my      mom's death.       This is a real, physical, immediate memory for me whenever      someone talks about healthcare, and it always comes to mind      when people talk about it in vague terms and market forces. I      am crying even as I write this, and it has been years.  He writes to me:       I am begging you, as a son who watched his mom who was      younger than you--  Than me--     die in a hospital because she couldn't afford the care she      needed, please protect the Affordable Care Protect it as      a legislator, protect it by recognizing how appointments you      choose to confirm or deny will affect my family's ability to      stay healthy and alive. Through grants and research, you've      worked to improve access to health care. Please, protect the       Another one--one more. This is a letter I received just back in the fall, a little before Christmas:       I have an incurable, generally non-lethal form of bone      cancer and have been under treatment for over 12 years. The      multiple surgeries [and costs] . . . I cannot afford to pay      for ongoing treatment without insurance. I am very pleased      the current ACA does not allow for ``preexisting      disqualification'' and I would hate to see that removed.      Having this condition is naturally stressful, debilitating      and undesired. I do not want or need the added stress of      having to worry about the details of coverage.       Additionally I have two boys, aged 23 and 26, both of whom      have benefited from remaining on our family insurance policy.      That is a great policy and my boys are healthier as a result.       Finally, access to quality health care is and must be a      right as it benefits both the individual and society. Health      is key to happiness and success and happy successful people      pay taxes, support the government, [and] give back to the      community.  I understand the debate that surrounded this. I understand the emotion. I understand the pressure that people feel in order to maintain a campaign promise or to meet promises[[Page S195]]made over the last several years. But we are not talking about maybe what will happen; we are talking about real cases, real people. I am talking about real people in Maine, in small towns and cities. I am talking about rural hospitals that are on the verge of being rendered financially incapacitated because if this law is repealed, it will take away a significant part of their support. I am talking about seniors having to pay more for drugs. But mostly, I am talking about people's lives.  These cases are people who can give specific examples. There are thousands, tens of thousands, and millions that we can't articulate--people who are saved who don't even know it because they went in to get that checkup, who are saved the stress of wondering how they are going to pay for some kind of treatment.  As a parent, I remember having to stress about whether to take my child to a doctor because I didn't know whether I could afford to pay that bill. Yet we all know that is the proper course. We shouldn't have to make those kinds of choices. We have a vehicle, imperfect as it is. Imperfect as it is, we have a vehicle for providing that care.  Let's slow down. Let's take a breath and say: We talked about repeal, but it isn't really practical. We can't harm that many people. Let's talk about what we are going to replace it with. The idea that we are going to repeal it today and replace it 3 years from now is just cruel. That is what I am hearing from people: Don't put us through that. People who finally got insurance after preexisting conditions, who have insurance and have a condition now--they depend upon that insurance. Let's not make them go through that pressure, the financial anxiety added to the health anxiety. We have an opportunity to rise above politics. This really shouldn't be political or a policy or something that divides us.  There is nobody in this body who wants to see people suffer, who wants to unnecessarily put people through the pressure of both health problems and financial problems. We ought to be able to find a solution. Every other industrialized country in the world has found a solution. It is not like this is some impenetrable box.  I realize that part of the solution has to involve controlling costs and facing the fact that we pay twice as much for health care per capita as anyone else in the world. That is an issue the Affordable Care Act does not sufficiently address, in my view, and we have to talk about that.  In the meantime, let us remember those people who are counting on us for their very lives. That is a commitment I believe we can respect and should meet.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

25161,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25161,topic-id,2460,"Mr.President, I ask to have printed in the Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest conducted by my office.  The material follows:   ZOE HOULIHAN, NORTH COUNTRY UNION HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)       When you think of America, do you think of McDonald's, big      cities, high-tech phones and computers, or do you think about      violence, fear, and hatred amongst people? Although America      seems like a great place full of opportunities and freedom,      it is quite the opposite if you are not a white, straight,      cisgendered male. There are many problems in America that      need to be fixed.       Racism has been ongoing for hundreds of years. Blacks,      Hispanics and many other[[Page S538]]     non-white groups have faced discrimination and hatred because      of the color of their skin. Blacks are thought as more      violent and lazy than whites. African Americans now      constitute 1 million of the 2.3 million imprisoned      population. They are also incarcerated at six times the rate      of whites. NAACP says that 5 times as many whites are using      drugs as Blacks, but they are being sent to prison at 10      times the rate of whites. Moreover, Blacks are getting shot      at higher rate than whites. Although more whites are getting      shot, there are about 160 million more white people than      there are black people. While Whites make up 49% of those      fatally shot by police officers, Blacks make up 24%, despite      only being 13% of the US population. More than 250 blacks      were killed in 2016. Furthermore, 47% of hate crimes have to      do with race. Racism is such a big problem in America it's      hard to say what an effective solution would be. One solution      to this could be to get media stars that are POC to talk      about racism. This could cause their fan base (which can be      quite large) to change their ideas about African      Another solution is to educate people on racism. Teaching      young children in school about how racism started could      lessen the number of people in each generation that feel      negatively about people of color. Lastly, the government      should make the policies about racism in schools and      workplaces stricter. Telling kids ``That is not appropriate''      when they make a racist comment isn't doing anything. People      need to be punished for making these comments because if they      aren't it makes it seem like it isn't a big deal.       Another problem in America is sexism and sexual assault.      Sexism makes it harder for women to get jobs and be well-off      in life. According to the Huffington Post, well-off white men      are three times more likely than women to be offered a job      interview. Moreover, women that work 41-44 hours per week      earn 84.6% of what a man working that same time would earn.      Women that work more than 60 hours a week earn only 78.3% of      what a man would earn. Similarly, in the House of      Representatives only 19.3% are women, and in the Senate only      20% are women. In addition, when a woman claims to have been      sexually assaulted, men usually blame the women. They ask      what they were wearing, how ``revealing'' it was, and if they      were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. One in four      women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Also,      683,000 adult women are forcibly raped each year. This is      equal to 56,916 per month, 1,871 per day and 78 per hour. One      solution to women not getting payed as much as men could be      to make a policy that both women and men are to be paid      equally. Furthermore, a solution to sexual assault is to      teach kids about consent and to give longer sentences to      people that have committed sexual assault. Another solution      to sexism is to have more women representation in media and      politics. This could help eliminate the thought that women      are only made to have children, clean and cook. It would also      give young girls more role models to look up to.       Finally, the last issue that needs to be fixed is hate and      discrimination against the LGBT+ community. According to an      analysis of data collected by the FBI, lesbian, gay,      bisexual, and transgender people are the most likely targets      of hate crimes. An example of a hate crime against the LGBT+      community is the Orlando nightclub shooting. 49 were killed      and at least 53 were injured. This shooting is considered the      worst mass shooting in the United States and the nation's      worst terrorist attack since 9/11. Additionally, LGBT+ people      experience discrimination in the workforce. They actually      have a higher unemployment rate than African Americans (15%      versus 12%). People of color that are also apart of the LGBT+      community face the most discrimination. A solution to this      problem could be to educate young children about the      different sexualities and explain that it's okay to feel      attracted to whomever. Another solution is to create policies      that would help protect people in the LGBT+ community.      Lastly, there should be stricter rules about when a teacher      hears a homophobic comment. Many kids say ``That's so gay''      when something that they don't like happens and i could make      other kids feel unsafe.       In conclusion, America has many issues with equal rights      that need to be fixed. One of the main solutions to every      problem is education. When people are educated, they can use      their knowledge to base their opinions off instead of going      with what the popular opinion is or what they are hearing      around them.        GRAHAM JANSON, MONTPELIER HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       Whenever you ask someone the question, ``What is the most      pressing issue facing our nation today?'' you will most      likely get a different answer every time. An environmentalist      might say, ``Carbon emissions and global warming.'' A      conservative activist might say, ``The increasing national      debt.'' There are many answers to this question. But there is      only one answer that addresses an issue that lies at the      center of our nation's existence. That answer is that the      fundamental democratic principles on which the United States      is based are being eroded by voter suppression and      gerrymandering.       Efforts to suppress voting rights for many people have been      around since the Constitution was adopted as the supreme law      of the land, when only property-owning white men could vote.      We have come a long way since then, with African Americans,      Native Americans, and American women gaining the right to      vote, but we still have a long way to go. Similar to during      Reconstruction, when literacy tests were used to deny African      Americans the right to vote, a now-overturned North Carolina      voter ID law was in effect that, according to the federal      appeals court that dealt with the case, deliberately      ``target[ed] African-Americans'' in an attempt to suppress      their voter turnout. Other states, such as Ohio, Kansas, and      North Carolina, have had voter ID laws that have been      overturned after being ruled discriminatory by a federal      appeals court. The overturning of these laws is already a      step in the right direction. A way to address voter-     suppression efforts is to require a federal court review for      every voter ID law to make sure that there is no      discrimination or infringement of American rights. Another      way is to restore the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of      1965.       Additionally, the repeal of some of the key aspects of the      Voting Rights Act in 2013, which allowed nine states to alter      their election laws without the approval of the federal      government, demonstrates how gerrymandered elections can      serve to undermine basic democratic principles.      Gerrymandering involves altering the areas of electoral      districts to favor one party or another, and both Democratic      and Republican politicians have engaged in gerrymandering in      the past. There have been many cases in which a political      candidate has won an election because of gerrymandering. This      clearly undermines our nation's democratic principles because      now a candidate can carry the minority of an electorate and      win an election, and it needs to change now. Furthermore,      because these same elected officials appoint and confirm      federal judges, voter suppression and gerrymandering can also      undermine the judiciary's vital role in protecting democratic      voting rights.       In conclusion, the restoration of equal voting rights and      the elimination of gerrymandering would allow the United      States to remain a true democracy. Indeed, the other pressing      issues that face our nation today, such as global warming,      economic development, immigration, healthcare, and      gender equity, cannot be fairly addressed while our nation      continues to utilize this flawed system that does not      reflect democratic values.   IRA RICHARDSON, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       When George Washington delivered his farewell address, he      stated that ``The alternate domination of one faction over      another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party      dissension . . . is itself a frightful despotism.'' Our first      and only president who was not a member of a political party      attempted to warn us of the threats they can pose to      democracy. Today, however, the Democratic and Republican      parties have become so powerful that one can hardly imagine      the American democratic system without them. In a sense, this      is one of the sources of their overbearing power: many      Americans see them as an intrinsic part of our democracy      rather than two organizations that were created long after      the union to organize like-minded voters. Political parties      are not inherently bad, but a system which creates a forced      dichotomy by only giving voters two realistic choices for any      given position has unquestionable negative effects on our      nation. Firstly, it forces citizens who care deeply about      specific issues to routinely vote for candidates whom they      may not agree with in any other capacity so as to not violate      their personal moral code. This, in turn, allows parties to      cynically align themselves with these single-issue voters to      win their votes without truly sharing their values.      Additionally, two diametrically opposed political parties      give rise to an us-versus-them mentality among citizens,      eroding the mutual trust that is intrinsic in the formation      of a nation.       To reduce the near-hegemonic power that the parties      currently hold, it is imperative to make it more clear to the      American public that both parties are private organizations,      operating within their own processes and promoting goals that      are not necessarily those of their constituents. The      intention is not to cause Americans to stop supporting the      party they belong to, but rather not to follow any party      blindly, and to understand their complex histories and role      in American democracy. Another step towards a system in which      people could more consistently vote for politicians they      truly support would be the implementation of an instant run-     off (aka alternate or ranked) voting system. In such a      system, a voter does not select a single candidate to receive      a position, but rather ranks the order in which they support      each candidate. If no candidate has over fifty percent of the      vote, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and      every citizen who selected them has their votes moved to      their next choice, and the votes are tallied again. This      process is repeated until a candidate has a majority. This      alternative would allow people to vote their conscience      without fear of handing the election to a candidate on the      opposite side of the political spectrum. It would not destroy      the existing political parties (which would be destabilizing)      but rather allow third-party and independent candidates to      speak for portions of the population who cannot identify with      either existing party. By reducing the power of the two major      parties, the environment necessary to address the many      problems facing America could be created.[[Page S539]]       JULIA STERGAS, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY FAIRFAX SENIOR (FINALIST)       Nearly 260 years ago our country endured a war over the      rights of our states and the rights of its peoples. From this      war came the first legislation to protect African Americans      living in the United One-hundred years later, our      country faced another revolution, resulting in new      legislation that enhanced the ability for African Americans      to participate in political and social life. Since then, many      Americans have believed that racial equality has been      achieved.       But here we are, fifty years later, struggling through yet      another conflict over the divide between black and white.      Tensions are high between African Americans and white      authority figures in the United Distrust and anxiety      separates black Americans from their government and onlooking      citizens. In 2014, Michael Brown was shot and killed by a      police officer in Ferguson, That same year, a      barrage of negative media emerged from an originally peaceful      protest in Baltimore, Maryland, depicting unlawful rioters      who looted and set fire to business, injuring six police      officers. Now, we continue to watch video clips on nightly      news highlighting the struggle between black and white.      Through this our attention has been distracted from the true      cause of continued racial conflict: the lack of recent      successful intervention.       White authority figures are perpetually distrusted by the      black community, and groups such as Black Lives Matter still      believe inherent biases against African Americans are      abundant in society. We must rebuild this connection. To      achieve comprehensive change we must redirect our nation's      path. The first step toward action is awareness. This issue      must be introduced into schools, universities, and community      centers. If we can enlighten young adults they will share      their knowledge and work to obtain equality nationwide.       Educators would lead discussions on current and historic      racial tensions in a non-partisan, open environment. Focusing      on historic and current events and their social and political      ramifications, these open debates would promote civic      engagement and thoughtful problem solving. Prompts regarding      the government's involvement and the responsibilities it      should assume, the action we as the nation's youth should      assume, and opportunities to develop individual solutions      would be considered during discussion. Our young population      is critical to the future of our nation, so it is necessary      that we provide them with opportunities to immerse themselves      in their political and social world.       Today's generation and the ones to follow will be our      leaders and our visionaries. Incorporating awareness into      education programs would introduce these leaders to the      nuances of the world they will come to inspire, and allow      them to develop an understanding of their political efficacy.      Raising consciousness of this racial strain would encourage      young leaders to take charge of their futures, and ours, and      incite change. It is critical to the well being of our nation      that we cultivate a generation of educated young adults who      possess the skills to maneuver themselves in their political      and social world. Addressing our nation's imperfection and      coaching our youth will only be the start to a nationwide      revolution of change and acceptance.

The material follows:          KEELAN DURHAM, OXBOW HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)       Climate change is the most important issue facing our      nation and the biggest challenge our world has ever faced. It      threatens us at the most immediate level--the very land,      water and air that we have called home for thousands of      years. Addressing climate change will require tremendous      policy shifts and changing massive amounts of infrastructure      that we have spent many years and billions of dollars making.      And it will require people and governments to collaborate at      a worldwide level. The United States is the richest most      powerful country in the world. We have achieved this position      in world politics by being a leading force in creating      prosperity and democracy around the world. However, by      achieving this, we have wreaked havoc on the environment at      the expense of the greater world. Now, we have a moral      obligation to to lead the world in implementing strong      policies toward a renewable future. If we fail to address      climate change, both our nation and nations around the globe      will suffer tremendous consequences. According to the      environmental protection agency's (EPA) ``Climate Impacts on      Coastal Areas'', Rising seas alone will cause the United      States to lose a projected 28,800 square miles of land. This      would submerge large parts of fourteen US cities, displace 25      million people, and destroy billions of dollars worth of real      estate. Rising seas would claim beautiful areas all along the      coast such as the beaches of Culebra the multimillion dollar      condos of Malibu or of the beautiful coast of      Outside the United States, small island countries that have      done very little to cause global warming could be wiped of      the face of the planet.       As the richest most powerful country with the oldest, and      arguably the strongest, democracy ever we need to take bold      action and implement strong policies to stop global warming.      There are many things the United States can do to address      climate change. We could put a price on carbon pollution;      this would create a disincentive to use oil and possibly hurt      oil companies profits. We could create strong incentives and      grants for renewable energy; this would make it easier and      cheaper for individuals and businesses to instal renewable      energy like solar or wind. A huge step forward would be to      ban coal mining and oil extractions from public lands--just      this would keep millions of tons of CO2 out of the      atmosphere and greatly help the environment. Merely stopping      all new gas and oil infrastructure in its tracks would be a      huge step in the fight against climate change. There is more      we can do but this would be a start.       Currently the United States has been doing very little to      combat global warming. The Paris Agreements were a step in      the right direction but oil companies still have many members      of congress working for them and with Donald Trump as      president progress will likely will be lost and not made.      This is why we must fight for this issue, and all issues that      we know are important. If we do this, we show the oil      companies and corrupt politicians that this government is for      ``we the people of the United States'' and not ``we the super      huge and super rich corporations of the United States''.      Together we can make huge progress towards a renewable energy      future and towards protecting our environment for future      generations.          MORGEN EDWARDS, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, our country spends more on training      men and women to go to war than what it does on training our      family members and our neighbors to come home. We spend more      money on the military as whole, than what we do our veterans.      Our veterans deserve more benefits through an increased      budget of ten percent, we must reform the VA, and help to put      an end to the 22 veterans who commit suicide a day. To help      put an end to veteran suicide rates, there should be funding      to create a separate organization to solely focus on the      mental health of our veterans, readjusting them to civilian      life, and acting as a twenty-four hour hotline to help      prevent veteran suicide. This should be comprised of experts,      and people who can adequately represent them when it comes to      congress and budgeting.       In order to save our veterans, we first must provide the VA      with a better budget, in order for the VA to provide veterans      with access to benefits. The projected budget for the      president to spend on the VA as of 2017 is 182.3 billion      dollars, and according to the VA this is a ``4.9% increase      over the 2016 enacted level.'' If we increase the budget by      ten percent to start out, than the VA could have more money      to provide our veterans with better benefits, thus helping to      cut down on wait times by employing more qualified      individuals, while helping to provide more options for care      and help to the men and women who need it. According to      Military times ``The average wait time across the system as      of May 15 was 6.89 days for primary care, 10.15 days for      specialty care and 4.4 days for mental health appointments,      according to the report.'' Wait times should be no more than      three to four days, and if at all possible we should try      cutting that down even more, to ensure the safety of our      veterans.       We must train our veterans on how to readjust to civilian      life, help them to find and maintain jobs, help them find      housing and teach them about PTSD and mental health      awareness. We must train them to not be afraid to speak out      about their mental health. Most importantly, we must not send      them away when they seek help, telling them to ``just forget      about it.'' If we have the means to train them to go to war,      than we must take those same means but apply it to training      them to come home. No longer should we send of veterans home      to fend for themselves. If we have the resources to send them      to boot camp to go to war than we have the resources to send      them to boot camp to come home. We should try and expand the      Wounded Warriors Project, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of      America, and American Veterans and their efforts to provide      transition programs.[[Page S488]]         REBECCA GREEN, JOHNSBURY ACADEMY SOPHOMORE (FINALIST)       I believe that one of the most pressing issues that is      facing our nation today is the conservative movement to      remove federal funding from Planned I think that      this is very important, because Planned Parenthood clinics      are key providers not only of family planning services, but      also preventative care, and other important health care      services for low income women and families, and therefore,      defunding this organization would negatively impact access to      healthcare in these vulnerable socioeconomic groups.       The movement to defund Planned Parenthood is centered      primarily on ideological and political reasons surrounding      the pro-life movement and their argument that tax dollars      should not be allowed to support organizations that provide      abortions. Yet, Planned Parenthood data demonstrated that      only 3% of their budget goes to fund abortion, with the rest      of their funds going to contraceptive services (31%), testing      and treatment of STD's (45%), other women's health care      services (14%), and screening and prevention of cancer (7%).      According to a report from the Guttmacher Institute, in 2014,      Planned Parenthood prevented 2.2 million unintended      pregnancies and averted many cases of sexual transmitted      diseases, and cervical and breast cancer through screening      PAP smears and mammograms and HPV tests and vaccinations,      resulting in a net public savings of $13.6 billion, or $7.09      for every public dollar spent. Defunding Planned Parenthood      clinics could therefore have a significant negative impact on      both these health benefits and the health care savings that      come from their services.       An example of the effects of this movement to defund      Planned Parenthood can be seen in the case of Texas, where      cutting federal funding to this organization led to closure      of more than 80 clinics and deprived thousands of low-income      women of highly effective contraceptive methods, resulting in      a drastic increase in the rate of births covered by       In conclusion, Planned Parenthood has created a nationwide      network of clinics that provide a wide breadth of services to      low income women and families who often fall in the gap      between Medicaid and insurance coverage. Efforts to defund      this organization would deprive this vulnerable socio-     economic group from important health care services, and cause      profound negative impact, not just on preventative care and      overall women's health, but on state and national health care      spending.          ABIGAIL HALNON, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, I am humbled and thrilled to be your      president. I believe that the American people are generous,      insightful, and accepting. Our nation gains its power,      strength, and beauty from its diversity. We strive, as a      nation, to be an international leader in perpetuating ideals      of freedom and equality. It is my concern that there are many      acts in this country that violate these fundamental beliefs.       It is important that the United States is a country      recognized as a pioneer of social justice on a worldwide      stage. It is our moral duty to uphold the highest standards      of equality and acceptance. We have made great steps towards      this in recent years. The landmark Supreme Court decision in      2015 of Obergefell v. Hodges upheld the fundamental right to      marry, regardless of sex. We must further prove our nation's      belief in freedom and opportunity by the legislation that we      pass. There is progress yet to be made.       Currently, practicing conversion therapy on gay and      bisexual Americans is widely permitted across the U.This      is a process under which non-heterosexual people are      subjected to various means to reverse their sexual      orientation. Conversion therapy, based on a scientifically      discredited premise, must see an immediate ban. It permits      the means to punish and abuse innocent The vast      majority of these victims are minors. This practice      perpetuates a false and violent belief system that      homosexuality is a mental disease and that a cure must be      sought. It is an obscene violation of the basic human rights      of gay, lesbian, and bisexual It should not be      permitted by law.       Although it receives little public support, only 5 states      have banned conversion therapy on minors. These acts of hate      and misinformation must be outlawed nationwide. It is an      injustice and a crime to subject torture on Americans, most      often minors, who have committed no offense. An immediate      country-wide ban must take place.       We must work to defy all accounts of prejudice based on      sexual orientation and gender identity. The freedom and      mobility of transgender and nonbinary Americans is severely      limited. Their rights and protection are being eroded by      current legislation. A recent law in North Carolina known as      the ``bathroom bill'' allows regulation of bathroom access      for transgender individuals. Legislation that regulates      bathroom use by transgender Americans is an act of hate and      tragic misinformation. Rates of violence or misconduct by      transgender individuals in bathrooms are so unprecedented      that there are virtually no statistics on it. There is no      need for regulation. These laws must immediately be struck      down. These are basic and necessary rights and they must not      be infringed upon. Discriminatory acts based on sexuality and      gender identity have implications outside of their specific      goals. The use of U.law to marginalize any group      perpetuates dangerous and violent beliefs. Our      misunderstanding cannot become rejection. Our fear cannot      manifest into anger.       Americans will not stand for the perpetuation of hate,      fear, and misinformation. We will not reject our neighbors      and our friends. Our country must make these necessary steps      towards true equality.   KARLEY ZIER, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       Raising the price of minimum wage would benefit everyone      differently, but all in a commendable way. This would give      people on government assistance more of an incentive to      secure a job. It would keep the average family of four from      drowning in debt just to buy groceries for the week.      According to Sherrod Brown, Senator of Ohio, ``Anyone who's      tried to pay a heating bill, fill a prescription, or simply      buy groceries knows all too well that the current minimum      wage does not cut the mustard.'' Sherrod explains exactly how      tough it is to try and survive off from the ongoing minimum      wage price.       Minimum wage in Vermont should be raised for a multitude of      reasons. One way the state could benefit from this would be      the amount of people withdrawing from welfare and other      government funded programs. The state could benefit from this      act because unemployed rates would go down with more people      applying for jobs. Families living off of minimum wage have      barely enough money to meet their basic needs per week or per      month. Someone making minimum wage at $9.60 an hour for eight      hours a day and five days a week will earn $384. Therefore,      one will make $1,536 per month without any taxes being taken      out. According to USA Today, the average cost of groceries      per week for a family of four is $150-$200. The average cost      of rent in Vermont is $900 per month. Being left with $436,      which would be non-existent due to taxes, leaves no room to      pay for other needs or necessities. People wouldn't have      money to pay for phone bills, transportation expenses, or      daycare because one would be working. Someone would not be      able to pay for any of these necessities because of the fact      they wouldn't be able to afford them living off of minimum      wage.       People who are using government assistance programs could      benefit from this because there would be a reason for them to      want to work. If people make the same amount off of welfare      as they are making while working a forty hour job each week,      of course they are going to choose welfare, or other      government assistance programs. There is no incentive for the      people on welfare to want to get a job with the minimum wage      being so low and having to pay for expenses they wouldn't      need to pay for while being unemployed. The other people in      the state could benefit from this by the amount of people      withdrawing from the welfare program. The more people who      withdraw from the system, the less tax money that one say to      pay to fund these types of programs. Overall, those are the      reasons why the minimum wage in Vermont should be      raised.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS487.txt,CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS487.xml,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017,30,January
25197,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25197,topic-id,841,"Mr.President, tonight is an important nightbecause it allows what is very rare here in the Senate--for Members of the body to bring forth amendments and ideas that are veryimportant to them, and that, unfortunately, don't often get debated or voted upon here on the floor.  I know I speak forvirtually all Democrats in saying that we have deep concern about the Republican proposal that would repeal the Affordable CareAct without having any alternative plan in place. We think the idea of throwing some 30 million Americans off of the healthinsurance they have and significantly reducing funding for Medicaid will not only be very, very problematic for lower incomepeople but also impact middle-class people who depend upon Medicaid to help pay for the nursing home care their parents get. Weare deeply concerned about the possible privatization of Medicare, making Medicare into a voucher program. We are concernedabout the increase in prescription drug costs for seniors that would occur. If the Affordable Care Act were repealed, seniorswould have to pay far more than they are paying right now, at a time when many seniors cannot today afford the high cost ofprescription drugs. What we find is outrageous is that, in the midst of all these attacks on the middle class and workingfamilies of this country, the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act would end up providing hundreds and hundreds ofbillions of dollars in tax breaks for the top 2 percent. I believe there are very few people in America who think we shoulddevastate the health care programs that millions of Americans depend upon and at the same time give huge tax breaks to the very,very wealthy.  Tonight we are going to hear a number of Senators on the Democratic side come down to the floor and offervery, very important amendments which I hope can receive bipartisan support.  We are going to hear Senator Manchin talkabout the need to protect rural health. As a Senator from a rural State, I understand very clearly that if the Affordable CareAct is repealed, it will be devastating to rural hospitals all across this country.  Senator Nelson is going to talkabout the high cost of prescription drugs and what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean in raising prescription drugprices. Senator Baldwin will be talking about the need to make sure that, as is currently the case, young people 26 yearsof age or younger can continue to stay on their parents' health insurance. Senator Tester is going to be offering anamendment which will oppose limiting veterans' ability to choose.  I will be offering an amendment making certain the peoplein our country do not have to pay more for medicine than the people in Canada and in other countries. Senator Casey isconcerned about protecting individuals with disabilities and chronic conditions. Senator King is concerned about protectinghealth insurance for people, many of whom are working in very dangerous occupations.  Senator Menendez is concernedabout protecting Medicaid expansion. Millions of Americans have received health care, in some cases for the first time in theirlives because we were able to expand  Senator Gillibrand is concerned about protecting women's health. TheAffordable Care Act has gone a long way in terms of equity for women, in terms of the health care they receive, and I hopenobody wants to see that disappear.[[Page S249]]  Senator Manchin will address a very important issue about the opiate epidemicthat exists in West Virginia and all across this country.  Senator Stabenow will be speaking about the need to protectmental health services. We have a major crisis in mental health care in this country. We need to do a lot more than we arecurrently doing, and we certainly do not need to do less.  Senators Cantwell and Carper will be talking about theneed to protect delivery system reform. Senator Brown will be talking about the need to protect the Children's HealthInsurance Senator Coons will be talking about the need to make sure there are no limits on the health insurancepeople with serious illnesses receive.  So there are a lot of very, very important amendments that will be offered, and Ilook forward to an interesting evening of discussion.  I would just conclude my remarks to say that I find it beyondcomprehension that at a time when we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people--weare the only one--that at a time when we pay significantly more per capita for health care than do the people of any othernation, that at a time when we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs--what we need is to have ahealth care system that protects the needs of the middle class and working families of our country, not just the insurancecompanies and not just the drug companies. In fact, the votes tonight are really about whether we are prepared to stand up forordinary Americans or whether we are going to continue to kowtow to the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry.

I would yield to my friends if they will tell me now what the replacement is. How many of those 30 millionpeople are going to die? What is your plan to cover them, plus the other 28 million people who have no health insurance? How areyou going to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guaranteehealth care to all people?  They don't have a plan. I understand Senator Corker wants more time. Maybe they will developa plan. Right now what they are talking about is repealing legislation which has brought millions of people health care, andthey have no substitute.  I would urge the defeat of the Barrasso amendment.

25218,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25218,topic-id,240,"Mr.President, I begin by thanking Senator He has shown a lot of courage for standing and exposing the hypocrisy of the Republican budget resolution.  Year after year, we have heard from our Republican colleagues that the United States is going broke, that we have huge deficits, that we have a $19 trillion national debt, that we have to cut Social Security, we have to cut Medicare, we have to cut Medicaid, we have to cut funding for education, we have to deal with the deficit.  As Senator Paul has indicated, if the Republican budget resolution passes, the Federal deficit would more than double over the next decade, going from $571 billion this year to over $1.3 trillion 10 years from now.  I hope all of the deficit hawks on the Republican side hear what Senator Paul has to say and support him.  I will not support him because I understand that the cuts that he is proposing are devastating to working families, to the elderly, to the children, to the sick, and to the poor. They would mean massive cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, Federal aid to education, and a variety of programs people desperately need, so I will oppose the amendment.  All of my Republican friends who talk about the deficit year after year, here is a vote you should cast.  Thank you.  The PRESIDING The time of the Senator has expired.

25221,1010,Bernard,SANDERS,SENATOR,I,VT,,S000033,115,25221,topic-id,1617,"Mr.President, since 2010, I havesponsored a State of the Union essay contest for Vermont students. The contest, now in its 7th year, is an opportunity forVermont's high school students to articulate what issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United Apanel of Vermont teachers reviewed all of the essays submitted and selected the top 20.  I would like to congratulate eachand every finalist and to specifically acknowledge Quinn Nelson Mayo as this year's winner of the contest. I would also like torecognize Musa Mayange for placing second and A.DeFelice for placing third. I ask to have printed in the Record thewinning essays.  The material follows:        quinn nelson mayo, st. johnsbury academy junior (winner)       The United States was founded onseveral core values; the      most important, as most of us agree, is freedom. This shared      belief has been the foundation of ourcountry for over 200      years. And for centuries, media has been a major outlet for      people to exercise this freedom because itallows them to      share their opinions with the masses. The idea of free speech      took on a different meaning with the development ofthe      internet in the late 80s. Since then, this liberty has grown      exponentially. Now people have the ability to share      theirthoughts with a much larger audience. It is possible to      do this anonymously and without fear of consequence. The      internet is anincredible asset which has helped with      globalization and the spread of information. However, this      form of media does have itsdrawbacks. The leading issue is      that it enables the spread of false information. So, while      the internet embodies our nation'score value of freedom, it      can also be detrimental to another vital aspect of our      society: educated and well informedcitizens.       Regardless of one's political views, we can all agree that      2016 has been a tumultuous year for politics, here inthe      United States and across the globe. The 2016 presidential      campaign was a dramatic affair, and just the opening act to      one ofthe most high-stakes elections in our country's      history. The actions and rhetoric of the president-elect have      inspired a greatpolitical shift, as well as a burgeoning      sense of xenophobia and hatred throughout the country. During      times such as these, itis important to focus on what we can      do to create a better future. Much of the hate directed      towards certain groups of people isdue to ignorance and can      be traced back to stereotypes perpetrated by unreliable media      sources. Forcing media sites todrastically increase their      censorship would rightfully anger their users, on the grounds      that it restricts their constitutionalright to free speech.      Therefore, the most plausible and effective solution to the      problem of misinformation is to educatepeople.       As of this year, 78% of the United States population has a      social media profile (Statista). Facebook and Twitter      havebillions of users across the world. It is imperative that      we use such sites with care. The recent controversies over      fake newshave made the influence of the media on politics      increasingly apparent. The rumor now known as ``Pizzagate''      is a prime exampleof a fake news story with tremendous      influence. Millions of people believed that Hillary Clinton      was involved in a child-prostitution ring run out of a pizza      parlor. This is because, for a vast number of people, social      media and biased news sourcesare their only ways of acquiring      information. In fact, it is estimated that 62% of American      adults use social media at leastoccasionally as a news source      (Pew Research Center). However, many blindly make the      assumption that it is accurate. Whenhundreds of thousands of      people are susceptible to hate-driven fake news, it can have      a huge impact on our democracy.       This iswhy I propose the incorporation of media literacy as      a core subject in all public schools. Public schools educate      the majorityof our nation's children. Which is why, by      teaching America's youth how to approach sources impartially      and critically, we canfix this problem of misinformation.      Integrating media literacy as a required course at elementary      and high-school levels is aninvestment in our future      generations.        musa mayange, winooski high school senior (secondplace)       Twelve years and still no change. After fleeing from a      civil war in Somalia in 1992, my parentstook refuge at a      refugee camp in Kakuma, After 12 years of struggle, in      2004 we flew from the National Airport of Kenyato J.F.

Racism exists in Surveys reveal that whites apply      stereotypical thinkingabout blacks, considering them lazy and      unintelligent. What are we going to do about these attitudes      towards persons ofcolor?       The American National Election Studies asked voters to rank      blacks and whites from hardworking to lazy, fromintelligent      to unintelligent. In 2012, 62 percent of whites gave blacks a      lower score in at least one area. In 2008, 45 percentof      whites expressed negative feelings about black stereotypes.      (Milbank, Washington Post)       For a while, we thought that theissue of racism was over      and that our nation was going to move forward and ``leave the      past in the past.'' It almost had mefooled because we live in      Vermont and we sometimes can be isolated from world issues.      But racism is still here. When everyonethought that it was no      longer ``relevant,'' it's still alive.       As a young African-American immigrant, how can I wrap my      headaround this? As Vermonters how can we annihilate racism      and get our community to be accepting of all races, cultures,      and ethnicbackgrounds?       Ta-Nehisi Coates addresses the disadvantages of living with      black skin in Between the World And Coates says``. . .      today, when 8% of the world's prisoners are black men, our      race has been refinanced to the Dream of being white.      Blacklife is cheap, but in America, black bodies are a      natural resource of incomparable value.'' Black people are      born with adisadvantage. We are more likely to go jail than      white people. The Center for American Progress says, ``In the      United States,black people account for 60 percent of those      imprisoned. The prison population grew by 700 percent from      1970 to 2005, a ratethat is outpacing crime and population      rates.       Black people make up 17% of the United States population      yet more of us are injail. A black man is twice as likely to      go to jail than a white man, even if they did the same crime.       Racism was born whenhumans identified skin color as a      positive or negative factor. If each of us could accept that      we are all humans, we come fromdifferent places, and have      different interests, we could accept racial differences, but      not let them divide us. We will nevermove forward if we don't      work together side by side and knock down obstacles.        aj defelice,hartford high school freshman (third place)       The United States is one of the greatest countries onEarth,      prized for its natural beauty, economic opportunities, and      democratic principles. However, many challenges face      ournation. Among the most pressing issues are climate change,      immigration, and income inequality.       Perhaps the most dauntingproblem we face is climate change,      and the crucial role our country plays in it. Although      President Obama recently signed theParis Agreement to limit      greenhouse gas emissions, much must still be done to combat      this issue. We can begin by puttingunemployed or low-income      Americans to work--manufacturing, transporting, and      installing renewable energy products--such as solarpanels,      wind turbines, and more. This would produce a similar effect      as the New Deal put into place by President Franklin      D.Roosevelt to combat the negative effects of the Great      Additionally, a carbon tax should be established      nationally,to lower emissions, and encourage the usage of      renewable energy. A carbon tax would also allow for tax      reductions in otherareas, and combined with employing      Americans to transition to widespread renewable energy, would      create economic growth, whilesimultaneously reducing our      carbon footprint.       Another controversial issue which troubles our nation is      immigration. TheUnited States is a country built on the backs      of immigrants, and to deny a path to citizenship to millions      who long only for ahigher quality of life is unpatriotic. We      must stop dehumanizing these people and see them only for who      they are--people.Immigrants strengthen our economy, whether      it be as producers, consumers, or developers. To deny them      access to citizenship inour nation would be depriving      ourselves of economic growth and cultural diversity. Economic      and cultural change that would onlystrengthen American      society.       Income inequality is another issue which plagues our nation      today. According to countless yearsof research, income      inequality has a direct correlation on social and health      issues. A study conducted by the University ofWisconsin found      that people who reside in more financially unequal      communities are more likely to die before the age of 75.      Asnational income inequality decreases, so do social and      health problems. This decline can be seen in Scandinavian      countries,where having a more equal gross domestic product      per capita results in a higher quality of life. To make this      possible for theUnited States, corporations must be regulated      and held accountable by lawmakers to be sure that the      American people arereceiving the representation they deserve.      As citizens, we must be responsible in electing officials who      will place the needs ofthe greater population[[Page S360]]     above the interests of wealthy corporate executives.       Our nation is at a turning point in itshistory, and the      choices we make today will have lasting effects on future      generations.       The United States of America willremain a strong,      respected, and prosperous nation if we are able to look past      our disagreements and focus on making progressthrough      compromise. We must act wisely, and keep our eyes on what is      most important--the liberty we treasure as our      nation'scrowning promise.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS359.txt,CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS359.xml,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017,20,January
