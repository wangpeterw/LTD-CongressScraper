                  EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR EQUAL PAY DAY

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of Equal Pay Day.
  The Equal Pay Act became law more than 50 years ago, and today women 
comprise almost half of the American workforce. They serve in our 
hospitals, schools, and our factories. They are executives at major 
corporations. They are doctors, they are lawyers, and they serve in 
countless other occupations that make our economy one of the greatest 
in the world.
  Yet, women are still disadvantaged by the gender wage gap. They are 
compensated at only 80 cents for every dollar earned by a man.
  This must not continue. It is unjust, it prevents a fair and 
productive economy, and is something that we need to close, this gap. 
Closing the wage gap is an economic imperative.
