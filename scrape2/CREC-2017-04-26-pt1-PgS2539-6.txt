                     NOMINATION OF ALEXANDER ACOSTA

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, I am pleased that 
the Senate voted yesterday to confirm Rod Rosenstein to serve as Deputy 
Attorney General, despite the unnecessary delay, and I look forward to 
advancing another nominee today.
  For the past 8 years, burdensome regulations put forth by the Obama 
administration have held back our economy and taken a toll on too many 
hard-working Americans. Fortunately, we now have an administration that 
has already proven its commitment to easing the regulatory burden on 
our economy and advancing policies that actually promote economic 
growth and job creation.
  The Department of Labor nominee before us today, Alexander Acosta, 
shares that commitment, and he has just the right experience to address 
these issues. He was previously confirmed to three positions by voice 
votes here in the Senate, meaning not a single Senator of either party 
recorded a vote in opposition, so it is no surprise that he has earned 
a host of bipartisan support for his current nomination as well. We 
should confirm him without delay. The sooner we do, the sooner he can 
advance labor policies that put American workers, businesses, and our 
economy first.
