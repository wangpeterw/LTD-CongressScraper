                           THE ACT OF NO DEAL

  (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, more and more Americans are recognizing 
that Donald Trump is unfit to be President--his divisive tactics, his 
racism, and his mendacity--but this Trump shutdown has shown further 
that he is truly incapable of being President.
  His fabled dealmaking ability appears to be just a television act. 
When he reaches an agreement, his extremist cohorts will not let him 
close the deal. He mistakes tweeting for government. He just cannot 
lead.
  Since this Trump shutdown began, this self-described ``stable 
genius'' has failed to hold a single bipartisan meeting, nor even make 
a public appearance, though he did dispatch his son, Eric, to declare--
amazingly--that the government shutdown is a ``good thing for us.''
  It is not a good thing for America. This Congress must lead in 
supporting the needs of our people and recognizing that we must put 
America first in this situation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
