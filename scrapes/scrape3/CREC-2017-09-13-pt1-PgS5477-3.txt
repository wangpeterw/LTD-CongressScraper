                       REMEMBERING PETE DOMENICI

  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to hear about the 
passing of my friend and former colleague, Senator Pete Domenici, a 
great American who dedicated his life and career to public service. I 
had the great privilege of serving alongside Pete for many years and 
knew him as a gentleman who always behaved in the highest traditions of 
the Senate. Pete was a knowledgeable and pragmatic leader who knew how 
to reach across the aisle to advance bipartisan solutions to the 
Nation's biggest problems. Perhaps the best example of his skill for 
compromise was when he negotiated the Nation's last balanced budget in 
1997. Pete represented the very best ideals of the U.S. Senate and left 
an indelible mark on this Chamber. Cindy and I extend our deepest 
condolences to Nancy and the entire Domenici family as they mourn the 
loss of a great man.
