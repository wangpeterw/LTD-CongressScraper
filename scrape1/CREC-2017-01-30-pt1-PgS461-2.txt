                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, who inhabits eternity, whose throne is Heaven and whose 
footstool is the Earth, You have given us the gift of this day, and we 
will rejoice and be glad in it.
  May our lawmakers never forget that they borrow their heartbeat from 
You. Continue to sustain them and give them all that they need to 
glorify Your Name. May Your Spirit move them that they will make 
concessions without coercion and be conciliatory without compromising. 
Compel them to be just and honest in all their dealings. May they 
remember that our country is no better than its citizens and no 
stronger than its commitment to righteousness. Lord, bless our Senators 
in their going out and coming in, their rising up and lying down, their 
labor and their leisure.
  We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.
