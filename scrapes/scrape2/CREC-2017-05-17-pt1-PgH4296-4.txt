               THANK YOU TO LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS

  (Mr. GARRETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, during this National Police Week, I wish 
to, on behalf of myself and the fine citizens of the Fifth District of 
Virginia, extend our thank-you.
  Since 1791, greater than 22,000 law enforcement professionals have 
given their lives in the line of duty--over 70 in a single day in 2001, 
including 37 from the NYPD and 23 from the Port Authority Police--an 
average of over 140 a year. And yet these men and women who look like 
us--every race, every color, every gender--are the best of us because 
every day they get up and go to work again.
  Mr. Speaker, when I served in the military, I became familiar with 
Isaiah 6:8, and I cite that verse in thanking our law enforcement 
professionals:
  And then the voice of the Lord spoke to us and said, ``Whom shall I 
send? And who will go for us?'' And I said, ``Here am I. Send me.''
  Mr. Speaker, take that as a thank-you from myself and the citizens of 
the Fifth District of Virginia to those professional men and women who 
serve us every day.
