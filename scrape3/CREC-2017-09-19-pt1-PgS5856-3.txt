                        TRIBUTE TO SABRINA LIANG

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Sabrina for her hard work as 
an intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize her efforts and 
contributions to my office, as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Sabrina is a native of California. She currently attends Wellesley 
College, where she is studying political science. She has demonstrated 
a strong work ethic, which has made her an invaluable asset to our 
office. The quality of her work is reflected in her great efforts over 
the last several months.
  I want to thank Sabrina for the dedication she has shown while 
working for me and my staff. It was a pleasure to have her as part of 
our team. I know she will have continued success with all of her future 
endeavors. I wish her all my best on her next journey.
