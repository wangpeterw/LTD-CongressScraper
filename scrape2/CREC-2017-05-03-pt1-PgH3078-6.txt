           MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD AWARDED UNIT OF THE YEAR

  (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a Minnesota 
National Guard unit for recently receiving the prestigious John J. 
Stanko Army National Guard Unit of the Year Award.
  During their deployment, which included soldiers spread across 
multiple locations, the Bravo Company 2 of the 211th General Support 
Aviation Battalion completed more than 300 missions across Afghanistan, 
enduring some of the most difficult and dangerous environments 
imaginable. Additionally, they moved an incredible 1 million pounds of 
cargo and participated in high-risk missions and deliberate operations 
to support forces on the ground.
  Due to their overall excellent performance, the Bravo Company 
soldiers have been awarded three Bronze Stars, several Air Medals, 
eight Combat Action Badges, three Meritorious Service Medals, five Army 
Commendation Medals, and 14 Army Achievement Medals.
  The Bravo Company's achievements have earned them the reputation as 
one of the best Army aviation units serving in Afghanistan. We are 
proud to know that these soldiers call Minnesota their home.
  I want to thank these soldiers for their brave service to our Nation, 
their unwavering dedication to their unit, and the honorable way in 
which they have served. You are the reason the United States Armed 
Forces are the best in the world.
