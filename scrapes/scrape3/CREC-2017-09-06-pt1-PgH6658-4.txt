                              PROTECT DACA

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of the DACA program.
  Since the announcement of the end of this important program, I have 
heard from countless DREAMers who, in a word, are terrified. These are 
young people who are brought to our country as children and are now 
living, studying, and working in our communities.
  One constituent's story, in particular, has stayed with me. This 
young woman was brought to our country at the age of 5. America is the 
only home she has ever known.
  She was raised in San Diego, educated in San Diego, and now works in 
San Diego helping other immigrants transition more seamlessly into our 
society.
  The administration's decision to end DACA is a broken promise to her, 
the 40,000 DREAMers in San Diego, and the 800,000 DREAMers across the 
country.
  But even in the face of this betrayal, she called on us to ``act with 
love and lead with inclusion.''
  With this call to action in mind, I hope my colleagues commit to 
protecting the DACA program and DREAMers.
