                 CELEBRATING 25 YEARS OF THE FOOD TRUST

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as chairman 
of the Committee on Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition to honor The 
Food Trust on celebrating 25 years of helping improve food security in 
Pennsylvania.
  The Food Trust is a nonprofit founded in 1992 in Philadelphia that 
works to develop a stable food supply in underserved communities, 
educate youth and family about healthy eating, and improve the 
connection between urban communities and regional farmers.
  A number of Food Trust programs have become national models that have 
expanded beyond Philadelphia to other regions in need of healthy food 
access and nutrition education. The Food Trust provides nutrition 
education for youth and adults in Philadelphia and the wider region, 
serving more than 70,000 lower-income individuals.
  It also increases access to nutritious food in underserved 
communities by operating a network of 22 farmers markets in lower-
income city neighborhoods, which accept SNAP benefits for the use of 
onsite wireless card readers.
  I commend The Food Trust for the fine work it does promoting food 
education and to ensure that no one goes hungry in America.
  Congratulations on 25 years.
