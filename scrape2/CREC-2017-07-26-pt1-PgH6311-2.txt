                     AUGUST 21 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, on August 21, a total solar eclipse will 
stretch from coast to coast in the United States for the first time in 
99 years, and I am proud to say that my district in southern Illinois 
is the prime viewing spot.
  In fact, my home county of Jackson County near Carbondale, and also 
my front yard, is where the eclipse will be at its apex.
  For 2 minutes and 38 seconds, it will be like total darkness in the 
middle of the day. The city's population of 26,000 is expected to 
multiply many times over from visitors around the world coming for 
tourism and to see this astronomical Super Bowl.
  So I would encourage my colleagues and the American people to visit 
for some world championship southern Illinois barbecue, the beautiful 
outdoors, the wonderful wineries, and welcome one and all people for 
the best viewing moments of this solar eclipse.
