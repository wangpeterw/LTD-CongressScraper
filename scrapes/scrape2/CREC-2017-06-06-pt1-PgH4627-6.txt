                          NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH

  (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the great men and 
women and their families that drive Minnesota's dairy industry. This 
month is National Dairy Month. In fact, considering the amount of milk 
and other dairy products we consume on a daily basis in the United 
States and beyond, one could argue that we already remember and 
recognize our dairy farmers every day.
  In Minnesota, our dairy farmers produce nearly 10 billion pounds of 
milk each year. Our dairy farmers, along with their industry colleagues 
across the country, not only bring billions of dollars to our economy, 
they are vital to a strong and healthy population.
  Our dairy farmers work extremely hard. Many, in addition to their 
dairy operation, have to maintain a job off the farm to make ends meet.
  So, during National Dairy Month, when you drink a glass of milk, have 
a milk-filled bowl of cereal, eat a piece of cheese or that cup of 
yogurt, let's stop and remember the hardworking men and women of our 
dairy industry and their importance to our economy and their commitment 
to our health.
