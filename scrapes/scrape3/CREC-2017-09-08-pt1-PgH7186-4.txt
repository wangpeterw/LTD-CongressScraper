                                  DACA

  (Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of thousands of DREAMers across the country.
  This week, as you know, President Trump threatened to kick these 
children out of the only country they have ever known.
  In New York, we have over 40,000 DACA kids who work hard and 
contribute to our communities. And if the President or anyone thinks 
these DREAMers are somehow a threat to our country, well, I would like 
you to meet Laura Garcia.
  Laura is a neighbor of mine who lives in Orange County, New York. She 
was brought here from Mexico at 8 years old. She has lived here for 
nearly her entire life and done everything the right way, right here in 
the United States.
  Laura was elected vice president of her high school. She works three 
jobs to pay her way through Dutchess Community College. In the few 
spare moments she has, she volunteers to help others.
  Laura has DACA status, which means she is registered with the 
program. She paid a fee, she passed a criminal background check, and 
she has stayed out of trouble. She has done everything we have asked 
her to do, and she has done it the right way.
  All of us would be proud to have a daughter like Laura. America has 
hundreds of thousands of sons and daughters just like Laura. These are 
our children.
  So for those who say that DREAMers like Laura should go home, I say 
they can't go home because they are home. This is their home.
