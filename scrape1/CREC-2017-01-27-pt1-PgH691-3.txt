                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Scott Wilson, Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Our gracious God, we come today with thanks and gratitude for Your 
presence, with thanks for this beautiful land we call home, and with 
thanks for Your guidance as we seek to serve our fellow citizens.
  We ask Your blessings for all of those who choose to take up the 
difficult task of governing, not only those who are elected, but also 
those who serve as staffers, interns, and volunteers. Strengthen all of 
us and help us to show forth the fruits of Your spirit of love, joy, 
peace, and generosity as we go about our work. Grant us a spirit of 
compassion and cooperation.
  May the peace that passes all understanding guide our hearts and 
minds in the days to come.
  Amen.
