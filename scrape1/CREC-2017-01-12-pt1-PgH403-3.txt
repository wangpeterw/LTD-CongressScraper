                   EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS LEGISLATION

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
legislation, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, H.R. 437.Last 
year in Florida alone, we witnessed terrorism, major hurricanes, and 
the outbreak of the Zika virus. We need to be preparedfor these types 
of emergencies, and we need to make sure our first responders have the 
tools they need to keep us safe.
  My bill enhances medical preparedness and promotes the stockpiling of 
medical countermeasures. This includes medical kits,protective gear, 
ventilators, and more. Importantly, the legislation uses existing grant 
funds to accomplish this. It does notrequire new or additional funding.
  This Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act ensures we take these 
critical steps now so we are ready in case of crisis. Inthe wake of an 
emergency, our first responders bravely risk their lives on behalf of 
our safety. I introduced this bill toprotect the public and protect our 
protecters.
