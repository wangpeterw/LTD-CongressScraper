                      TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the many veterans 
and the work that Congress is doing to support and represent them on 
the House floor this week. These are the heroes who keep us safe and 
secure each and every day.
  This week, this body passed a few important bills to streamline 
access to care for veterans as well as provide new and better 
opportunities for veteran-owned businesses and veterans seeking 
employment.
  Last month, the unemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans 
increased to 6.3 percent, marking the fourth time in the last 7 months 
that group's percentage has been higher than the overall veteran 
unemployment rate. That means that about 211,000 Iraq and Afghanistan 
veterans are still looking for work. That is 211,000 too many.
  That is why one of the bills we passed this week establishes a 
Federal program recognizing private businesses that employ veterans and 
engage in community service to help our veterans.
  Mr. Speaker, helping our Nation's veterans who have sacrificed so 
much for us is a critical priority and remains one of the most 
important objectives of this Congress. I will continue to use my time 
and effort to fight for every opportunity to support them when they 
return home to give them the hero's welcome they deserve.
