        CONGRATULATING JOANNA HARLACHER ON AWARD-WINNING WEBSITE

  (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a student from 
my district who has achieved something truly remarkable.
  More than half a million students from around the world participated 
in this year's National History Day contest, each one making a film, 
exhibit, website, or other presentation on this year's theme, which was 
``Taking a Stand in History.''
  Joanna Harlacher, a graduate of Donegal High School, took first place 
for her website. Her website focused on someone we all know and love: 
fellow Pennsylvanian Fred Rogers. Joanna used to watch reruns of his 
PBS show and wanted to showcase his impact on Americans during his life 
and his career.
  I would also like to recognize retired Donegal teacher Elizabeth 
Lewis, who helped Joanna create the award-winning website.
  Mr. Speaker, I couldn't be prouder to represent this exceptional 
young woman and thousands of students across my district who impress us 
each and every day.
  Congratulations, Joanna Harlacher, her family, Mrs. Lewis, and 
Donegal High School on this globally recognized accomplishment.
