              NUNES MEMO HAS NO IMPACT ON THE RUSSIA PROBE

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the Nunes memo was 
released over the objections of the FBI, the Department of Justice, 
Democratic Members of the House Intelligence Committee, and several 
Republican Senators. This selectively edited document was political in 
nature from the outset, as is evident in the gap between what some of 
my colleagues claimed it contained and what the memo actually says.
  The Nunes memo focuses on the most recent warrants for surveillance 
of Carter Page, who has reportedly been

under watch since 2013 for his relationship with the Russian 
Government, years before his involvement with the Trump campaign. Yet 
this document in no way questions those facts, while new reporting has 
since revealed that Mr. Page boasted of his role as a Kremlin adviser 
as far back as 5 years ago, when the first FISA warrants against him 
were reportedly issued.
  As Oversight Chairman Gowdy has noted, the Nunes memo has no impact 
on the Russia probe, and Special Counsel Mueller's work must continue 
unabated to allow the American public to know the full truth.
