                          REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax scam will raise taxes 
on 36 million middle class Americans, undermine Medicare, and explode 
the deficit. It will saddle our children and grandchildren with more 
than $1 trillion in additional debt simply to pay for an unnecessary, 
un-American, unconscionable tax cut for millionaires, billionaires, 
special interests, corporations, and big donors.

  To justify this reckless Ponzi scheme, the Treasury Department has 
produced a 1-page analysis.
  Really? One page? That is the best you can do?
  You are insulting the intelligence of the American people, insulting 
the intelligence of this Congress, and insulting the intelligence of 
our Democratic republic.
  The American people deserve a better deal.
