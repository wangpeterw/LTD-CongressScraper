In 1986, working as a LouisianaState trooper, Bobby Smith, from Buckeye, Louisiana, was shot in the face and blinded in the line of duty. He not only lost hissight, but also lost the career that he deeply loved.  Never one to succumb to adversity, Bobby earned a Ph.D., authoredbooks, and set out on a path of helping others. In 2001, he organized the Foundation for Officers Recovering from This foundation helped provide training and counseling to law enforcement individuals, firefighters, emergency servicespersonnel, and their families going through tough times from various traumatic events.  Bobby's will to help others wouldcarry him through his personal challenges as he traveled across the United States and throughout the world literally sharing hisstory and lifting up others. Before his death in October of this year, Mr.Smith had addressed and touched the lives of over 1million people.  Many who knew Bobby would often hear him say, ``I see. I see.'' Today, as we remember Bobby Smith, let usnot be blinded by our own tragedies, adversities, and obstacles in our lives, but let us also have the courage that Bobby had tolook beyond and see the beauty of life and see the good in others.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH57-2.txt,2244,STATE SPONSORS OF TERROR REVIEW ENHANCEMENT ACT--115TH CONGRESS,2017.0,4.0,January

I rise today to express concern and strong opposition to President-elect Trump Cabinet nominations for Attorney General, Secretary of Education,[[Page H226]]and Secretary of Health and Human President-elect Trump chose not to practice what he preached, and he didn't drain the swamp. Instead, he nominated politically divisive individuals to serve in his administration.  Throughout a public service career spanning more than 30 years, Senator Sessions used the power of the courts to discriminate against civil rights leaders. He allegedly used racially charged language to disparage minorities, expressed support for the KKK, and then tried to dismiss it as a joke. He celebrated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act and opposed same-sex marriage. He denied the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade and voted against greater access to health care for veterans.

One of the most important investments families make is in their children. The Secretary of Education must be committed to providing a free, world-class education to all students regardless of race, gender, ability, status, financial means, or geography.  Unfortunately, Betsy DeVos has consistently fought for private school vouchers that divert funds from public schools, our communities, and our children who need these investments the most. She has even used her personal wealth to lobby against important transparency and accountability measures that would have provided necessary safeguards for Michigan students.  DeVos' track record of undermining public education and her lack of commitment to defending the civil rights of students causes me great pause in her quest to become Secretary of I can't support it. Betsy DeVos, absolutely no.  Finally, Chairman He has made it clear that his budget priorities are highly partisan. We can expect that if he is confirmed, he will strip 20 million people of affordable health care, women would be denied their right to contraception and reproductive health care, and devastating cuts would be levied against Medicaid funding.

1894,topic-id,1565,"Mr.President, we are engaged in the first step to debate what is important to virtually every What we want to do is to find good ways to reform and replace ObamaCare and then repeal the provisions of it that have damaged so many  Before we start talking about a big subject, sometimes it helps to ask the question: Exactly what are we talking about? So, very quickly, where do Americans get our health care insurance? It might be interesting to note that 91 percent of us have some sort of health insurance--290 million. We get it from four places, basically. One is Medicare--18 percent of us with insurance. This is not a bill to change That is a discussion for another day. So we are talking about these three areas.  One is employers, on the job. Sixty-one percent of us with insurance get it on the job--178 million people.  Medicaid, managed by States, paid for by the Federal and State governments--22 percent of covered Americans there get their insurance through  Then there is the individual market, people who buy it on their own. That includes the exchanges we hear so much about. Here is where all the news is; here is where the turmoil is. That is just 6 percent of everyone who is insured, although that is 18 million This is information from the U. Who is not insured? That is interesting too. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are 27 million people who aren't insured, but 17 million of those are eligible for some help to get insurance and just haven't taken it. Of the 11 million who are not eligible for any help, nearly half of them--5 million--are illegally here. Of the rest, some make too much money to be eligible for assistance, and some dropped through the Medicaid coverage gap. So it is fair to say that 91 percent of us are insured one way or the other. Then, of the 27 million--the 9 percent who are not insured--17 million of those are eligible for some sort of assistance.  How should we approach this? Following the Presidential election, President-Elect Donald Trump said on ``60 Minutes'' that replacement and repeal of ObamaCare would be done ``simultaneously.'' To me, that means at the same time.  Just today, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that repeal and replacement of ObamaCare would be done concurrently. To me, simultaneously and concurrently mean ObamaCare should finally be repealed only when there are concrete practical reforms in place--that give Americans access to truly affordable health care. Let me say that again: ObamaCare should be repealed, finally, only when there are concrete, practical reforms in place that give Americans access to truly affordable health care.  The American people deserve health care reform that is done in the right way for the right reasons and in the right amount of time. It is not about developing a quick fix. It is about working toward a long-term recovery that works for everyone.  Here is one way to think about what simultaneously or concurrently might mean. I would ask you to think about ObamaCare as if it were a local bridge in, say, South Dakota that is collapsing--because that is just what is happening with According to the Tennessee Insurance Commission, the ObamaCare insurance market in our State is ``very near collapse.'' Across the country, premiums and copays are up. Employers have cut jobs to afford ObamaCare costs. Medicaid mandates are consuming State budgets. In one-third of America's counties, citizens with Federal subsidies have only a single choice of a company to buy insurance from on an ObamaCare exchange. Without quick action this year, next year, these Americans may have zero choices. Their subsidies may be worth about as much as a bus ticket in a town where no buses run.  If your local bridge in South Dakota or Wyoming or Tennessee were very near collapse, what would you do? I think the first thing you do is to send in a rescue crew to repair it temporarily so no one else is hurt. Then you start building a better bridge--or more accurately, many bridges--as States develop their own plans for providing truly affordable health care to replace the old bridge.  Finally, when the new bridges are finished, you close the old bridge. That is how we propose to proceed: to rescue those trapped in a failing system that is ObamaCare, to replace that system with a functional market or markets, and then repeal ObamaCare for good.  First, we will offer a rescue plan so that the 11 million Americans who buy insurance now on the exchanges can continue to do so while we build a better set of concrete, practical alternatives.  Second, we will build the better systems. Note that I say systems, not one system. If anyone is expecting Senator McConnell to roll a wheelbarrow onto the Senate floor with a great big comprehensive Republican health care plan, they are going to be waiting a long time because we don't believe in that. We don't want to replace a failed ObamaCare Federal system with another failed Federal system.  We want to create many systems across this country, step-by-step, to give Americans more choices of insurance that cost less. We will do this by moving more health care decisions out of Washington and into the hands of State and patients and by reducing harmful taxes. We will do it carefully, step-by-step, so that it is effective.  Finally, we will repeal what remains of the law that did all of this damage and created all of this risk. That is what we will do.[[Page S196]]  Here is what we will not do. This is not a bill for Medicare reform. That will be handled separately.  Second, you won't be disqualified from getting insurance if you have a preexisting health condition. If you are under the age of 26, you will still be able to be covered under your parents' plan.  That is what, in my opinion, we mean by repeal and replace ``simultaneously,'' as the President-elect said, or ``concurrently,'' as Speaker Ryan said.  Here are three steps we will take beginning immediately. 1 is the rescue plan. Six percent of Americans with insurance buy their insurance in this individual market, about two-thirds of those on the ObamaCare exchanges. This is where today's turmoil is. This is where the copays are up, the premiums are up, where insurance companies are pulling out of the markets.  While we build replacements, we want the 11 million Americans who now buy insurance on the exchanges to be able to continue to buy private insurance. This will require Congress and the President to take action before March 1, which is when the insurance companies begin to decide whether they will offer insurance in these markets during 2018.  In general, the goal is to get as close as possible to allowing any State-approved plan to count as health insurance under ObamaCare rules while we are transitioning to new systems. Among the actions that will help are to allow individuals to use their ObamaCare subsidies to purchase State-approved insurance outside the ObamaCare exchanges; to adjust ObamaCare's special enrollment periods; to approve the temporary continuation of cost-sharing subsidies for deductibles and copays; to allow States more flexibility to determine so-called essential health benefits, age rating rules, and small group restrictions; to expand health savings accounts; eventually, to provide tax credits to help lower-income Americans buy insurance; and to repeal the individual mandate when new insurance market rules are in place.  When the new administration rewrites the guidance on ObamaCare section 1332 State innovation waivers to allow for more State flexibility, States will have the authority to further innovate to build more modern health systems.  Now, second is employer insurance. Remember, that is where 61 percent of us get our insurance--on the job. We will repair the damage ObamaCare has done so that employers can offer employees more personalized patient-centered care. We will do that by repealing ObamaCare's employer mandate penalty. We will allow States to determine the so-called essential health benefits and thereby lower costs for small businesses. We will repeal ObamaCare's restrictions on grandfathered health plans, on wellness benefits, on small group plans, and provide more flexibility for small businesses so they can work together to buy insurance--a proposal for which the Senator from Wyoming has championed for years.  This will mean more State authority, more choices, and lower costs for the 178 million Americans who obtain insurance on the job.  Third is Twenty-two percent of all insured Americans are covered by We will give States more flexibility to offer those 62 million citizens more options by making Federal Medicaid waivers more flexible.  So in summary, we will first send in a rescue crew to repair temporarily a collapsing health care market so no one else is hurt. Second, step-by-step, we will build better systems--that give Americans access to truly affordable health care. We will do this by moving health care decisions out of Washington, DC, and back to States and patients.  Finally, when our reforms become concrete practical alternatives, we will repeal the remaining parts of ObamaCare in order to repair the damage it has caused This is what I believe we mean when we say ObamaCare should be repealed and replaced simultaneously and concurrently.

1896,topic-id,813,"Mr.President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, who has spent a great deal of time on this. I like the way he put that because I think what we want to assure people of--at least, I think that is what almost all of us feel--is that this is step 1. It involves reforms, replacing, and repealing--as the President-elect has said, ``simultaneously,'' and as the Speaker has said, ``concurrently.'' It involves not just one big system replaced by another big system. In our view, the one big system needs to be replaced step-by-step by many different systems as we move more decisions to the  For example, on employer insurance, or people who get their insurance on the job, we know right now steps that we can take to repeal ObamaCare, which damaged the employer system and which increased costs for employers. I remember sitting around with a group of restaurant company chief executive officers 6 years ago when ObamaCare passed. They pointed out that they were going have to hire fewer people to afford the cost of  We don't want that to happen. We would like for them to be able to hire more people and to offer more people insurance. How would we do that? Well, if we repeal the Washington rules in an orderly way and transfer back to the States responsibility for regulating most insurance, the insurance commissioners have told us they believe they can do that very well--do it one way in South Dakota, another way in Tennessee, another way in Wyoming, and fit the needs of that community, reduce costs, increase choices, and have truly affordable health care.  So we can repeal those provisions that interfere with employer insurance and make sure that that repeal does not go into effect until South Dakota, Wyoming, Tennessee, and other parts of the market have in place concrete practical alternatives so they go together. But we have to get started. This is step 1.  Now, we can do the same with We have a former Governor of South Dakota in the Governors spend most of their time trying to figure out how to afford They almost feel that, if Washington would just allow the States to have more[[Page S197]]flexibility in terms of how the available money is spent, we could cover more people better, offer more options.  Well, we can do that. But we are not going to do that tomorrow. We will have to sit down with the Governors and say: How do you suggest we do this? Then, as we do that, we can repeal the extensive Federal regulation that creates a jungle of redtape for But it only would take effect as the States tell us that there are concrete practical alternatives in effect. So this is the step-by-step way to go about making those kind of changes.  Finally, as the Senator said, we have to have a rescue team here. I mean, the ObamaCare market is in turmoil. It is only 6 percent of all of those who have insurance, but that is millions of people. If we don't act before March 1 to make sure insurance companies are selling into those markets, we will have many millions of people who will not be able to buy insurance. This will be, as I said, like having a bus ticket in a hometown with no buses running.  So that is really one of the first things we have to do--get that rescue team going. I like the analogy of the collapsing bridge. ObamaCare is collapsing in Tennessee, and I would say it is around the country, if you have one-third of the counties where you can only choose insurance from one company.  So, if a bridge is collapsing, you send in a crew to deal with that emergency so no one else is hurt. Then you start building these new bridges. After a while, in a prudent way, as you build each of those systems, as States build their systems, then you close that old broken-down bridge that was damaging so many people.  So that is an orderly way to go about things. I hope that, over time, we will have bipartisan support for these. We need a consensus. We don't, in the end, want to have just a partisan bill. But we have been acting like the Hatfields and McCoys in West Virginia for 6 years, arguing with each other about ObamaCare--Republicans and  So it may take a little while to get there. But we can start, and we are starting under the leadership of Senator Then, we will move concurrently and simultaneously to reform, replace, and repeal ObamaCare so that Americans have access to truly affordable insurance. By the time we get to that, I am hopeful that we will begin to have a consensus within this body that involves Democrats and Republicans both.

1561,topic-id,1743,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to join my colleagues--Democrats, Independents--to fight together to protect the health and economic security of the American people.  In 2012, when I was elected to the Senate, I can assure you that the people of Wisconsin did not send me here to take their health care away.  We are barely into the second week of the new Congress, and the Republican establishment is already wielding its power to accomplish just one thing, making America sick again.  The budget resolution that we are considering this week will repeal the Affordable Care Act, put insurance companies back in charge of people's health care, strip health care away from millions of Americans, and raise premiums. It will take us from affordable coverage to chaos.  This is the first step toward higher costs, fewer people with health insurance, and more uncertainty for American families. In short, the Republicans believe they have a mandate to make America sick. By repealing the law and taking away the health care that families already have, Republicans are forcing 30 million Americans to lose their insurance.  Republicans are putting the health care coverage of over 200,000 Wisconsinites at risk, and they are raising taxes on more than 190,000 Wisconsinites who rely on and receive premium tax credits to help them afford high quality health insurance.  Instead, they are giving tax breaks to big corporations and handing over control to the insurance companies, which will be free, once again, to deny coverage if you have a preexisting condition, to jack up premiums simply because you are a woman, and to drop your coverage if you get sick or have a baby.  I could continue to list some very disturbing facts and statistics of what this Republican repeal of health care reform will do to our working class and what it will mean to rip away protections from families struggling with cancer or other serious illnesses, but these facts seem to fall flat on the other side of the aisle. So, instead, I am demanding that my Republican colleagues listen--not to me but to the calls from the real people who we are here to represent and fight for, our constituents back home.  I demand that they listen to Randy is from Rhinelander, Randy told me that the Affordable Care Act has been a ``savior'' for his wife, who was diagnosed with kidney failure more than 2 years ago as a result of an autoimmune disease. She has to have dialysis three times a week.  The law eliminated her lifetime maximum limit, and that helps them afford her lifesaving care, and it prevents her from being denied coverage because of her preexisting condition.  Randy said that repealing the law will force them to face the harsh reality of not only losing insurance but also declaring bankruptcy.  I also heard from Sheila, from Neenah, Sheila is a small business owner who relies on the premium tax credits that helped her purchase her health plan through the marketplace. She writes:       I just wanted to let you know how devastating it will be      for my family if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. To take      away the subsidies would pretty much turn the plan into the      Unaffordable Care  Sheila has owned a small hair salon for 35 years and said that the premium tax credits under the law have made it possible for her to buy decent health insurance for the first time in her whole career.  I want my Republican colleagues to listen to Joel is a physician from He is on the frontlines of delivering high quality health care, and he told me that he had witnessed tremendous good that has occurred as a result of the health care law. He has been able to provide his patients with better care because they have increased coverage. He is especially aware of the positive impact of allowing children to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26.  But Joel remembers the days before the Affordable Care He said that he has seen firsthand the insurance companies callously denying or dropping coverage for families with preexisting conditions or those struggling with a new diagnosis. He doesn't want to go back to the days when insurance companies were in charge and literally dictated his patients' health.  I want my Republican colleagues to listen to Chelsea from Shelby, When Chelsea was pregnant with her daughter Zoe, she learned that Zoe would be born with a congenital heart defect. At just 5 days old, Zoe had to have open heart surgery. She had it at Children's Hospital in Wauwatosa, WI, and was fighting for her life. Thankfully, she is recovering, and she is living a healthy life.  Chelsea wrote to me:       The Affordable Care Act protects my daughter, it allows her      to have health care access and not be denied. I'm pleading to      you as a mother to fight for that and follow through on that      promise. There are so many kids in Wisconsin with heart      defects (as well as other kids with pre-existing conditions)      that are counting on you to protect that right.  So for Zoe, I want to call on my Republican colleagues to stand with me--with all of us--to protect these health care rights and benefits for all of our families.  These are our families who are benefitting right now from the protections in the law and the quality, affordable health care options it provides. They are calling on Congress, calling on the Republican majority to stop their plot that is going to take this all away.  I could continue to share stories of real Wisconsinites whose coverage is at risk today, but I want to take a moment to illustrate what life was like before the Affordable Care Act was the law of the land, before these sweeping reforms and protections had been put in place.  Now, during my time in the House of Representatives, Sue from Beloit, WI, reached out to me. She told me:       My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. After treatment      began, we found out that the insurance company had a small      loophole. Under our insurance, they have a $13,000 limit per      year on radiation and chemotherapy.       That amount did not even cover the first treatment of      either radiation or chemo.[[Page S171]]       I was not going to have my husband die for lack of      treatment, so we started to use our savings and our available      credit to pay for medical expenses.       My husband later died.  She told me:       After having completely depleted our savings and facing      insurmountable credit card debt, I had no choice but to file      bankruptcy. . . .  Sue's devastating ordeal was a common story all across our country, almost 8 years ago, before health care reform was enacted to prohibit lifetime caps and to restrict annual limits on care.  Before the health law, I heard from too many working Wisconsin families that went bankrupt, sold their homes, and even spent their entire life's savings just to get the health care that they needed. This was when America was sick and when lawmakers prioritized the health of insurance companies over the health of the American people. Republicans will take us back to those days when they vote to make America sick again.  I want to share one last story about life before the Affordable Care Act, and that is my own. As many of you may know, I was raised by my maternal grandparents in Madison, When I was just 9 years old, I was diagnosed with a serious childhood illness similar to spinal meningitis, and I spent 3 months at the age of 9 years old in the hospital. My grandparents had health insurance but learned that their plan didn't cover me. Since their insurance didn't cover me, they made incredible sacrifices to pay for the care that I needed. When I got better, my grandparents did what any responsible parent or grandparent would do: They looked for an insurance policy that would cover me into the future, but look as they might, they discovered that because of my previous illness, they couldn't find a policy. They couldn't find it from any insurer at any price, and at 9 years old I had been branded with those magic words: preexisting condition.  Well, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, children today have new protections, and no one can be denied insurance coverage because of a preexisting condition. My family experience helped inspire me to enter public service and to fight to ensure that every American has quality, affordable health care as a right, not a privilege. This is what I fought for and will continue to fight with my colleagues to protect, these vital benefits that the health care law guarantees to all Wisconsinites and families across this great country.  But we cannot fight alone. Republicans are hard at work making America sick again, taking us back from affordable care to chaos, handing over the reins to insurance companies and driving up health care costs for all I call on them to stand accountable to our families. It is the American people that we are charged to represent. I call on them to join us to fight for Sue who was forced into medical bankruptcy. I call on them to fight to protect Zoe from predatory insurance companies who want to deny her coverage because of her heart condition, to fight for Sheila and other entrepreneurs like her, and to fight for our health care professionals, nurse's aides, occupational therapists, physical therapists like Joel, and to fight for Randy and his wife as they battle her kidney failure.  We have been ready for over 6 years to work together to keep all that works with the Affordable Care Act and to fix what doesn't, but instead of working on bipartisan reforms to improve the Affordable Care Act, this Republican plan to repeal historic health care reforms will create nothing short of chaos. I know I speak for my colleagues, my Democratic colleagues and Independent colleagues, in saying that we are here and we will stay here on the floor because we are ready. We are ready to work across the aisle to protect coverage and to improve the Affordable Care Act, but we will not help you make America sick again and we will not help you take away people's health care.

913,topic-id,694,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule governing these pieces of legislation and, in particular, the underlying legislation, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny, or REINS Act, H.26.  Mr.Speaker, during the first two terms that I have served in this Congress, the most common question posed to me by my constituents in central and eastern Kentucky is: What is the biggest surprise that you have confronted as a Member of Congress?  Regrettably, Mr.Speaker, the biggest surprise that I have discovered as a Member of Congress is that Congress is no longer in charge. Regrettably, unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch run the country.                              {time}  1315  Most of the laws that are enacted in this country at the Federal level come out of unelected bureaucrats in administrative agencies in the executive branch. Members of Congress, even though we are elected by the American people to be the lawmaking branch under Article I of the Constitution, we can't stop it. We can't stop these rules and regulations.  So I am proud to have consistently supported the REINS Act because it reasserts the powers of this body and this Congress under Article I of the Constitution, which provides: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be invested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.''  What does this mean?  The most important word in Article I of the Constitution is that first substantive word, ``all,'' implying that none of the legislative powers should be in any other branch of the Federal Government, and it certainly shouldn't be exercised by the executive branch. We know this as the nondelegation doctrine, the principle that Congress may not and should not delegate its administrative power to administrative agencies.  The nondelegation doctrine forces a politically accountable Congress to make policy choices rather than leave this to unelected administrative officials. Yet what we have seen over the last several decades, and especially over the last 8 years, has been the rise of an unaccountable, out-of-control administrative state. Over time, legislative powers that are vested exclusively in Congress by the Constitution have been increasingly and unconstitutionally claimed, assumed, and exercised by the executive branch.  Now unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats decide how you work, what goods and services you can buy and sell, and what you can do with your own property, all without accountability at the ballot box. So this state of affairs is fundamentally in conflict with the foundational, constitutional principle that Congress alone possesses the Federal legislative power.  Look, this has enormous economic consequences. It is costly to our economy, and I don't have to go into that. The estimates are $1.8 trillion in costs to the American economy. But the bigger issue is that none of these rules from these agencies have been approved--let alone, even considered--by Congress, even though they have a profound impact on the economy. So the measure we are considering today would simply require those regulations with the greatest economic impact to be approved by both Houses of Congress prior to their implementation.  This has two positive outcomes. First, obviously, it has the effect of blocking costly rules. Secondly, and more importantly, it will no longer allow Members of Congress to delegate their constitutional responsibility to the executive branch.  I will conclude, I heard my friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, make the argument that Congress is not even interested in these regulations and we are not capable of seriously reviewing these rules. This is about making sure that experts with specialized expertise in the executive branch review and promulgate these rules. But what are we doing here if[[Page H118]]that is true? We should turn out the lights, lock the door and leave, and give the keys of the government to the executive branch.  We had a Democratic administration over the last 8 years. We have a Republican administration coming. This is not about Republicans and This is not a partisan issue.

1874,topic-id,1337,"Mr.President, I would like to congratulate my colleague from South Dakota for his comments. I am hearing the same thing in Wyoming that he has been hearing about the ObamaCare health care law and the impact on people in his I am hearing the same thing. I heard it this past weekend in Wyoming talking to people about what impact ObamaCare has had on their lives.  It is very interesting because people all around the State of Wyoming are talking about the fact that their costs have gone up and choices have gone down. Many who had insurance that worked for them lost that insurance all related to a law passed in the House and the Senate and signed into law by President  Tonight, in Chicago, President Obama is going to give a farewell address. I am assuming he will talk about ObamaCare, and I am assuming he paints a very different picture than the American people have seen and are living with. The President is using scare tactics about what Republicans plan to do. No matter what President Obama wants, the American people have spoken. They have voted, and 8 out of 10 people say that what this costly and complicated health care law has done to them, they would like to see it either significantly changed or repealed and replaced. They know better than to believe what the Democrats are continuing to tell them because they have been living with it every day.  Seven years ago, Democrats made one false claim after another when they were trying to sell this law to the American people. Democrats said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. They said: If you liked your health care plan, you could keep your health care plan. That one was labeled the Lie of the Year a few years ago. They said premiums for the average family would go down by $2,500. None of it was true. Now Democrats are out telling more tales about All of these new stories are going to be just as false as the ones they told us all in the past. For one thing, Democrats have been saying that millions of Americans are going to lose their health insurance if we repeal the ObamaCare health care law.  In a letter just last week, Senators Schumer and Sanders said that Republicans are planning to take health care coverage away from more than 30 million It is not going to happen. The Democrats absolutely know it is not going to happen. It doesn't stop them from saying it.  The fact is, this should never have been about health insurance in the first place. As a doctor, I will tell you this should have been about health care and patients. Republicans are going to make sure that is where the focus is from now on. The number of people with good health insurance coverage under ObamaCare actually has been a lot less than what the Democrats are claiming. That is because lots of people who bought ObamaCare coverage only did it because the health care law forced them to give up the insurance they already had and liked and worked for them. I have heard many stories from people in Wyoming who had insurance. It worked for them. They chose it because it was best for them and their family, and they lost it because the President said it wasn't good enough for him. These are people who were hurt by the broken promises and by President Obama's well-earned award of Lie of the  With the health care law, most of the people who got insurance for the first time were actually forced into the broken system called Most of those people were actually eligible for Medicaid before the law was even signed, but for people who didn't have insurance before, a lot of them still can't afford care now because they may have insurance, but the deductibles are so high they can't afford to use it. Half of ObamaCare enrollees say they are skipping doctor visits in order to save money. If a family's health insurance doesn't cover the care they need, then the number of people covered is totally meaningless.  Democrats are out there saying that if we try to replace ObamaCare with a better solution, that it is just going to, in their words, cause chaos in the health insurance industry. Where have they been? There is chaos everywhere because of When you look at what Democrats did to America's health care system, what you see is chaos. Premiums are up 25 percent in 1 year. That is chaos. Deductibles are up by an average of $450 in a year. That is chaos. There is no functioning marketplace for ObamaCare in one-third of the country. That is chaos. When Americans look at this, what they see is already chaos, and ObamaCare caused it.  I want to mention one of the false claims the Democrats are making, and it has to do with That is because Medicaid was broken long before All the health care law did[[Page S186]]was add more people onto this broken program. One reason Medicaid is struggling is the same reason the rest of ObamaCare isn't working--because Medicaid tries to impose too many rules and regulations from It tries to make one size fit all.  There are different needs in every States know what those needs are, and they know much better than Washington about the people who live in those There are Republican Governors like Mike Pence of Indiana who understood this very important fact--and I am glad he is soon going to be Vice Governors like Mike Pence fought for waivers, waivers to make sure they could do what the people of their States needed. Every Governor should have that kind of freedom to look out for the best interests of the people in their home They shouldn't have to ask permission from some unaccountable, unelected Washington bureaucrat before making improvements to their own Medicaid Giving States the freedom to come up with better solutions is just one of the things Republicans are going to do to replace ObamaCare with real health care reform. States need and deserve to have that freedom, and people should be free to buy the health insurance that meets their needs, not what meets the needs of the President of the United  People shouldn't have to pay more for coverage that isn't a good value for them. That is why so many people aren't even signing up in the first place and would rather pay the penalty--a penalty that, in my mind, is still unconstitutional. Families should have more flexibility to save for their own medical care. That is a way to make sure they are not stuck with empty coverage they can't afford to use. People shouldn't be mandated to buy this overpriced, unusable insurance or face a penalty from the It is one of the most outrageous parts of the entire health care law. To me, it is the first thing that has to go on the chopping block.  Republicans are going to repeal damaging and destructive ideas like ObamaCare's many taxes, mandates, and penalties. Then we are going to walk through better solutions one-by-one, step-by-step. I hope some of the Democrats in Congress will join us.  The Democratic Senators must be heading home on weekends and listening to people who have been impacted the way I described the people of Wyoming believe they have been impacted by the health care law. They have to realize there are things we must do better and more freedoms that must be given to the American people.  The American people have suffered long enough with the chaos created by It took years for health insurance markets to get this bad, and it is going to take time to get things fixed.

Health care costs have been about $15,000 a year for us out      of pocket, but we've been able to manage because of the      protections afforded by the ACA, specifically no caps on      annual or lifetime benefits and no denials for preexisting      conditions. . . .

We knew prior to her birth that she had a      heart defect (a hole in her heart) that would need to be      repaired through open-heart surgery during the first year of      her life.

During the past five months, Emma      has undergone more surgeries and procedures than most people      will undergo in their entire lives. . . .

I have become extremely anxious about how my family will      meet Emma's ongoing needs if the ACA is repealed and      insurance companies are allowed to reinstate lifetime      maximums and to discriminate against preexisting conditions.      . . .       I beseech you to do everything you can to preserve the      provisions that will help my family--and to do everything      possible to ensure that the millions who have finally been      able to acquire health insurance since the ACA was passed      don't lose their insurance.  People have received probably hundreds of thousands of these letters in the It seems to me--I mean, yes, we should be having a conversation about how to make the law better. I have said from the very beginning that I don't think it is perfect. I think there were big problems with our health care system before we passed the Affordable Care I think there are big health care problems with our health care system today. That is a fact that anybody in America ought to be able to notice. And the Senate ought to be able to notice that and say: Why don't we make it better? Why don't we improve it? We should improve it.  I would love to meet with colleagues here to talk about how we deal with the fact that in rural Colorado, there is not enough competition in health insurance for people. I would love to be able to have a conversation here about how to drive the cost of insurance down in rural Colorado, rather than continue to see those costs increase.  I would say this. If there is somebody here with a solution to that problem, on either side of the aisle, I would be happy to write that amendment with them. But the problem I have with where we are in this debate--and I will close with this--is that we are talking about throwing out all the protections that all of these people have come to rely upon, that all of these people have come to count on in America with our health care system. We are going to throw them out, but we are not going to tell you what we are going to put in its place. In fact, for all you know, we are not going to put anything in its place because what we have heard is that there is no consensus on the other side about how we should move forward.  Part of the problem I have had with this legislation since the beginning is that we have been unable to forge a bipartisan consensus on how to deal with the fact that this country is spending 16 percent of its GDP on health care when every other industrialized country in the world is spending about half that or, in some cases, less than half that and delivering better results. I would love to see a bipartisan consensus. But what we have come to understand in the days leading up to this debate is that there is not a consensus on the Republican side about how we should go forward.  After 7 or 8 years, you would think we would have the opportunity to see a plan. It is not hard to think about what the values would be underlying a plan--the values that would say: Let's[[Page S170]]try to maximize coverage where we can. Let's try to increase quality where we can. Let's try to drive prices down where we can. Let's try to spend less, as a country, on health care where we can.  Those are not Democratic or Republican ideals. It would seem to me that those values would have the virtue of being able to inform Democratic pieces of legislation and Republican pieces of legislation. But in 8 years, we haven't seen a plan.  Here we are tonight, talking about repealing the protections that Coloradans are counting on every single day for their peace of mind and so they can plan for the sake of putting nothing in its place. It reminds me--and, colleagues, I will close with this--of the complaints that I have had in my office and as I travel the State of Colorado, where people say: Michael, we paid into our health insurance company. Month after month after month, we paid our premiums. Then, when my kid got sick and I called them up, their response was to keep me on the phone as long as possible without an answer in the hope that I would give up and go home and that the claim wouldn't have to be paid.  To be honest, colleagues, I have heard that before we passed the Affordable Care Act, and I have heard that since we have passed the Affordable Care We have more to do. That is the honest thing to say here.  But for us to talk about repealing this, taking away the benefits that people have, the protections that people have, the security and peace of mind that people have, and replacing it with the equivalent of leaving the American people on hold so they will give up, so they will move on to the next thing is beneath the dignity of this place and is not worthy of the Members of the  I want to close by saying what I have always said. I will work with anybody--Democrat or Republican--to make sure that we really do have affordable health care in this country for the American people, for the people whom I represent in Colorado, and I look forward to our getting to a place where that is the politics we are pursuing in this Chamber, instead of the politics we have seen over the past number of years.

1591,topic-id,601,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise not as a Member of Congress, but as a doctor. When I graduated medical school and took that oath, there are two core ethics that we take when we take that oath: to do good. And that is exactly what we tried to do when this body passed the Affordable Care It was about doing good. It was about giving people basic access to health care. That is a good thing.  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but let's keep doing good. Let's fix it. Let's address the cost of health care. Let's make sure people can afford their medications. That is doing good.  Another core ethic that we take when we enter the profession of medicine as a physician is to do no harm. If this body repeals the Affordable Care Act, we are going to harm 20 million Americans that now have access to health care that didn't have it prior to the Affordable Care We shouldn't do harm.  Let me put it into real context. I am a primary care internist. My wife is also a primary care internist. You can tell we have exciting conversations at our house. I was asking her the other day what the Affordable Care Act meant to her as a physician, and she was sharing a story of a patient that she had cared for for years.  This was a patient that had diabetes and hypertension, high blood pressure. We know these are silent killers. If you don't control your diabetes, if you don't control your blood pressure, it can have devastating consequences leading to heart attacks, leading to strokes. It is one of the leading causes of death in But if you control it, you can prevent all of these illnesses and people can live a normal, healthy life.  So my wife--she is a very good doctor--had her patient under good control. The patient stopped coming in to see her--maybe the patient moved away or something happened--for a couple of years. And then about 2 years ago, the patient came back in. Once she came in, her blood sugars, her diabetes was out of control; her blood pressure was out of control.  My wife looked at this patient and just said: Well, what happened? How come you stopped taking your diabetes medicine? How come you stopped taking your blood pressure medicine?  She said: Well, Doc, in the recession, I lost my job. I lost my health insurance coverage. I couldn't get the medications.  And then she said: But you know what? With the Affordable Care Act with Covered California, I was able to get health insurance again. I was able to come in and see you.  It wasn't too late for this patient. My wife was able to get her back on her medications, get her back on her blood pressure medicine, get her blood pressure and diabetes under control, and, hopefully, there is no permanent damage.  But if we do harm and repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to do irreparable damage to 20 million and more Americans who are just like this patient, who need their health care covered, who need their access to medications. That is what this is about.  Mr.Speaker, let's do what we are trained to do as physicians and what this body should do. Let's do good by making sure people have better coverage, affordable coverage, and better access to health care. Let's definitely make sure we do not do any harm by repealing the Affordable Care Let's make sure we fix it and make it better.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH242.txt,2102,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,10.0,January

1718,topic-id,703,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.288, the Small Business Broadband Deployment I am glad that the House is taking swift action on this bill, which would protect small Internet service providers from the enhanced disclosure requirements laid out in the 2015 Open Internet  After adopting the Open Internet Order, the FCC recognized the importance of exempting small ISPs from these enhanced transparency rules and subsequently granted a temporary exemption to broadband providers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers. However, the Commission failed to reach an agreement to grant another exemption before the deadline last December and, as a result, has left hundreds of our Nation's small providers vulnerable to cumbersome rules.  FCC Commissioners Pai and O'Rielly have taken action, since the exemption expired, to reassure our small broadband providers that the rules will not be enforced until the situation has been addressed by the Commission, but Congress should go a step further and provide certainty to our Nation's small businesses and pass this bill.  Rather than a 1-year exemption to the enhanced disclosure requirements, this bill would exempt for 5 years broadband providers with fewer than 250,000 subscribers from the enhanced reporting obligations, providing them with the regulatory certainty to invest in their business.  At our hearing last January, we heard from multiple witnesses just how cumbersome and burdensome these rules are. One witness described the difference to be as significant as the need to hire regulatory counsel versus the ability to build another tower to provide service. For a small business in a capital-intensive industry, that could be the difference between getting more people connected to the Internet and going out of business.  We cannot let our small businesses and hardworking taxpayers be saddled[[Page H269]]with more onerous rules and the costs that they bring. In addition to regulatory relief for small ISPs, the bill adds certainty for our Nation's small ISPs by extending the exemption for 5 years.  It was disappointing to see the Commission fail to reach an agreement at the end of last year to extend the exemption, and it is why we are here today. Despite overwhelming bipartisan support from Congress and President Obama's Small Business Administration, negotiations fell short, and our Nation's smallest and most competitive Internet service providers were left to bear the burden.  In today's 21st century economy, we need to do more to encourage connectivity, and this bill embodies that spirit. Congress is poised to provide the regulatory certainty small businesses are seeking in order to invest in stronger networks and foster a better consumer experience.  I want to thank Chairman Walden and Mr.Loebsack for acting quickly to reintroduce this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the commonsense measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Oregon on his new chairmanship. I look forward to working across the aisle on most of the issues. It is a good bipartisan subcommittee. I think we have a lot to accomplish.  The Small Business Broadband Deployment Act, H.288, unanimously passed the House last Congress on a bipartisan vote, unanimous. H.288 provides a 5-year exemption from the FCC's enhanced transparency rules for small Internet service providers that serve 250,000 or fewer subscribers.  This exemption comes with the understanding that there is a 5-year sunset on the exemption and that the FCC report to Congress with sufficient information to help us better understand the impacts on the consumers of a permanent exemption, of a possible permanent exemption. This data will also better inform us whether a longer term exemption is necessary and whether we got the definition of what a small business is right in this case.  It is also worth noting that H.288 would leave intact the FCC's 2010 transparency rules that consumers have come to rely on, such as what they are paying for, Internet speeds they rely on, data quality, and so on. At the same time, these modifications provide certainty for small ISPs while the FCC collects and reports relevant information to  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1581,topic-id,564,"Mr.Speaker, the campaign rhetoric and politics of the last 7 years now must confront the reality of health care.  No political party can repeal the basic economics. All of the features that make health insurance policies better today--the elimination of lifetime limits on health insurance payments; preventing denial for preexisting conditions; charging women the same premium as men, not more; keeping children on their parents' insurance policies until age 26--are wildly popular, but they all increase the cost of insurance.  We cannot allow people to wait until they are sick to get a policy. That undermines the very concept of insurance, hence, the mandate to have health insurance.  The truth is that the impact of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in healthcare costs rising more slowly than before the act. We have expanded coverage and subsidized care for millions of Americans, while improving the quality of health insurance. All of these reforms are, in fact, working.  A reckless act to repeal something that is now baked into the healthcare system on which millions of Americans rely and benefit from--indeed, the entire system benefits from--would have serious destabilizing effects beyond the loss of coverage for almost 30 million Republican efforts to weaken Medicaid for the poor and disabled and undermine Medicare for the elderly means that almost 100 million Americans have their health care at risk.  We will begin the battle fighting any effort by the new administration and the suddenly empowered Republican majority to act on their campaign rhetoric abolishing ObamaCare but not providing a replacement. A repeal without a clear alternative replacement at the same time is unacceptable. It is not just unacceptable to Democrats in It is unacceptable to millions of recently insured Americans--in fact, millions found in red States--unacceptable to healthcare professionals, insurance companies, hospitals, and the vast array of other people involved with the healthcare industry. Most importantly, it is unacceptable to our families.  The most unpopular feature of ObamaCare was the name, suggesting, perhaps, a simple solution. When identified with the President, the Affordable Care Act provisions were 20 percent more unpopular than when the act was described in exactly the same terms but the name was different. So perhaps we just allow the Republicans to abolish ``ObamaCare'' and then get back down to work doing what we should have been doing for the last 7 years: making the Affordable Care Act better.  By all means, let's look for ways to make the system less burdensome. We can continue to demand accountability, but allow some competition with value-based purchasing and negotiation of prescription drug prices by the largest pharmaceutical customer in the world: the Federal Dealing with skyrocketing prescription drug prices and other outrageous practices by some in the pharmaceutical industry will find broad support in and out of  When the Republican majority and the new administration get serious about a replacement that keeps all of their campaign promises and protects the industry from chaos and consumers from loss of essential coverage, there will be plenty of bipartisan cooperation. But any effort of breaking that fundamental promise by denying coverage and upsetting the healthcare applecart will be met with strong opposition, and, ultimately, they will lose.  For the sake of the American families and the people who provide health care, not only should they lose, they must lose. We must stand strong and united on that proposition.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH240.txt,99,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,10.0,January

Medicare, as it stands, as we all know, benefits our Nation's seniors who have worked hard and earned this program, but they would rather privatize or gut the program. So this action really should be decided not under reconciliation but by a 60-vote margin after hearings and an opportunity to be heard for our constituents.  Similarly, any replacement plan must not include fundamental or restrictive changes to the Medicaid The bottom line is, Medicaid continues to work to provide potential health care to our most vulnerable citizens. I come from a State that is truly making a commitment to make sure our Medicaid Program works. In fact, Connecticut was the first State to take advantage of the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, allowing the State to cover 72,000 more of our people in the State of  In Connecticut, the State has also utilized existing flexibility in the Medicaid Program to improve outcomes through the patient-centered medical home. As a result, in 2016, Medicaid hospital admissions decreased by 5.4 percent, emergency department visits fell 4.3 percent, and people requiring intensive case management saw a reduction of hospital inpatient admissions of nearly 40 percent.  These statistics are of staggering scope and scale and profoundly significant. We cannot make mean-spirited changes to the Medicaid Program, such as block granting, that would weaken the safety net, and we cannot allow gutting Medicare, endangering millions of seniors. We will not allow it without a fight. I am determined to join my colleagues in working and fighting for this amendment and keeping the pressure on our colleagues who disagree.  I yield the floor.

1527,topic-id,1399,"Mr.President, I am honored to be here tonight with my very eloquent colleague Senator Franken from Minnesota and also with two colleagues who will follow me shortly, Senator Schatz and Senator Markey, all of them great champions of better, more affordable health care for all the people who live in this great country.  This is the greatest country in the history of the world because we care about each other and we care about the common good. That is what the Affordable Care Act represents. It is not perfect. No great social reform ever is the first time around, including Social Security, but it can be repaired and improved without completely repealing it.  So repeal without a replacement is the height of irresponsibility. The first order of business for the Republican leadership during this session of Congress is to tear down and rip apart the Affordable Care Act, not to deal with job creation or economic growth. In fact, the Affordable Care Act provides 3 million jobs in our country, and repealing it would eliminate those jobs. No, it is to destroy and decimate a program that has literally saved lives, opened new futures, transformed the existences of millions and millions of Americans who would lose health care coverage if this measure is just repealed.  In fact, 22 million people across the country and more than 100,000 in Connecticut would lose that critical insurance. Preexisting conditions would become, again, an excuse for the health care industry and insurance companies to deny coverage. Women would be charged more simply because they are women. And young people would be denied access to their parents' health care coverage up to the age of 26.  Those kinds of losses just begin the list, but among the most egregious of the profound defects to this approach is the effect on the Prevention and Public Health I know it isn't a household term: Prevention and Public Health It is not exactly on everyone's tongue, but it is a measure that is profoundly important to the future of this Nation if you care about lives and dollars. And if you care about dollars, the $931 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund is allocated to provide funding for things like diabetes prevention, preventing healthcare-associated infections, chronic disease management, smoking prevention, lead poisoning, suicide prevention, and Alzheimer's disease prevention.  You may not consider these kinds of challenges--smoking prevention, lead poisoning, Alzheimer's disease, hospital-acquired infections--as the most glamorous, but treating them costs millions and millions and millions of dollars--in fact, billions of dollars.  Just to give you one example, the Tips From Former Smokers campaign, which the Prevention and Public Health Fund supports, has led to an estimated 1.6 million smokers attempting to quit smoking and has helped 100,000 Americans quit smoking. Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the United The country spent $133 million on tobacco-related healthcare costs between 2000 and 2012.  I just made I think an error. I said $133 million. In fact, it is $133 billion. How easy it seems to confuse billions with millions--$133 billion by investing this kind of money from the Prevention and Public Health We can literally save tens of billions of dollars on smoking-related diseases and premature deaths.  Improving public health outcomes and preventing the public from getting sick and dying are important goals in and of themselves because the human suffering and the premature deaths they cause are important, humane causes to our Nation, a nation that cares about people. But the $1.3 trillion in treatment costs and lost productivity every year--let me repeat that--$1.3 trillion in treatment costs and lost productivity every year on chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke can be reduced and, dare I say at some point, reduced by so much that we may look back, and we will say: That Prevention and Public Health Fund was one good investment, but not if it is decimated and destroyed by the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which costs us money as well as lives.  In Connecticut, the fund has invested over $27 million in our communities since 2010, improving the lives and well-being of the people of Connecticut literally every day.  This strong investment has provided more Connecticut women with screenings for cancer, mammograms, other critical, preventive care, and it has given our State health department the ability to prevent diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and to fight obesity through improved physical activity.  It has allowed our State to address school health much more effectively, and we are talking about the Nation's children--preventing obesity, smoking, diabetes, which, as we know, more and more affects our children.  It has staved off disease outbreaks by providing Connecticut with millions of dollars to provide vaccinations for young people who otherwise would go without, children who would be denied this essential means of preventing emotionally crippling, if not physically debilitating, diseases that can transform their lives forever.  Perhaps most importantly, the Prevention Fund has relied on the communities impacted by the money for solutions. That means stronger collaboration between community organizations and the health system to prevent suicides, for example, in the Community Transformation Grants Program that encourages healthier lifestyles across our  The ACA, in short, has reflected a historic shift. We are trying to prevent, not just treat the disease, and that kind of investment from the Prevention and Public Health Fund in my State and many others has already produced a return on that investment which is of invaluable importance.  I have authored an amendment, which currently has 12 cosponsors, to create a budget point of order against any piece of legislation that would take away funding for preventive care. It is very simple. If we are going to work toward reducing the cost of health care in this great country, we should not be talking about getting rid of effective and efficient ways of preventing disease. We ought to be talking about reducing drug prices, stopping costly addictions, preventing disease, and improving the quality and efficiency of care.  I want to stress, again, the importance of reducing pharmaceutical drug prices, which has been a concern to me for years in this job and for many more years when I served as our State's attorney general.  But reducing health care costs and improving quality is not what our Republican colleagues are trying to do.[[Page S150]]They are trying to make good on campaign rhetoric and political promises to completely repeal the Affordable Care Act without any replacement, without following through on their commitment to provide health insurance to our Nation's people. We are expected to just wait and see what they have in the plan. Meanwhile, millions of people will be left without health care, and the health care industry will be in confusion and chaos as insurance companies wonder what comes next.  The simple fact is that our Republican colleagues have no idea, no clue, no plan. In their view, the Earth is flat. They can abolish something and promise to replace it because they know something will come. That is unacceptable, and I will fight to ensure that the Affordable Care Act continues to mean access to affordable health care for millions of Most importantly, fairness and effectiveness in health care means prevention. The Prevention and Public Health Fund is critical to that effort.  I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of prevention, safeguarding our health, and heed the voices and faces that have been so dramatic and powerful to me, so inspiring in their courage and strength, as they were just this morning when I met with and presented to the people of Connecticut at an event we did there. Three brave women came forward to talk about what the Affordable Care Act had meant to them and what its loss would mean as well. These perhaps not immediately visible voices and faces should be a stirring reminder to our colleagues that we need to do better, improve the Affordable Care Act, make it better--but not simply trash it, decimate it, destroy it, and abandon the great hope and ideal of assuring affordable care for all.  I yield now to my colleague from Hawaii, Senator Schatz, who has been a champion of affordable care in this Nation and is a great credit to his State of  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS126.txt,2076,OBJECTING TO UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2334,2017.0,9.0,January

1208,topic-id,1895,"Mr.President, I am going to talk about the resolution we are moving to that will allow us to repeal and begin the replacement for the President's health care plan.  A little over 3 years ago, President Obama hailed the start of the ObamaCare exchanges as a life-changing opportunity for For most Americans, it was life-changing, but it didn't turn out to be an opportunity. It was a life-changing experience because in many cases the insurance they had was no longer affordable, what they thought met their family's needs was no longer available, and the cost continues to go up.  When President Obama pushed the health care law through Congress without a single Republican vote, he repeatedly assured Americans that they would be able to keep the plans they had, that they would be able to keep the doctors they had, and that every family would have a significant reduction in their health care costs. He continued to make every one of those commitments until the plan actually was put in place and it was obvious those commitments were not going to be what happened. By the end of 2013, at least 4.7 million Americans had their plans canceled because they didn't meet the law's mandatory requirements. Remember, these were plans that 4.7 million people thought met their individual needs, and they could afford those plans. That is why they bought them. They might not have been perfect. They might have still been a stretch on their budget, but they decided: This is insurance I can afford, and it is insurance that meets the needs that I can afford to meet with the insurance I can buy.  The President's claims about everybody being able to keep their policies and keep their doctor were so far from reality that PolitiFact rated it as the lie of the year. I don't like to use that language as it relates to the President of the United I would say it must be really easy to become isolated in the Oval Office, and the President may get lots of information that sounds to him as if his plan is working, but the truth is that the President is not entitled to his own facts. He is entitled to his own opinion. He is entitled to his vision of what he thinks health care in America should look like, but he is not entitled to his own facts. If it is not happening the way he thinks it is happening, somebody needs to tell him. But, of course, in just a few days there will be a new President, and we have to deal with the chaos, frankly, that has been created under the old law.  President Obama said this law would mean more choice, more competition, and lower costs for millions of Nobody can find those A number of Americans got on Medicaid, another government program, who weren't on Medicaid before. But there aren't millions of Americans who have more choices, and there aren't millions of Americans who have more competition for their business, and there aren't millions of Americans who have lower costs. In fact, just the opposite would be the case in Missouri, where I live. A number of insurers pulled out of the exchange totally. Our neighboring States all have the same experience and, in some cases, even worse experience, but the competition, the choices, just aren't there because the system doesn't work.  We have 115 counties in our State, and in 97 of them, you have one choice; you have one insurer offering insurance. That one insurer may offer three different plans, but there is no competition for whatever level you are shopping for. There is only one place to get that level. This would be as if there is one shoe store in town and none of the shoes fit and they all cost too much, but if you didn't buy the shoes in that shoe store--and the chairman of the Budget Committee knows a lot about shoe stores--you would have to pay a penalty for not buying shoes that were available at that one location. Everybody would think: Well, that is unacceptable; you ought to at least be able to drive to another community and look for shoes. But that is not the case in 97 places, 97 counties. The vast majority of our State and a couple of States have no counties on the individual exchange that have competition. We went from several--every county a year ago in Missouri had at least two companies offering insurance, so there was at least a competitor. Some had more than two companies offering insurance. Now 97 have one company.  The promise was to bend the cost curve. The cost curve bent, but it bent the wrong way. The cost curve went up; it didn't go down. In our State, again, increased premiums have been as high as 40 percent.  In a number of States, they are in the 70-percent category. In one State, there is a 100-percent increase--not from when ObamaCare started but from last year--in places where the cost of insurance for individuals and families had too often already doubled, and now another add-on.  I was with somebody the other day, and I asked them about their insurance. He was a healthy guy in his mid-40s. His wife and two daughters were healthy. I said: What are you doing for insurance?  He said: I am self-employed. In 2009, there were four of us. We had insurance we thought met our needs. We were paying $300 a month. Now we are paying $1,190 a month, and we have a $7,500 deductible. If two of us are sick, we have to submit that deductible twice before we get any assistance from the insurance company--a $15,000 deductible if two people in the family are sick with a $1,190 monthly premium.  This is a family that had no health care problems. This is not a response to somebody who has a policy that they were using. This is a policy that wasn't being used and, of course, with a $7,500 deductible unlikely to be used unless that family really has a catastrophic situation occur. What I believe that family found out a few months after I visited with them was that their policy went up closer to $2,000 than $1,190.  The average deductible for a mid-level plan--there are the gold plan, silver plan, the bronze plan. For the silver plan, the average deductible in the exchange last year was $3,000. The average deductible in the bronze plan was $5,000, and it is higher than that for many people.  To make matters worse, if you aren't able to afford the few options available on the exchange, you pay a penalty. So you have no competition. You are required to buy the product, and if you don't buy the product, there is a penalty. It could have been as much this year as $2,045, but if your option is to pay $15,000 or $20,000 for insurance that has this high deductible, that is what many people have decided to do.  I have heard a lot of Missourians from the day this was initiated through today talking about the individual challenges they have seen. For[[Page S85]]example, Dave, a small business owner in Columbia, said that the premiums for his employees have doubled. Why would that be the case? One, the standards necessary for a policy change and, two, if you're losing all this money in the individual marketplace, the insurance companies make that up somewhere. So his premiums have doubled. At the same time, they have continually had to raise deductibles and seriously reduce benefits. The cost goes up and the coverage goes down. I think that is what President Clinton said when he said this is a crazy system. It is costing more all the time and covering less. That is what Dave has found out in his business, and he was told late last year that he should expect a 40-percent increase this year. He said: If that happens another time, we are no longer in the employee-employer provided insurance marketplace.  Another location that serves our State and happens to be headquartered also in Columbia is the Older Americans Transportation System, a not-for-profit. They provide critical transportation services to older Missourians, and they have it other places in the country--older Missourians to low-income people, to underserved parts of our State that don't have other transportation options. The costs to insure their drivers have gone up by half a million dollars. The paperwork to comply with the law's requirements, as the executive director told me, is so complex and cumbersome, they had to spend additional money to hire a consultant to implement a software program to help them keep up with the new mandates. It suddenly got even harder to be a not-for-profit and break even.  Families and small businesses shouldn't be penalized because the law did not live up to its promise: If you like your health care, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Family costs will go down by $2,500 after this plan is put in place. Those things didn't happen.  We are in a chaotic situation now, and it is time to move in a new direction. We will have a bill before us very shortly that will allow us to begin that transition to do things that will prevent Washington from getting in between health care providers and their patients. We will do things that will break down barriers that artificially restrict choice and prevent Americans from picking insurance that meets their family's needs that they can still pay for. What a concept that would be.  This is basically the system we had before. It wasn't a perfect system, and I will say the biggest straw man put forward in that system was that nobody else had any ideas. There were plenty of other ideas, ideas that would better serve American families, American job creators, American job holders, people--plans that would have allowed small businesses to band together and become a bigger group to seek group insurance for a number of businesses instead of just one business's health savings account, better use of health savings accounts, buying across State lines, and things that I proposed specifically on letting your family stay on your insurance a little bit longer. Frankly, that was a 4-page bill that adds 3 million people to insurance every year so you can stay on your family policy until you are 26. There are four pages with a lot of white space. This does not have to be that complicated. There is no cost to taxpayers. Frankly, you are adding young, healthy people, not much cost to anybody but fundamentally no cost to taxpayers. It is just an additional way to look at things like buying insurance across State lines would be. There are solutions here, but we have been prevented from moving to those solutions.  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution that will allow us to move forward. We will begin to eliminate the chaos of ObamaCare and restore the focus of health care to patients, people, the doctors they want to have, and the places they want to go to get their health care.

1379,topic-id,616,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation This bill, introduced by my colleague, Mr.Lucas, is a product of hard work and negotiation over the past two  In addition to Mr.Lucas, I thank Chairman Smith and also Environment Subcommittee chair, Mr.Bridenstine, and former chair, Mr.Chris Stewart, who were great partners in this process. The language before us today is a result of a truly bipartisan and bicameral effort.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible for many important tasks at the cutting edge of science and public service, and weather forecasting is one of the tasks most critical to our country.  In the northwest Oregon communities I represent, my constituents rely on timely weather forecasts to decide when to harvest their crops, when to go to sea to fish, how to navigate the roads safely when there is freezing rain or snow, and to prepare for possible flood conditions.  The National Weather Service provides excellent forecasting products to support our economy, but with the increasing frequency of severe weather events, there can be and should be improvements in our forecasting capabilities and delivery.  For example, forecasts can be more precise regarding what will happen and when. Improved forecasts can provide more lead time to allow communities to prepare, especially in severe weather events. Forecast information should also be communicated more effectively to the public and those in harm's way to reduce the loss of life and property. This bill is designed to address those important goals.  The bill connects the research side of NOAA, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, more effectively to the forecasting needs of the National Weather This research-to-operations pipeline is essential for the continued improvement of our weather forecasting enterprise.                              {time}  1715  The bill contains several provisions that will improve interactions and information sharing between NOAA's researchers and the National Weather It also improves communications between NOAA and the broader research and private weather communities.  The bill also establishes interagency coordination, through the Office of Science and Technology Policy, across multiple agencies outside of NOAA that share responsibilities for weather research and forecast communications. This is essential as we face budget constraints, and it will help speed the adoption of best tools and practices across the various agencies.  H.353 also recognizes that even the best forecasts will not serve the public's needs unless there are effective communications systems. The bill directs NOAA to do more research, listen to experts, and improve its risk communications techniques.  The bill also reestablishes a program that allows NOAA to give awards to people who save the lives of others through NOAA's Weather Radio All Hazards program. The bill also formally establishes the pilot program currently operating at NOAA to engage in contracts with the commercial sector for weather forecasting data.  Additionally, the bill requires NOAA to examine the benefits and costs of different sensors by running simulations of different configurations of instruments and datasets on forecasting accuracy. It is important that these requirements are not too prescriptive so that NOAA can use the most efficient, accurate, and cost-effective model for this situation.  This legislation will produce advances in weather forecasting and capabilities that will result in better development of forecast innovations and technology. Ultimately, this will save American lives and property.  I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle for their input and support. Also, I would like to thank the hardworking committee staff on both sides of the aisle for their efforts to continue negotiations to move this bill forward.

1176,topic-id,907,"Mr.President, today, I introduced the Protect American Families from Unnecessary Registration and Deportation Act of 2017, or the Protect American Families This critical bill would advance civil and human rights by ensuring we protect American immigrants from being wrongfully targeted by the Federal Government because of who they are or how they worship. I thank Senators Elizabeth Warren, Brian Schatz, Ed Markey, Patty Murray, Bernie Sanders, Patrick Leahy, Jeff Merkley, Mazie Hirono, and Ron Wyden for joining me on this important legislation.  Enshrined in the Constitution are the ideas that all people are free to practice the religion of their choice and that we will not discriminate because of your faith or national origin. Creating a Federal immigration program that requires people to register their status with the Federal Government on the basis of their religion, race, ethnicity, gender, age, nationality, national origin, or citizenship is contrary to those values. Because the United States is the world's beacon of democracy, we must lead by example and live the values we preach.  Yet, in troubling times we have not always stayed true to our values. During World War II, soon after Imperial Japan attacked United States Naval Base Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. That order authorized the Secretary of War to designate particular areas as military zones, which allowed for the removal of Japanese Americans from certain parts of the United Subsequently, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans were relocated to internment camps.  Similarly, in 2002, the year following the tragic terrorist attacks on September 11, the Federal Government created the National Security Entry-Exist Registration System, This Federal program required non-citizen visa holders from certain countries to register with the Federal The registration process included fingerprinting, photographs, and interrogation. Once an individual registered, NSEERS required the person to regularly check in with immigration officials. Finally, NSEERS monitored people who registered with the program to ensure that no one remained in the country longer than the law permitted them.  Inconsistent with the American values of religious freedom and nondiscrimination, the NSEERS program wrongly targeted males over 16 years old from the following countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and North Thus, 24 out of the 25 countries listed in the NSEERS program were Arab and Muslim countries. This was another moment in our nation's history where our leaders succumbed to the politics of[[Page S117]]fear and adopted a program that tore at the very fabric of our country.  Immigration-registry programs do not make the public more safe. The purpose of NSEERS was to identify and capture terrorists. Yet, despite registering over 83,000 people, the program yielded zero terrorism convictions. Without proof of a single terrorist related conviction, the NSEERS program did not do its job of keeping the homeland safe.  But immigration-registry programs do result in discrimination. The fact that NSEERS led to the forced registry, interrogation, and deportations of immigrants from predominantly Muslim or Arab countries is proof that broadly defined enforcement programs often result in racial and religious profiling. That is why the United Nations and major American civil rights groups condemned NSEERS for unfairly singling out By targeting Muslims, NSEERS sent the wrong message that America does not welcome immigrants from certain lands.  While the Obama administration dismantled the NSEERS program, this alone will not prevent the incoming administration from attempting to follow through on its threats to create a registry based on religion or national origin. On the campaign trail President-elect Trump called for a ``total and complete shutdown'' of Muslim immigrants entering the United Additionally, he has called for ``extreme vetting'' of immigrants reminiscent of It is incumbent upon congressional leaders to ensure that the United States does not sacrifice its values in the face of fear.  Today, I introduce the Protect American Families Act to ensure that America protects the rights and liberties of American immigrants from overly broad, ineffective, and discriminatory registry programs. This bill would prohibit the Federal Government from requiring noncitizens to register or check in with the Federal Government simply because of their religion, race, ethnicity, age, gender, national origin, nationality, or citizenship. Banning the creation of a discriminatory registration program is not only consistent with our democratic values, but it allows law enforcement to focus resources on the real threats to our safety.  The bill has commonsense exemptions. Data collection is critical in our fight against terrorists, and the bill allows the government to collect routine data on the entry and exit of noncitizens. The bill would also protect important immigration programs like Temporary Protected Status, Deferred Enforced Departure, the Visa Waiver Program, and Deferred Action for Childhood This provision makes clear that legitimate Federal programs that confer immigration benefits are not prohibited by the ban on enforcement immigration programs that target immigrants and other vulnerable  In his First Inaugural Address, President Roosevelt said that ``the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Unfortunately, he failed to live up to that statement when he issued Executive Order 9066. But we have a chance to fulfill that vision. We have a chance to stand up against fear and stay true to our American values in the face of hardship.

I have a deep belief that this is a body that can do good things for the American people. We don't always agree, and too many things are not getting done, but I have seen this body at its best.

This is fundamentally dangerous, and it will hurt millions of I have heard over the past month people rightfully saying: Well, this is how the Affordable Care Act was implemented.  I understand the frustrations that have resulted from that, and people think this was jammed through along partisan lines many years ago using similar legislative tactics. The truth is, that is simply not the case. The Affordable Care Act went through a long and arduous process and received input from doctors, nurses, patient groups, medical specialists, medical professionals of all types.  The Affordable Care Act started with listening sessions, then hearings, then came the advice and counsel of policy experts, businesses, market experts, insurance companies, health nonprofits, hospitals--literally thousands and thousands of people over thousands of hours, often through public discourse, putting forth ideas that actually shaped and changed legislation. I wasn't in the body then. I was a mayor in Newark, NJ, but I know this occupied months of debate.  Years later, Republicans are seeking to undo this work with a kind of plan to move forward. They are saying that they have a plan, but no plan exists.  I am a big believer that there are things we can and we must do to improve health care in America, to improve the Affordable Care Act, but what I have to make clear is that it is profoundly irresponsible to repeal the Affordable Care Act and not put anything in place. There is no plan.  This is at a time that everyone agrees--people in the Republican Party and Democratic Party continue to talk about the achievements of the Affordable Care Act, things that they want to maintain, things they believe make a real difference. Those are things I have heard Republicans praise and even say again they want to protect. These things are making a lifesaving difference for millions of  Let's be clear. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that we should not give the power back to insurance companies to deny people health insurance because of a preexisting condition. Let's be clear. Most people believe that we should allow young people, young adults to stay on their parents' plans up to the age of 26.[[Page S100]]We also believe that requiring health plans cover preventive services is a profoundly important thing to do for individuals in this country, but it actually saves Americans money by pushing people to do preventive care--mammograms, birth control, and mental health care--without cost sharing. These are logical things that the majority of Americans believe in, such as closing the prescription drug coverage gap, which too many seniors on Medicare and people with disabilities have had to face, known as that doughnut hole. We believe in prohibiting insurance companies from charging women more money simply because of their gender. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe in requiring the insurance companies to spend more on patient care and less on administrative costs, and the insurance companies shouldn't be allowed to gouge the American people while making massive profits at the same time.  There is so much that people believe in and want to have preserved, and these are tremendous things for There are bank account savings; there are lifesaving policies, all of which are popular with Democrats, Republicans, and They are popular with people on both sides of the aisle in this body.  Some Republicans have said that what they are doing will not threaten these accomplishments, but this couldn't be any further from the truth. The way they are going about this puts the health care system in a perilous position. The health care system is complicated in nuance, and to think you can repeal something without replacing it right away shows a lack of understanding of what is going to happen and what the consequences will be.  What the Republicans are doing now is quite contrary to what the Democrats did before the ACA passed in 2010. Republicans are not putting forth a proposal. They are not speaking to the health care needs of all They are not inviting professionals from all different backgrounds to help shape a plan for They are not even fulfilling what I heard countless Republicans on the campaign trail, including our President-elect, say: They would repeal and then replace. They are just not replacing.  The replace part put forth by the mantra of many Republicans has not materialized. It doesn't exist. There is no plan to replace, no statement of principles, no outline of features, no framework for a plan, no explanation of how they would pay for the things they claim they like. There is no specific timeline for when a plan might materialize or even any substantive hint of what many Republican colleagues plan on doing to address the crisis--the crisis that will surely come as a result of repealing the Affordable Care Act without giving forth any replacement.  I say time and again: Show us the plan before you repeal this legislation. If you do not do that, you will be responsible for pain, suffering, chaotic markets, and for many Americans' health care problems. There are many people who don't understand this. They listen to the political rhetoric, and they think: Hey, you might be that one who, if you are wealthy enough or secure enough, if you are a Member of this body, in fact, this concept of repealing and maybe figuring out a replacement down the road might sound good. But if you are one illness away from bankruptcy, if you know and remember the challenges of having a child with a preexisting condition, if you know that one injury, one unexpected fall could place your family in peril but for the insurance you have, if you are one of the 20 million Americans who used to be uninsured and now you have insurance, you know how perilous this moment is. You know that you can't afford the recklessness of any politician--a Republican move that equates to jumping off a cliff and then packing your parachute on the way down.  Repealing without replacing is simply irresponsible, it is dangerous, and it is threatening to our country's well-being. People--families, children, the elderly--will suffer.  This is a moment where we need Republican leaders to tell the truth and say: We want to improve our health care system. We may not believe in ObamaCare, but we can't tear it down unless we do the responsible thing and put forth a replacement.  Right now, what we have is political rhetoric that is not just rhetoric. It is perilous. It is dangerous. It is threatening to our This will inflict immediate catastrophe upon families, causing millions to lose their health insurance, and it will unleash chaos with market uncertainty and cost spikes.  There is no defense for what is being done. I don't understand it. There is no logic here whatsoever. Elections were won. You now have the floor and the ability to put forth your great vision for health care in America, but doing it backward and repealing something and not offering up a plan is truly putting politics before people. This is a move of grand political theater that comes with profound public consequences affecting millions.  As a Democratic Senator, some people will say that this is just political rhetoric, but these are not just partisan words. This is the truth and don't take my word for it. Look at the words of other more thoughtful--other very thoughtful people, Democrats and Republicans, businesspeople and nonprofit leaders, conservative think tanks and nonpartisan groups, speaking with a chorus to the point I am making. Experts across sectors, across industries, and across the country are taking a hard look at what a repeal will mean for the American people without a replacement. People from all across sectors of our country are saying what the Republicans are doing is reckless, and the consequences are dire.  Take the American Medical Association, the preeminent association of physicians. Mind you, this is an organization that opposed the enactment of the Affordable Care They have urged--this chorus of doctors has urged that ``before any action is taken, policymakers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies. Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions.''  The American Medical Association isn't a political organization. They are thoughtful people whose fundamental concern is the doctors in this Nation and the health care of the people. Another respected organization representing American hospitals made it clear. The American Hospital Association warned that Republican action of repealing without a plan would result in an ``unprecedented health care crisis.''  Are Republicans listening to doctors and hospitals or are they rushing forth, willing to risk a crisis for our country, and for what? They are a President for 4 years, a Congress for 2. What is the rush to put forth a plan and just repeal? Will they listen to these experts? What about the president of America's leading cancer group, the American Cancer Society? Will they listen to them? They urge Congress to ``consider the future of the Affordable Care It is critically important that cancer patients, survivors and those at risk of the disease don't face any gap in coverage of prevention or treatment. . . . Delaying enactment of a replacement for 2 or 3 years could lead to the collapse of the individual health market with long-term consequences.''  This organization is respected by people on both sides of the aisle and is not playing partisan games. They are calling out the truth; that it is a reckless Republican move to repeal without replacing. Will Republicans listen to the American Diabetes Association? Folks with diabetes are Independents, Republicans, and Democrats, and this is an organization respected by people on both sides of the aisle. They say:       The Association strongly opposes going back to a time when      . . . treatment for preexisting conditions like diabetes      could be excluded from coverage; when people could find their      insurance coverage was no longer available just when they      needed it most.  What is the Republican plan to address these concerns and to pay for these concerns? Will they listen to private businesspeople? They, too, join in the chorus of Americans urging that Republicans not endanger the lives and livelihoods of millions.  The Main Street We all have main streets in our States and our communities. A group representing these small businesses from across the country urges lawmakers to consider the devastating effect a repeal without[[Page S101]]replace would have on small businesses:       Small business owners depend on healthy and vibrant      communities to keep us profitable in the engines of economic      growth. . . . Changes to our current health care system are      needed, but not in the form of cuts to critical programs or      through taking away our health coverage.  There are some Senators who are speaking out. It is not the entire Republican caucus. There are some who are saying exactly what I am saying. Yet we are still rushing toward a vote, even with Republican Senators having the courage to stand up. Just yesterday Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, before voting to proceed to this measure, said: ``It is imperative that Republicans do a replacement simultaneous to a repeal.'' I respect my Republican colleague for saying what is common sense and speaking up against the reckless actions being taken by the Republican Party as a whole, and some fellow Republican Senators have joined him in similar statements, including Lamar Alexander, the chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions The Republican from Tennessee, who noted in an interview in November 2016 that when it comes to the ACA, ``what we need to focus on first''--Senator Alexander said--``is what would we replace it with and what are the steps that it would take to do that?''  Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine shared in an interview last month that she was ``concerned about the speed in which this is occurring'' and expressed concern over what would happen to her constituents in Maine who had signed up for insurance through the ACA, saying: ``You just can't drop insurance for 84,000 people in my State.''  I not only talk about Republicans in this body, but there are conservative think tanks focused on our country that are speaking out now as well. The American Enterprise Institute said in a 2015 report that ``repealing the law without a plausible plan for replacing it would be a mistake.''  So here we have it from all over the country, people across the political spectrum, experts, market analysts, insurance executives, doctors, nurses, hospital leaders, patient groups; these people in our country who are beyond politics and even beyond their opinions of the Affordable Care Act when it was enacted are now speaking in a chorus of conviction in one voice: Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act without a clear plan to preserve the things that are making America healthier and more financially strong and secure. Don't recklessly rush into a politically motivated move that would endanger the health care of millions of Americans, increase the costs for millions of Americans, throw insurance markets into chaos, endanger our hospitals' financial stability, and put our most vulnerable Americans into crisis: our seniors, people in nursing homes, retired coal miners, people recovering from drug addiction, the poor and other underserved communities.  We are America, and this is a time that we must call, not to party rhetoric but to who we are and what we stand for. We cannot let this repeal without replacement happen. We must know what the Republican plan is so experts, market analysts, insurance folks, doctors, everyone understands what will happen. Americans will be hurt. It is time to put our country and the people first. There is no rush. The voters gave this body 2 years. It gave the Presidency 4 years. We must now fight these efforts. We must resist. We must call to the conscience of neighbors and appeal to the moral compasses of our Republican leaders to do what they said they would do--put forth your plan. Let the American people know what they are going to do and do not thrust millions of your fellow country men and women off a cliff and shout promises to them as they fall: ``Hey, don't worry. We will figure something out before you hit the ground.'' Where is the honor in that strategy? Call the public together, gather your experts, put forth a thoughtful process, and develop what you think is better, what improves upon what we have now, what doesn't diminish our unassailable gains that we have had but build upon them. Give us a plan, not empty promises. Give America hope. Don't plunge millions into despair and uncertainty. Show decency, not costly craven politics. We know who we are as a country. Profound are the words, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among . . . `'  This government, this body, the United States Senate, led by Republicans here and in the House and in the White House, must stand for these ideals. Health care is critical to life. We must stand for these ideals. Health care is critical to liberty, our freedom from fear, our freedom from illness, our freedom from deprivation. We must stand for these principles. Health care is critical to the happiness, the joy, the greatness of To secure these rights, governments are instituted, and we were elected to stand for the American people, by the American people, to fight to defend our brothers and sisters. This government and actors must put our ideals first, not partisanship and not theater. Do not attack these ideals through a rash and reckless repeal. Be thoughtful. Be kind. Be magnanimous. The well-being of our Nation is in the balance.  May God bless us in this time of crisis. May wisdom prevail over politics.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1568,topic-id,1644,"Mr.President, the hour is late, even though you look like you have a lot of work there to do, sir. I think I am going to be merciful and keep this short. I want to thank the Senator from Hawaii, the senior Senator from Hawaii, for his remarks.  I just want to wrap up. We have had multiple speakers now driving home a number of points. Two of them I just want to reiterate, which is the fact that as I look at a lot of more moderate and conservative outlets, from the American Enterprise Institute all the way to the American Medical Association, that did not support ObamaCare in the first place, you have this chorus growing of responsible, thoughtful people who said: Hey, we may want to repeal ObamaCare, but to do it without putting up a plan and showing the American public what you are going to replace it with is not only contrary, obviously, to a lot of the political rhetoric we heard during the campaign season, but it is against the logic, it is not prudent, it is actually reckless, and it is going to hurt a lot of people.  This is what we have to understand. I say it is akin to pushing someone off a ledge and telling them, as they are falling down, that, hey, we are going to get a plan, don't worry. The problem is, people are going to get hurt in the interim. The cost of medical care, not having that kind of business certainty that you need, it is going to spike markets and make things very difficult.  I just want to say that this body, which I respect--and I am happy to hear voices like Senator Rand Paul and others on the Republican side begin to come out and say that we should not be repealing this without replacing it. I want to offer my gratitude to them because I think there are a lot of people--I even heard Chuck[[Page S179]]Schumer say himself that he is ready to roll up his sleeves and talk about ways to improve this.  We have heard from the President-elect, saying that he is going to have a health care system that is better and that costs less. I think he used the word ``terrific'' to describe what he is going to bring to the American people.  Well, where is it? Where is the plan? What is the idea? Because there are too many people right now in our country who are fearful of what might happen. When I say ``fearful,'' it is a base fear; for example, some people from my State of New This is Martha, who lives in a town called Montclair--not quite the same town that the Senator from Hawaii was speaking of before, which I cannot pronounce yet. I hope he will help me with that. Mahalo; is that right? I am doing all right.  But this young lady from Montclair very dramatically writes:       I want to take a moment to thank you for fighting as hard      as you have to protect those of us who are disabled and      vulnerable to financial ruin, medical crisis, and debt if the      ACA is repealed. I am a psychotherapist in private practice      for over 20 years. I have served my community by keeping one-     third of my caseload no fee or low fee for those who have had      no insurance.       For over 20 years, I have purchased my insurance privately      and paid dearly for my medical coverage. Two months ago, I      was diagnosed with an extremely rare cancer in my central      nervous system. I am fortunate that doctors believe that it      can be controlled, but not cured, by my taking a low dose of      oral chemotherapy for life. I now, as a result of this      condition, have zero chance of being able to afford      reasonable medical coverage purchased from an unregulated      open market.       My life, literally without hyperbole, depends on my being      able to maintain continuity of care and insurance regulations      that eliminate exclusions for preexisting conditions. My      energies are limited due to my illness. So I thank you for      doing all you can to fight for my life and my family. The      idea that people with preexisting conditions aren't      contributing to the economic health of our country is a      distortion. I personally address gaps in our health care      system as a provider by sliding my scale.       The safety net is us, and if I lose my health coverage and      can no longer afford it, I will no longer be able to afford      to devote one-third of my caseload to those who cannot afford      it. It becomes a profound domino effect.  That is where we are right now. I have heard so many of my colleagues, Republican and Democratic, speak to the things they like about ObamaCare or at least they like in the abstract, not giving ObamaCare any credit. They like the fact that people with preexisting conditions can get insurance. They like this idea that there will be no lifetime caps. That means that a child who might have leukemia and beats it and then becomes an adult can't find insurance because nobody wants to insure him because they have exceeded these ideas of lifetime caps. They have gotten rid of this idea that you cannot stay on your parent's insurance just because you have turned 23, 24. Now you can do it until you are 26. There are so many aspects of ObamaCare that people say they like. One thing that even Republican Governors talk about liking is just the idea of Medicaid expansions that have occurred in 32 States and have enabled millions of Americans, hard-working families, their children, people living in nursing homes, those who suffer from addiction, and the poor and the underserved, to get access to quality health care.  That is what is incredible. We have people who are coal miners and sick who have benefited from this. We have folks who are in nursing homes who have benefited from this. We have folks who are suffering in this opioid crisis with addictions who have been able to get access to coverage and access to care. More than this, we have now created a system that equates and understands that mental illness and physical illness is in parity--that insurance companies have to offer that as well.  In addition to all of that, we now have a system that says to anybody that you cannot be denied for the kind of reasons you were denied before and find yourself falling into the trap that so many Americans did; that the 1 reason--or at least one of the top reasons people were declaring bankruptcy was because they could not afford their medical bills. These are all things that are universally--or at least the overwhelming majority of Americans want.  So we all agree on many of the basic goals. The question is, How do get there? It has been indicated by the President-elect and others that they have a plan to get there, to preserve all of these things that are now being savored by Americans, that are literally, as Martha from Montclair points out, saving people's lives. The question is, How are you going to get there? By the way, if you try to shortcut it and don't tell us how you are going to get there and just repeal ObamaCare, then you introduce uncertainty to the market. Insurance companies are speaking up. The American Medical Association is speaking up. The American Diabetes Association is speaking up. The American Cancer Society is speaking up. All of these nonpartisan or maybe even conservative folks are speaking up, saying: You can't do the repeal unless you put forward what you are going to replace it with.  Free market folks know you don't introduce uncertainty into the markets without consequences, and those consequences would be a disruption to the individual marketplace, the spiking of prices, people pulling out, and that death spiral.  I believe in the prudence of this body. I have seen it from people on both sides of the aisle--the thoughtfulness that they won't rush to embrace a pure political victory at the expense of real people. Well, this is one of those moments.  What are we going to do as a body? Are we going to repeal and not replace? Or are we going to have a great discussion about what that replacement will be?  So tonight we have heard from a lot of my colleagues. I am really proud that folks have taken to the floor. I am even more proud that, from my office, we are hearing from people on both sides of the political aisle. Not everybody likes Not everybody voted It is people from both sides of the aisle. They do not understand why we would rush forward doing the repeal without the replace.  I want to thank everybody who has spoken tonight. The hour is late, and I just want to thank a lot of the folks who don't normally keep these kinds of hours. There are some pretty incredible people who work up around the President's desk.  We have a lot of pages here who do not get enough thanks on both sides--Republican pages and Democratic pages. I want to thank them, as well, for staying late, even though, technically--and I hate to call them out on this--if they have to stay up past 10 p.m., they don't have to necessarily do their homework and show up for school the next day. That is what I hear. So we might have done you a favor. But either way, I want to thank everybody tonight.  Mr.President, I want to suggest the absence of a quorum.  Oh, I am sorry. I want to--what do I want to do? I want to just drop the mic.  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS161-3.txt,2194,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,9.0,January

I would like to thank Chairman Smith, Vice Chairman Lucas, and Environment Subcommittee Ranking Member Bonamici for their tireless efforts to see this bipartisan legislation move forward.  The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 is the product of extensive negotiations between the Environment Subcommittee, which I chair, and the Senate Commerce Committee, and I am proud of the bipartisan and bicameral agreement that this bill represents.  H.353 directs the NOAA Administrator to prioritize activities that will save lives and protect property. Again, this is critically important to my State, which is in the heart of tornado alley.  This legislation will help NOAA develop more accurate and timely warnings for hurricanes, tornadoes, and other high-impact weather events. It calls on NOAA to develop a plan to maintain forecasting capabilities that are second to none in the world, primarily because, by some metrics, we lag behind our counterparts in Europe, the U.and  The bill encourages better cooperation across NOAA offices and enhances collaboration with universities, such as the University of Oklahoma, which is a national leader in weather research.  It will also ensure that innovative methods and technologies, such as warn on forecast, currently being developed at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, are rapidly deployed in operational status so that the American people can benefit.  Further, beyond improvements to short-term forecasts of extreme events, the bill directs NOAA to improve our understanding of seasonal forecasts, which can be immensely useful to industries such as agriculture.  Mr.Speaker, I am particularly pleased this bill finally authorizes a commercial weather data pilot program. H.353 authorizes $24 million over the next 4 years for a pilot program for NOAA to purchase commercial space-based weather data and test it against NOAA's proprietary data. This can improve forecasts and save the Federal Government money. This will allow NOAA to continue to expand upon the two pilot contracts it awarded in September of last year.  Mr.Speaker, this has the potential to be a paradigm-shifting provision. Commercial weather data can augment the data we receive from systems such as JPSS and GOES, while also serving as a mitigation strategy in the event we experience a gap in weather data from these systems. More data from innovative sources has a real potential to improve our forecasting capabilities.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

630,topic-id,827,"Mr.President, 70 years ago United Mine Workers president John Lewis, a lifelong Republican, sat down with theDemocratic Secretary of the Interior, Julius They struck a deal to end a national strike. They promised health and pensionbenefits for miners in exchange for a lifetime of hard work. It is a promise that the Federal Government has kept ever since.  For 70 years, no matter the President, no matter the party in control of the Senate, we have kept that promise. Thatchanged, unfortunately, in This body left for vacation. It left tens of thousands of mine workers to face an uncertainfuture, not knowing if the pensions and health care they had earned for themselves--and in many cases for their widows--over alifetime of hard work would be there for them in the future. This is shameful.[[Page S45]]  Senator Portman, my Republican colleague from Ohio, and I and Senator Manchin and Senator Capito, a Democratand a Republican from West Virginia, and Senator Casey--a number of us--said: We should not leave Washington to go home toour families until we take care of mine worker families.  Congress has the power to stop these cuts and to live up to this pledge. We had a bipartisan solution that would have passedif it had been brought to the floor. But instead, Congress broke its promise to these miners and their families. Congress stolethe health care they had earned by passing a continuing resolution that failed to address the pension problem, and it stole thefunds that were still left in their health care plan to pay for a 4-month fix--4 months, 4 months. Who can make health caredecisions when you don't know if you will have health care coverage 4 months from now?  These working people don't deserve to live with this kind of uncertainty. I have heard my colleagues, particularly on theRepublican side of the aisle, always talk about predictability. Government should never inject more uncertainty into the livesof individuals, never should inject uncertainty into the lives of business people as they make investment decisions.  But that is what we have done with these mine workers. We have made their lives less certain, less predictable, and theirhealth care so unpredictable. This is the health care these workers fought for, the health care they sacrificed raises for. Keepin mind that at the bargaining table, workers will be willing to accept less wages today in exchange for health care andpensions in the future. That is what collective bargaining is often about. That is what is so important.  This is health care they sacrificed raises for. It was the health care we promised them. My colleagues know their stories ofhard work and sacrifice. We know these stories because over the past year, these miners traveled here by the busload. They rodelong distances. They gathered in the heat and in the cold for hours outside this building to make their voices heard.  They worked decades in the mines--hard back-breaking work. But that work had dignity. It was dangerous work--work where someof them were killed on the job, work where many of them developed health problems later. Many of them died younger than peoplewho dress like we do and have jobs like this. Their widows have been denied these pensions and health care. They clocked inevery day, these workers. They knew the conditions they faced. Many of them now suffer from black lung or other illnesses. Theyaccepted a lifetime of hard labor because they valued their jobs, they valued their work, and they believed that good-payingunion jobs were their tickets to the middle class.  These miners believed in the covenant we used to have in this country that promised if you work hard your whole life, if youput in the hours, if you save a little and do your part, you will be able to help your children go to college. They believedthat would give their kids a chance at a better life perhaps than they had. They believed that if they upheld their end of thedeal, if they put in the work to power our country by mining coal used for a generation of electricity, their government woulddo the same. In December, Congress told them they were wrong. I don't accept that. These workerssacrificed their lungs and their backs to keep our lights on. It is shameful that Congress, despite all intents and purposes,has stolen what they earned. These miners should have spent Christmas with their grandkids, not worrying about whether theycould afford their medicine.  We aren't giving up. We had a bipartisan solution in We will keep fighting until mine workers across Ohio and thiscountry have the full health care and retirement security that we promised them. They kept faith with us and powered ourcountry. It is time to keep faith with the workers in our industrial heartland and to right this wrong.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1935,topic-id,1122,"Mr.President, skyrocketing drug prices are crippling far too many American families. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that nearly 8 in 10 Americans believe the cost of their prescription drugs is too high and that Congress should work to lower the price of medication that people need.  This should be our top health priority for 2017, lowering drug costs for families, not taking health care away from Americans with no plan to replace it. Think about that. This Congress is hell-bent on, instead of attacking one of the major causes of health care inflation--and we have done a good job the last 10 years, by and large, of keeping prices from going much higher than they would have otherwise. Keep that in mind while we hear the generally specious arguments against the Affordable Care Instead of doing that, the majority party has fallen all over itself to try to take away health insurance from 900,000 people in my State; taking away from 1 million seniors the Medicare consumer protections and Medicare services of preventive care, such as osteoporosis screening, diabetes screening, physicals, all that the doctors order; taking away from 100,000 young people the ability to stay on their parents' health care plan; and stripping from virtually all Ohio citizens the consumer protections of denying people coverage because of previous conditions, cutting people off their insurance policy because they happen to get too sick and might have cost the insurance companies too much money.  This health care coverage that has saved 24,000 American lives each year since 2014, just think what could happen if we took away their health care coverage.  Instead, lowering drug prices should be something we can come together on.[[Page S221]]Americans of all political parties and Americans who don't even bother voting are all facing skyrocketing pharmacy bills. There are concrete actions we can take right now to lower the cost of prescription drugs.  Senator Franken and I led 18 of our colleagues in outlining 5 of them in a letter to the President-elect in December, including putting an end to abusive price gouging, requiring more transparency from drug companies, boosting competition and innovation in the market, and allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate better prices for seniors. That is what we do with the Veterans' The VA, on behalf of 7 million veterans, negotiates directly with the drug companies to get a significantly better price for the cost of drugs--saves taxpayers, saves veterans. Medicare should do the same thing.  Senator Klobuchar and I worked with several colleagues to reintroduce the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Negotiating better prices for seniors will save significant taxpayer dollars.  Instead of focusing on the priorities that the vast majority of Americans agree on, Congress and President-Elect Trump are working to throw 30 million Americans and some 900,000 Ohioans off their health insurance with no plans to replace it. It is reckless and dangerous. It will cause premiums to skyrocket. It will cause costs to go up for everyone. Do you know what it does? It gives a $30 billion tax break to drugs companies and tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest  On the one hand, Congress will not do anything about drug prices because the pharmaceutical industry, frankly, gave too much money to far too many of my colleagues. On the other hand, this same Congress is going to strip away health care and consumer protections to seniors on Medicare and people of all ages and at the same time give a tax break to the drug companies. We must fight against these attempts to decrease coverage and increase costs for working families.  Whether you support the Affordable Care Act or not, we all agree you can't ask people to change horses midstream without giving them a second horse.  Last week, I spoke with one of my constituents, Kathy, who wrote to my office last November with the heartbreaking story of her husband He is fighting stage IV cancer. Before 2010, insurance companies denied Kathy and her family the family coverage she needed because her husband's cancer was a preexisting condition. Thankfully, the Affordable Care Act stopped insurance companies from abusive practices like this. It allowed Kathy's family to buy health insurance through the marketplace, helping them afford the care he needs to fight this devastating disease. Still, like so many Ohio families, Kathy continues to struggle to afford the prescription medicines she and her husband need. She fears what will happen when a family like hers is simply kicked off their insurance.  Imagine 900,000 Ohioans with insurance and, like that--because of partisan politics here, because so many of my colleagues ran for President, in some cases, or ran for the Senate or ran for the House by saying they are going to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and they are going to get rid of it and not replace it for a couple of years maybe.  Governor Kasich, Republican Governor in my State--also in the Presidential race with my friend in the Presiding Officer's chair--has said to the Senate and House, to Ohio's Republican Members: Don't cancel the Affordable Care Don't throw people off insurance unless you are going to replace it with something right now that will take care of those people; 700,000 people on Medicaid expansion, another 200,000 people, 26-year-olds, on their parents' plan, people on the exchanges, people getting insurance in other ways.  When I was talking to Kathy the other day, she was choked up talking about the stress and heartache dealing with a loved one with cancer, how she can't even bear the thought of adding more insurance worries on top of that. I was speaking to a hospital administrator today at one of Ohio's great hospitals. He said he thinks what this Republican Congress is going to do in the Affordable Care Act is morally reprehensible. He said: How do I explain to people right in the middle of their treatment that we can't do it anymore? Because we will not have the resources if the Affordable Care Act is repealed and the insurance is canceled and the Medicaid expansion is gone and hospitals can't take care of everybody like they are pretty much now. How do I explain to somebody right in the middle of cancer treatment, right in the middle of another kind of long-term or short-term illness that their insurance has been cut off?  Instead of kicking people off their insurance with no plan to replace it and handing billions of dollars in tax breaks to the drug companies, let us make our first priority lowering drug costs for the people whom we say we are serving.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgS220-5.txt,2106,MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,January

I was pleased the rules package also includes an important effort to address unauthorized appropriations, an issue I have championed as a member of the Rules I think it is very concerning for Congress to appropriate money to any Federal agency that has not gone through the appropriations process or has seen their authorization expire.  Thanks to provisions included in this package, it is my hope that each of our standing committees will make a better effort to address unauthorized programs and ensure that Congress is providing diligent oversight of the Federal bureaucracy.  Mr.Speaker, the American people sent us to this body to make real changes on their behalf. We must adopt these rules today so that we can go about the people's business. I urge my colleagues to support these rules so the House can address the many important issues that await our attention so that we can all, each and every one of us, have real free speech.

910,topic-id,641,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to share my strong support for this rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, there is no greater friend to the United States than Israel is a beacon of hope in a very dangerous part of the world. They are an important economic and military partner of the United States, and they play a critical role when it comes to fighting radical Islamic terrorism.  Given the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship, I was deeply disappointed to see the United States recently passed a flawed anti-Israel resolution that will only make it more difficult to achieve peace in the Middle Even more disappointing was the fact that the United States just stood by and did nothing as it happened. Instead of vetoing the resolution, the United States Ambassador abstained from voting at all.  In other words, the United States turned its back and looked the other way as the U.passed a flawed resolution attacking This represents a[[Page H116]]dangerous break in a longstanding and bipartisan policy to protect our sole democratic ally in the region from one-sided resolutions at the U. Let's be clear, this resolution does absolutely nothing to make peace more likely in the region. Instead, it muddies the water and only further complicates what is already a very complex issue.  No solution to the ongoing problems with Israel and the Palestinian Authority is going to come from an international body like the United Nations telling them what to do. Any real solution must come through negotiations between the involved parties.  Honestly, given the many blunders of the Obama administration on the world stage, I guess this most recent action shouldn't be all that surprising. But this action is one of the most irresponsible acts ever by an outgoing It will be a dark stain on an already disastrous legacy.  By abstaining and allowing this resolution to pass, the Obama administration has upset decades of bipartisan policy as it relates to Israel and put a pathway to peace even further out of reach. Now is the time to be standing up for Israel, not turning away from them.  It is my hope and my belief that under President-elect Trump the United States will once again stand arm in arm with Israel, and this resolution is an important step in that direction.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I hope that my colleague from Alabama uses some of that passion to convince the President-elect to stop cozying up to Vladimir Putin, who is no friend of democracy, no friend of Israel, and no friend of human rights.  All we are trying to do here, Mr.Speaker, is to have a little democracy on the House floor. People can vote whichever way they want to vote. But the Rules Committee last night, staying true to form, actually denied us the ability to bring to the floor and debate an alternative, which we think is, quite frankly, more appropriate.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will make in order 23, the David Price-Eliot Engel-Gerry Connolly resolution, to provide an alternative viewpoint.  Mr.Speaker, this resolution again was blocked by the Rules Committee, right along party line. Republicans said ``no'' to an open debate, even though it complies with all the rules of the  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

1324,topic-id,2501,"Mr.Speaker, last Friday the House and the Senate met to fulfill our solemn constitutional responsibility to count the votes of electors for President and Vice This year the joint session was confronted with a record number of so-called faithless electors--electors who were supposed to vote for the Presidential candidates named on their States' ballot, but, instead, voted for someone else.  Different States handle their faithless electors in different ways. In my view, the joint session rightly fulfilled its constitutional responsibility by simply taking the certified results of each State without intervention. This was in line with precedent set in 1969 and with the text of the  Because I believe this decision to be correct, I did not file an objection during the counting process. However, I wish for the Record to contain my views on this matter and to express my concern that an avoidable constitutional crisis on this subject is a very real possibility in the future.  The faithless elector problem has often been seen as academic, but in 2000, Vice President Gore was three faithless electors away from the As a point of reference, there were 10 faithless electors in this election. Thus, this is not a matter that should be taken lightly.  Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution gives the States the exclusive power to appoint electors in a manner decided by their State legislatures. Clause 4 provides the sole grant of authority to Congress in the process to determine the time for choosing electors and the day they cast their vote.  The process to count electors is outlined in Clause 3 and identical language which superseded it in the 12th It provides that, ``The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted. . . .'' Under the 12th Amendment, the persons receiving a majority of the vote ``shall be'' the President and Vice  The extent of what Congress' powers are in the counting process has been the subject of over 200 years of debate. The Congressional Record from 1800 includes a lengthy speech by Senator Charles Pinckney, a Framer of the Constitution, who stated that as the Framers wished the President to be independent, ``It never was intended . . . to have given to Congress . . . the right to object to any electoral vote.''  The first successful effort to expand Congress' power in counting did not come until 1865, when Congress adopted a joint House-Senate rule on the subject. Under the rule, no electoral vote that incurred an objection could be counted unless both Houses agreed.  The joint rule was tempered by the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which still governs the counting process to this day. The law allows an objection signed by a House and a Senate However, under the Electoral Count Act, unless there is a case of double returns, no electoral vote regularly given and lawfully certified shall be rejected.  In 1969, Lloyd Bailey, a Republican elector from North Carolina, was faithless, and the Governor of North Carolina certified the State's electoral certificate with knowledge of his vote.  The House and the Senate thoroughly debated whether Bailey's vote should be counted, but ultimately voted to reject the challenge. Opponents of the challenge, in my view, properly argued that Congress lacked the power to exclude Bailey's vote under the Electoral Count Act and, more importantly, Congress had no power to exclude his vote under the To do so would be a violation of the rights of the sovereign  Some have argued that the Bailey precedent is not applicable when an elector violates his or her State's law in casting a faithless vote. I find this argument constitutionally suspect. Unless no candidate reaches a majority, Congress' role in the counting process appears to be ministerial: to count votes and announce a result.  For that reason, the issue of faithless electors is rightly resolved at the State level, before the results reach At the present time, however, a[[Page H198]]hodgepodge of State laws exist to deal with faithless electors, some of which are ill-equipped to handle the problem.  Fortunately, the Uniform Law Commission has proposed the Faithful Presidential Electors Act, which has already been enacted in four The Faithful Presidential Electors Act provides a State-administered pledge of faithfulness, with any attempt by an elector to submit a vote in violation of that pledge constituting a resignation from the office of elector. In such case, the act provides a mechanism for filling an electoral vacancy.  At the conclusion of my remarks, I will include in the Record a copy of the Faithful Presidential Electors  In short, Mr.Speaker, based upon my view of the Constitution, Congress properly handled the issue of faithless electors in this election. This election should, however, serve as a wake-up call to States that further action on their part may be necessary.

SHORT This [act] may be cited as the      Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors       SECTION 2. In this [act]:       (1) ``Cast'' means accepted by the [Secretary of State] in      accordance with Section 7(b).       (2) ``Elector'' means an individual selected as a      presidential elector under [applicable state statute] and      this [act].       (3) ``President'' means President of the United       (4) [``Unaffiliated presidential candidate'' means a      candidate for President who qualifies for the general      election ballot in this state by means other than nomination      by a political party.]       [(5)] ``Vice President'' means Vice President of the United            SECTION 3. DESIGNATION OF STATE'S For each      elector position in this state, a political party contesting      the position[, or an unaffiliated presidential candidate,]      shall submit to the [Secretary of State] the names of two      qualified individuals. One of the individuals must be      designated ``elector nominee'' and the other ``alternate      elector nominee''. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5      through 8, this state's electors are the winning elector      nominees under the laws of this state.       Legislative Note: For a state wishing to accommodate      unpledged electors, the following three sentences could be      substituted for the first two sentences of Section 3: ``Any      political party [or unaffiliated presidential candidate]      advancing candidates for elector positions in this state      shall submit to the [Secretary of State] the names of two      qualified individuals for each elector position to be      contested. One of the individuals must be designated      ``elector nominee'' and the other ``alternate elector      nominee''. Any unpledged candidate for the position of      elector who is not nominated by a political party or      unaffiliated presidential candidate shall submit to the      [Secretary of State], in addition to the individual's own      name as ``elector nominee'', the name of another qualified      individual designated as ``alternate elector nominee''.''       SECTION 4. Each elector nominee and alternate      elector nominee of a political party shall execute the      following pledge: ``If selected for the position of elector,      I agree to serve and to mark my ballots for President and      Vice President for the nominees for those offices of the      party that nominated me.'' [Each elector nominee and      alternate elector nominee of an unaffiliated presidential      candidate shall execute the following pledge: ``If selected      for the position of elector as a nominee of an unaffiliated      presidential candidate, I agree to serve and to mark my      ballots for that candidate and for that candidate's vice-     presidential running mate.''] The executed pledges must      accompany the submission of the corresponding names to the      [Secretary of State].       Legislative Note: This act does not deal with the      possibility of death of a presidential or vice-presidential      candidate before the electoral college meetings, or with any      other disabling condition or the discovery of disqualifying      information. A state may choose to deal separately with one      or another of these possibilities.       SECTION 5. CERTIFICATION OF In submitting this      state's certificate of ascertainment as required by 3 U.S.     Section 6, the [Governor] shall certify this state's electors      and state in the certificate that:       (1) the electors will serve as electors unless a vacancy      occurs in the office of elector before the end of the meeting      at which elector votes are cast, in which case a substitute      elector will fill the vacancy; and       (2) if a substitute elector is appointed to fill a vacancy,      the [Governor] will submit an amended certificate of      ascertainment stating the names on the final list of this      state's electors.       SECTION 6. PRESIDING OFFICER; ELECTOR       (a) The [Secretary of State] shall preside at the meeting      of electors described in Section 7.       (b) The position of an elector not present to vote is      vacant. The [Secretary of State] shall appoint an individual      as a substitute elector to fill a vacancy as follows:       (1) if the alternate elector is present to vote, by      appointing the alternate elector for the vacant position;       (2) if the alternate elector for the vacant position is not      present to vote, by appointing an elector chosen by lot from      among the alternate electors present to vote who were      nominated by the same political party [or unaffiliated      presidential candidate];       (3) if the number of alternate electors present to vote is      insufficient to fill any vacant position pursuant to      paragraphs (1) and (2), by appointing any immediately      available individual who is qualified to serve as an elector      and chosen through nomination by and plurality vote of the      remaining electors, including nomination and vote by a single      elector if only one remains;       (4) if there is a tie between at least two nominees for      substitute elector in a vote conducted under paragraph (3),      by appointing an elector chosen by lot from among those      nominees; or       (5) if all elector positions are vacant and cannot be      filled pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4), by appointing      a single presidential elector, with remaining vacant      positions to be filled under paragraph (3) and, if necessary,      paragraph (4).       (c) To qualify as a substitute elector under subsection      (b), an individual who has not executed the pledge required      under Section 4 shall execute the following pledge: ``I agree      to serve and to mark my ballots for President and Vice      President consistent with the pledge of the individual to      whose elector position I have succeeded.''.       Legislative Note: As with Sections 3 and 4, adjustment of      this Section is required for any state where unpledged      electors are permissible. For a state wishing to accommodate      unpledged electors, the language of subsections (b)(2),      (b)(3), and (c) could be changed to the following:       (b)(2): ``if the alternate elector for the vacant position      is not present to vote but other alternate electors who were      nominated by the same political party [or unaffiliated      presidential candidate] are present, by appointing an elector      chosen by lot from among those alternate electors of the same      political party [or of the same unaffiliated presidential      candidate] .''       (b)(3): ``if the vacant position is that of an unpledged      elector and the alternate elector for that vacant position is      not present to vote, or if there otherwise are no alternate      electors eligible for the vacant position under paragraphs      (1) and (2), by appointing any immediately available      individual who is qualified to serve as an elector and has      been chosen through nomination by and plurality vote of the      remaining electors, including nomination and vote by a single      elector if only one remains.''       (c): ``To qualify as a substitute elector for a vacant      position associated with an elector who had executed a      pledge, an individual who has not executed the pledge      required under Section 4 shall execute the following pledge:      ``I agree to serve and to mark my ballots for President and      Vice President consistent with the pledge of the individual      to whose elector position I have succeeded''.''       SECTION 7. ELECTOR       (a) At the time designated for elector voting and after all      vacant positions have been filled under Section 6, the      [Secretary of State] shall provide each elector with a      presidential and a vice-presidential ballot. The elector      shall mark the elector's presidential and vice-presidential      ballots with the elector's votes for the offices of President      and Vice President, respectively, along with the elector's      signature and the elector's legibly printed name.       (b) Except as otherwise provided by law of this state other      than this [act], each elector shall present both completed      ballots to the [Secretary of State], who shall examine the      ballots and accept as cast all ballots of electors whose      votes are consistent with their pledges executed under      Section 4 or 6(c). Except as otherwise provided by law of      this state other than this [act], the [Secretary of State]      may not accept and may not count either an elector's      presidential or vice-presidential ballot if the elector has      not marked both ballots or has marked a ballot in violation      of the elector's pledge.       (c) An elector who refuses to present a ballot, presents an      unmarked ballot, or presents a ballot marked in violation of      the elector's pledge executed under Section 4 or 6(c) vacates      the office of elector, creating a vacant position to be      filled under Section 6.       (d) The [Secretary of State] shall distribute ballots to      and collect ballots from a substitute elector and repeat the      process under this section of examining ballots, declaring      and filling vacant positions as required, and recording      appropriately completed ballots from the substituted      electors, until all of this state's electoral votes have been      cast and recorded.       SECTION 8. ELECTOR REPLACEMENT; ASSOCIATED CERTIFICATES.[[Page H199]]       (a) After the vote of this state's electors is completed,      if the final list of electors differs from any list that the      [Governor] previously included on a certificate of      ascertainment prepared and transmitted under 3 U.S.Section      6, the [Secretary of State] immediately shall prepare an      amended certificate of ascertainment and transmit it to the      [Governor] for the [Governor's] signature.       (b) The [Governor] immediately shall deliver the signed      amended certificate of ascertainment to the [Secretary of      State] and a signed duplicate original of the amended      certificate of ascertainment to all individuals entitled to      receive this state's certificate of ascertainment, indicating      that the amended certificate of ascertaimnent is to be      substituted for the certificate of ascertainment previously      submitted.

1493,topic-id,2990,"Mr.President, I look forward to having this discussion this afternoon about the Affordable Care Act and the many votes and actions that are going to be taking place. I especially look forward to having this discussion with the Presiding Officer because I know his State is greatly impacted by the health care delivery system and its shortfalls, and I look forward to discussing with him some of the many ideas that our colleagues have.  I will say this at the outset of my comments. I am willing to work with anybody to improve our health care delivery system. I am willing to discuss with anybody what we need to do to improve the quality of health care for Americans, and I am specifically interested in making sure that we improve the outcomes of many Americans' health care and that we also lower costs.  It has been the hallmark of what the Northwest health care delivery system has been all about. Yes, that is right. We get less money and deliver better outcomes. It is not because we all like to hike, although there are many Washingtonians who like to hike. It is because we have had to make do with less, and we have built a better system. We hope the rest of the country can move forward along similar lines.  So I am here to talk about the Affordable Care Act and the many aspects of it that are so important to our Nation in actually slowing health care costs and reducing our deficit. That is one of the cornerstones of why we did delivery system reform and why we did health care reform. We needed to slow the rate of health insurance increases, and we needed to lower the costs for us as a nation as well for the private sector. That was the task at hand. So to my colleagues who are ready to repeal all that, I ask you to wait. I ask you to stop and think about what we are doing, and before you repeal, think about what we are going to put in its place because this is such an important issue.  What does the Affordable Care Act mean? One of the aspects that I think is getting lost in this debate is that people are talking about what has happened in a percentage of the individual market. They are talking about the plans as they related to last October and what happened with rate increases. Some people said: Oh, well, a lot of providers went out and offered a lot of low-ball coverage costs and came back with higher rates later. Some people said: Some of the pools aren't big enough. Some people said: Well, the coverage we are going to guarantee is going to help. But the issue is that the Affordable Care Act is much more than just what we tried to do in the individual markets. It is about providing affordable coverage, but it is also about reducing costs, improving the health care delivery system, protecting women's health, and saving the taxpayers money. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will think about all of these issues--providing affordable coverage, reducing costs, improving the health care delivery system. I warn my colleagues that if you repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away its improvements to the delivery system, you are going to balloon the deficit, and that is something that we cannot afford.  What am I talking about when I say ``affordable coverage''? Well, let's take Washington State, for example. I am sure the Presiding Officer could take his State also, but in our State, there are 3 million Washingtonians with preexisting conditions who are guaranteed coverage; there are 50,000 young adults who can keep coverage through their parents' plans; and more than 600,000 Washingtonians have been covered by the Medicaid expansion.[[Page S129]]  To me, the Medicaid expansion is about simple math. Medicaid is expanded because it is the most cost-effective, economical way for that population to get health care coverage and to be part of the health care system, keeping our costs down and keeping that population healthy.  Depending on what State you are from and what philosophy you have as an individual, you may not be for Medicaid expansion. There have been many times that across the aisle we have been able to come to terms on Medicaid expansion and on the CHIP program because we believe that having a healthier population is a good economic policy for our After the Affordable Care Act implementation, we actually have results, studies, and analysis by various States in the Nation that have said that expanding the Medicaid population has helped our economy and has helped our States overall. So I would say to my colleagues, please do not repeal the Medicaid expansion. Please do not put these people back on the street with their health care problems and health care issues and increase the cost of uncompensated care. That is not a strategy.  What else do we want to do? We want to drop the rate of uninsured The Affordable Care Act has done that, decreasing by more than 40 percent the number of uninsured Less than 9 percent of Americans are now uninsured. In our State, the uninsured rate has dropped to 5.8 percent, which is a nearly 60-percent decrease. For us in the State of Washington, we have more people covered. The Affordable Care Act is covering more people, so we have taken more people out of the uninsured market.  The way the other side of the aisle would like to describe this is that the whole thing is falling apart because of some changes and shifts in the individual market, but the facts are there that the law is not only expanding coverage but lowering costs. Looking at what health care costs would have been over the last decade has always been a tricky issue. The rates of health care costs were going up. I like to say that we may want health care costs to keep pace with the rate of inflation--and I will give health costs a little bit of an inflationary bump because of technology and new innovation. It is not the same as the rate of inflation for everything else, but at the same time, we shouldn't be seeing double-digit increases in the costs of health care. Our goal was to change the system to the degree that we would see health care costs more in line or a little bit above the rate of inflation.  This chart shows the national expenditures for health care on the dotted line on these actual and most recent projections of what the health care system is doing now compared to what it would have been before the Affordable Care So again, people are debating over what these increases are, when in reality we were seeing double-digit increases, and now we are seeing the cost growth of health care go down.  So going back to the chart for a second, this projection is so big because of many factors. This is about changing the delivery system; this is about making sure that there are not exorbitant amounts of uncompensated care; and this is about making sure that we don't overspend on the health care delivery system. I can imagine that for some States this must be the most frustrating issue, particularly if the reimbursement rate has led to a population that is constantly underserved because no one wants to see those patients. We in the Northwest have had that frustration because we get somewhere between $1,000 to $2,000 less--maybe even more--per Medicare beneficiary than many other States in the country. That has led to a situation where people don't even see Medicare beneficiaries in parts of our That is right. People have to travel a great distance to find a doctor because they can't find one because of the Medicare reimbursement rate.  My solution is, if we are providing health care in my State with better outcomes and lower costs, I shouldn't be penalized for that; I should be rewarded. Every other State should try to practice medicine that actually helps us lower the costs.  So why are we working on this issue? The Affordable Care Act has contributed to slower cost growth. Medicare spent $473 billion less in the 5-year period from 2009-2014 compared to the benchmark--compared to what would have been done if we did nothing. So, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I know you are all for repeal. Where will you replace this money? Where are you going to come up with those savings? If you come to the floor and say that you don't want to repeal the delivery system reform that we fought so hard for and crafted, that you are willing to make those changes and keep the delivery system, we will be listening with open arms and great receptivity because there are many people on this side of the aisle who have worked very, very hard on these reforms.  In the private sector, we have also slowed the rate of growth in insurance premiums. I am talking now about the employer-based plans. We slowed the rate to one-third of what it was before.  Individuals are seeing lower increases than what they would have had to pay before these reforms.  So what is the debate about now? What we are trying to do in health care reform is improve health care by decreasing costs, having better patient outcomes, and helping doctors spend more time with their patients than with their paperwork. This is critically important because what we are seeing in the United States is doctors spending more time on the paperwork of the system than on the actual outcomes of their patients.  We want everybody to have a medical home. We want everybody to have a delivery system that rewards outcomes, and that is what we are driving for, but the debate in Washington has not been over this issue of where Americans get their insurance coverage. As you can see from this chart, 49 percent of Americans get insurance through work, 34 percent of them through Medicare and Medicaid and other public programs, and then a much smaller percentage are uninsured or in the individual market. The debate now is over the individual market. The debate is over the 7-percent number.  In some States, the individual market was out of whack for a variety of reasons. Maybe the risk pool was too small, maybe insurers went too low on their original estimates, maybe they made some changes that didn't work in that marketplace, but that doesn't mean we throw out all of the Affordable Care Act that is doing such great work just because 7 percent of the population in the individual market needs further attention. It doesn't mean that we repeal all of this. It certainly doesn't mean that we give this uncertainty to the American people about whether they are going to have health care coverage and give the illusion that the other side of the aisle is doing anything but taking the system and capping Medicare and Medicaid, giving out a check that never keeps pace with inflation, and then taking the savings from the system and channeling it into corporate tax reform relief. No, no, no, no, no. We need to make the health care delivery system work for the American people, deliver better outcomes, and continue to make reforms.  What are the innovations that we are talking about in the delivery system? Well, my colleague, the Presiding Officer, will know, because he understands health care, that the innovation in health care is about everybody having a medical home. Why do you need a medical home? You need a medical home because you need to be seen, not by the emergency room physician but by your doctor and someone who is going to understand your health care needs.  We need to make investments in primary care and prevention and wellness. I am sure the Presiding Officer understands that we don't have enough primary care providers in the United We need to change our system for the GME; that is, graduate medical education, so we can get more primary care providers.  We also need to focus on health and wellness. That is what the Affordable Care Act does. It starts to look at the system and rewards prevention and wellness. The Affordable Care Act says: OK, let's try to do this in a new way. Accountable care organizations aim for a global budget instead of all the paperwork that has to happen. A provision I authored, the Basic Health Plan, which is being used in the State of New York, is showing results in lowering[[Page S130]]the costs of premiums, giving affordability to people well beyond what they were able to otherwise get.  The other idea is rebalancing nursing care to community-based care. Twenty-one States applied for and were approved to do rebalancing. A lot of these States were Republican States in the South that took the money from the Affordable Care Act and bought into this really smart notion. It says: Let's rebalance away from nursing home care into community-based care, and we as the Federal Government will help incent that. So all the Republican Governors that took that money from the Affordable Care Act to try to rebalance their population away from a very expensive delivery system to a new delivery system, are they now going to pay us back? Is that what repeal is going to mean, that we are going to ask them to pay us the money back or that we are going to forgo this notion that moving people out of nursing homes and keeping them in their community homes is more important?  I will tell you this. We have a problem of an aging population in the United States of America, and the best thing we can do is help change the delivery system so it is more cost effective for the future. That is what the Affordable Care Act did.  The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, which is also a part of the Affordable Care Act, drove in some incredible efficiencies. The Secretary just spoke today at the National Press Club, talking about focusing on better managing care for many people affected with diabetes because they are one of the biggest cost drivers. So all of this innovation is part of the Affordable Care Are we going to repeal that, too? Are we going to repeal all those health care delivery reforms that are helping reduce the cost of health care?  So what does repeal actually mean?  I am taking it from two different sources here; that is, a full Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act will increase the deficit by $350 billion over 10 years.  Why does the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that? Why do they say that? Why would they make such a claim? Because they know that built into the Affordable Care Act are changes to the health care delivery system that improve access, focus on better outcomes, and change our system for the better. We cannot afford to repeal this as a way to try to say to our base: This is a better way of delivering health care.  What does the Affordable Care Act come down to?  The philosophy we pushed through is to put the patient at the center of the health care delivery system so that it works for them. The repeal attempt by the other side is nothing more than basically saying we are going to come up with a model where you are not at the center of this, you are going to get a check that no longer pays for your full health insurance costs, you are going to get capitated and so is Medicare and Medicaid--or at least that is all we can get out of the other side right now about their plans.  It is very important to me that we do not repeal the Affordable Care Act and that we certainly don't repeal the Affordable Care Act without any idea what it is that we are going to be doing instead. We have millions of Americans who will not be covered, and we are going to throw away our whole system, which has managed to save private employers and individual families millions of dollars--I would say billions of dollars over the time period of this legislation and put us on the right track. If we have to make some changes and adjustments to the system, let's make some adjustments and changes to the system, but let's not throw out the entire legislation, and certainly let us not steal away the Affordable Care Act from the American people.  Basically, that is what repeal is. Repeal is stealing away the affordability they have been granted over these last several years and instead taking it for some other corporate interest. I hope it is not to stuff it into a tax reform bill to give relief to corporate America because that is not what we need. We need a delivery system that works for everyone. We need to save those individuals by making sure there is a cost-effective health care option for them and the marketplace, and I look forward to seeing real and serious legislation--not a poster board but a solution.  I love working with my colleagues who want to work on these ideas. I do. I will because this is a solvable problem. It is. We have shown that. We have enough results. We have to make some adjustments, but repealing is just stealing health care from hard-working I urge my colleagues to turn that down.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

661,topic-id,2224,"Mr.President, it is with a renewed sense of purpose that I reintroduce my resolution on the Emoluments Clause.It is a resolution intended to uphold the values and strictures of one of our most sacred documents. I am referring, of course,to the Constitution, the instrument that, in but a short time, President-elect Donald Trump will take an oath to preserve,protect, and defend.  Our Founding Fathers could not have been clearer that any Federal office holder of the United States must never be put in aposition where he or she could be influenced by a foreign governmental actor. It was a concern made explicit by AlexanderHamilton's writings in Federalist 22, in which he noted examples of republics that had been ruthlessly dismembered by theirhostile neighbors who had paralyzed the victim republic by bribing its officers and officials.  The Founding Fathers addressed this grave concern by placing the Emoluments Clause within the Constitution as an explicitbar on foreign corruption and interference. Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the United States Constitution declaresthat:       No title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States:      And no Person holding any Officeof Profit or Trust under      them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of      any present, Emolument, Office, or Title,of any kind      whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign  Longstanding precedent has made it plain that the President of the United States, as the head of the executive branch of thegovernment, clearly occupies an ``office of profit or trust''. As such, the Emoluments Clause clearly applies to and constrainswhomever holds the office of the  Past American presidents have recognized the danger of foreign corruption and interference, or merely the perception ofcorruption and interference, and have accordingly taken great pains to avoid even the appearance of impropriety with regard totheir personal wealth and investments, ensuring that such investments never interfere with performing their duties as Presidentof the United Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and George Bush allhad their assets placed into blind trust while they were To fulfill his promises of greater government transparency,President Obama went even further and invested the vast majority of his funds in U.Treasury bonds.  The President-elect has claimed he will ``absolutely sever'' his ties to the Trump Organization, which has financialinterests around the world and negotiates and concludes transactions with foreign states, as well as entities that areextensions of foreign states. We have a constitutional duty to ensure that he does. It is easy to imagine circumstances in whicha foreign government will want to give President Trump a personal gift through his businesses with the intent to curry favorwith him and seek to influence his decisions in ways that benefit them, instead of the American people--precisely the danger ourFounding Fathers sought to protect against with the Emoluments  This is not an esoteric argument about rules that do not affect real people. Put simply, the American public has a right toknow that the President of the United States is always acting in their best interest, and not take the risk that his actions areinfluenced by some benefit or gift from a foreign government like Russia or The citizens of this country need to knowthat when the President of the United States is making decisions about potential trade agreements, sending troops into war, orspending America's great resources, those actions are motivated by the public interest, and not because they might advance orharm[[Page S64]]the President's private pecuniary interests.  We should be concerned when the President-elect is connected to an organization that has dealings with countries andentities that are not interested in distinguishing between doing business with President Trump and the profit-makingorganization that bears his name. The President-elect's failure thus far to dispose of his business interests in a comprehensivefashion has left this door wide open, and we are already seeing indications that foreign companies and businesses are beginningto take advantage. Kuwait's National Day event, which has traditionally been held at the Four Seasons in Washington, D.C., wasmoved to the Trump International Hotel, allegedly because of pressure--or perhaps merely a suggestion--from the President-elect'sassociates. Similarly, Bahrain has chosen to schedule an event to take place at the Trump International  News reports suggest that one day after a phone call between President-elect Trump and the President of Argentina, permitsunder review for the Trump building in Buenos Aires were suddenly approved. In China, just days after the presidential election,Donald Trump scored a legal victory in a decade-long trademark dispute over the right to use the Trump name for real estateagent services in commercial and residential properties in The timing of these actions is interesting, to put it mildly.  I sincerely regret the necessity of reintroducing this resolution. Just after Thanksgiving, when President-elect Trump helda press conference to state that on December 15, 2016, he would make an announcement about his future with the TrumpOrganization, I publicly said how encouraged I was to see the President-elect's positive response. When I first introduced thisresolution, my intent was to create an opportunity for the President-elect to act and remove this as an issue, so that he couldput aside any appearance of impropriety and devote himself to good work on behalf of the American people. That is why I wasdisappointed when Mr.Trump abruptly canceled his December 15 announcement--and, as of today, he has not yet rescheduled it. Thisissue is far too critical to kick the can down the road, or to ignore, before an incipient violation of the Constitution becomesan actual violation.  Even before Mr.Trump's cancellation of his December 15 announcement, I was deeply concerned by statements he and hislawyers made with regard to the disposition of his numerous business interests. Mr.Trump's lawyers had initially announced thatthe Trump Organization would be placed into a ``blind trust'' managed by Donald Trump's older children. That arrangement is,unfortunately, by its terms the complete opposite of an actual blind trust. An actual blind trust is an arrangement which theofficial has no control over, will receive no communications about, and will have no knowledge of the identity of the specificassets being held, and in which the trust's manager operates independently of the owner.  Around the same time President-elect Trump cancelled his December 15th announcement, he tweeted another idea for dispositionof his businesses, stating that ``[t]wo of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will bedone during my term(s) in office''. Let me be absolutely clear: the arrangement tweeted by Mr.Trump is not sufficient and ishardly independent. Mr.Trump would be well-aware of the specific assets held, and he could receive communications about andtake actions to affect the value of those assets. The idea that President-elect Trump's children, who are listed as members ofhis transition team and have already been present at meetings or phone calls with foreign leaders, can ever be truly``independent managers'' is simply not a credible resolution of this concern.  This inadequate suggested arrangement is not a blind trust and will not ensure compliance with the Emoluments Clause of theUnited States Indeed, numerous legal and constitutional experts, including Richard Painter, a former adviser toGeorge Bush, have made clear that such an arrangement will leave the President-elect with a personal financial interest inbusinesses that collect foreign government payments and benefits. The notion that the American people should be satisfied by anunbinding promise that no new deals will be pursued--a promise that does notdefine what constitutes a ``deal'' and which can be reneged on at any time--does not pass the laugh test.  I must admit, I have also been quite disturbed and disappointed by the recent excuses and suggestions by surrogate speakersand supporters of the President-elect as to why no action need be taken and, indeed, by statements the President-elect has madehimself. President-elect Trump has tweeted, [p]rior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties allover the world.'' This is undoubtedly true. But the American people, in voting for a candidate, cannot--and, in fact, wouldnot--want to excuse a potential future violation of the Constitution by that candidate. Indeed, I would say that President-electTrump has this idea backwards. Prior to the election, he was well aware of the fact that he had interests in unique propertiesall over the world. Since the President-elect has referred to himself as ``a constitutionalist,'' he must have known of theimportance of complying with the Constitution by severing his foreign business connections in advance of his inauguration, whichmakes his continued failure and delay on this front all the more inexplicable.  On November 22nd, President-elect Trump stated, ``The law's totally on my side, meaning, the president can't have a conflictof interest.'' This regrettable statement selectively picks facts and shows a troubling disregard for the Constitution and forthe duties owed to the American people. While the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and Federal judges may begranted specific, limited exemptions from conflicts of interest so that they may act and carry out their duties, that law doesnot supersede the Constitution nor, frankly, have anything to do with the very specific provisions of the Emoluments Clause,which are intended to prevent foreign governmental financial influence over the  Even as some of the President-elect's most trusted surrogates have acknowledged that the potential ethics challenges facingPresident-elect Trump are ``a very real problem,'' they have persisted in arguing that Mr.Trump is somehow exempt fromconstitutional strictures, and even from the temptation of corruption itself, by virtue of his great wealth. For example, formerSpeaker Gingrich has claimed ``that this is a new situation we've never seen before, and the rules [that] were written forpeople who were dramatically less successful literally do not work,'' while Mr.Trump's leading candidate to head theadministration's Council of Economic Advisors has claimed that ``[w]ealthy folks have no need to steal or engage incorruption.'' Really? That is a transparently false idea that one does not have to look very far to disprove. We need onlyglance at the countries where the Trump Organization has done business--places like Russia, Azerbaijan, Argentina, and Nigeria--tofind numerous examples of already-wealthy government officials who have used their positions to lie, cheat, extort, and furtherenrich themselves and their families at the expense of the people they are supposed to be serving.  It was the enduring wisdom of our Founders to recognize that America is not magically immune from the corruption problems inother countries, and that not all men are angels. This is why we place our trust in the Constitution, not in individuals. A manwith more wealth and extensive foreign holdings than prior presidents is, by an order of magnitude, more vulnerable to foreigncorruption and interference than any president before him. The Emoluments Clause has greater bearing on Mr.Trump's presidencythan his predecessors, not less.  No man can gain such wealth and power that he outgrows the limits of our John Adams said it best: ``We are agovernment of laws, and not of men.'' No matter our political or partisan sympathies, we all recognize that the Constitution isthe law of the land, and that when the needs and ambitions of any man conflicts with the Constitution, the Constitution must winout.  It has also been suggested by some of Donald Trump's supporters that the[[Page S65]]Emoluments Clause does not actually apply tothe office of the Not only does this conflict with longstanding understanding of the Emoluments Clause in theExecutive Branch, it contravenes both the strict interpretation of the plain words of the Constitution, as well as thetraditional values and practices adopted by previous presidents.  To get around the ethics challenges facing Mr.Trump, it has been suggested by the President-elect's supporters that a panelof five ``experts'' regularly monitor the Trump Organization businesses and tell the President ``don't go over these bounds''.It has even been suggested that the President-elect can simply sidestep ethics issues that clearly violate the law by pardoningadvisors ``if anyone finds them to have behaved against the rules''. These 'ideas' are non-starters that cut dangerously againstthe plain intent of the Emoluments I am afraid they show a disregard for the values of our  The solution to this problem is simple, not complex, and is set forth by my resolution: President-elect Trump has only tofollow the precedents established by prior presidents and convert his assets to simple, conflict-free holdings; adopt blindtrusts managed by truly independent trustees with no relationship to Mr.Trump or his businesses; or to take other, equivalentmeasures. This solution also has the benefit of having been successfully implemented by every modem president before Mr. This resolution and its aims should not be viewed through the distorting prism of politics. I want the Trump administrationto have the support from Congress to succeed on behalf of the American people. Nevertheless, I believe that Congress has aninstitutional, constitutional obligation to ensure that the President of the United States, whoever that person may be, does notviolate our Constitution, acts lawfully, and is discharging the obligations of the office based on the broad interests of theAmerican people and not his or her own narrow, personal interests.  Despite the late hour--just days before the inauguration--it is still possible for President-elect Trump to live up to thevalues of the Constitution, give the American people the transparency they deserve, and completely sever his relationship withthe Trump Organization before he takes the oath of office on January 20, 2017. To do so would avoid a constitutional crisis thatwould not serve the best interests of the President, Congress, or the American people. Therefore, I ask for prompt, bipartisansupport to advance this vital resolution.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS62-2.txt,,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued",2017.0,4.0,January
1198,topic-id,3679,"Mr.President, first I want to thank Senator Durbin for his comments about the policy of repealing the Affordable Care Act and not knowing what comes next, the impact it is going to have on people from I am going to talk about people in I have received similar letters showing that people are going to be adversely impacted.  I want to share with my colleagues the conversation I had with the secretary of health from Maryland has Governor Hogan, a Republican Governor, and his secretary of health met with me several weeks ago to express his concerns about the impact on the people of my State of Maryland if the Affordable Care Act were repealed. What I heard from the secretary of health of Maryland was similar to what I heard from many of the health care stakeholders from the hospital association to physician groups, to health care advocates, to ordinary Marylanders who have contacted me about their concerns about what happens if we see a repeal of the Affordable Care  Let me just give you some examples of how the Affordable Care Act is working in my State and, as Senator Durbin indicated, in his The uninsured rate in Maryland has dropped from 12.9 percent to 6.6 percent. That is about a 50-percent drop in the uninsured rate. That benefits all Marylanders--all Yes, 400,000 Marylanders now have health coverage who didn't have health coverage before, and for those 400,000, that is a big deal. That means they can see a doctor and get a physical examination. If they are ill, they can get treated and know there are doctors and hospitals that will want to take care of them because they have third-party reimbursement. They[[Page S77]]no longer have to show up in emergency rooms because that is the only place they could get to. They can now go to a doctor and get a physical examination.  Mr.President, it benefits more than just those 400,000 Marylanders, who, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, have health coverage. It affects all Marylanders because we no longer have the amount of cost shifting of those who have health insurance paying for those who don't have health insurance because they use the system and don't pay for it. That dislocation has been dramatically changed in my So all Marylanders are benefiting from having 400,000 Marylanders who now have health coverage, but it goes beyond that. Many Marylanders who had health insurance didn't have adequate health insurance. They had restrictions on preexisting conditions. They had caps on their policies. It didn't cover preventive health care. They now have quality health coverage.  All of that is at risk. All of that is at risk because of what we are talking about doing, if I understand correctly. Quite frankly, I am still trying to figure out what the Republicans are doing to the Affordable Care Act, but if I understand it, they are going to repeal it, and they are not going to tell us right now how they are going to replace it. So everything that is included in the Affordable Care Act is at risk.  I will give you one more example of costs because I think this is an important point. Under the Affordable Care Act, if an insurance company wants to increase rates more than 10 percent, there are certain procedures they have to go through, certain public disclosures. We have a much more public process, but the number of claims of those who wanted to increase their policies by 10 percent have dropped from 75 percent before the Affordable Care Act to now 14 percent nationally. We have seen one of the lowest growth rates in health care costs in modern history. Yes, the Affordable Care Act has helped us do that. Why? Because individuals who had insurance now have coverage for preventive health care and are saving us money. Those who didn't have health care coverage now have health care coverage, and they are seeing doctors, and they are saving us money because if they have a disease, it is being caught at an earlier stage, being treated in a more aggressive way, and they are saving more intensive health care costs. All that is benefiting the people of Maryland and our country.  Senator Durbin mentioned several people in his State--a person in his State--and letters. I want to talk about people in Maryland whom I have talked to over the last several years about the impact of the Affordable Care Act and why they are so concerned about the policy now of repealing the Affordable Care  I want to go back to 2007. That is a date that Marylanders know very well. I want to go back to a 12-year-old, Deamonte Deamonte Driver was a 12-year-old who lived about 10 miles from here. His mom tried to get him to a dentist, but he had no insurance coverage, and she couldn't find a dentist. She couldn't find a dentist who would take care of him. Deamonte Driver needed about $80 of oral health care. He had an abscessed tooth that needed to be removed. It would have cost $80, and he couldn't find care in 2007 in the wealthiest country, in As a result, his tooth became abscessed and it went into his brain. He had thousands of dollars of health care costs, and he lost his life. As a result of that incident, I, along with other members of Congress, took up the cause of pediatric dental care to make sure every child in America has access to pediatric dental care. That is included in the Affordable Care Act as an essential health benefit.  Before the Affordable Care Act, very few health policies included pediatric dental; therefore, families were at risk as to whether they would actually use dental services because they did not have the money to pay for them. That was changed under the Affordable Care That is at risk. That is at risk because, if I understand what is being suggested here, we are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the essential health benefits. We can't allow any more tragedies like Deamonte Driver in America, and yet we will be putting our children at risk if we repeal the Affordable Care  There was another provision I worked very hard to get into the Affordable Care Act that I think is extremely important. We now have a National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities at the National Institutes of We have agencies that deal with minority health and health disparities in all of our health care agencies thanks to the Affordable Care That means we are now acknowledging that historically we have not done right for minority health in We looked at a lot of the research dollars; they were not spent in areas that minorities were impacted by. We see that access to care in certain communities is much more challenging because of minority status. We are looking at these issues and taking action.  The Institute sponsored a study in my home city of That study showed that depending on what ZIP Code you live in, your life expectancy could be as different as 30 years--a generation. Just your ZIP We are taking steps to change that in Baltimore thanks to the National Institutes and the Institute on Minority Health and Health Are the Republicans telling us that is not needed anymore, that we are going to repeal our efforts to look at minority health and health disparities? That is unconscionable. Yet, if I understand correctly, that is the course we are going to follow.  Mental health parity is another area we have talked about at great length here. We know we still have not reached that goal to make sure mental health receives the same attention as any other health need, but in the Affordable Care Act, we did amazing things to expand access to coverage for mental health and drug addiction. By expanding the Medicaid population, we have 1.6 million Americans who now have expanded coverage for mental health and substance abuse.  We have had great discussions in this body. I am very proud of the Cures Act, where we expanded coverage for drug addiction. Now Republicans are talking about taking a major step backward by repealing Medicaid expansion that allows access to coverage for mental health and drug addiction. To me, that is something that is unthinkable. Yet we are moving on that path by the legislation that is before us.  Let me share a letter I received from Lillian from In 2008 she lost her job. She has a history of abnormal mammograms. She could not get coverage. She could not get an insurance company to cover her because of the preexisting concerns. She wrote: The Affordable Care Act has worked. I have coverage.  No preexisting conditions. No longer is being a woman considered a preexisting condition in Are we now going to turn our backs on the women of America and allow these discriminatory practices that existed before the Affordable Care Act to come back? I will tell you, I am going to fight to do everything I can to make sure that does not happen, and I would hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle feel the same. But you are marching down a path that puts women at risk, that puts Americans at risk.  We know about the caps that were in the law before the Affordable Care What do I mean by caps? That is the maximum amount your health insurance policy will pay you. Some 2.25 million Marylanders had caps on their policies before the Affordable Care Act--not just the 400,000 new people who have come into the system, 2.25 million Marylanders will be impacted if we eliminate the protection against arbitrary caps.  The tragedy about caps is that when you really need coverage, that is when you are impacted. You get insurance to cover you. You discover you have cancer. It is extremely expensive to treat cancer in an aggressive way. All of a sudden, you are in the middle of treatment and you reach your cap. What do you do? What do you do? There are real, live examples from before we passed the Affordable Care We are going to go back to those days in the United States of America? That is what repealing the Affordable Care Act means for 2.25 million Marylanders who are being put at risk.  Rebecca from Baltimore told me about her daughter Eva, who is 18 months of age and has severe congenital heart defects and has gone[[Page S78]]through numerous operations. If caps are in place, she cannot get adequate care for her 18-month-old daughter. Those are real, live examples of people who are impacted by the Affordable Care She also told me: Thank you for the 26-year-old provision where you can stay on your parent's policy. At least she knows Eva will be able to stay on her policy until she is 26.  I heard from Nichole, who is a 22-year-old student at Towson She could not get affordable health coverage and was able to stay on her parents' policy. That is an important provision which is being repealed by the Affordable Care  I helped work on the provision in the Affordable Care Act that provides preventive care coverage--immunizations, cancer screening, contraception, no cost sharing. That saves money. Preventive health care saves money. It makes our health care system more cost-effective. That is why we decided to put a focus on preventive health care and expand it dramatically. Now, 2.95 million Marylanders benefit from the preventive health care requirements of the Affordable Care Act that is included in every health policy. That will be repealed, if I understand correctly what the Republicans are attempting to do on their repeal of the Affordable Care We don't have a replacement. We don't know what it is going to look like. It is not easy to figure out how to put the pieces back together again.  There is a provision in the Affordable Act that deals with prevention and public health funds and that provides dollars to deal with some of the real challenges we have out there--obesity, tobacco abuse. My State is getting funds so that we can deal with healthy eating that will not only provide a better quality of life for those who have weight issues but also lead to a more cost-effective health care system. That will be gone with the repeal of the Affordable Care  Let me talk for a moment about health centers because I know we made that a priority in the Affordable Care Qualified health centers are centers that are located in, in many cases, challenging communities where it is hard to get doctors and hospitals to locate. We provide access to care for people who have limited means. The Affordable Care Act did two things that are extremely important in regard to health centers. First, it provided some significant new direct resources for those programs. Secondly, because they are in challenging neighborhoods, they have a much higher number of people who have no health coverage who go into these centers; therefore, their third-party reimbursement is much lower than other health centers that are located in better neighborhoods or more affluent neighborhoods.  The Affordable Care Act has worked in expanding dramatically the capacities of these qualified health centers. We have 18 that are located in I could talk about all of them, but I have been to the Greater Baden Medical Services center several times. It is located in Prince George's They also have a center in Mary's I have been to them many times. I have seen their new facilities thanks to the Affordable Care I have seen the building in which they provide mental health services and pediatric dental care and actually adult dental care also. They provide those services to the community thanks to the Affordable Care They told me that in the very first year alone of the Affordable Care Act, they were able to reduce their uninsured rates by 20 percent, meaning they get a lot more money coming in and they can provide many more services. All of that will be gone if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. I can't be silent about that. This center is providing incredible services. It is one thing to have third-party coverage; it is another thing to have access to care. We provided both in the Affordable Care We are not going to go back.  I heard Senator Durbin talk about I just want to underscore this. This is not just about those under 65. It is about our seniors. It is about those on disability who are covered by  We heard about the doughnut hole. We all understood. We were getting numerous letters from people who fell into that doughnut hole. Guess what. Those letters are tailing off dramatically. Why? Because the Affordable Care Act closes the doughnut hole for prescription drug coverage. In my own State of Maryland, 80,000 Marylanders benefited in 2014 from the Affordable Care Act and better coverage for prescription drugs, amounting to $82 million, averaging over $1,000 per beneficiary benefit. Those over 65 have better coverage for prescription drugs. You repeal the Affordable Care Act, and all of a sudden seniors figure out they have to pay another thousand dollars a year for prescription drugs. In my State, they don't have the money to do that. You are going to again hear about prescription drugs left on the counter at the pharmacy because of the repeal.  Guess what. It even does more than that. The Affordable Care Act provided greater solvency for the Medicare system. I have heard my Republican colleagues say: We are not going to do anything to hurt Repealing the Affordable Care Act hurts It hurts the coverage and it hurts the solvency. I don't want to be part of that. I would hope my colleagues don't want to be part of that. Yet repealing the Affordable Care Act does that.  Let me talk for a moment about affordability. It is one thing to have coverage; it is another thing whether you can afford that coverage. We heard all of these stories about the increased premiums, and we know, of course, that insurance premiums in America have gone up at a slower growth rate than they did before the Affordable Care That is a fact. But we do hear about the individual market within the exchanges and how that has gone up by a significant amount, mainly because of the way it was originally rated. We have heard about that. But perhaps what many people don't know is that in my State and around the Nation, 75 percent of the people who qualify for private health insurance within the exchanges are eligible for credits. In other words, we are helping them with the affordability of their health care. In my State, that was $200 million a year to help Marylanders pay for health insurance. That will be gone with the repeal of this Affordable Care That is wrong.  I received many letters from small business owners. One of the proud parts of the Affordable Care Act is that it helped our small business owners. Why? If you ran a small business, you wanted health insurance for your employees because you wanted to keep them well. You were discriminated against before the Affordable Care You didn't have a big pool. God forbid one of your employees gets really sick during the year; your insurance premium goes through the roof. That is what was happening before the passage of the Affordable Care Are we going to go back to the days where we tell small companies: You really can't get health insurance because if someone gets sick, you lose your policies basically. That is what we are talking about.  Annette of Bel Air, MD, wrote to me. She said she has saved significant money as a small business owner as a result of the Affordable Care Tim from Laurel, MD, told me that in his small business, he saved $7,000 a year thanks to the Affordable Care The reason is simple: You have broader pools, and you get the same type of rates larger companies get now. You will lose that with the repeal of the Affordable Care  Let me tell you about one of the tragedies of this that will happen immediately, affecting America's competitiveness and entrepreneur spirit. We know that a lot of people who work for big companies have great ideas, and they want to start out on their own. I have seen that over and over again in the biotech industries of I go down the 270 corridor, the 95 corridor. I see small entrepreneurs who used to work for one of the giant defense contractors, and now they are pulling out and coming up with new ideas, doing things in a great way. That is what makes America a great nation. That is how we create jobs and how we deal with innovation.  Here is the situation. You are a 30-something-year-old, ready to leave that company and go out on your own. Your spouse has cancer. What do you do? You are not going to be able to get coverage. You are locked into that job. That will be a consequence of the repeal of the Affordable Care We are[[Page S79]]dealing with real people and real people's lives. It is irresponsible to repeal the Affordable Care Act and not tell that young entrepreneur what he or she can expect. That is what is at stake.  There is one last point I want to talk about, and that is the Patients' Bill of I helped draft the Patients' Bill of It was not easy to pass the Patients' Bill of We were able to get it in the Affordable Care We were able to get in the right that--you go to an emergency room. Under a prudent layperson standard, you did the right thing. You find out you didn't have that heart attack even though you had chest pains. Then you wake up the next morning and find out your insurance company is not paying the bill because you didn't have that heart attack. We changed that in the Affordable Care  Are we going back, eliminating those protections, the right to appeal decisions or are we going to repeal that part of the Affordable Care Act? Are we going to go back to medical loss ratios, where insurance companies can make obscene profits and not rebate those excess profits to their policyholders when we have millions of people receiving rebates today? All of that is gone with the repeal of the Affordable Care  Mr.President, I could go on and on, but I see my colleague Senator Kaine is here and others who want to speak on this issue.  Let me conclude with this. This is the wrong way to go about this. I heard the leader say that for 6 or 7 years--for 6 or 7 years--Democrats have been trying to work with Republicans to make the law even better.  We have never passed a major law that didn't need to be revisited. We understand that. We have been working to try to improve the law--not repeal it--improve it, build on it, make it better, and we have gotten no help from Republicans, not any help whatsoever.  Republicans have blocked efforts to improve this law. Instead, they are stuck on this repeal without knowing what the replacement is going to be. That is wrong. We should be working together to improve our health care system, but to pass a repeal, to put Americans at risk will lead to uncertainty, which will lead to insurance companies abandoning the market, giving consumers less choice rather than more choice. To hurt millions of Americans is wrong, and I urge my colleagues to reject this approach.  I yield the floor.

1214,topic-id,603,"It is great to see my friend from Kansas on the floor and looking forward to serving the next 6 years.  One of the things I focused on as a member of the Finance Committee on the Affordable Care Act was the idea that we have doctors, hospitals, and nurses who in some cases provide entirely too many tests and procedures and so forth that are needed to treat somebody just in order to cover--as Naval aviation used to say--our 6 o'clock. You didn't want to have somebody come up from behind you to shoot you down. So we talked about covering our 6 o'clock. Doctors, hospitals, and nurses spend a lot of time covering the 6 o'clock, as my friend knows.  I am an Ohio State boy. I am going to say something nice about Michigan, which is really out of character here. In Michigan, the University of Michigan Medical School and hospital came up with a policy called Sorry If a doctor, hospital, or nurse made a mistake that adversely affected a patient, they apologized. The idea was to apologize, make up for it, make them whole, help them get well, cover their financial costs and so forth. It is called Sorry It is a good idea.  I met a guy who is a doctor and a lawyer--a Republican--from Illinois who took the idea of Sorry Works and he put it on steroids and they called it Seven It has been a great example of what actually works to reduce the incidents of medical mistakes in hospitals and nursing homes and also to get better health care outcomes. You reduce medical malpractice costs, and you also get more satisfaction from the patient side.  We have taken that idea in Delaware--Seven Pillars--at Christiana Care, which is the big health care delivery system in our We have taken that and have begun to incorporate it in the way they work. If I am your doctor and you are my patient and I perform a procedure on you, if you are harmed or hurt--not your fault, my fault--the idea is I apologize. I meet with you privately--no lawyers--and apologize for what has happened and try to make you whole. If you lost wages, if you have pain and suffering, they pay your health care costs and make you whole. Don't hide it. Don't put it under the rug but take full acceptance, responsibility. That is one of the approaches being used to try to deal with medical malpractice costs. I think it is a good one. It is not the only good one, but it is one.  I happened to be walking through the Chamber and heard my friend speaking, and I thought I would share that with you, with everyone.  When I was Governor of Delaware, we used to meet with my We would be talking about a particular problem or challenge we faced in I would say to my Cabinet: Some other State or some other Governor has actually addressed this issue. They figured out how to deal with this this. Our challenge is to find out what works and do more of that and to see if it can be transferred to  Sorry Works is a Michigan idea. It morphed into Seven Pillars in Illinois, and now it is being incorporated in my own little State in our big health care delivery system. It is something that works. I am not sorry that it works. I am glad that it works, and I am happy to share it with my friend from Kansas and whoever else might be interested.  I yield.

We are anxious to see how it works over the next couple of years.  Ironically, I was probably the only Democrat--maybe the only member of the Finance Committee--who was trying to get included in the Affordable Care Act provisions dealing with medical malpractice. I had this idea--not to let a thousand flowers bloom or ideas like that--to figure out five or six good ideas and put them on steroids to see if they actually work on a larger scale. I could not get a cosponsor on the other side of the aisle, which blew my mind. It still does. I could never understand that.

1558,topic-id,2650,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to speak about the Republican effort in the Senate, by way of a budget resolution, which includes so-called reconciliation instructions to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in this case, unfortunately, without any replacement for that legislation we passed a number of years ago.  In a word, I think this is a plan for chaos--chaos certainly for insurance markets but more particularly chaos and damage done to middle-class families whose costs will go up. Of course, their coverage will be affected adversely. A repeal act without replacement would raise the price of prescription drugs for older Americans across our country, put insurance companies back in charge of health care, cost our economy millions of jobs, and devastate funding for rural hospitals and rural communities in Pennsylvania and across the country.  I think, on a night like tonight, where we are just beginning a long debate about how to bring affordable care to Americans and how to continue that, we should reflect back on where things were before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Over 50 million Americans were uninsured in 2009--50 million people. People with any sort of medical condition were routinely denied health insurance or were charged exorbitant rates because of their health histories. Women in the United States were routinely charged more than men for their health insurance. This is not an exhaustive list. Finally, individuals who were ill were routinely dropped from their health care coverage because they had reached arbitrary caps on the amount of care an insurer would pay for a given year.  So let us talk about what has happened since then. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, we have come a long way. More than 20 million Americans, including almost 1 million in Pennsylvania, have received health insurance as a result of this one piece of legislation. One hundred five million Americans are protected from discrimination due to preexisting conditions. Those are 105 million Americans with preexisting conditions who are no longer barred from treatment or coverage as they were before. Nine million Americans have received tax credits to help them cover the cost of their insurance. Eleven million seniors have saved over $23 billion from closing the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan's so-called doughnut hole. Doughnut hole is a benign way of saying burn a hole--costs that were burning a hole in the pockets of America's seniors.  Finally, hospitals in States like Pennsylvania are getting a lot of help due to the legislation. In Pennsylvania, our hospitals have saved $680 million due to reductions in uncompensated care. I think, in the end, most of this is about real people and real families and their real lives and, unfortunately, the real consequences that would adversely impact their lives.  Among the 3 million Pennsylvanians with preexisting conditions, there are two remarkable young women whose mother first contacted me in 2009--Stacie Ritter, from Manheim, Stacie is a mother of four children, including twin girls, Hannah and That is a picture of Hannah and Madeline a number of years ago. Hannah and Madeline were diagnosed at the age of 4 with a rare and dangerous type of leukemia, at such a young age.  Stacie and her husband went bankrupt. They literally went bankrupt trying to pay for their daughters' medical bills. She wrote to me at the time, saying that without health care reform ``my girls will be unable to afford care, that is if they are eligible for care that is critically necessary to maintain this chronic condition. Punished and rejected because they had the misfortune of developing cancer as a child.''  So said Stacie Ritter, one mother in one community in Pennsylvania in 2009. She was talking about her daughters being punished and rejected, as if they had any control over the cancer they were diagnosed with. Fortunately, Hannah and Madeline are healthy young women today. Madeline and Hannah are freshmen at Arcadia University and are doing well. The Affordable Care Act protects them by assuring they will have access to affordable coverage, whether on their parents' plan or on a plan in the market. Because of their medical histories, they have ongoing health care needs, and they don't know what they would do without the Affordable Care  Here is a picture of them today, and you can see what a difference health care makes in the life of a child--in this case, the life of two children who are now young women and in college. I don't even want to think about it, but we should think about what would have happened without this legislation. We should not ever put children and their families in that circumstance.  If you are talking about a new plan, you better have a plan that would cover children like Hannah and Madeline, and you better be able to pay for it. You can't just talk about it. You can't just promise it. You have to be able to pay for it, as we did in this legislation.[[Page S166]]  While we are on the question of costs, let's talk about it in human terms--human terms meaning young women like Hannah and We have heard an awful lot from Republican Members of the Senate and Republican Members of the House of They have been promising to come up with a ``better plan'' than the Affordable Care Act since 2010. Since March of 2010, when this passed, you would think that by now they would have a plan--a plan that would replace what they had repealed. That is part one. Part two is a plan that is better, because that is what they promised. They used other words to describe it as well.  Now almost 7 years later--and it will be 7 years in March--where is their plan? I don't think anyone has been able to find their plan. Some Members of the Senate on the Republican side of the aisle have said recently that they have a plan but they haven't released it yet, or they have parts of a plan or different plans but they are putting them together, and we will see them soon. Others don't seem to know whether there is a plan or not. So they promised to replace the Affordable Care Act only after they repealed it and only after millions of Americans would lose their insurance.  Where is the plan after 7 years? You would think, if you were serious about a matter of public policy--something as substantial and as consequential in the lives of families--that after 6-plus, almost 7 years you would have a plan ready to go, and that plan would be comprehensive, and that plan would cover at least 20 million people, maybe more.  That plan would have all the protections that I spoke of earlier. Young women like that, when they were children, would not have their treatment capped. Someone with a preexisting condition would be protected. Women would not be discriminated against. All of those protections, including the coverage, would be part of that plan--you would think.  It seems as if to find the Republican plan here in Washington, you would need to hire a really good private investigator to look in every corner of Maybe it is in some of the desks here. Maybe we just haven't found it yet. So far, there is no plan--no plan. There is a lot of talk and a lot of hot air about repeal but no plan.  What does the Brookings Institution say? They say that the number of uninsured Americans would double if the act is repealed. To be precise, that would leave 29.8 million people without insurance. It would go from 28.9 to 58.7 million people. I started tonight talking about 50 million uninsured in 2009. If you repeal this legislation and you don't replace it with something that is very close to comparable, that means you no longer have 50 million uninsured like we did in 2009, you have 58.7 million--let's round it off to 59 million Americans without insurance--despite all the gains we have made in the last number of years.  What does that mean for Pennsylvania? Since the bill was passed, 956,000 Pennsylvanians stand to lose their coverage because that is how many have gained it. The Congressional Budget Office, which is the Congress's referee or scorecard, estimates that insurance premiums would rise by 20 percent if the act is repealed without a replacement.  The Commonwealth Fund, in a recent report, estimated that repealing the act would cost our economy 2.5 million jobs per year--not over 5 years or 10 years but 2.5 million jobs per year.  Pennsylvania is a State where, despite having huge urban areas in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and a lot of cities in between, we have millions of people literally that live in so-called rural communities, rural counties. By one estimate of our 67 counties, 48 of them could be categorized as rural counties. We have a lot of people who live in, make their living in, and work very hard in rural communities.  One of the headlines that caught my attention last week was from the Fiscal This is from January 5. You can't see it from a distance, but the headline reads: ``Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink.'' It is all focusing on rural hospitals and the cost of repeal.  We know that a couple of years ago there was a report by First Focus that focused specifically on rural children and their health care. Here is what the conclusion of that report was. As of 2012, the year they examined, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program covered 47 percent of rural children, compared with 38 percent of urban children. Almost half of rural children, as of this report, received their health care from Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Both would be adversely impacted by both the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the implementation of the House Republican budget, which I think is the most extreme budget ever proposed in  That is the reality just for rural children and their health care and, also, the predictions about what will happen to rural hospitals. A lot of people employed in Pennsylvania--tens of thousands--are employed in rural hospitals in our  One of the individuals who contacted us to talk about this issue in the context of being in a somewhat rural community but someone who is actually doing farming--and, of course, farming does not occur just in rural areas--is Julia Inslee, from Coatesville, That is in Southeastern Pennsylvania, where we have a lot of farms, as well, just like we do in the middle of the State and in the western, northeastern, and northwestern part of the Julia turned her family's hobby farm into a full-time operation. Here is what she wrote to her office in       I am one of the millions of people who have benefited      greatly from affordable access to health care. I work part      time as a tutor at a community college and nearly full time      as a farmer. Neither one of these jobs provides me with      health care, nor do I make enough to pay several hundred      dollars in premiums per month. The government subsidy is what      makes it possible for me to have healthcare. If Obamacare is      taken away, I will most likely have to give up farming, and      if anything, we need more farmers, not fewer.  That is what she says. ``If Obamacare is taken away, I will most likely have to give up farming.''  Why would we do that? Why would we say that to someone who has achieved success in any profession or any job or any career--but especially something as fundamental to the economy of Pennsylvania? By one estimate, our largest industry is agriculture in Why would we say to that farmer: They have this idea to get rid of legislation in You are just going to have to come up with a new profession. Why would we force people to give up farming in order to meet the demands of some people in Washington?  Julia is facing the likelihood, if the act is repealed, of losing her ability to support herself because her insurance would be too expensive.  I have to ask: Is this a ``better plan''? Is this what Republicans have come up with? We shall see.  Rebecca Seidel is a dairy farmer as well. She is from Douglassville, Rebecca co-owns a herd of dairy cows, and she talked with me just last week about how dangerous farming can be and how scary it is not to have insurance. She says:       As the daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter of      Pennsylvania dairy farmers, I've seen my share of      agricultural catastrophes. Between equipment and large      animals, every day comes with potential hazards. Will I break      a rib getting between two cows who are fighting? Will a blade      come loose from the bedding chopper and hit me? Will my hand      be broken through miscommunication with someone operating the      skidloader? These are realities with which I live every day      and I am able to go about my job bravely because I know none      of these events would financially destroy my family.  She said the Affordable Care Act allowed her to work, and she wrote:       Threats to the ACA are threats to our future, Senator, and      to the future of small businesses, agriculture, and families.  Rebecca and her husband don't know what to expect with repeal of the law. They want to start their own business, allowing their current employer to hire more people, but they don't know what they will be able to afford in such an environment of uncertainty. Rebecca and her husband don't know if they will be able to realize their plans to start a new business. How is this a better result for them, we would have to ask.  Finally, we have a story of a businessman, Anthony Anthony is a small business owner who has been successful with the hard work of one employee who purchases an affordable[[Page S167]]and comprehensive plan through Pennsylvania's health insurance marketplace. This is what Anthony said as a small business person:       It is my opinion that the Affordable Care Act is the best      thing the federal government has ever done for a real small      business like mine. This bill paved the way for entrepreneurs      to strike out on their own, knowing that they have a way to      get health insurance. The bill allowed these entrepreneurs to      attract professional employees who would otherwise have never      left a corporate job to join a small startup.  His business relies on his one employee--in this case, he has one who is central to his business--being able to purchase affordable health insurance, since, with only one employee, he cannot get her on employer-sponsored coverage. He said, ``Looking forward, we plan to do even bigger and better things, but she still needs health insurance to do it, and if we lose the Marketplace, iQ Product Design will likely lose its key employee and will be unable to create the next big market-changing product.''  He is asking: What is going to happen? Is there a replacement plan? What happens to his employee? What happens to his business? We have a long way to go to debate these issues. But I have to ask again, if there is such a better idea here after almost 7 years now, where is this replacement plan? We haven't heard one word about the details of it. Where is it? I think that is what a lot of Americans are asking. We know what Republicans want to do: Repeal the Affordable Care Act or patient protections in the Affordable Care Act for all those people with insurance who had much better protections solely because of this legislation.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS161-3.txt,1828,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,9.0,January
1218,topic-id,1912,"Madam President, I hear my Democratic colleagues praising I had to smile yesterday. I heard a colleague talking about how ObamaCare was addressing high pharmaceutical costs. I had to start laughing--and kind of a bitter laugh. Tell that to a senior who is paying $6,000 for her medicine, which before ObamaCare passed was a fraction of that.  We hear how great it is that ObamaCare has given so many people coverage. Say how great that coverage is to someone who has a $6,000 deductible--a $6,000 deductible--who does not have $400 in her checking account. There is a friend of mine--people don't believe it so I put it on my Facebook page. He got his quote for him and his wife. They are 60 and 61 years of age. Their premium for 1 year was $39,000, each of them with $6,000 deductibles. Again, it is on my Facebook page because otherwise no one would have believed me.  So when people speak about the affordable health care act, I have to laugh. If this is affordable, what would be unaffordable? We can clearly do better than this.  I begin this speech by calling into question my Democratic colleague's defense of ObamaCare, but we can have common ground. I applauded and still applaud the goals of those who support the Affordable Care They wish to have coverage for all. Now, that is important. For over 30 years, I have worked as a physician in a hospital for the uninsured. My medical practice has been geared toward bringing coverage, to bringing care to those who otherwise would not have it.  As I look at this issue, I have to thank them for their motivation but have to recognize that the Affordable Care Act has not achieved that in a way which most Americans find affordable. The other thing about ObamaCare is that it coerces It takes power from patients and States and gives it to Washington, DC, coercing the individual with mandates and penalties, taking away her right to choose. That is not where the American people wish to be.  I would like to believe Republicans and Democrats can find common ground. I have introduced a replacement plan that would give States the power. I am willing to concede, the minority leader believes that ObamaCare is working just fine in his State of New In my plan, we repeal ObamaCare on a Federal level, but if a State like California or New York thinks ObamaCare is working for them, God bless them.  Under my plan, a State legislature would have the right to stay on So here Congress would pass the legislation giving States the choice, and the State would either have the option we advance, which I think is superior--but when Republicans say that you can keep your health insurance if you wish, and we mean it, we mean it. If a State decided they wished to stay on ObamaCare, they could or if a State truly decides they want to have nothing at all to do with any of this, they can totally opt away from the Medicaid expansion, from any help for others in their State to purchase insurance, period.  I think this recognizes that if the minority leader wants to claim it is working in New York, they can keep it, but clearly ObamaCare is not working in some other We can talk about Arizona, where briefly a county did not have a single insurance company providing insurance and where premiums increased by as much as 100 percent. We can look at Louisiana, my State, where that quote I gave earlier--a fellow and his wife, $39,000 for 1 year's premium.  Clearly, ObamaCare markets are failing there. So let's repeal ObamaCare, give the States the power, allowing them to choose the system that will work for them. Now, health care cost is important. Under our bill, we make health care more affordable by giving the patient the choice, the power, if you will, of price transparency. Under ObamaCare, we have seen prices rise out of control. A lack of price transparency keeps providers from having to compete which takes away the consumer's power of choice.  You can see this power of choice price transparency. Fifteen years ago, LASIK surgery cost $1,000 an eye or $875 an eye, with more for astigmatism. Now you can drive down the street and you see a billboard--a billboard--that says: LASIK surgery $275 an eye. So over a period of time, when everything has increased, LASIK surgery has come down--the power of price transparency.  Another example I like to use is of a woman, a physician, went for her mammogram. She wanted to pay cash. They talked her out of it. We don't even know what to charge you.  I won't pay cash.  They billed her insurance company. She later found that if she had paid cash for her mammogram, it would have cost her $90. As it turns out, they billed the insurance company $500. Her deductible was $100. She was actually out $10 because they billed her insurance company. She should have known that price going into it.  One more example. If a doctor orders a CT scan, the cash price, according to an LA Times article a few years ago in the Los Angeles Basin, varied from $250 to $2,500. Unless you are an investigative reporter for the LA Times, able to call up and get that cash price, you otherwise would not know. I guess maybe it sometimes helps to have another example. Would anyone buy a car if they did not know the price of the car beforehand? Yet that is routinely done with health care.  Under the legislation I and Senator Collins have introduced in the Senate, and I and Pete Sessions have introduced in the House of Representatives, people will know what the cash price is. I have found, working in a hospital for the uninsured, that when you the give the patient the information and power they need to know to make the better decisions, you get better outcomes.  By the way, we have been told that Republicans don't have a plan. The plans I am speaking of now are drafted in legislative language--legislative language, again, that would repeal ObamaCare, put in price transparency, and return decisionmaking power to the patient. We should repeal the individual mandate, repeal the employer mandate, prevent the Federal Government, the long arm of the Federal Government from reaching into someone's household, forcing them to do something they don't wish to do.  There should be an alternative. Under both the World's Greatest Health Care Plan--the bill I introduced with Pete Sessions--or the Patient Freedom Act that I have Susan Collins as a cosponsor, we take all of the money a State would receive had they done the Medicaid expansion and those eligible to be signed up for the ObamaCare exchanges, and we give that money to the State to allow them to give tax credits to those who are eligible.  These tax credits could only be used for health insurance. If the patient did nothing, she would have a health savings account, catastrophic policy with a pharmacy benefit. She could use the health savings account as first-dollar coverage.  Now, under ObamaCare, $6,000 deductible. Under our plan, the patient has first-dollar coverage, so if her daughter has an earache and she takes her daughter to the urgent care center, she can cover that visit with a health savings account that would be funded with this credit. They also have catastrophic major medical coverage, so if they get in that car wreck, take them to the emergency room, sky-high pricing, they are protected from medical bankruptcy.  Under our replacement plan, we also give States the option to say that if someone in our State is eligible, they are automatically enrolled. I smile when I say that covers two populations, the person who may live under a park bench and does not have his life together to otherwise do it, and the other population would be my 22-year-old son and those like him, those young folks who never think they are going to get ill so they never sign up for insurance. Without them being in the pool, we end up with a sicker pool. That is what has happened with  By the way, it would be easy to imagine you could end up with 95 percent enrollment of those eligible should the State decide to go this way. The timeframe for our replacement would be simple. In year one, say 2017 Congress[[Page S91]]passes the enabling legislation, which in year 2018 allows the State to choose between these three options; in 2019, the State would implement the option it chooses; and by the end of 2019, we have made the transition from repeal to replace, to implementation.  Folks ask: Would I lose my coverage? I am a physician. I am going to give my perspective: a patient I might see who has breast cancer. She does not like She voted for Donald Trump, but she is on the bubble financially. She is not sure she can afford coverage, but she has breast cancer. As bad as ObamaCare is, at least she is getting some care.  Now she is having to put out all this money first, but still she is getting some care. If we keep her in the prism through which we look at this problem so that in the transition from ObamaCare to better coverage she continues to have her therapy, so at the end of this, not only does she have better coverage, but she has health and recovery from breast cancer, we have done our job. That is our Republican goal, to keep our prism as that woman who is vulnerable from a sickness she has now. In our transition, she does not lose coverage; she merely moves to better coverage.  I introduced the Patient Freedom Act with 12 Senate cosponsors in 2015 and then again teamed up with Representative Pete Sessions in 2016 to introduce the World's Greatest Health Care That is truly its name. Tom Price, our soon-to-be HHS Secretary, first introduced his Empowering Patients First Act to the House of Representatives in 2014. Speaker Paul Ryan, Representative Fred Upton, Senators Richard Burr, and Orrin Hatch have also outlined plans for comprehensive health care reform.  All of these plans create a new system that returns power of choice to patients and to Simple provisions as I have described such as health savings accounts, instituting free market values, if we put them into a replacement plan now, we will quickly have an effect upon millions. Republicans have worked hard to lay the groundwork to repeal and replace  President-elect Trump has said he wants repeal and replace to happen at the same time. He promised both. We should fulfill both promises. Our majority leader has said we can do a better job as Republicans covering more people. We have the principles, the ideas, and the plans ready to go so let's put them to use. We owe it to the American people to carry out that replacement now with a smooth transition so the insured population can grow without anyone losing coverage in the process.  Republicans are committed to creating and passing effective health care legislation to replace ObamaCare and to bring real coverage to all Now is the time to do so.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,1925,OBJECTING TO UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2334,2017.0,5.0,January
1494,topic-id,2656,"Madam President, I rise to address a very important issue in regard to the health care of our poorest Americans and discus my plan, the Medicaid Accountability and Care Act, or the MAC Act, which is also included in my ObamaCare replacement plan which would address the failings of our current Medicaid system. My colleague from Washington just extolled the virtues of As she pointed out, Medicaid clearly is a major part of the ObamaCare kind of response so it is apropos I would follow.  I wish to first tell you my perspective. I am a physician, and I had been working in a hospital for the uninsured for 25 to 30 years, until they blew it up. I saw prisoners, the uninsured, and Medicaid patients. You might say: Wait a second. Medicaid, it is insurance. Why would somebody with Medicaid insurance be seen at a hospital for the uninsured?  It is because in my State, like in most others, Medicaid pays beneath the physician's cost of seeing a patient. To paraphrase Saint Paul, it is the illusion of coverage without the power of access.  I will point out, the week ObamaCare passed, there was an article in the New York Times, written by a very respected journalist, Robert Pear, tracking a Medicaid patient in The physician, the oncologist seeing her, had so many Medicaid patients, the oncologist was going bankrupt because she could not afford to pay her bills so she had to discharge the Medicaid patients from her practice.  I followed up to find out what would happen, and 2 weeks after being discharged from this oncologist's practice, the patient died. This is Medicaid, which is so critical to the purported success of  Is it that we are not spending enough money; that maybe if we just spent a little bit more on Medicaid it would all be better.  A study from MIT found that 60 percent--let me stop. The State of Oregon did an expansion of Medicaid so researchers from MIT and elsewhere went to study it. This study found that 60 percent of the dollars used for the Oregon Medicaid expansion went to institutions, not for patients--as little as, say, 20 percent to 40 percent--but as little as 20 percent of the money that was put toward the Medicaid Program actually was a benefit for the patient. Let me repeat this. As much as 60 percent went to benefit institutions, not patients. They also found that patients on Medicaid did not have improved outcomes. Think about this. We are giving everybody all of this coverage. It is supposedly wonderful. Yet when they went back 1 year later and 2 years and 3 years later and looked at the patients covered on Medicaid--versus those who were not, those who continued to be uninsured--there were no better health outcomes among those who are on  If we can't agree this is a program to reform, it is going to be hard to agree on anything.  For those who are not familiar with Medicaid, let's talk a little bit about the program. Medicaid is a Federal-State program. The Federal Government provides a certain percentage--a different percentage for each State--but the State actually administers the program. In some States, the Federal Government pays 50 percent of the cost. It can go up as much as 75 percent of the cost. In Mississippi, they put up $25, they get $75. In a State such as New York, they would put up $50 and get back $50 so it is a 1-to-1.  This open-ended financing structure is based solely on how much the State spends. I will agree with my colleague from Washington We should not reward States that spend incontinently. We should not reward States that just spend, but under Medicaid, the State is rewarded. The more it[[Page S131]]spends, the more it draws down from the Federal  I always smile when people speak about the economic development of Medicaid expansion. Medicaid expansion is not about economic development. It should be about taking care of patients, but I understand that perspective because they pull down at least $1 for every dollar the State spends, sometimes at the 75-percent ratio. Under the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion, States have been drawing down 100 percent of what they spend. If the State is going to draw down 100 percent of what it spends on the Medicaid expansion population--surprise, surprise--they are actually spending at a higher rate on the expansion population than on those Medicaid patients for whom the State actually has to cover part of the cost.  The Federal Government has very little ability to weed out the corruption of the inefficient programs. Again, this matching incentive disincentivizes States from looking for ways to be more efficient, but, still, States have to balance their budget every year and Medicaid is either the second largest or largest budget item in every Even though the Federal Government is paying 50 percent to 75 percent of the traditional Medicaid population and 100 percent of the expansion population, the State taxpayer is still on the hook for a lot. On average, States spend 17 cents of every State dollar on My State of Louisiana has the highest percentage. Nineteen percent of our budget goes to The percentage is steadily increasing, nearly doubling since 2000. Sooner or later, even though the Federal Government covers the majority of the cost, the budget crunch gets more difficult because the rate of Medicaid spending is climbing faster than the State tax base.  Because of all the Federal requirements on what a State can change in the Medicaid Programs, in order to come up with the State match, States have two options. They can pay providers less or they can cut other programs such as education and move the money to the Medicaid  First, paying physicians less brings us back to the situation Robert Pear described in his New York Times article, where the oncologist was going bankrupt because she could not afford to see more Medicaid patients.  Let's speak a little bit about education. I am just going to use my hands. In 1963, the State government used about that much for education and when Medicaid started in 1964 or 1965, about that much for In 2009, for the first time ever, on average, States spent more on Medicaid than on education. Now the percentage on Medicaid continues to climb, if you will, cannibalizing the State dollars that could be used to support higher education, primary and secondary education.  Let's look at the effect of the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion. Let's look not at my own State but Kentucky, a State which has been at this for a little bit longer. The previous Governor, Governor Beshear, implemented the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion---just kind of traditional Medicaid--and expanded it.  Again, my colleague from Washington State was extolling how much ObamaCare has lowered costs. When Kentucky originally implemented it, they expected the long-term cost of Medicaid expansion to be only a 4-percent increase in their current State spending on After only 1 year of the expansion, updated projections showed the expansion cost the Federal Government more than half a billion dollars more than Governor Beshear had projected for 2014, and this will double in the coming years, meaning that the Medicaid expansion will cost $1 billion more per year than expected. Again, this was the projected cost. This is the actual cost.  If this is saving money--oh, my gosh. What would happen if we actually lost money? By anybody's calculation, this is losing money. This has been the situation across the country. States that have expanded Medicaid have turned out to be far more expensive for the Federal taxpayer than originally anticipated. Again, it just isn't a Federal program. Like many other States across the Nation, Kentucky is facing serious fiscal issues. They do not have $1 billion lying around.  On its current path, Kentucky's own projections suggest the State will start losing $45 million in perpetuity beginning in 2021. This is a 10-percent increase. The Federal Government is putting up most, but Kentucky itself will have to put up an extra $45 million per year.  Also, given that the Federal taxpayer--you and me, us, the people watching on TV and in the Gallery--given that we, the Federal taxpayer, put up 90 percent of Kentucky's costs--well, every State's costs, we just happen to be speaking about Kentucky--but every State's costs are 90 percent of the costs in perpetuity. As this cost grows, taxpayers are on the hook for 90 percent of it. Such a deal.  It doesn't have to be this way. Let me compliment When Vice President-Elect Mike Pence was Governor of Indiana, rather than adopting kind of ObamaCare's let's do the traditional Medicaid and watch the cost explosion--he took an innovative approach and created the Healthy Indiana Plan or HIP as an alternative to simply doling out the dollars. The plan gave each beneficiary a high-deductible plan in combination with a health savings account. It was capitated. Again, my colleague from Washington who just spoke kind of criticized these capitated plans, which means there is a set amount, and the person is, if you will, engaged in managing her dollars.  The State will put up a certain amount on a sliding scale based upon the income of the Hoosier who enrolled. The plan empowered low-income enrollees to become better consumers of health care. Hoosiers who participated--for those not from Indiana, I have learned you don't say Indianans, you say So Hoosiers who participated changed behaviors. They use 40-percent less charity care than traditional Medicaid patients. Seventy percent contributed to their own Once they started contributing, virtually all continued to do so regularly. That is despite 83 percent of those participants in the Healthy Indiana Plan earning less than the Federal poverty level. Those Healthy Indiana Plan patients also saw clear improvements in care over traditional They decreased their emergency room utilization by 40 percent relative to Medicaid's average. Thousands more physicians chose to take Medicaid patients. Remember, at the beginning, I discussed how physicians often can't see Medicaid patients. It pays them below the cost of their seeing patients. In Indiana, thousands more chose to take Medicaid patients, improving access to quality care. Clearly, the Healthy Indiana Plan was able to work for Indiana patients. This is the sort of quality innovation that States can devise if we give them the power.  Now, revising the current funding structure would also encourage States to follow Indiana's example and develop innovative Medicaid programs to increase the efficiency in which the program spends money. Again, that is Federal taxpayer money. That is our money. For those watching right now, it is our money. We want to encourage States to be efficient with how they spend it. There should be greater flexibility to design the Medicaid program to better meet the needs of State residents. States will be given the latitude and the freedom to develop various coverage options and specialized delivery systems for different Medicaid patient populations.  This is why I developed the Medicaid Accountability and Care Act, which we call the MAC It reforms the flawed financing of Medicaid by giving each State a set amount according to how many people each State has enrolled in the different categories that each State's Medicaid program treats. That is a mouthful, but it is basically exactly like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or like any employer who goes to an insurance company and says: I want to give you a set amount of money per employee who enrolls in your plan. For that matter, it is like Medicaid managed care, where the State will go to a managed care company and give the managed care company a set amount per enrollee in that plan.  Now, I hear people say: Oh, my gosh, it is a set amount. That is all we do in health care, except in Medicaid, where we reward inefficient spending. So if it is good enough for the State to do it to the Medicaid managed care program, why isn't it good enough for the Federal taxpayers to do it to the State? I[[Page S132]]am not quite sure I understand the critics of this approach.  But, again, under the Medicaid Accountability and Care Act, or the MAC Act, each State would tell the Federal Government how many beneficiaries it has in different categories of Medicaid and the Federal Government would give each State the amount of money appropriate for that number of enrollees in each category. The advantage of this is it is a set amount. It allows the Federal Government to do that, which it does not do now; and that is, to say to the State government: If you recover fraud, you can keep that money.  Now, let's go back. Under the current situation, the Federal taxpayer pays 50 to 75 percent of the State's Medicaid costs. If there is fraud--and there is lots of fraud in Medicaid--and the State government recovers it, it has to give back to the Federal taxpayers whatever the percent was the Federal Government put up. So if the State goes out and recovers $1 million--spends money on the attorneys, spends money on the investigation, on the court case, and it recovers $1 million--it has to give half a million to $750 million back to the Federal taxpayers. It is responsible for the prosecution, the investigation, but it gives most of the money back to the So the States don't investigate because it is a disincentive to go after fraud.  Under the MAC Act, if the State goes out and gets $1 million worth of fraud, the State keeps the money. That is good for the It encourages the State to root out that fraud and to keep the money and to make sure that fly-by-night scam artists never get to become Medicaid providers in the first place.  The MAC Act's reforms will result in improved health care for Medicaid patients.  I will go back to where I started.  I am a physician who worked in a hospital for the uninsured and Medicaid patients. These are my patients. If this proposal was not about improving patient care, I would not advance it. But recall that Oregon, with their Medicaid program, upon review by MIT, found no improvement in patient outcomes. Then let's go to Indiana, which actually set up health savings accounts and engaged the patient in managing their own health, and there, we do see better outcomes. We should all be about patients having better outcomes.  Along the way, we do other things, such as equalizing the amount of money the Federal Government gives to each State per beneficiary. Again, my colleague from Washington State pointed out that folks in Washington get less money from the Federal Government than do other I would attempt to equalize that with the MAC  So let me finish. The American people have been voting against ObamaCare for the last 8 years. Whatever its proponents may say, the American people have found it wanting. One aspect of it that has been wanting is We have a proposal before us based upon my experience of treating patients in the hospital for the uninsured and Medicaid but also taking States like Indiana and elsewhere in which we attempt to give States the initiative to create specialized programs that focus on patient-centered care. In that way, we will see better outcomes. The current Medicaid funding system under ObamaCare works against States, penalizing them for addressing fraud, abuse, and waste. This must change. We need to change this broken framework with a system that will work with States to get their Medicaid programs back on track, benefiting their patients as much as possible.  With that, I yield the floor.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1661,topic-id,461,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this issue. I rise in strong support of H.79, the bipartisan HALOS  As the chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I have the honor and pleasure of hearing and speaking with many of America's small-business owners and their employees almost every day. I hear case after case of small-business owners working days and nights and weekends. I hear stories of sacrifice. I hear inspiring stories of success.  But all too often, I hear about how the government continues to make it difficult for small businesses to prosper and grow and create more jobs, which is, obviously, very important to our Nation and its economy.  Perhaps one of the most common and most alarming concerns is just how difficult it is for entrepreneurs who are starting out to access the capital they need in order to grow. We must provide entrepreneurs a better way to build their businesses. The HALOS Act does just that.  The Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act expands access to capital by ensuring small businesses are able to continue to connect and interact with angel investors. One popular way in which small businesses connect with angel investors is through demo days. These exciting events are sponsored by universities, nonprofits, local governments, and many other groups that allow entrepreneurs to showcase their products and informally meet investors and customers. However, SEC regulations are threatening to force these events out of business by imposing unwieldy regulations that dictate who is and who is not allowed to simply attend.  These ill-considered regulations would force everybody who merely walks through the door to go through what is essentially a full financial examination--handing over tax documents, bank statements, paycheck information, and on and on. This just doesn't make sense. We should be encouraging participation in demo days, not creating obstacles. We should be allowing the largest group of attendees to gather in the room, not be limiting who can walk through the door. After all, not only are these events places to connect people with our communities' small businesses, but they also provide a great opportunity for our next generation of entrepreneurs to ask questions and learn what it takes for a business to open its doors and be successful.  I thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership as well as Representatives Sinema and Schneider for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner.  An identical bill, as the chairman mentioned, passed this House in the last session of Congress in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion. We must continue to work together to create an environment in which our small businesses--the engines of our economy--grow and flourish. This bill is one more step in that direction.  I urge my colleagues to support H.79.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH259-2.txt,186,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,10.0,January
1723,topic-id,298,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.288, the Small Business Broadband Deployment This commonsense, bipartisan legislation does two important things. First, it extends the temporary exemption granted to small businesses by the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, from the burdensome disclosure requirements for Internet service providers and the FCC's own Open Internet Order by 5 years. Second, it increases the number of small businesses that can utilize the exemption by raising the threshold from 100,000 subscribers to the much more realistic 250,000 subscribers.  Small businesses frequently feel that the Federal Government exercises its most creativity in looking for new ways to get in their way. Oftentimes, small Internet providers are the only ones willing to take the risk and deploy broadband to particularly hard-to-reach areas of rural The last thing they have time for is the FCC imposing a greater regulatory burden on them, diverting precious resources to make Washington bureaucrats busy instead of doing what they do best, providing high quality broadband services to millions of Americans in every corner of our country.

It gives small ISP providers a certain amount of time and it allows the FCC to decide if it is overburdensome or not, to require them to disclose information to their customers. This allows us to give customers the amount of protection that is due them as well.  So it is a good compromise. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.  I thank my colleagues for their hard work.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

It is time to pass this bill. I really do appreciate the good work Mr.Duncan of Tennessee has done and the work of Ranking Member Cummings of  The Presidential LibraryDonation Reform Act of 2017 is the type of good-government, bipartisan legislation that is perfect to be one of the first billsto pass out of the 115th Last Congress, this legislation passed through the committee by regular order and passed theHouse of Representatives without opposition.  President Franklin Roosevelt established the first Presidential library in1939. Since then, every former President since Herbert Hoover has had a library dedicated to his Presidential records. Each ofthe 13 current libraries is managed and operated by the National Archives and Records Administration at an annual cost ofroughly $75 million. While these facilities are operated at taxpayer expense, the construction of these libraries is privatelyfinanced through donations.  As the volume of records for each President has increased over the years, so have constructioncosts. For example, when it opened in 2004, the Clinton Presidential Center, in part, cost approximately $165 million.                              {time}  1300  Nine years later, the George Bush Presidential Center, which openedin 2013, cost about $250 million. The Chicago Tribune has reported that President Obama's library might cost as much as $500million.  Despite these escalating costs, there are no transparency requirements for Presidential library fundraisingorganizations. Here, transparency is important and very much needed.  This bill will require Presidential library fundraisingorganizations to disclose to the National Archives contributions in excess of $200 in any fiscal quarter in a searchable andsortable format. In turn, the National Archives will post this data online.  This disclosure requirement would end oncecontrol of a library facility is transferred to the National This ensures compliance costs of this legislation areminimal for both fundraising organizations and the National  This legislation is bipartisan. It is not intended totarget any one individual. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act has passed the House four times since 2002, withoverwhelming support with both Democratic and Republican majorities in place at the time.

509,topic-id,505,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.Clay) for his goodwork on this. The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2017 was introduced by Representative Clay to help improvethe governance and transparency of the Federal advisory committees. Last Congress, this bill passed through the committee byregular order and passed the  Congress acknowledged the merits of using advisory committees to acquire viewpoints frombusiness, academic, and other interests when it passed the original act back in 1972. While not necessarily well-known, Federaladvisory committees are small bodies of people who provide advice, guidance, and recommendation to Federal policymakers on awide range of topics.  All told, in fiscal year 2015, there were roughly 1,000 Federal advisory committees, and they heldroughly 7,400 meetings at a cost to the American taxpayers of more than $369 million. Now, this strikes me personally as anexceptionally high number. It is a large amount of money. We need to learn more about them, and I personally would help championto reduce the number of overall Federal advisory committees.  We have some 2 million Federal employees, I think, who arehighly capable, motivated, and compensated to provide this work. It is good to get outside perspective; but, at some point, weare going to have to look at the cost, the size, and the scope of this as well. Nevertheless, we have to make sure that we aregetting the most of these taxpayer dollars.  Some agencies believe the FACA requirements are cumbersome and resourceintensive. We could certainly streamline this. This reduces the ability of committees to focus on substantive issues in a timelyfashion.  Both governmental agencies and private groups say the 1972 act does not do enough to require agencies to promoteopenness and transparency with regard to Federal advisory committees. The bill works to address these problems and bringtransparency to the Federal advisory committees and the Federal agency decisionmaking process.  The bill provides neededtransparency for how committee members are selected in several ways. First, the bill requires members to be selected withoutpolitical affiliation. The bill also authorizes agency heads to require members to fully disclose any conflicts of interest. Youwould think that that would be common sense but something that we actually need to put into this bill and make sure that weunderstand that.  In addition, the bill allows these individuals who regularly attend and participate in committee meetingsto be considered as a member, even if they are not allowed to vote.  The bill also improves transparency of committeeactivities. This is done by increasing the independence of these committees and making sure its advice, information, andrecommendations are a judgment of the committee and not the agency.[[Page H70]]  The bill alsoincreases transparency by requiring each agency to make available on their Web site the committee and its activities.  I urgeour Members to support this. It has wide support and has had it in the Oversight and Government Reform I urge itspassage.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.72, the GAO Access and Oversight Actof 2017, and its chief sponsor, Mr.Buddy Carter of  We have a duty to ensure that taxpayer money is spentefficiently and effectively. One of the key ways we carry out this duty is through the key watchdog of the government, theGovernment Accountability The GAO has a proven track record of excellence, and we rely heavily on this group, thousandsof professionals who pour their heart and soul into diving deep into organizations and understanding how they function. But asthis bill states, we need some more openness and transparency.  In the past 6 years alone, it has identified more than 200areas of duplication, overlap, and fragmentation. They have made recommendations on 600 actions to make our government moreeffective and efficient. We need to listen to them and understand them. We also, I would argue, Mr.Speaker, have a duty and anobligation to give them the tools and access that they need in order to do their jobs even better. We must put GAO in the bestposition possible to rout out and deter waste, fraud, and abuse.  Today, we have an opportunity to better arm the GAO byclarifying its right to access data contained in the National Directory of New This gives GAO access to the most up-to-date data to ensure Federal program dollars go to the folks Congress intended to receive them. Doing so, we will help GAO betterinvestigate potential fraud and improper payments, including those overextended disability insurance programs. The GAO'sobjectives are hindered without access to the data, and taxpayer dollars are not as well protected.

529,topic-id,429,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I mayconsume.  First, let me note in the last Congress this legislation passed out of committee by regular order and passed theHouse on January 11, 2016.  The Office of Special Counsel is tasked with protecting Federal employees fromprohibited personnel practices, including reprisals on whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are an indispensable part of helpingCongress identify waste, fraud, and abuse at Federal agencies. Information provided by these brave folks can result ininvestigations and legislation that changes the way we conduct ourselves in government.  As the agency tasked with protectingwhistleblowers, the OSC is vital to make sure these individuals feel comfortable coming forward and that they are offeredprotections. The agency has been busy. From 2013 to 2015, OSC's caseload increased from 4,500 cases open to more than 6,100.That increase coincided with multiple scandals within the Veterans Administration, as Mr.Blum of Iowa has highlighted.  In fiscal year 2016, OSC projected nearly 2,500 cases from just the VA--2,500 cases at just the Veterans Thisreauthorization will ensure the OSC has adequate funding to continue protecting whistleblowers in the VA and other agencies aswell. The majority of the OSC funding goes directly to hiring employees who work to protect whistleblowers.                              {time}  1330  The bill also makes substantive improvements to current law to ensurethe OSC can carry out its mission more effectively. Those reforms cover a few areas, ensuring agencies cooperate with the OSC,clarifying OSC's investigative procedures and making sure Congress receives clear information on whistleblower reprisalthroughout the Federal  With this bill, the OSC has clear authority to access agency records and to conduct itsinvestigations. For its part, the OSC must treat those records in the same manner of confidentiality as the agency would,alleviating concerns about disclosure of sensitive information.  The bill also gives OSC needed flexibility to focus onclaims that deserve our attention. It will allow the agency to terminate duplicative claims already being pursued by the MeritSystems Protection Board and claims that[[Page H74]]exceed statutory timeframes. Agencies will also be required to submit reportsdetailing what actions they take as a result of these OSC investigations--something in Congress that we should be payingattention to. This reporting provision requires agencies to admit any failures in holding people accountable and gives Congressmuch-needed transparency.  Finally, the bill codifies OSC's practice under the current special counsel of disclosing toCongress results and statistics. Codifying this transparency ensures the practice will continue and allow for easier oversightof these activities.  In order to help protect the whistleblowers and reform the Federal agencies, I would urge ourcolleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.69.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1758,topic-id,602,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, H.274, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Congressman Seth Moulton of Mr.Will Hurd of Texas and Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina have all come together on this bill. It is a good bill.  This bill came up in the 114th The same bill passed through the committee by regular order, and then in a close vote--much like the Clemson-Alabama game last night--when we voted on this bill last session was 415-0. I think there was a pretty good sense from the past Congress that is a good bill, and it should pass.  Federal employees' current transportation options on official travel are limited. While some agencies allow employees to be reimbursed for the use of sharing economy services, such as Lyft or Uber, not all of them do. As a result, the whole Federal Government does not benefit from the cost savings that can occur while being associated with these services.  The Modernizing Government Travel Act allows the Federal Government to reap the benefits of the sharing economy. The bill ensures that new transportation services as they emerge, Federal employees can quickly take advantage of the efficiencies of the new technologies that may be offered.  By opening up a new market for transportation services, H.274 will also help spur innovation and competition, creating greater cost savings. We have some 2 million Federal employees. So this is an important part and it shouldn't be glanced over. There could be considerable savings along the way.  We must ensure that there is accountability for travel expenditures. Our committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and other watchdog groups outside of government are looking at these expenses. We have a duty and obligation to ensure that we are dealing with Federal taxpayer dollars responsibly. This bill mandates that agencies report their travel costs for each type of travel service to the General Services Administration, the The GSA must publish that data, helping make the Federal Government more transparent and accountable. The GSA will also report to Congress on agency official travel costs in order to make sure that they inform future transportation policy decisions. I urge passage of the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I was trying to think of a BYU football analogy to go with the Clemson-Alabama analogy, but I haven't been able to come up with one yet. I will work on it.  I rise in support of H.274, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, as amended. I appreciate the good work of Representatives Moulton, Hurd, Meadows, Bustos, and Swalwell on this bipartisan measure.  H.274 would expand the transportation options for Federal employees on official government travel by allowing them to be reimbursed for the use of ridesharing services such as Uber and This bill would also allow for the use of future mobility technologies not yet known or available to be covered as by reimbursable travel expenses. The General Services Administration would be directed to issue implementing regulations. The bill would require Federal agencies to submit to GSA detailed information on their travel costs, including breakdowns of costs by transportation type by November 30 of each year.  GSA would be required to submit annual reports to Congress containing an analysis or survey of agencies' travel costs as well as descriptions of new or revised regulations.[[Page H280]]  H.274 is a commonsense, good government bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

It speaks volumes that the first thing Republicans attempted to do wasweaken ethical standards and that they only changed course once their efforts were exposed to the public.

Like the Obama administration, I am frustrated by the lack of progress in recent years toward achieving a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. However, I do not believe that the resolution passed by the Security Council contributes in any way to positively moving this process along.  Let's not mistake the fact that the Palestinian Government, which currently includes the terrorist faction Hamas, has done little to support peace negotiations. By refusing to publicly recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, condoning terrorist activity and pursuing unilateral actions at international institutions in violation of the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians have continuously placed roadblocks to achieving peace.  Let me be clear, the ongoing settlement activity sanctioned by the Israeli Government is also counterproductive to the peace process. If the Israeli Government wants to remain a beacon of freedom and democracy in the Middle East, they must recommit themselves to achieving a peaceful two-state solution where a Jewish Israel exists peacefully with the Palestinian state.  With the events of recent years, I am extremely fearful that the two-state solution is, if not dead, in critical condition. There are those within both the Israeli and Palestinian Governments who are actively working to ensure its demise. I think, as Members of Congress who strongly support Israel, we should be doing everything we can to convey to both the Israelis and the Palestinians that we will not stand by and watch them torpedo the hope of a peaceful solution to this crisis.

976,topic-id,451,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment to H.26 would exempt rules concerning public health or safety from the burdensome requirements of this legislation.  Simply put, when a rule is necessary to protect the health and safety of the public, it is critical that the rule be put into effect without unnecessary delay.  If this legislation is enacted without this amendment, it will create an untenable regulatory environment that will make it nearly impossible for agencies to safeguard the public welfare.  This legislation could bring to a grinding halt critical rulemaking such as rules relating to the transportation of hazardous materials by the Department of Transportation, clean air regulations by the EPA, and worker-protection standards by  For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration implemented an economically significant rule that, by May 2018, all new vehicles must have rearview cameras. This regulation will help drivers have better visibility behind their car, greatly reducing the likelihood of backover crashes which largely involves small children.  But under the REINS Act, this rule would require a joint congressional resolution with an unrealistic timeline for implementation. For every year this rule would be delayed, the Traffic Safety Administration estimates that there would be, on average, 15,000 injuries and 267 fatalities resulting from backover crashes.  Proponents of this legislation may argue that H.26 contains an emergency exemption which allows a major rule to temporarily take effect following an executive order stating that there is an imminent threat to public health and safety. Even when the threat is not imminent, the danger to the public health and welfare may be great and the fundamental responsibility to protect the public remains.                              {time}  1615  This legislation would substantially hinder the ability of agencies to fulfill this obligation, placing Americans at greater risk for the benefit of powerful corporate interests. In its present form, the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards and the alliance of more than 150 consumer, labor, faith, and other public interest groups predict that, by allowing Congress to even veto uncontroversial rules that protect public health and safety, the REINS Act ``would make the dysfunction and obstructionism that plague our political process even worse.''  In echoing this sentiment, the American Sustainable Business Council, which represents over 200,000 businesses, opposes H.26 because it would recklessly place the burden of proof on the taxpayers in order to protect themselves on environmental, health, and safety issues and would shift responsibility away from powerful corporate interests.

I thank my long-time friend Representative Duncan and Ranking Member Cummings for sponsoring this bill.Representative Duncan first sponsored a bill to improve Presidential libraries 17 years ago. I hope we can now, finally,get this important legislation enacted.  The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act would make the process for buildingPresidential libraries more transparent. Presidential libraries have become increasingly more expensive as they have evolvedinto multipurpose centers. The George Bush Presidential Center cost an estimated $250 million to build, and President Bushraised, approximately, $500 million for the building and an endowment for his library, museum, and institute.  Under currentlaw, there is no requirement to disclose the identities of those who donate to a Presidential library and to a President whilehe is still in office. He is able to raise an unlimited amount of private donations. Requiring the disclosures of donors wouldhelp prevent the trading of political favors in exchange for donations.  This bill would require organizations that raisemoney to build Presidential libraries to disclose the identity of any individual who donates more than $200. The National Archives and Records Administration would then be required to post the donation informationonline. The bill would also create criminal penalties for individuals who report false information on donations and forfundraising organizations that omit donation information.

The FACA was originally enacted in 1972. It is intended to ensure thatcommittees that provide advice to Federal agencies and the President operate with transparency.  Advisory committees providethe government with recommendations on a wide range of issues.

The bill also clarifies that a committee set up by a contractor is subject to FACA if it is formed underdirection of the President or an agency.

1659,topic-id,828,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups This bill, under the guise of helping angel groups attract additional investors for small businesses and startups, would alter the balance between capital formation and investor protection that we sought to achieve in the JOBS  Let me remind my colleagues of what we did in the wake of the financial crisis when bank lending was scarce. Our Nation's startups had trouble getting off the ground and attracting new capital. Previously, they had done so using rule 506, which allows companies to sell private securities to accredited investors who are financially savvy and have the means to bear their heightened risks and lack of SEC oversight. As a condition to using rule 506, however, companies could not solicit purchasers from or advertise to the general public.                              {time}  1415  This condition was viewed as a barrier to capital formation for startups. Therefore, Democrats worked with Republicans to provide companies in the JOBS Act with an alternative so that they could broadly advertise and solicit new investors.  Recognizing the need to balance investor protection with this expansion, Ranking Member Waters offered an amendment requiring companies to take reasonable steps to verify that the ultimate purchaser was an accredited investor. This verification requirement is a necessary investor protection designed to prevent unsophisticated investors from purchasing--either accidentally or by fraudulent means--risky, illiquid, and lightly regulated Rule 506 securities.[[Page H260]]  I would remind my Republican colleagues that this amendment was agreed to unanimously, in part because the amended provision struck the appropriate balance between capital formation and investor protection. Nevertheless, here we are today seeking to alter it in H.79.  This bill would remove the verification requirement and allow companies to broadly solicit and advertise their private stock at any event sponsored by a college, nonprofit, government organization, angel investor group, or other group. That means that America's college students can walk into an event on campus and be talked into buying stock that they don't understand and may not ever be able to sell. Having created this initial relationship, the company can then sell the students stock without ever checking if they are accredited investors.  What is more, the bill would make it much easier for fraudsters to swindle unsophisticated investors by, for example, encouraging the unsophisticated investors to buy stock in a fake or failing company, only to sell off their own stock at artificially inflated prices.  Republicans claim that the bill is merely a clarification; that these demo days are not merely solicitations or advertisements in and of themselves and can be used by companies to generally discuss investment opportunities along with their products and services with the general public. But that is not the case.  Companies can already go to a broadly advertised, widely attended demo day and discuss their businesses and not implicate the securities laws if they don't offer securities for sale or otherwise condition the market for their security, but the bill would allow them to offer securities or condition the market by describing the type and amount of stock they are offering, the intended use of the proceeds, or any of the other information in subsection (a)(4) of the bill.  Therefore, today, a company discussing such information would have two options: one, to ensure that the event is limited to persons with whom they or the event organizer has a preexisting, substantive relationship or have been contacted through an informal personal network; or two, verify at the time of purchase that their investors are accredited by, for example, looking at bank statements, W-2s, or third-party verification letters.  The bill would allow companies to avoid both options and broadly advertise their stock, solicit purchases from the general public, and never check to make sure they are financially sophisticated, accredited investors. The only limitation--that the stock offerings only be at events sponsored by certain groups--does not provide a meaningful investor protection. Phony private universities or nonprofits that may be guilty of fraud themselves can hardly be held accountable for policing it in stock offerings.  So rather than clarify existing law and preserve the compromise we struck in the JOBS Act, H.79 provides a potential loophole that is overbroad and harmful to investors.  Mr.Chairman, I am even more troubled that Republicans have brought this bill and another Financial Services Committee bill to the floor this week without a hearing or a committee markup. In fact, there are 10 new Republican Members and 4 new Democratic Members on our committee that have never even considered this bill.  Collectively, they represent millions of Americans that are being denied the right to better understand this legislation. It is deeply troubling that Republicans have decided to use their newfound power to rush through changes under cover of night without the benefits of an open, public process.  For these reasons, I oppose H.79.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

1684,topic-id,592,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Chairman, both Democrats and Republicans want to help facilitate capital formation, particularly for groups such as angel investors, who have substantial experience in the private securities market, and for small companies like startups who are seeking funding to innovate and grow. But as Members of Congress, we also have the responsibility to protect investors and ensure that the rules of the road are reasonable and appropriate. This is especially important for retail investors, those of us who are looking to save for retirement or to buy a house or to support our children's education.  That is what concerns me about the bill we have before us today. We cannot create loopholes in the securities laws that could have a serious negative impact on Americans' nest eggs, so we must strike the right balance between capital formation in our securities markets and investor protection.  It is with these goals in mind that Democrats supported the current rules in place. Companies can raise money to grow and support their businesses in our securities markets under the purview of the SEC and State regulators. The regulatory framework we have set up allows for different activities and oversight depending on the nature of the security offering.  For example, public offerings provide robust information to investors about the risks and rewards of a particular securities purchase. They require the SEC or State securities regulator to preapprove and review an offering, and they provide legal recourse to investors that may be deceived. This is a strong regulatory framework that ensures our markets are safe and sound. In exchange for complying with these rules, companies can advertise and sell their stock to anyone in the general public.  On the other hand, private offerings do not come with the same regulatory requirements and protections, which can make it easier and less costly for firms to raise money. This means less information for investors, less legal recourse, and little to no scrutiny by regulators. So we put in place procedures to ensure these private offerings, which are inherently riskier, are only sold to accredited investors.  Private offerings now play a significant role in the market. Unregistered securities have surpassed registered securities in terms of capital formation. They have accounted for more than $2 trillion in new capital. Moreover, $71 billion has been raised since 2012 through the general solicitation and advertising exemption that we put in place in the JOBS This is clearly an important and growing segment of our market, and, as such, I believe we need to be even more cautious about who is participating in it.  In fact, the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee said we should do more, not less, to protect investors in the general solicitation and advertising market for private offerings. They think we don't have enough guardrails in place. And yet this bill would do the opposite, by expanding the exemptions on general solicitation without similarly protecting the investor.  The bill also undercuts an important amendment Ranking Member Waters offered to the JOBS Act, which was approved unanimously. It required companies to verify that the purchaser is an accredited investor and is financially sophisticated enough to bear the risks involved in private offerings. By effectively allowing purchasers to ``self-certify'' at or after demo days sponsored by certain groups, the bill could open the door to financial ruin for a retail investor who may not have understood the consequences of his or her investment.

This bill has come up over many years when I served on this subcommittee and was the ranking member and the chairat one time. Mr.Issa suggested it might only be six or seven regulations. If that was the case, they could take themindividually.  There is a process where regulations can be brought before the House, in the Congressional Review Act, andeach one studied individually, and the House could overrule them. I can't fathom that they are bringing this bill for just sixregulations which they could do individually. But even then, that is wrong to put them all together.

934,topic-id,822,"Mr.Chairman, I don't know if I can live up to those words, but I certainly appreciate them.  I was the ranking member on this committee, and I was chair at one point. We have had this bill over the years. It is indeed a monkey wrench or a monkey in the wrench, as John McCain might have said. It will mess up the entire system that we have of Congress passing laws, delegating, giving the executive the ability to enact them in ways that make them functional and appropriate and come up with the details that the Congress does not have enough expertise to do.  The other side refers constantly to people that prepare these rules--which take many, many years and have much, much input--as bureaucrats, as if it is some type of pejorative. Bureaucrats are government employees who have expertise in certain areas and who study an area and become so much more expert than we are on the subject that they can come up with fine-tuned laws that are checked and balanced to make sure that the laws are implemented in the way that Congress intends. If Congress doesn't like it, Congress can pass a bill by both House and Senate to repeal it. We have already got that possibility.  Under this unique approach, either one of the houses of Congress can stop a regulation, a rule from going into effect because both Houses would have to approve a rule and the President would have to sign it before it could go into effect. That gives one House the ability to veto, basically, an executive action.  It is the executive in our system that has the power to veto acts of the legislature and not vice versa. We can pass laws in a bicameral spirit, which is what our Constitution has, when the House and the Senate agree. But neither House, independently, is given any power to veto laws or legislation. This would break that and, I believe, be unconstitutional. That is why I oppose H.26, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017.  Indeed, the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act is most appropriate this year as we start, because in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, we are, indeed, going to have an executive in need of scrutiny. So I thank the Republicans for naming this bill appropriately because we are, indeed, in the times of an Executive in need of scrutiny.  We need scrutiny over income tax returns that have been hidden from the public that might disclose conflicts of interest or loans from characters that might be considered oligarchs and have some type of an influence over our foreign policy and our domestic.  We need an Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act that deals with these conflicts, with income taxes that haven't been released, with businesses in the District where people could go to hotels and curry favor with the  Indeed, we do have an Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, so I appreciate the well-named bill that the Republicans have brought us and the awareness that, through this bill, they have seen that we need some concern about the Executive coming because he certainly needs scrutiny.                              {time}  1500  This bill, though, is the worst of corporate special interest because it will give corporate special interests the opportunity to override rules that take effect unless both Houses pass them. It is difficult enough for this House and the Senate to get legislation passed in the days that we often give to legislation, but to have both Houses have to agree, in which case if you can't, it is, in essence, a pocket veto, and it doesn't even have to be scheduled for a[[Page H127]]vote because the House would have to positively pass and the Senate positively pass. So if the Speaker doesn't want to do it, the Speaker can pocket veto the regulation. It doesn't even have to be scheduled.  This is not draining the swamp. It will heighten the influence of corporate lobbyists in Congress where they can come to the Speaker and ask that agency rules they don't like that might protect the lives of children because they are regulations dealing with toys that seem to possibly be defective, or automobiles where they need safety devices, or other consumer protections that interfere with business interests--business is good and important, but sometimes businesses do things that are injurious to the public.  To give this opportunity to stop rules and regulations from going into effect that protect the public is wrong. It was suggested maybe it will help the economy, but at what cost? What is one life worth--or several lives--if lives are lost because safety regulations are not approved by this House and the Senate, or one or the other, and then don't go into effect?

During his more than 7 years of service, Secretary Mabus has also demonstrated an unwavering commitment to building our naval fleet and supporting America's shipbuilding industrial base. He has put 84 ships under contract across the country, more than the last three Navy secretaries combined, and invested significantly in our aging shipbuilding infrastructure.  Secretary Mabus's focus on increasing shipbuilding has allowed the men and women at Bath Iron Works, BIW, to continue building high-quality destroyers, which are the workhorses of our To allow the Navy to operate these ships to their fullest potential while remaining mindful of the budget constraints faced by our military, Secretary Mabus supported energy initiatives to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. His focus on power-saving technologies, like diesel-electric plants in new ships, has reduced the Navy and Marine Corps' fuel expenses by 30 percent.  In Maine, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, PNSY, has received approximately $100 million in modernization funds since 2009, enabling it to maintain its status as the gold standard for public naval shipyards and further[[Page S110]]hone its efficiency and effectiveness in submarine repair.  While advancing these reforms, Secretary Mabus visited Navy and Marine Corps installations across the globe, traveling over 1.3 million miles to over 150 countries and territories and all 50 When measured in distance, Secretary Mabus has travelled to the moon and back almost three times. In 2009, he and I visited the hard-working men and women at BIW and PNSY together. Since that first visit, Secretary Mabus has worked tirelessly to support our shipbuilding industrial base and ensure our Navy and Marine Corps have the tools they need to succeed.  In addition, Secretary Mabus's leadership in 2010 on the Gulf Coast's long-term recovery plan following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was exemplary. His work securing the future of the Gulf Coast made Americans and certainly his home State of Mississippi proud.  Finally, his emphasis on platforms, power, and partnerships allowed our Navy to grow in strength, but Secretary Mabus never forgot those who make the system work: the people.  Secretary Mabus was instrumental in advancing the repeal of don't ask, don't tell in 2011, a harmful policy that barred Americans from serving their country simply because of their sexual orientation. His efforts helped to ensure that all patriots who willingly answer the call to arms may proudly serve their  Similarly, as discussions on military integration have evolved with a new focus on women in combat, Secretary Mabus again stepped up to become a leader on gender equality in the military. His support for integration of women into the Navy and Marine Corps, in all occupations and specialties, and his expansion of maternity leave have ensured that women can serve in the military jobs they love.  Secretary Mabus has also taken steps to support career flexibility, continuing education, and family well-being for all members of the Navy and Marine He worked to ensure that all those who serve in uniform are provided the mental health care they need and deserve. By supporting and empowering a dedicated, intelligent, and committed personnel base, Secretary Mabus has enabled our Navy to remain the powerful fighting force that it is today.  With his retirement, we lose a true patriot who served his country as a civilian, as well as in uniform, and we lose a visionary leader who saw how our Armed Forces could be better--and did everything in his power to make it happen. It has been a personal and professional pleasure to work with Secretary Mabus, and I wish him fair winds and following seas.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS109-2.txt,2121,REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,5.0,January

The Federal Advisory Committee Act, FACA, enacted on October 6, 1972, formalized theprocess for establishing, operating, overseeing, and terminating Federal advisory committees. Federal advisory committeesprovide a mechanism for government officials to gain knowledge from Federal and non-Federal experts on key policy matters. FACAensures Federal advisory committees, however, are both transparent and accessible.  FACA was enacted in response to concernsthat Federal advisory committees were becoming increasingly common but had little oversight or accountability. The then-HouseCommittee on Government Operations listened to concerns over the lack of transparency and formalized a governance process forthese advisory bodies by establishing the Committee Management Secretariat within the General Services Administration to monitorcompliance with the new law. The intent of that law was to make Federal advisory committees more accountable, more transparent,balanced, and independent from the influence of special interests.  This bill before us today, inspired by Mr.Lacy'sleadership, will help strengthen the independence of those advisory committees by requiring members to be selected withoutregard to partisan affiliation. It is imperative that the recommendations and guidance of the committees be provided free ofpolitical influence, pressure, and intervention.  The bill closes the loophole that allows subcommittees to operate outsideof the regulations of It also improves the transparency of advisory committees by requiring agency heads to obtainconflict of interest disclosures from all committee members serving as individual experts.  H.2347 builds upon theaccountability of the advisory committees by explicitly stating that committees established by contractors must comply with thelaw and that individuals who regularly attend and participate as if they are members are considered members regardless of theirability to vote.  This bill also calls on the Government Accountability Office to review and report regularly on agencycompliance.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Byrne). The time of the gentleman has expired.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Thoroughly Investigating RetaliationAgainst Whistleblowers Act--a mouthful, but it captures what we are trying to do.  I certainly appreciate Mr.Blum'sefforts to advance legislation that authorizes the Office of Special Counsel and protects whistleblowers in the FederalGovernment, an effort the Oversight and Government Reform Committee strives to promote when we are at our best on a bipartisanbasis, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill.

With the enactment of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, OSC became anindependent agency within the executive branch. Its mission is to safeguard the merit system of protecting Federal employeesfrom prohibitive personnel practices, especially reprisal from whistleblowing. OSC provides employees a mechanism for disclosingwrongdoing in government agencies and provides advice on the Hatch Act, which restricts political activity by governmentemployees generally.  OSC enforces employment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of1994 for Federal employees who serve or have served in the uniformed services. Congress last reauthorized OSC for the period2003 to 2007. Due in part to Congress' emphasis on transparency in government, OSC has experienced significant growth in itscaseload since its last reauthorization. In the past 5 years, that caseload has increased, Mr.Speaker, by 58 percent.  Thisbill reauthorizes the agency from 2016 through 2020 and makes several important changes to assist OSC in carrying out its vitalmission. The bill codifies OSC's current practice of providing important performance metrics in its annual reports to theCongress and requires additional metrics to support congressional oversight of its effectiveness.

Ranking Member Engel, Mr.Price, and I have submitted an amendment to 11 when it came before the Rules Our amendment offered a balanced approach and strongly reaffirmed longstanding, bipartisan principles that undergird U.policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We introduced that amendment as a reasonable alternative that would allow all of us to convene the broadest possible bipartisan coalition here in the  Personally, I believe the U.should have vetoed the U.Security Council resolution, and, notably, our resolution supported the U.veto of any one-sided or anti-Israel U.Security Council resolution or any resolution that seeks to impose a resolution to the conflict.  Our resolution also condemned boycott and divestment campaigns and sanctions that target Israel, and it reiterated support for a negotiated settlement leading to a sustainable two-state solution that reaffirms Israel's right to exist as a democratic, Jewish state. We all agree that there can be no substitute for direct bilateral negotiations between Israel and the As we transition into a new administration and begin this new Congress, we should resist temptations to rewrite U.policy on the peace process in a misguided attempt to further drive a wedge where none should exist.  The point of 11 seems to be to bash Obama on the way out, and the fact that there are distortions on history and fact seem not to bother us. On this point, I would note that 11 mentions settlements but makes no attempt to reaffirm longstanding U.opposition to those very settlements. It is more important now than ever that Congress maintain its consistent, bipartisan policy toward the conflict. We believe the carefully constructed language in our resolution did just that, but we were not allowed the opportunity by the Rules Committee to bring it before the floor for a vote.  So I urge my colleagues, especially my Democratic colleagues, to vote ``no'' on 11 and the rule and to support and cosponsor 23, a much more bipartisan and balanced approach.

537,topic-id,941,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this is anunusual measure that is being brought forward under unusual circumstances. To begin with, this measure would, believe it or not,empower our Federal legislature to undo virtually every regulation submitted to the Congress since mid-June of last year throughthe end of 2016 last year. The bill accomplishes this--every regulation--by authorizing Congress to disapprove these rules througha single joint resolution, thereby depriving Members to consider the merits of each individual regulation. This presents anumber of problems.                              {time}  1345  As the administration has stated, witha threat of veto of an identical bill that was considered last November, the legislation ``would create tremendous regulatoryuncertainty, potentially impose additional costs on businesses, and represent a step backwards for applying sound regulatoryprinciples to protect public health, safety, the environment, and other critical aspects of society.''  This, in my view, isa cynical way of trying to legislate. For those concerned about the continued improvement of clean air and clean water, if wecare about the safety of the toys we give our children, if we care about the environment, then we must oppose this bill.  Iurge my colleagues to join me. There hasn't been any deliberative process on the bill recently. It is amazing to me that we havesuch opposition to the bill. It would be overwhelming to put in the over 150 labor organizations, consumer organizations,environmental organizations, and others who have openly asked us to oppose this bill.  If that isn't enough, we have thebusiness community itself in opposition. The American Sustainable Business Council, which represents over 200,000 businesses--andI have a partial list of them--also opposes this measure. It is one of the rare instances in which I have brought to the floorlegislation that is opposed by both labor and by business as well.  It is a little bit of an insult that this bill is beingconsidered, on top of that, under a closed rule. There can be no amendments to this measure.  I am in a state of surprisethat on the second day of a new Congress we would come forward with a measure that could potentially jeopardize public healthand safety in so many different ways.  I think that the opposition to this measure is so overwhelming that I am surprisedthat without hearings, without an opportunity for amendment, we are now considering a measure that has this much opposition.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Consumer Reports dated January 3, 2017.                                             Consumer Reports,                                  Washington, DC, January 3, 2017.     U.House of Representatives,     Washington,      Dear Representative: Consumer Reports and its policy and      mobilization arm, Consumers Union,strongly urge you to vote      no on H.21, the so-called ``Midnight Rules Relief Act.''      This bill would severely undermineaccountability to the      public regarding important protections and safeguards.       Although the rules targeted by this legislationwere      finalized relatively recently, many have been under      development for several years. Consumers Union has provided      publiccomment on several of these regulations that were      designed to protect consumers against unsafe products,      dishonest businessdealings, and other hazards in the      marketplace that place their health, safety, or well-being at      risk. Agency experts carefullyexamined these hazards and      considered various alternative approaches to address them.      They sought input and guidance frombusinesses, consumer      organizations, outside scientific and legal experts, and the      public at[[Page H76]]     large, and ultimately developedfinal rules, explaining      publicly the basis and rationale for the adopted approach.       The federal law known as the CongressionalReview Act (CRA)      already permits a regulation carefully developed over many      years to be erased by Congress, in a rushed processthat does      not reflect the same level of expertise or careful      consideration. Congress could even rescind a rule for reasons      thatmight be based not on any broader interests of the      public, but on the narrower, private special interests of      those seeking toavoid having appropriate obligations imposed      on their profit-making activities.       The potential for the CRA to be employed inthe service of      special interests is at least somewhat held in check by the      fact that the law currently requires separatecongressional      action for erasing each regulation. A regulation considered      for erasure under the CRA must be brought to the Houseand      Senate in its own separate resolution, given its own debate      and vote, and sent to the President for its own signature      orveto. All officials involved in considering whether to      erase the regulation and its protections are thus put on      record, and canbe held accountable for their positions and      the consequences. Perhaps for this reason, there has only      been one regulationrescinded under the CRA in its 20-year      history.       This important accountability check would be removed under      the ``MidnightRules Relief Act.'' By allowing erasure of      multiple regulations en bloc, this bill would enable Members      of Congress and thePresident to evade public accountability      for what Gould be ill-considered, politically motivated      decisions that result indevastating consequences. Under the      bill, no Member would ever have to be on record regarding any      specific regulation beingerased. In fact, any Member who      actually wants to cast a more selective vote, to erase      certain regulations but not others, wouldbe unable to do so.       We are somewhat encouraged that the House Majority, after      initially acting behind closed doors to weakenthe Office of      Congressional Ethics, has reversed course in light of major      concerns raised about the impact on      congressionalaccountability. We urge all Members to also      recognize the damaging effects that this bill would have on      accountability and onthe ability of the American public to      trust their elected representatives.

I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from California for pointingout how innocent this measure is, and I am astounded by his feeling that regulations shouldn't be examined one by one. Underthis measure, 61 regulations could be considered en bloc. To me, just trying to put together two regulations to revoke themwould be very, very hard to handle.  What we are talking about here is a bill that would provide special interests with yetanother opportunity to block critical lifesaving regulations, and I want to say I have never had so much opposition to a billbrought to my attention before. 150 environmental organizations, consumer organizations, and labor organizations have urged theMembers of this body to oppose H.21. It is incredible. And then not only are workers and consumers against this measure aswell as environmentalists, businesspeople are against it as well.  I feel like there is some missing part to this thing. TheAmerican Sustainable Business Council has over 200,000 businesses. So here is labor and commerce combined, urging Congress notto do this on the second day of a new Congress with all the challenges that are before us, and he says it wouldn't create anyproblems. It would be okay to put in 1 or 2 or 3 or 5 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60. This is incredible.

I mean, it is unthinkable. It is not very practical at all.  When we talk about meatlabeling regulations and then in another paragraph or another section there would be standards for school lunch nutrition, theywould be combined. My friend from California would say, well, that is no problem. We will take them separately, but they willall come in the same package.  So if you wanted to examine all of these things individually, we could have an instance wherethe whole Congress could be consumed for weeks or for months trying to figure out why they should block all of these importantand sensible safeguards.  Business and labor are joined with us, and, to me, it is beyond comprehension for us to beconcerned about not taking them up one at a time.

The gentleman from California has 13\1/2\ minutes remaining.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My colleague from Tennessee has been a good friend on manyissues. I know he is passionate about regulations and laws that he would like to have passed, and so am  All of us inCongress have seen that it is extremely easy--the longer you are here, the more you will see it--it is extremely easy to stopsomething here. The same is true about those 61 or so regulations. Any combining of regulations, unless they are overwhelminglydisapproved, actually makes them harder to pass. We are not going to put 61 pieces of legislation, each of which has at leastone or two or three or a dozen Republicans who vehemently oppose that regulation being rescinded. The fact is it is only theworst of the worst that are going to be stayed through this process and then reevaluated by the new administration.  I willmention, though, for my colleagues on the other side of this debate today, that we do appropriations every year. The Americanpeople, and for the freshmen who haven't voted on appropriations yet, think of appropriations as somehow different than the law.It really isn't. Appropriation is simply a law that provides funding.  Every appropriation bill during the entire nearly 8 years of President Obama has been some form of a continuing resolution or an omnibus. But as my colleaguefrom Tennessee knows, every one of those has had dozens to hundreds of laws attached to them. We call them riders. We have termsfor them. The fact is that a single appropriations bill, often done just before the end of funding of the government,always--always--has dozens, if not hundreds, of laws attached to it.  So the idea that we don't group together things which arerelatively noncontroversial, that will cause someone to still vote for the bill in spite of it being in there, would be to bedishonest to the freshmen who need to know that we do for efficiency bring together things that we can pass en bloc, and we doit all the time--and even major legislation. I dare say, the Affordable Care Act and others are, in fact, multiple pieces oflegislation put together in one package.  So lest our freshmen who are about to take their first vote on a piece oflegislation--or one that could have a major impact--misunderstand, bringing together multiple pieces into one bill is common, butit is always done in order to gain votes or to maintain votes. In fact, you do it at your folly if you lose votes.  I wouldsay to my friend and colleague from Michigan that there is no likelihood that 61 pieces of regulation will be put togetherbecause there is no chance that there would be 61 pieces that even all Republicans would agree should be revoked. I wouldimagine the number would be less. I suspect that if my bill said 2 or 5 or 10, it would still be opposed for the same reason,which is that it creates inefficiency if there are multiple generally agreed bad pieces of legislation that need to beconsidered.  Lastly, and I am not closing, but I think this may be one of my closing remarks, for freshmen to understand,this isn't even about the We have the procedures in the House where we could put these together. This is about the Senatethat can take 60 hours, 60 legislative hours or more, to do one piece of legislation.

Background on theCongressional Review Act       The CRA is a tool that Congress may use to overturn a rule      issued by a federalagency, including, in some cases, rules      issued in a previous session of Congress and by a previous      The CRA requiresagencies to report on their      rulemaking activities to Congress and provides Congress with      a special set of procedures under whichto consider      legislation to overturn those rules. The CRA, which was      enacted in 1996, was largely intended to assert control      overagency rulemaking by establishing a special set of      expedited or ``fast track'' legislative procedures for this      purpose,primarily in the       Of the approximately 73,000 final rules that have been      submitted to Congress since the legislationwas enacted in      1996, the CRA has been used to disapprove one rule: the      Occupational Safety and Health Administration's November2000      final rule on ergonomics, which was overturned using the CRA      in March 2001. The primary reason the CRA has overturned      onerule in the 20 years since its enactment is that under      most circumstances, it is likely that a President would veto      such aresolution in order to protect rules developed under      his own administration, and it may also be difficult for      Congress to musterthe two-thirds vote in both houses needed      to overturn the veto. However, under a specific set of      circumstances--a turnover inparty control of the White House,      particularly a turnover in which the incoming President      shares a party affiliation with amajority in both houses of      Congress--the CRA is more likely to be used successfully. The      March 2001 rejection of the ergonomicsrule was the result of      that set of circumstances. Similar circumstances will take      place in 2017 after the start of the 115thCongress and after      President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office.                         CRA ``Reset''Mechanism       Section 801(d) of the CRA provides that, if Congress      adjourns its annual session sine die lessthan 60 legislative      days in the House of Representatives or 60 session days in      the Senate after a rule is submitted to it, thenthe periods      to submit and act on a disapproval resolution ``reset'' in      their entirety in the next session of Congress'' Thepurpose      of this provision is to ensure that both houses of Congress      have sufficient time to consider disapproving rulessubmitted      during this end-of-session ``carryover period.'' This      provision applies in every session of Congress, but it is      ofparticular relevance in sessions of Congress that coincide      with presidential transitions. This provision allows, for a      limitedtime period, a new Congress to consider a joint      resolution disapproving a rule issued late in the previous      administration. Ifintroduced and considered at the proper      time, such a joint resolution cannot be filibustered in the            The projectedsecond-session meeting schedules of the House      and Senate issued by each chamber's majority leader may be      used to estimate thedate in 2016 after which final rules      submitted to Congress will be subject to the renewed review      periods in 2017 describedabove. The estimated start of the      reset period for all rules was determined by counting back      from the projected sine dieadjournment in the respective      chambers--60 days of session in the Senate and 60 legislative      days in the House--then taking theearlier of the two dates.       Under this calculation, CRS estimates that agency final      rules submitted to Congress on or afterJune 13, 2016, will be      subject to renewed review periods in 2017 by a new President      and a new CRS day count estimatesare unofficial and      non-binding; the House and Senate Parliamentarians are the      sole definitive arbiters of the operation of theCRA mechanism      and should be consulted if a formal opinion is desired.     ``Major'' ObamaAdministration Rules Potentially Eligible for                   Consideration under the CRA in 2017       Using this estimatedreset date of June 13, 2016, CRS      compiled a list of major rules that would fall under this      reset period--i.e., rules that couldbe overturned in the      115th Congress using the       Table 1 lists the major rules CRS has identified as of      January 3, 2017,that could be eligible for the reset      mechanism. To identify these rules, CRS used a two-step      process. First, CRS consulted theGovernment Accountability      Office's (GAO's) federal rules database to identify major      rules that were issued during calendar year2016 and posted on      GAO's website as of January 3, 2017.

955,topic-id,4620,"Mr.Chair, H.26, the ``Regulations from the Executive in Need of[[Page H132]]Scrutiny Act of 2017,'' otherwise known as the REINS Act, would amend the Congressional Review Act to require that both Houses of Congress pass and the President sign a joint resolution of approval within 70 legislative days before any major rule issued by an agency can take effect.  Simply put, H.26 would impose unworkable deadlines for the enactment of a major rule under procedures that could charitably be referred to as convoluted.  Under this bill, the House may only consider a resolution for a major rule on the second and fourth Thursday of each month. Keep in mind that typically 80 major rules are promulgated annually. Yet, there may be as little as just 15 days available to consider such measures based on the majority's legislative calendar for the current year.  Furthermore, Congress may only consider such resolutions within 70 legislative days of receiving a major rule. This process would constructively end rulemaking as we know it.  Now, Mr.Chair, the reason why my friends on the other side of the aisle say we need this kind of gumming-the-works legislation--is because they claim regulations stifle economic growth.  For example, they point to the outgoing administration and say that regulations promulgated during its tenure have hurt our Nation's economy.  What they fail to tell the American people is that it was the Republican George Bush's administration's economic policies that caused the Great  Without question, it was the lack of regulatory controls that facilitated rampant predatory lending, which nearly destroyed our Nation's economy.  It led to millions of home foreclosures and devastated neighborhoods across In fact, it nearly caused a global economic meltdown.  Nevertheless, as a consequence of strong regulatory policies implemented by President Obama through such measures as the Dodd-Frank Act, our Nation has recovered to a point where the unemployment has been cut nearly in half to less than 5 percent.  Yet, the REINS Act would reverse these gains by empowering Congress to control and override the rulemaking process, even in the absence of any substantive expertise.  More than 80 of the Nation's leading professors on environmental and administrative law have warned in connection with substantively identical legislation considered in the last Congress, that without this expertise, any congressional disapproval is more likely to reflect the political power of special interests.  Lastly, by upending the process for agency rulemaking so that Congress can simply void major rules through inaction, the REINS Act likely violates the presentment and bicameralism requirements of Article I of the  As a leading expert on administrative law states: ``The reality is that the act is intended to enable a single House of Congress to control the implementation of the laws through the rulemaking process. Such a scheme transgresses the very idea of separation of powers, under which the Constitution entrusts the writing of the laws to the legislative branch and the implementation of the laws to the executive branch.''  The REINS Act will further encourage corporate giants to hold our country hostage through a deregulatory, profits-first agenda and facilitate a political influence process rivaling the destructive industrial monopolies from the past century.  In sum, H.26, like the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act'' we considered yesterday on the House floor, is yet another blatant gift to big business to weaken the critical regulatory protections that ensure the safety of the air we breathe, the cars we drive, the toys we give our children, and the food we eat.  Accordingly, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this ill-conceived bill.  The All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.  The text of the bill is as follows:                                H.26       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the      Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017''.     2.       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for      and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1      of article I of the United States Constitution grants all      legislative powers to Over time, Congress has      excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing      to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability      for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in      Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted      and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and      a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the      American people for the laws imposed upon them.     3.

983,topic-id,354,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.26, the REINS Act, rules issued to reduce the amount of lead in public drinking water.  The ingestion of lead, of course, causes serious harmful effects on human health, even at low exposure levels. That is why the Environmental Protection Agency has set the maximum contaminant level for this toxic metal in drinking water at zero.  According to the EPA, young children, infants, and fetuses are particularly vulnerable to lead because the physical and behavioral effects of lead occur at lower exposure levels in children than in adults. The Agency reports that, in children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and the impaired formation and function of blood cells.  Take, for example, the Flint water crisis, which I have a little experience with, which was a preventable public health disaster. While much blame for the Flint water crisis lies with unelected officials who prioritize saving money over saving lives, the presence of lead in drinking water is, unfortunately, not unique to In fact, the drinking water of, potentially, millions of Americans may be contaminated by lead.  My amendment highlights one of the most problematic aspects of H.26: that it could slow down or completely block urgent rulemakings that protect health and safety. This is because Members simply lack the requisite scientific or technical knowledge to independently assess the bona fides of most regulations, which are often the product of extensive research and analysis by agencies as well as input from effective entities and the public.  As a result, Members would have to make their own determinations based on their own--usually inexpert--views and limited information. Worse yet, some may be persuaded to disapprove of a rule in response to a wide-ranging influence exerted by outside special interests that favor profits over safety.  My amendment simply preserves current law with respect to regulations that are designed to prevent the contamination of drinking water by lead. Accordingly, I sincerely urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

1563,topic-id,2339,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleagues in raising the alarm about the possible impact for all of us in America and, in particular, for my constituents in my home State of Delaware should we indeed as a body proceed with barreling forward and repealing the Affordable Care Act without a plan to replace it, as seems to be the intention of the majority.  When I was first elected to the Senate back in 2010, the Affordable Care Act wasn't even a year old. Yet Republicans were already trying to repeal it, without offering any comprehensive plan with which to replace it. Now, more than 6 years and 60 repeal attempts later, it is truly disheartening to see that when it comes to plans for the American health care system, seemingly nothing has changed. Instead of working across the aisle to find constructive fixes to this Affordable Care Act that could win bipartisan support, instead of finding new ways to invest in infrastructure or strengthen American manufacturing or coming together to respond to the Russian attack on American democracy or even waiting a week to take this upcoming vote so we Senators can give our full focus to vetting the President-elect's Cabinet nominees, instead of pursuing any of these priorities, it seems we are once again spending--even wasting--the American people's time to fulfill a misguided and, in my view, mean-spirited promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act at all costs, without a clear plan to replace it. Sadly, in that sense, nothing has changed since I first came here in 2010, not so for the American people, as plenty has changed for them and for my home State of  More than 20 million Americans now have gained access to high-quality health insurance across our whole country, including 38,000 more Now, 38,000 is not a big number of people, but in my little State of 900,000, 38,000 more people who couldn't get access to health insurance before and can now is a big deal. Across the whole country, the rate of uninsured Americans is at a record low of just 11 percent, and in Delaware fewer than 8 percent, and this is well down below pre-ACA levels.  Let me focus on what I think is the biggest, broadest, and most important benefit of the Affordable Care Act, not just those tens of thousands in my State who have gotten coverage on the exchanges, but in my little State of 900,000, 560,000 Delawareans get their health insurance through their employer, as the vast majority of Americans do. For those half a million or more Delawareans, they have gained lifetime improvements to the quality of the health insurance they have through the ACA: no discrimination against preexisting conditions, young people can stay on their parents' health insurance until they turn 26, free preventive care, no lifetime limits on coverage and recovery, and a requirement that insurance companies spend 80 cents of every dollar on health care versus overhead. These five key consumer protections have been the center of the best of what the Affordable Care Act has delivered to Delawareans and Americans no longer have to make the phone calls they used to make to their Senators, their Congressmen, their local representatives, pleading that they could somehow find access to quality and affordable coverage. These reforms have made a real and tangible impact on Americans across the country.  I have also come to this floor, on a number of occasions over many years, and recognized the challenges of the Affordable Care Act, the ways in my home State that it has fallen short of our hopes and goals when it was initially passed, and I have offered, with an open hand, to work across the aisle[[Page S173]]to find vehicles to repair and improve elements of it that haven't worked as had been hoped.  Before I turn to that, though, let us focus for a few minutes on hearing the stories of Delawareans who have reached out to me because at the end of the day, my passionate defense of the Affordable Care Act is rooted in individuals I have met and heard from, people whose lives have been changed by access to quality, affordable, accessible health care.  As Republicans move us forward to a repeal vote, it is my hope that they will listen to these and other stories and think about what possible alternative pathway there might be that would save the opportunity for them to have access to decent, quality health care.  I grew up in this tiny town of about 1,500 called Hockessin, DE, and Nicole is also from She reached out to me to tell me her 2-year-old daughter has cystic fibrosis. She spends at least an hour every day administering her daughter's breathing treatments and at least $5,000 a month. Her medications aren't cheap. Nicole is confident that without the Affordable Care Act, she would have exceeded her annual cap on medical expenses well before the end of each year.  Nicole makes it pretty clear to me that without the consumer protections put in place by so-called ObamaCare--the ACA--she would have one of three choices, choices tragically faced by many Delawareans and Americans before the Affordable Care One, hope she somehow qualifies for Medicaid, which she probably doesn't because she is hard-working enough and successful enough that her income makes her ineligible for Option 2, go into deep debt to pay for her daughter's needed and lifesaving treatment. Option 3, stop giving her daughter some of the medication she depends on and just hope and pray that she will not suffer needlessly. That is all assuming that her daughter's cystic fibrosis was not a preexisting condition, preventing her from getting any insurance at all.  Let me review that because Nicole's story starkly outlines the reality that millions of Americans could face if we continue barreling down this misguided path of repealing the Affordable Care Act wholesale without coming together around a plan for replacement. That reality for so many sick Americans or Americans with sick children is this: First, hope you don't get sick. If that fails and you don't qualify for some other form of government assistance, either go into debt or try to get by without health care. That is it. That is what it was before the Affordable Care Act, and following its repeal, that may sadly be what it is again.  Over the last few weeks, I have heard many other stories, and I will cover a few quickly, if I may. Kim, from Wilmington, DE, is a thyroid cancer survivor who was able to get insurance because her cancer is no longer considered a preexisting condition. Will her ability to access affordable, quality health care be repealed?  There is Sue from Frankford, DE, whose husband got sick a decade ago--desperately sick--and hasn't been able to work since. They are retired but not quite eligible for Yet, despite his illness, they have been able to find coverage now on the individual market. Will repeal of the Affordable Care Act deny Sue and her husband access to quality health insurance?  There is Carla from Odessa, DE, whose son was able to stay on her health insurance when his employer didn't cover it. Not only that, but Carla's sister--a self-employed gardener with a 40-year history of insulin-dependent diabetes, also known as a preexisting condition, was able to get health insurance when she tragically divorced at age 63 and lost coverage through her husband's employer.  There is Matthew from Wilmington, whose son was diagnosed with brain cancer. The year before his son's diagnosis, Matthew and his family were on a non-ACA-compliant health insurance plan. As Matthew wrote me, ``Our family was all young and healthy, and we thought this plan was right for us. Then, my 11-year-old got sick right out of the blue. It can happen to anyone at any time.''  Matthew is right. Illness can strike any one of us at any time--and not just the flu, not just a cold, but tragic, expensive, terminal illnesses can strike any family in America at any time.  Just listen to the story of Kerry from Wilmington, DE, a massage therapist who considers the Affordable Care Act, as she puts it, ``nothing short of miraculous.'' Here is why. Kerry signed up for health insurance in 2014 thanks to the subsidies, the tax credits provided through the Affordable Care She had long had nagging abdominal and lower back pain. She didn't think much of it considering she had no family history of terrible diseases and had never even had a stitch before. Fast forward to January of 2015, when a routine diagnostic procedure covered by her new health insurance revealed that Kerry had stage III colon cancer. She had surgery a week later, followed by 6 months of chemotherapy, and ended up facing no out-of-pocket expenses besides her annual deductible. Kerry's cancer has now been in remission since September of 2015, and as she writes, ``The ACA came along at the last possible moment to save my life. I am certain that without it, I would have just continued to live and work with the discomfort and try to self-treat until the cancer was so advanced it could not have been successfully treated.''  I have many more, but stories like Kerry's and Matthew's and Carla's and Sue's and Kim's have been pouring into the inboxes of my colleagues in States around the country.  My Democratic colleagues and I know, and have known since the day it was signed into law, that the ACA is not perfect. I have talked to small businesses that want to offer health insurance for their employees but have struggled to find affordable options in I have met plenty of Delawareans whose deductibles or premiums are higher than they would like to see, and I have heard from economists and budget forecasters who know our country's fiscal health depends on doing even more to control health care costs.  That is exactly why 2 years ago I came to this floor with a simple, commonsense request of my Republican colleagues: work with us to make the Affordable Care Act better. A colleague, a physician from the State of Louisiana, happened to be listening that day, and we have had a number of constructive and positive conversations since. Sadly, despite many attempts over many years, I so far have been unable to find a Republican partner willing to actually cosponsor meaningful, constructive fixes to the law.  In my view, and as I said 2 years ago, no conversation about the Affordable Care Act and how to improve it can be complete without reconciling the reality of the millions of Americans it has helped and the many others for whom it has fallen short.  I have sought to address the affordability of health care coverage for all families. I have cosponsored bills to increase tax credits to make it more affordable for small businesses, looked for ways to make sure there is more competition in the marketplace, especially in small States like Delaware, and pursued commonsense regulatory reforms and cost-containment efforts to further slow the growth in health care costs. For years, my colleagues and I have asked our Republican friends to put aside their rhetoric and focus on pursuing bipartisan fixes like these.  Today, the bottom line is still this: I know the Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans just like the Delawareans whose stories I have read. Kerry, Carla, Matthew, Sue, and Kim today live healthier, safer, and more secure lives.  Let's take a look at the alternative. There is no single proposed plan. There are dozens of bills in the House and Senate that would do lots of different things, but it would be very hard to predict with precision what the alternative really is. We know what repeal will do. As of today, the alternative--let's call it TrumpCare--is nothing more than a wholesale repeal with no clear plan to replace.  TrumpCare, a simple repeal, by one estimate would kick 26 million Americans--more than 50,000 Delawareans--off their health insurance. Even for those who don't lose their insurance, those hundreds of thousands of Delawareans who get their insurance through their employer, it would be much lower quality because it would[[Page S174]]remove all the consumer protections that we have all come to embrace. It would give a nearly $350 billion tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent of our country and a nearly $250 billion tax cut to big corporations. While tax cuts have their day and their reason, pushing aside all of that revenue with no plan for how to replace the Affordable Care Act and how to pay for it will become a desperate and dangerous move. TrumpCare, a simple repeal of the Affordable Care Act, would cut 3 million jobs and trigger negative economic impacts well beyond the health care sector by creating profound uncertainty. Lastly, it would burden State and local governments, which would lose nearly $50 billion in tax revenue.  That is the reality. Describing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act as anything other than the injection of wild uncertainty into our daily lives, into the health insurance and health care markets is just not square. That is the reality. Describing it any other way is political rhetoric, and that is, sadly, what this debate is about. It is repeal without replace.  Matthew from Wilmington, whose 11-year-old son was diagnosed unexpectedly with brain cancer, concluded his note to me with one last thought. He wrote of his son: ``He's my hero and I will fight for him and all others who continue to suffer similarly every day.''  Thank you, Thank you for sharing your story and continuing the fight. I promise you and all the Delawareans who have reached out to me to do my level best to stand with you and fight for you every step of the way every day until we find a better path together.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS161-3.txt,1984,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,9.0,January

TRANSMITTAL 16-66  Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                           Annex Item vii       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:       1. Components considered to contain sensitive technology in      the proposed sale are as follows:       a. M1A2 Thermal Imaging System (TIS)--The TIS constitutes a      target acquisition system which, when operated with other      tank systems gives the tank crew a substantial advantage over      the potential threat. The TIS provides the crew with the      ability to effectively aim and fire the tank main armament      system under a broad range of adverse battlefield conditions.      The hardware itself is The engineering design      and manufacturing data associated with the detector and      infrared (IR) optics and coatings are considered sensitive.      The technical data package is UNCLASSIFIED with the exception      of the specifications for target acquisition range which is      CONFIDENTIAL and hardening data is classified up to      The consequences of such compromise would increase potential      enemy capabilities to neutralize effectiveness of the tank      main armament system by denying the crew ability to acquire      targets.       b. Special Armor--Major components of special armor are      fabricated in sealed modules and in serialized removable      subassemblies. Special armor vulnerability data for both      chemical and kinetic energy rounds are classified      Engineering design and manufacturing data related to special      armor are also classified The consequences of such      compromise of classified information would be the capability      to neutralize or defeat the armor. The sale or transfer of      armor modules are done on a government-to-government basis.      This serves to minimize, but not eliminate, the danger of      compromise.       c. 120mm Gun--the gun is composed of a 120mm smoothbore gun      (cannon) manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal; ``long rod''      APFSDS warheads; and combustible cartridge case ammunition.      There may be a need to procure/produce new gun cannon tubes      from Watervliet New cannons inducted at Anniston      Army Depot would be inspected according to established      criteria and shipped to Lima Army Tank Plant for tank upgrade      process. Gun production and technology are generally known.      Disclosure of gun production and technology specific to the      120mm (advance materials and tolerances) would degrade the      advantage.       d. AGT-1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion System--The use of a gas      turbine propulsion system in the M1A2 is a unique application      of armored vehicle power pack technology. The hardware is      composed of the AGT-1500 engine and transmission and is not      Manufacturing processes associated with the      production of turbine blades, recuperator, bearings and      shafts, and hydrostatic pump and motor are propriety and      therefore commercially competition sensitive. Unauthorized      release and exploitation of sensitive propulsion information      would adversely impact U.commercial interests. Acquisition      of production data by a potential enemy could enhance its      ability to design and produce gas turbine engine propulsion      system with application to land vehicles.       e. Compartmentation--A major survivability feature of the      MI tank is the compartmentation of fuel and ammunition.      Compartmentation is the positive separation of the crew and      critical components from combustible materials such that in      the event that the fuel or ammunition is ignited or      deteriorated by an incoming threat round, the crew is fully      protected. Sensitive information includes the performance of      the ammunition compartments as well as the compartment design      parameters. The design of the compartments cannot be      protected, however the guidelines, parametric inductions and      test data used to develop the compartments do not have to be      disclosed to permit a sale.       f. Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station--Low Profile      (CROWS-LP)--The CROWS-LP (M153A2E1) is a commanders' weapon      station. It allows for under armor operation of weapons--     M2HB, M2A1, M250B, and The CROWS-LP is an updated      version of the M153A2 CROWS that is approximately 10 inches      shorter; the CROWS-LP M153A2E1 increases visibility over the      weapon station. The fire control system of the CROWS-LP      allows the ``first-burst'' on target capability from      stationary and moving platforms. The CROWS-LP ingratiates a      day camera (VIM-C), thermal camera (TIM 1500), and laser      range finder (STORM/STORM-PI). Engineering design and      manufacturing data would provide potential enemy with the      means to increase small arms fire control from under armor.      The consequences of this would be improved enemy equipment in      the field and decrease technological fire control advantages.       2. The Ml tank will include the following communications      suite: Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)      Receiver (DAGR); AN/VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) and      Rear View Sensor System (RVSS); and Single Channel Ground and      Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).       a. Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)      Receiver (DAGR)--DAGR is a lightweight (less than two pounds)      hand-held or host platform-mounted, dual frequency, Selective      Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based, Precise      Positioning Service (PPS) device. The DAGR provides real-time      positioning, velocity (ground speed), navigation, and timing      (PVNT) information, in standalone (dismounted) and mounted      (ground facilities, sea, air, and land vehicles)      configurations. The DAGR can support missions involving land-     based war-fighting and non-war fighting operations. The DAGR      can also be used as a secondary or supplemental aid to      aviation-based missions which involve operations in low-     dynamic aircraft, and as an aid to navigation in water-borne      operations. DAGR AN/PSN-13(A) is fitted with the Selective      Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) 3.7 and can accept      cryptographic keys for increased PVNT accuracy and protection      from intentional false or spoofed satellite signals. The AN/     PSN-13(A) DAGR does not output classified information. If a      technology advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the      specific hardware and software elements, the information      could be used to identify ways of countering the detection      capabilities of the DAGR or improve the performance of their      GPS receivers; however, information available for the SAASM      would not be obtainable. SAASM is a tamper-resistant security      module. The remaining hardware used in the DAGR is considered      mature and available in other industrial nation's comparable      performance thresholds.       b. Drivers Vision Enhancer (DVE) AN/VAS-5 and Rear View      Sensor System (RVSS)--The AN/VAS-5 and RVSS are un-cooled      thermal imaging systems developed for use while driving      Combat Vehicles and Tactical Wheeled DVE and RVSS      allow for tactical vehicle movement in support of operational      missions in all environment conditions (day/night and all      weather) and provides enhanced driving capability during      limited visibility conditions (darkness, smoke, dust, fog,      etc.). The DVE program provides night vision targeting      capabilities for armored vehicles and long-range night vision      reconnaissance capability to the warfighter. Engineering      design and manufacturing data would provide a potential enemy      with the means to upgrade the quality of efficiency of      thermal devices production. The consequences of this would be      improved enemy equipment of the field. Technical information      regarding DVE and RVSS, including UNCLASSIFIED information,      should generally not be considered for release.       The highest level of information that must be disclosed for      production, operation or sale of the end item is      UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE       c. Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System      (SINCGARS)--The AN/VRC-92E and RT-1702 SINCGARS provides war-     fighting commanders and troops with a highly reliable,      secure, easily maintained Combat Net Radio (CNR) that has      both voice and data handling capability in support of command      and control operations. SINCGARS, with the Internet      Controller, provides the communications link for the      digitized force. SINCGARS is a radio fielded to tactical      field elements. It facilitates the transmission of voice and/     or data information, which allows for the conducting of a      myriad of missions across the operational continuum. SINCGARS      is available for the dismounted soldier, ground and aviation      platforms. Training will vary for the radio (RT-1702) and      spare and repair parts for the RT-1702 model are not      supported by the Standard Army Supply There is      sensitive or restricted information contained in the AN/[[Page S18]]     VRC-92E or software. There would be adverse consequences of      the AN/VRC-92E and software were to be lost to a technically      advanced adversary. If a technology advances adversary were      to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software      elements, the information could be used to identify ways of      countering the Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM).      The hardware used in the AN/VRC-92E and RT-1702 is considered      mature.       3. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.     foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in      the Policy Moreover, the benefits to be      derived from this sale, as outlined in the Policy      Justification, outweigh the potential damage that could      result if the sensitive technology were revealed to      unauthorized persons.       4. All defense articles and services listed in this      transmittal have been authorized for release and export to      the Government of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgS14.txt,1825,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,3.0,January
392,topic-id,1700,"Mr.President, let me start by offering my congratulations to my friend and colleague Senator Schumer from New He is a worthy adversary when we see things differently, as we frequently do, but he is also somebody with whom I have found I can work productively. I understand he has a new role to play as the Democratic leader. I am sure we will see a lot of that worthy adversarial part of his character in the forefront. But in this new year, with a new Congress, I do hope we can work together.  I became a little concerned, though, as I heard him go on. He had already declared the Trump Presidency over, and he is not even going to be sworn in until 17 days from now, by my calculations. Of course, we just swore in the new Members of the 115th  Let me also congratulate my colleagues across the aisle who were elected to join us here in what historically has been known as the world's greatest deliberative body. But if there is anything any one of us who have been here a while has learned, it is that neither party gets everything they want. It just was not designed that way.  For example in 2009, when one party controlled the White House, had 60 votes in the Senate, and had a majority in the House of Representatives, ostensibly you could get what you want since you didn't need to rely on any votes from the opposing party. But if there is one great historic example of why it is a mistake to try to do things alone or without bipartisan support, it is the example of ObamaCare, which we will be talking more about in the coming days.  The media, of course, is still trying to figure out what happened on November 8--how the pundits, all the experts, all the pollsters got it wrong. It is still not hard to find articles from those pundits and the mainstream media giving their diagnosis on exactly what the American voter was saying to us on November 8.  I personally don't think it is all that complicated; I think it is pretty straightforward. After 8 years of an Obama White House, the American people wanted a change. They spoke up loudly and clearly, demanding a new direction that would actually deliver results for the American people. I think those of us on both sides of the aisle ought to have enough humility to say it was not exactly a ringing affirmation of either political party.  I am grateful for one thing, though, and that is that the American people decided they did not want to change the Republican majority in the House and the We do take the responsibility of being in the majority seriously. We believe it is our duty to bring real help to the American people.  I would digress for just a moment and say to my colleague from New York, the Democratic leader, that I remember when I came to the Senate, Mike Enzi, conservative Republican from Wyoming, and Teddy Kennedy, whom you identified as your mentor, the liberal lion of the Senate--they worked so productively together on the HELP Committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions I remember one time asking Senator Enzi: How is it that somebody as conservative as you are can work with someone as liberal as Teddy Kennedy is and do so in good faith, good spirits, and so productively?  Senator Enzi said: It is easy. It is the 80-20 rule. The 80 percent that we can agree on, we do. The 20 percent we will never agree on, we simply leave for another fight another day. Actually, I think that is a pretty good rule of thumb.  The first job the new Congress will have is to repeal I alluded to that earlier. It is simple. I think if history teaches anything about taking advantage of a supermajority in Senate, it is that you should not do that because if we did that with Social Security, Medicare, or other programs widely supported by the American people, it simply would not be sustainable. That is the case with ObamaCare, voted through the Senate--jammed through with 60 votes on the other side in the Senate, and then a majority in the House, signed by President Actually, after Republicans picked up a vacant Senate seat in Massachusetts, it caused our Democratic colleagues to have to use the budget reconciliation process to pass it.  But we know the broken promises of ObamaCare, and we will revisit those more and more in coming days. There are higher premiums with less coverage. Many lost their insurance all together after being promised by the President himself that if you like what you have, you can keep it. We know that many folks no longer have access to the doctor or health care plan of their choice because their doctor has either quit accepting that insurance or retired or health plans have simply pulled up stakes because they can't compete under the provisions of  I believe the verdict for the American people has been that ObamaCare has failed the American people. I would ask our Democratic colleagues to look at the fact that they passed it originally with 60 votes. Now they are at 48. We have all been in the majority and the minority if we have been around here for very long, but I think ObamaCare is one of the big reasons our Democratic colleagues find themselves currently in the minority.  As one of our colleagues put it this morning, if we can't do better than ObamaCare, we might as well look for another line of work. What we owe the American people, I believe, is coverage that they choose, at a price they can afford.  Of course, that is just the beginning. Under President Obama's leadership, his administration has imposed thousands of rules and regulations, running up the pricetag of hundreds of billions of dollars, which has put a stranglehold on the American economy. Many of these are job-killing regulations that make it harder for small businesses, which are the very lifeblood of our economy, to make ends meet, to make a profit, to hire additional employees--things that we desperately need in this country--more well-paying jobs.  I look forward to working with the new administration to roll back those regulations and rules that don't make sense. With ObamaCare repealed and replaced with coverage you can afford from a provider that you choose and with the better economic climate for the country, we can help more Americans achieve their dreams. That should be the top priority for every one of us here in this  Finally, I look forward to working with the incoming administration to consider President-Elect Trump's nominees to fill his posts in his If I am not mistaken, on the day that President Obama was sworn into office, January 20, 2009, there were seven Cabinet members of his incoming cabinet that were confirmed that day. That demonstrates the sort of good faith and accommodation that this Senate should continue because we understand the importance of the President's Cabinet members. Whether it is the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, or the Attorney General, they hold critical positions, not only in terms of national security but in terms of making sure the government works for the American people.  I have already spoken about one of our colleagues, Senator Sessions, the President-elect's nominee to be the chief law enforcement officer for the country. I think Senator Sessions is an excellent choice. Our colleagues will have a chance to ask all the questions they want, but there is one thing I can[[Page S11]]be sure of with Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, and that is that he will remove the political orientation of the Department of Justice and make sure that it is not just another political branch of the White I look forward to confirming him as Attorney General, and I am confident that he will be prepared to answer the questions from our colleagues.  As we have seen over the last few days, President-Elect Trump continues to announce the nominations of many other qualified candidates who, I am confident, will serve the American people, including people like my friend the former Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, as Energy Secretary, and Rex Tillerson as Secretary of I hope all of our colleagues will understand how integral it is to the administration's ability to govern to get well-qualified people confirmed to the President's They, of course, have a responsibility to be forthcoming and to answer questions and cooperate with the process here in the Senate, but I look forward to working with our colleagues in getting the President's nominees confirmed. I know we have a lot of work ahead of us, and I don't have any doubt that, with a little cooperation, we can make the 115th Congress a productive one that meets the needs of the American people.  I would just conclude, perhaps, as I started, by saying that all of us who have worked here in the Senate for a while know Senator We also understand he has taken on a new and more challenging role, because, frankly, the Democratic conference is a lot more left-leaning than it has ever been since I, certainly, have been here, and he has to work with all of his But I hope there is one thing we can all agree with--that we have an obligation beyond party, and that is to our country and to the people we represent. We are blessed to work in a great American institution--a unique institution--and I believe it is our obligation and duty to try to find areas we can agree on and build consensus to move the country forward for the American people. While surely we will have our fights--and they will be glorious fights--we shouldn't shy away from those differences, but let's not let our desire just to fight for fighting's sake get in the way of our ability to work together and try to find consensus where we can.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgS10.txt,1692,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,3.0,January
613,topic-id,2392,"Mr.President, there has been a flurry of activity this week with the beginning of the new year and thebeginning of a new Congress--the 115th Congress--and we have a lot of work to do.  This election that we just went through on November 8 was surprising in many ways, gratifying in many ways. Personally, Ithink the best thing about it is that it gives us an opportunity to start anew, to deal with the problems that the Americanpeople were, frankly, not all that happy with either of the political parties about in terms of the solutions that we were tooffer. I would hope that it would also give us an opportunity to hit the reset button when it comes to working together to tryto find political consensus to solve some of these big problems.  I mentioned yesterday our friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and his 80-20 rule, which I told him I have usedtime and again to make the point that just because you disagree on some things doesn't mean you can't get[[Page S35]]anything done. Tothe contrary, people of widely divergent ideological, philosophical, and political beliefs can work together by simply trying tofind common ground. That is possible. That, in fact, is the way our Constitution created our government to force us to do that,because what we decide here impacts a lot of people--well over 300 million people in the United States alone. But if there wasone consistent complaint that I heard from my constituents back in Texas and that we heard in the national media and beyond, itis about the failure of the promise of We made a solemn commitment to the American people that if they provided uswith the majority we needed to do it and if they provided us a President who would sign it, we would repeal ObamaCare and wewould replace it with affordable health care that would be of their choosing, as opposed to a top-down mandate, a one-size-fits-all, which is the failure of  In a previous life, I was attorney general of my State, the State of We had a huge division of trial lawyers calledthe consumer protection division. What we did is we sued people who committed consumer fraud--people who promised one thing butdelivered another. I can't think of a bigger case of consumer fraud than ObamaCare, which was sold under false pretenses: If youlike what you have, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you are a family of four, yourpremiums will go down by an average of $2,500.  None of that has proven to be true.  The reason why ObamaCare is so unpopular is that people have seen their premiums skyrocket. People have seen theirdeductibles grow to the point where they are effectively self-insured, which is not having insurance at all. Many people havesimply seen insurance companies pull out of the insurance market, leaving them with little or no choices in terms of where tobuy their health care.  So many remember the PR campaign of the President and Democrats, with which they sold ObamaCare to the American people, and,as I said, promised better coverage, more choices, and lower prices.  That means now that ObamaCare has failed to deliver that. It is incumbent on us to try to repeal it, which we will do, andto replace it with more affordable coverage that people will choose and that fits their needs better. The bad news of ObamaCarepicked up throughout last summer into the fall. As I mentioned, insurance companies were losing money and were unable to operateand deliver health care under the tight grip of But the real losers weren't the insurance companies. It is the tensof thousands of Texans who were forced to find new insurance at higher prices--not insurance they would have chosen on their own,but which they were forced to accept because there was no alternative.  So instead of helping rural Texans--the Senator from Vermont talked about rural residents in his State--I would submit thatfor people living in rural areas across the country, the implementation of ObamaCare hurt most of our rural country by dwindlingthe number of choices to one health care option for the year. That sounds like the opposite of more choices and better coverageto me. But we can't forget that behind these numbers and headlines are real personal consequences for families across thecountry.  So today I want to provide just a snapshot of some of the thousands of letters that I received in my office about ObamaCareand the burdens that it is placing on the backs of the people I represent in One Texan wrote telling the story that Ihave heard time and again. She said her insurance plan was discontinued--so much for ``if you like what you have, you can keepit.'' But she did what she had to do, and she switched to a more expensive plan--one with a higher monthly payment and one withan $11,000 deductible. What good is health insurance if you have to spend $11,000 out of your own pocket before the insurancebegins to kick in? It is nearly worthless.  Well, nothing about that says affordable health care. Unfortunately, this individual is like many folks across the country,full of questions and with nowhere to turn to find any relief for their families or their small business.  Another one of my constituents had a similar complaint. He wrote to me that he was searching for yet another healthinsurance plan for the third time in as many years after his was canceled. He went on to highlight this in this letter, which Ireceived from a constituent on November 23, 2015. He said:       I seem to remember the President sayingsomething about      liking your insurance and being able to keep it. For myself      and my family, it has been just the opposite. Weloved our      insurance prior to the passage of the Act and since have been      forced to purchase much more expensive insurance withmuch      higher deductibles.  Well, this Texan is right, but unfortunately, his experience was not isolated. It was shared by millions of people acrossthe country for whom ObamaCare was a false promise. It is not as if he had the freedom to choose. The choice was made for him,and this was the fundamental flaw of In a country as big and diverse as ours, this notion of ``one-size-fits-all''and that somehow the people who live and work inside the beltway are smarter than the rest of us and we can figure out what isgood for them and a choice they would not themselves make is just simply implausible. It is not true. This constituent ended hisletter by asking the Congress:       Do anything. Do anything within your power to reverse this      terriblehealth care trend. I need relief.  After this historic election, after the promises we made that have given us the opportunity to govern in the majority, witha President in the White House who will work with us, I believe we have a clear mandate to repeal this terrible law and make ita relic of the past. We will do that by adopting the budget resolution submitted by Chairman Enzi of the Budget  It is not just Republicans who have pointed out the defects of Many of our Democratic colleagues have pointed outthe law's failed promises as well--from an op-ed entitled ``How to fix the Affordable Health Care Act,'' which was written by aDemocrat, to statements on the Senate floor, to legislation introduced to ``fix the glitch.'' Even in campaign ads, many of ourDemocratic colleagues have themselves been outspoken advocates for changing The senior Senatorfrom Missouri, pointing out the ``huge problem ObamaCare has been in her State'' came up with an entire list of necessarychanges. I, for one, would be happy to start with her list and say let's try to use this as a core of issues that we can thentry to build consensus around to begin to make that replacement and make it on a bipartisan basis.  We have seen that attempted fixes, unsupported by the Obama administration and vastly insufficient, continually have beenmet with frustration by Democrats and I pointed out yesterday that when the Democrats voted through ObamaCare, theyhad 60 votes. They had 60 Today they have 48.  At one point, certainly back in 2009 and 2010 when ObamaCare passed, they had a majority in the House of Representatives.Well, they lost that. Now they have lost the White House itself. I just don't know how much longer, how much more needs to besaid or done for them to get the message that this is not working because I believe they are paying a political price for it aspeople are searching for accountability for what they have to deal with day in and day out.  The senior Senator from Indiana said that he supported the Affordable Care Act to help working and middle-class familieshave access to health care, but he said that doesn't mean the law is perfect, and it doesn't mean we don't still have work todo.  I was delighted to hear the Senator from Vermont, Mr.Sanders, say he agrees ObamaCare is not perfect. My request ofhim and others is to work with us to try to replace it with something better.  I recognize that neither side is going to be able to get everything they want. That is just not the way this place works.Indeed, the single failure of the Obama administration is to try to do things on a go-it-alone basis because we are going to seethose Executive orders that he issued unilaterally rescinded on the first day President-Elect Trump takes office. All themassive regulations that have been issued, we are going to use the Congressional[[Page S36]]Review Act to rein those in or to defundthose through the appropriations process. In order for legislation and policy to be sustainable, it is going to have to bebipartisan. I realize our Democratic colleagues are disappointed with the outcome of the election on November 8. That is anunderstatement. At first they started out in denial: It just can't be true. The next stage was met with anger. Well, they areangry about it, and they are going to obstruct everything the new majority, working with the White House, tries to do, but Iwould hope they would move past that denial and past that anger and do what the Senate was always designed to do; that is, towork on a bipartisan basis, as our friend and colleague from Wyoming demonstrated to us working on the Health, Education, Labor,and Pensions Committee with the liberal lion of the Senate, Teddy Let's try the 80-20 rule and see how it works. Itwill work.  The senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr.Manchin--this is another Democrat--has said he would vote to repeal ObamaCare.He said that we should be working together to identify which parts of the law are broken and need to be fixed. We may learn thatsome parts of the law can't be repaired and we should eliminate those parts entirely. This is our Democratic friend andcolleague from West Virginia, Senator  I think that is a great place to start because no matter which side of the aisle you sit on, you can see the Affordable CareAct is not working, certainly not as sold to the American people. The choice of the Democrats now is whether to obstruct orwhether they will actually work with us, as we should have done in the first place, to come up with something more sustainablethat would address costs and preserve individual choice.  It is interesting. It is not just our Democratic colleagues, many of whom voted for I remember during thePresidential campaign that former President Bill Clinton made some pretty interesting comments. This would have been on October5, 2016. I am reading from a CNN story here. It said:       Speaking at a Democratic rally in Flint,Michigan, the      former president ripped the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for      flooding the health care insurance market and causingpremiums      to rise for middle-class Americans who do not qualify for      subsidies.  Here is what he said:       So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25      million morepeople have health care and then the people who      are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up      with their premiumsdoubled and their coverage cut in half.      It's the craziest thing in the world.  Former President Bill Clinton said that in Flint, MI, on October 5, 2016.  He is right, but that is what you get when you try to do things in a partisan, unilateral fashion. We should learn from ourcollective mistakes and try to do better, and shame on us if we can't do better than ObamaCare with all of its failed promises.  By repealing ObamaCare, Congress is doing more than just delivering on a promise we made to the people who put us here. Weare providing a way forward for millions of people across the country who have been hurt by ObamaCare and are looking forrelief.  I look forward to making ObamaCare and the many burdens it has placed on American families a thing of the past in this newyear. That is what we will do when next week we pass this budget resolution, and then reconciliation instructions will be sentto the relevant Senate and House committees. They will then report back with the replacement, and, yes, it may take some time totransition into that replacement because it has taken us 6 years to get into the mess, into the ditch we find ourselves in now.When your truck or car is in the ditch, the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch. Sometimes that takes a lot ofhard work.  We are going to have to work as hard as we can. I would hope our colleagues will work with us, not just to resist forresistance's sake, not just to take a partisan position because they feel they are required to do so because of their allegianceto the policies of the Democratic Let's do what this institution has always been best known for; that is, to try to findsome way to work together on a step-by-step basis to produce reform which will make health care more affordable and stillpreserve those choices for individuals and their families, not a one-size-fits-all government mandate which simply has failed inthis tragic experiment known as We can and we will do better.

1207,topic-id,1902,"Mr.President, I would just say, I had the pleasure of sitting here listening to the Senator from Connecticut talk about his concerns about repealing ObamaCare, and I would say it strikes me that their posture is that we sold the American people a lemon, and we insist they keep it.  Our position is that ObamaCare has been a failure. It has been a grand--in terms of scale--experiment, a national experiment that has failed.  Yesterday I talked about the fact that my constituents are writing me and telling me that their premiums, in many instances, have doubled, and their deductible has gotten to the point that they are effectively self-insured so their insurance does them virtually no good.  We will vote to repeal ObamaCare, but obviously we are not going to leave people hanging out to dry. We are going to make sure they have coverage that they choose and that they can afford. I welcome the assistance of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to craft a bipartisan reform.[[Page S83]]  The biggest failure of ObamaCare was the fact that when our Democratic friends had 60 votes in the Senate and they had President Obama in the White House and a majority in the House, they jammed it down the throats of the American people. That is really why ObamaCare is unsustainable--because it was purely a partisan political exercise. We need to start over by repealing ObamaCare and then reforming our health care system so people can buy the coverage they want at a price they can afford. We are going to work very carefully to make sure the transition is thought out, methodical, and very carefully done.                              Nominations  Soon, Mr.President, we will be considering and confirming men and women nominated by the President-elect to fill leadership roles throughout the administration. This is crucial to ensuring a smooth transition from one President to another, and it is important to make sure the next President has the people and resources he needs to help lead our country.  I have had some of the reporters in the hallway say: How in the world can you process so many nominees at the same time, so quickly?  I said: It is the tyranny of the calendar. We are going to have a new President on January 20, and wouldn't you want--for example, the President's CIA Director choice, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence--wouldn't you want all of those key national security positions filled as soon as possible in case some of our adversaries decide to take advantage of this transition to try to threaten the United States?  It makes sense to me that we would work in an orderly sort of way with our colleagues across the aisle to make this transition a smooth one from President Obama to President President Obama has said that is what he is working to do, and you would think it would make sense for us to be a part of the solution and not a part of the problem.  Holding up confirmations just for delay's sake is irresponsible and it is dangerous. As I speak, there is a hearing going on on the foreign cyber threats in the Senate Armed Services People are justifiably concerned about what our adversaries are doing in cyber space. But it is not related to just cyber space, it is related to nuclear threats from countries such as North Korea, obviously the ongoing humanitarian crisis and civil war going on in Syria and elsewhere, the threats from Russia not only in cyber space but also to our NATO allies in Europe, and I could go on and on talking about Iran and its nuclear aspirations, its ballistic missile capability.  This is a dangerous world we are living in, and why in the world would we want to make it even more dangerous just to let our colleagues delay for delay's sake President-Elect Trump getting to fill his Cabinet, particularly these important national security offices? The truth is, when it comes to wanting what is best for America, we are all on the same team. We should all want what is best for our country. It doesn't do our Democratic colleagues a bit of good to delay the inevitable because, thanks to former Democratic leader Harry Reid and the so-called nuclear option that changed the Senate confirmation rules, we know that President-Elect Trump's Cabinet members will be confirmed. It is going to happen because it takes 51 votes. Just delaying for delay's sake out of partisan pique really doesn't do anything to accomplish any goal but, rather, makes our country more dangerous and denies the President-elect the Cabinet he has chosen.  When President-Elect Obama was nominated to office, we acted very quickly. In fact, on the day he was inaugurated--January 20, 2009--seven of his Cabinet members were confirmed. We were not happy about the outcome of the election on this side of the aisle. We wished a different electoral outcome had occurred. But once the voters had spoken, we accepted their verdict, and we worked cooperatively to see a smooth transition from the Bush administration to the Obama administration. I believe it is our duty to do that. Nearly all of President Obama's Cabinet-level nominees were confirmed within the span of 2 weeks. We came together, understood that the people had spoken, and we went to work to cooperate in good faith, not necessarily because we were happy about the outcome but because it is our responsibility to do so.  Then there are some of the statements from some of our colleagues across the aisle that they now appear to be walking away from. In the spring of 2015, Senator Stabenow, the senior Senator from Michigan, said: ``When a President wins an election, they have the right to have their team.'' She said that on April 20, 2015. I hope that not only the Senator from Michigan but her other colleagues remember that position they took then and simply reciprocate in good faith during this transition.  Senator Stabenow is right, by the way. No matter which side you are on, we know that the voters have spoken. As President-elect, he has the authority to surround himself with those he sees fit to advise him and help him as he serves our country.  For some of our colleagues to suggest that keeping the President understaffed is somehow in the best interest of the American people is palpably false. It is ridiculous. I mentioned the national security nominations the President-elect has indicated. One of those first ones was Senator Sessions, our colleague here in the Senate, the junior Senator from Alabama, to serve as Attorney General of the United The Attorney General is not only the head of the Department of Justice and has an important law enforcement role, the Attorney General also has a very important anti-terrorism national security portfolio as well. So it is very important that people like Senator Sessions, the Attorney General nominee, be put in place on a timely basis for the safety of our community.  Talking about the nomination of Attorney General Loretta Lynch not even 2 years ago, the senior Senator from Vermont urged a quick confirmation, saying: ``Confirming the top law enforcement position should be an urgent priority of the Senate.'' And he is right.  As the minority party is now considering the political strategy of obstruction, delay, and stall tactics, what has changed except that your preferred candidate did not win and our preferred candidate did win? That is the only thing that has changed.  Another nominee the Senate will consider is the President-elect's choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Last year, after the death of Justice Scalia, we promised the American people that the next President, whether it was a Republican or a Democrat, would nominate the successor to Justice We didn't say we would only vote to confirm a Republican President's nominees; we said that the American people had a right to a voice in who would make that choice, recognizing that the next Justice on the Supreme Court could serve 25 or 30 years.  Here we are 15 days before the President-elect is sworn in to the White House and the minority leader is already threatening to deny the voices and the vote of the American people from last November by blocking any nominee indefinitely.  As shocking as it sounds, on Tuesday night, just hours after the 115th Congress was sworn in, Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, was asked in an interview on MSNBC if he would ``do his best to keep the seat open.'' He answered with one word: ``Absolutely.'' Despite months of calling for a full Supreme Court, all nine members, even using the hashtag ``We need nine,'' the Democratic leader is now threatening indefinite obstruction.  Republicans were clear with the American people: We would respect their voice in whom they wanted to pick the next Supreme Court Justice, whether it was a Democrat or Republican in the White House, and we would move forward with that nominee in the new  I hope our Democratic friends don't slow-walk President-Elect Trump's nominees. It is one thing to obstruct, but it becomes an even bigger problem when they intentionally try to keep President Trump from doing the job the voters have given him the responsibility to do.  The American people made clear in November that they are done with[[Page S84]]business as usual here in Washington, Frankly, I don't think it was a robust endorsement of either one of the political parties. We got an unconventional President-elect, and I think the American people expect him to shake this place up, and I think he will. We intend to work with him to make sure there is a positive outcome for the American people. I don't think they are interested in political stunts or delay for delay's sake, nor do they want us to return to the dysfunctional do-nothing Congress of the past. They want results, and they want a path forward toward a brighter future for themselves and their families.  Let's not keep from President Trump the men and women he has chosen to work alongside him. That would only make us less safe, our economy more fragile, and the government less efficient. After all, we are paying the bills as taxpayers. Why would we want a less efficient or less effective government? In short, it will not serve the interests of the American people well.  I know we are ready on this side of the aisle to roll up our sleeves and get to work. As I have learned through hard experience, the only time anything ever gets accomplished in the Senate is when we work together. I am not talking about people sacrificing their principles. We ought to fight like cats and dogs when it comes to our basic principles. There are a lot of things that are outside of the realm of principles where we can find common ground and work together and build consensus. I think we ought to take advantage of this historic opportunity to do just that, starting with confirming the President's Cabinet and letting them get to work to help his administration as soon as possible.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,1692,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,5.0,January

1496,topic-id,1595,"Madam President, as my colleagues know, this week we will take up the nominations of the men and women who President-Elect Trump has selected for his I have to say, for myself, that looking at the quality of the people the President-elect has nominated gives me quite a bit of reassurance about what his administration will be like, starting with the Vice President, Mike Mr.Pence is somebody well known to those of us here in the Congress, having served 12 years in the House of Representatives, and then he went on to be the Governor of Indiana for 4 years. He is eminently qualified to help the administration and the President-elect navigate the perils and pitfalls of the legislative process here in the Senate and in the  Then we look at the other people who have been nominated, whether it is for Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, or the Department of Homeland In some cases, they are unconventional choices, but, in every case I can think of, they are people who have eminent qualifications to offer to the administration and to the country in this new administration.  This is one of the most important responsibilities a Senator has--to make sure we conduct the advice and consent process and make sure we vet the nominees for these important posts. But in one case in particular, it is not going to be all that hard because we have served alongside Senator Jeff Sessions, for 15 years in my case and for 20 years in other cases.  We should be working together, as President Obama himself has said, recognizing the importance of a smooth transition from the outgoing administration to the new one. That should be true no matter what side of the aisle you are on. Unfortunately, I think some of our Democratic friends are still in some shock from the election on November 8.  I remember a book written on the grieving process, describing that first comes denial, then comes anger, and then ultimately acceptance. I think what our Democratic colleagues have to work through is their denial and anger to get to acceptance of the fact that President-Elect Trump and Vice President-Elect Pence won the election.  So what is our responsibility? It is to work in a bipartisan basis to make sure that they have the people around them that they need in order to run the government.  We are simply trying to stick to the same standard set under President In 2009, our Democratic colleagues held seven confirmation hearings in one day. That is more than we are planning to do on So my response to our friends across the aisle is to listen to the junior Senator from Connecticut, who told a reporter: ``I can figure out how to walk across the hall and attend two hearings occurring simultaneously.''  One of the most important hearings, in my mind, we will hold is the hearing we are going to have in the Judiciary Committee starting tomorrow on the President-elect's nominee as Attorney General--our friend Senator Jeff As I said, the junior Senator from Alabama has a lengthy history serving his State and country in law enforcement, but his passion for public service started long before that.  Before we knew him in the Senate, Jeff Sessions was an Eagle Scout from Hybart, He later served in the Army After college, he taught at Goode Street Elementary School in Montgomery, I bet even those of us who have known him a long time did not know that he taught at Goode Street Elementary School in Montgomery, AL, after college. Then he went on to become a lawyer, receiving his law degree from the University of He later worked as a Federal prosecutor, including 12 years as a U.attorney for the Southern District of Then--where I got to know him--he became his State's attorney general.  Senator Sessions' record is one of a person not afraid to go after those who are abusing power. From State judges and senators to county commissioners and school board members, Jeff Sessions has rooted out and punished corrupt officials as was his job as a U.attorney. As U.attorney, he fought to secure the rights of African Americans to vote and successfully advocated to uphold the death penalty sentence of Ku Klux Klan member and murderer Henry  Here in the Senate, he served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for 20[[Page S133]]years, where I have come to know him well. Working with him has shown me not only his sharp mind but his passion for the people of this country and his commitment to the rule of law. He is a hard worker and a person who makes his decisions based on what he thinks is the right thing to do and his own integrity. I know many of us can attest to this, including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. While holding true to his principles, Jeff Sessions has found common ground with folks across the ideological spectrum on many issues, including ones he will work on as Attorney General of the United  For example, in 2003, Senator Sessions worked closely with the late-Senator Teddy Kennedy, whom I have called the liberal lion of the Perhaps, I am not the first one, but he certainly was that. He was a larger-than-life personality and somebody who personified our political opposition across the aisle. But Jeff Sessions and Teddy Kennedy worked together to help fight sexual assault in prison in a way that was both proactive and pragmatic. Senator Sessions crafted legislation to encourage State governments to take affirmative measures that reduced the frequency of sexual assault in jails and prisons. We continue to see the benefits of this legislation today, as more and more States get serious and crack down on this crime. Last Congress, I was proud to work with Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, the ranking member in the 114th Congress, and others in this Chamber, to pass the Justice for All Reauthorization Act, which created additional tools that strengthened the Prison Rape Elimination  Then there is the work Senator Sessions has done with the assistant minority leader, the Democratic whip, and the senior Senator from Vermont, two of this Chamber's more liberal Members, to address sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. It became obvious over time that many people living in our inner cities were using crack cocaine, but their fellow countrymen living in more affluent areas caught with powder cocaine were subject to far lesser sentences than those in the inner cities using crack cocaine. The work Senator Sessions did with Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy, called the Fair Sentencing Act, was signed in to law by President Obama in 2010. Senator Sessions saw the harsh penalties many young African-American men experienced for possession of crack, compared to the lighter punishments given to suspects found with powder cocaine, who as a group tended to be more White or To me, this is the sort of thing that offends the most basic sensibilities of Jeff Sessions--somebody who believes unequivocally in color-blind justice and equal justice under the law. Of course, the utmost responsibility of the U.Department of Justice is to enforce the law and ensure equality for all Americans under our  Senator Sessions has demonstrated that he is qualified and prepared to serve as the Nation's top law enforcement officer--not only thanks to a proven track record but, because at his core, he understands the importance of justice for all and upholding the rule of law. Now, you don't have to take my word for it. Here is what some of our leading Democratic colleagues have had to say about working with Senator Sessions over the years:  The incoming Democratic leader, Senator Schumer of New York, called Jeff Sessions ``straightforward and fair.''  Senator Durbin, the Democratic whip, in June 2010, working with him to eliminate the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine called Jeff Sessions ``a man of his word.''  Then, perhaps, there is an unlikely person to compliment Senator Sessions, because of some of the positions Attorney General Holder took that I think Senator Sessions found objectionable--particularly when injecting too much politics into the work of the Department of Justice and not enforcing what Senator Sessions saw to be the rule of law. Nevertheless, former Attorney General Eric Holder on January 2016, 2009, called Senator Sessions ``a great U.attorney.''  Senator Sessions has both the temperament and experience to restore the faith of all Americans in our justice system, and we have the responsibility to grant him a fair confirmation hearing starting tomorrow. I suspect our Democratic colleagues agree, because in 2015 they penned a letter that said:       The Attorney General plays a pivotal role in administering      our nation's laws and protecting our national security. This      is why the Senate, regardless of the party in control, has      historically given swift consideration to Attorney General      nominees.  Those were our Democratic colleagues. The chance to do so is right before all of us, and I hope they will assist us in a fair and swift confirmation process for a truly honorable and deserving candidate for Attorney  I know we will miss Senator Sessions in the Not that we always agreed with him, but he always disagreed in the most congenial sort of manner and in a way that we knew he had respect for people of widely divergent views. But the fact is that our country needs him to lead the Department of Justice now more than ever.  I yield the floor.

(2) Gradient boundary survey method.--The term ``gradient      boundary survey method'' means the measurement technique used      to locate the South Bank boundary line in accordance with the      methodology established in Oklahoma v.

(3) Landowner.--The term ``landowner'' means any      individual, group, association, corporation, federally      recognized Indian tribe or member of such an Indian tribe, or      other private or governmental legal entity that owns an      interest in land in the affected area.

Texas, 261 U.340 (1923)--       (i) to confine the waters within the bed; and       (ii) to preserve the course of the river.       (6) South bank boundary line.--The term ``South Bank      boundary line'' means the boundary, with respect to title and      ownership, between the States of Oklahoma and Texas      identified through the gradient boundary survey method that      does not impact or alter the permanent political boundary      line between the States along the Red River, as outlined      under article II, section B of the Red River Boundary Compact      enacted by the States and consented to by Congress pursuant      to Public Law 106-288 (114 919).     3.

Shelby wanted to find a way to honor the men and women who put their lives on the line for our safety: our veterans.Specifically, she wanted to help those veterans who suffer from posttraumatic stress.  After learning about the Arkansas Veterans Hospital posttraumatic stress disorder program, Shelby began to talk with anyonewho would listen about the program--friends and family, her church congregation, civic clubs, and other organizations acrossWarren and Bradley She told them about her passion for helping veterans, the good work this program does, and how muchit would benefit from additional support.  Her hard work paid off. With the help of a local auctioneer, Shelby organized a community bake sale auction and managed toraise $8,000 for the Arkansas Veterans But Shelby wasn't finished. She and a group of other volunteers spent hourspreparing and selling sandwiches at the Bradley County fair and raised an additional $2,000, for a grand total of $10,000 forveterans suffering from posttraumatic stress.  A veteran in Shelby's community was struck by her commitment to such a noble cause and in his nomination of Shelby wrote:``Her actions are proof that patriotism runs deep in small town She is an exceptional representative of many youngpeople in our nation deeply committed to the men and women who serve protecting and defending our nation and our way of life.Shelby is a shining example of the caliber of young person this country requires to ensure the survival of our nation and ourvalues.

1008,topic-id,245,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which really is a life-or-death question before the  On February 7, 2010, a bunch of workers who were at a natural gas plant construction site early in the morning lost their lives in a horrific explosion because there was a natural gas blow where they intentionally put natural gas through the pipe that was being installed as a way of cleaning it. This is a practice which the pipe suppliers, Siemens, GE, and others have issued serious warning is an unsafe practice. Unfortunately, it wasn't followed that day, so six men lost their lives. One of them was Ronnie Crabb, who was a dear friend of mine.  It never should have happened because, again, in the private sector, the workplace standard was there, but there was no workplace standard in OSHA, which is now, again, trapped in the Chemical Safety Board and the regulatory process.  This bill is just going to do nothing but, again, add additional obstacles so that preventive measures that OSHA is really about--it is about compliance, not retribution. There was a $16 million fine imposed after the fact. The company, the contractor, went out of business and paid just a fraction of it. That is not the way to protect workers' lives. Let's allow a healthy regulatory process with private sector input so that people like Ronnie Crabb won't lose their lives in the future.  Mr.Chairman, again, I strongly support the Scott amendment.

1226,topic-id,2458,"Mr.President, in the final days of the Obama administration's second term, with all eyes focused on the President-elect, the temptation to try to take a dramatic action to seal a cherished policy legacy must have been almost irresistible. So it proved for President Obama on December 23, 2016, when he betrayed decades of robust bipartisan American support for Israel at the United Nations by abstaining from a completely biased resolution that condemns our close friend and ally Israel and condemns all the so-called settlement activity, defined as any construction in any territory won by Israel in the Six-Day  U.policy for decades has been to stand up for Israel at the United Nations, a hot bed of anti-Semitism that discriminately condemns Israel more than any country in the world, particularly when resolutions are being offered up that are outrageously biased, that attempt to predetermine the outcome of negotiations, that prejudge the basis for negotiations, or that try to dictate terms to  We have seen this pattern of appealing to the United Nations from the Obama administration over and over with disastrous deals--the nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the U.Convention on Climate Change, two international agreements that significantly threaten the security and prosperity of the United Both of them should have been submitted to this body, the Senate, as treaties.  But the President chose instead to try to impose them through the United Nations because he knew that they would never be ratified by the Senate, even when this Senate had a Democratic majority. So the Obama administration's strategy, instead, has been to curb American power by subjugating our national interests to the globalist agenda of the U.N., a policy that he is now attempting to extend to  Here are some of the main problems with UNSC Resolution 2334. First, it is an attack on Israeli sovereignty, as it falsely defines as illegal under international law building activity within Israel's own borders, which should be an internal Israeli issue. The historical connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel did not begin in 1967.  Let us not forget that the Six-Day War was a defensive war fought almost 50 years ago by the Jewish state against the Palestinians and their Arab enablers, who were gathering in a concerted effort to wipe Israel off the map. Against all odds, Israel won quickly and decisively and the map was redrawn to ensure that Israel was not endangered by its own borders, the weakness of which Israel's enemies had attempted to exploit.  Of course, the defeated party, the Palestinians, have not accepted this outcome. Israel has time and again invited them to negotiate a resolution--just one that involves Israel's continued existence as a Jewish state, something that the Palestinian Authority has over and over refused to acknowledge or accept.  Therein lies the bottom line for Israeli security. The pre-1967 lines proved indefensible. So rather than, as the Obama administration, treat them as some sort of gold standard, Israel's security interest has deemed them intolerable and any resolution to this issue should not be dictated by the United States or the United Nations but rather should be negotiated and decided upon directly by the sovereign nation of Israel and by the  Secondly, the resolution falsely claims that Israel's sovereignty over the eastern part of Jerusalem and areas that it controls after the Six-Day War, including Judea and Samaria, are supposedly ``occupied Palestinian territory''. This is nothing short of absurd. What that means is that, under the terms of the United Nations resolution that the Obama administration acquiesced to--indeed, there are considerable reports that the Obama administration, President Obama, and John Kerry actively encouraged and facilitated it--the Jewish Quarter, the Old City of Jerusalem, is illegal and illegitimate and not justifiably a part of Under the terms of that resolution, the location of holy sites for the Jewish people, including the most important holy site, the Temple Mount, is illegal and illegitimate to be a part of Under the terms of the resolution, the Western Wall, where Jews from all over the world go to pray, is deemed ``occupied Palestinian territory,'' illegal and illegitimate.  It is more than a little ironic that President Obama went to the Western Wall to place a yarmulke there, pretending to show respect to Israel, and yet his administration, in an outgoing act of contempt, declares the Western Wall not part of the nation of  This couldn't be further from the truth. It was also an affront to Jews around the world that the resolution was adopted on the eve of For 8 days, Jews lit candles all over the world to remember the miracle that happened there, and to commemorate the heroic battle fought by the Maccabees that liberated Jerusalem and restored their right to worship freely and the rededication of the Temple in How ironic it is that on the eve of a celebration liberating Jerusalem and rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem, the Obama administration and the United Nations would declare that Jerusalem and the Temple are not legitimately part of Israel.[[Page S96]]  How disgraceful--the United States should be not be facilitating the adoption of a resolution that at its core attempts to distort and rewrite recent history as well as the historical connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel that goes back thousands of years.  Third, the resolution will also help fuel the Palestinian diplomatic, economic, and legal warfare campaign against Israel, particularly because of its provision that calls on states to make a distinction in their dealings with Israel between pre-1967 Israel and Israel beyond the 1967 lines, encouraging boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against Israel and potentially leading to Israelis and Americans being brought in front of the International Criminal  Palestinian leaders are already promising to use this resolution to push the International Criminal Court to launch a formal investigation against  That was not an unintended consequence of this action. That was precisely the intent of the United Nations and the Obama administration--to facilitate assaults on the nation of  Yet even after this disgraceful United Nations resolution, it was clear that the administration was not yet done, with Secretary of State John Kerry delivering just days later a truly shameful speech attacking His speech, very much like Kerry's 2014 remarks likening Israel to an apartheid state, will only enflame rising anti-Semitism in It will encourage the mullahs, who hate Israel and hate America, and it will further facilitate ``lawfare,'' the growing assaults on Israel through transnational legal fora.  President Obama and John Kerry's actions were designed to secure a legacy, and in that, they have succeeded. History will record and the world will note that Barack Obama and John Kerry are relentless enemies of  Kerry's speech drew a stunning moral equivalence between our great friend and ally Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which is currently formed by a ``unity'' government with the vicious terrorists of  Secretary Kerry declared the Hamas regime and Gaza ``radical'' in the same way that he declared the duly elected Government of Israel ``extreme.'' That moral equivalence is false, and it is a lie.  The IDF, defending the people of Israel, protecting people, and keeping them safe, is not the same moral equivalent of terrorists who strap bombs to their bodies and seek to murder innocent women and children.  Kerry declared the vicious terrorism sponsored by Hamas equal to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and he equated Israel's celebration of its birth with the Palestinian description of this event as the ``disaster.''  Unlike Barack Obama and John Kerry, I do not consider the existence and creation of Israel to be a disaster, and the Government of the United States should not be suggesting such a thing.  Kerry's speech attempted to lay out a historic and seismic shift toward the delegitimization of our ally It is a sign of their radicalism and refusal to defend American interests that Obama and Kerry chose to attack the only inclusive democracy in the Middle East--a strong, steadfast ally of America--while simultaneously turning a blind eye to the Islamic terrorism that grows daily.  Unfortunately, President Obama still has 2 weeks left in his Presidency, and he may not yet be done betraying  Next week, on Sunday, January 15, France is convening a conference with 70 other nations designed to serve as an extension of the U.resolution and the Kerry speech--an all-out assault on I am deeply concerned that what is decided at this conference will be used to try to further impose parameters or even audaciously to recognize a so-called independent Palestinian state through another Security Council resolution. The Security Council is scheduled to meet on January 17--conveniently, 3 days before Obama and Kerry leave office.  Let me speak a moment to our friends and allies across the globe.  When the President of the United States, when the administration of the United States attempts to encourage you to support their positions in the United Nations, that can be highly persuasive. It has been an arena, a forum that Barack Obama has flourished in, even as he has shown condescension and contempt for the Congress of the United States and the people of the United  But to our friends and allies, let me remind you: The Obama administration is coming to an end on January 20. If you desire to continue being a friend to America, if you desire a continued close working relationship with America, then I call upon our allies: Do not join in attacking Israel on January 15 in France or on January 17 at the Security  The new administration--President-Elect Trump--has loudly condemned the U.resolution and the Obama administration's complicity in its passage.  I would encourage our friends and allies not even to attend the January 15 conference, or, if they do choose to attend, to oppose and stand up and speak out against any further attempts to attack or undermine or delegitimize America or  I want to commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for offering resolutions to repudiate this administration for their actions of the last few weeks. It says something when you see Republicans and Democrats in Congress coming together, united to say: This action by the Obama administration is beyond the pale.  Let me underscore again to our friends and allies, to our Ambassadors, to heads of state, to friendships and relationships that we value so much: Listen to the bipartisan consensus of Congress, and do not go along with the bitter, clinging radicalism of the Obama administration, attempting to lash out and strike out at Israel with their last breath in office.  As commendable as these resolutions are, I believe the Senate and the Congress need to go further--that we need to take concrete steps so that there will be repercussions and consequences for the United Nations and the Palestinians for their behavior. That is why I am working with my colleague Senator Lindsey Graham on introducing legislation, along with other Members of this body, designed to cut the funding to the United Nations--designed to cut U.taxpayer funding going to the U.N.--unless and until they repeal this disgraceful anti-Israel resolution.  We know, previously, that one way to get the U.N.'s attention is to cut off their money. We know from the failure of other U.organizations to recognize so-called Palestine as a member-state after American tax dollars were withheld from UNESCO for doing so in 2011 that the U.over and over values its pocketbook over its leftist values.  However unintentionally, President Obama's misguided foreign policy has led to an unprecedented rapprochement between Israel and America's Arab allies, such as Egypt, Jordan, and the We have also seen hopeful signs of shifting positions at the United Nations, as countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Italy, and Australia have recently signaled that they may no longer vote reflexively in favor of the  Great Britain, although it voted for the resolution, has recently demonstrated an unprecedented degree of support for the Jewish state.  These changes represent a significant opportunity for the United States to bolster one of our most important allies, an opportunity we can preserve for the President-elect by not letting Mr.Obama squander it on the way out the door.  America should be leading the charge at the United Nations and around the world to rally burgeoning support for Israel, not trying to stab the Jewish state in the back.  Just over a week ago, I spoke with Israeli Prime Minister I told the Prime Minister that, despite the disgraceful actions of the United Nations, America stands resolutely with the nation of Israel, that the American people stand with Israel, and that I believe there is a very real possibility that the extreme and radical actions of Obama and Kerry will, in fact, backfire.  It is not accidental that they waited until after the election to do this. They could have tried to do that this summer, but Obama and Kerry knew well that the American people do not support their attempting to attack So they waited until after the election.[[Page S97]]They waited until they were on their way out the door.  Kerry, in his speech, said Israel cannot be both democratic and Jewish--one or the other, but not both.  This is an inanity that is deemed profound only in Marxist faculty lounges.  Israel is Jewish, it is democratic, and it is and should remain both. I believe that by revealing just how extreme they are, by removing the fake mask of support for Israel that Obama and Kerry have chosen to do in the last several weeks, it will help to galvanize support in this body and across the world for our friend and ally, the nation of  Israel is not only our friend and ally, but it is a partner of the United That alliance benefits the vital national security interest of Israel's military benefits the national security of the United States of The Israeli intelligence services benefit the United States of Israel's steadfastness against radical Islamic terrorism, which has declared war on both Israel and America, benefits the national security interests of this country.  It is Israel--the thriving, one and only Jewish state--that stands on the frontlines for America and, more broadly, Western civilization against the global threats we face. Our commitment to Israel must be restored and strengthened. I look forward to taking action with my colleagues--I hope on both sides of the aisle--in the near future to repudiate Obama's shameful attack on Israel, to repudiate the United Nations' efforts to undermine Israel, and to reaffirm America's strong and unshakable friendship and support for the nation of  I yield the floor.

Last April, it also won the top award in The Big Tap: 2016 Historic Bars Tournament Championship, an online contest sponsored by the National Trust for Historic  Unfortunately, Club Moderne was destroyed in a fire in October, a tragic loss to the Anaconda community.

Just this week, I was thrilled to hear the Hekkels announce plans to rebuild the bar and restore this historic establishment.  This is a true Montana story. Montanans pull themselves up by their bootstraps, even in times of hardship or loss.  I invite fellow Montanans to stop by to try whatever's on tap or a Moscow Mule, which is an Anaconda specialty.  The Hekkels, through Club Moderne, have welcomed those just passing through our State and native Montanans alike for generations. As small business owners, they have brought their community together. I wish them all my best as they restore Club Moderne and renew it as a bright spot in the Anaconda community.

Unfortunately, the resolution that passed the Security Council resolution without our veto was exactly that. It was one-sided.  The resolution contained no fewer than five provisions on Israeli settlement activity. It calls the Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem illegal, and it characterizes Jews praying at the Western Wall as being in flagrant violation of international law.  But even if you choose to accept every provision on settlement activity, the resolution included only one very general statement about violence. The U.N., which is historically biased against Israel, could not even condemn Palestinian terrorism against Israel as an obstacle to peace. It is, and the U.must acknowledge it. That is not balanced. It is one-sided.

922,topic-id,282,"Mr.Speaker, this House contains many friends of Israel, Republican and Indeed, as long as I've been here, I have never found an enemy of Israel in this Certainly that friendship was very apparent when only a few weeks ago President Obama approved giving Israel $38 billion of American tax money in military assistance. But like the Knesset in Jerusalem, we sometimes do disagree about what the best way is to ensure peace and security, and lively debate is important to that.  Unfortunately, this rule is about stifling Knesset-style debate. It restricts and denies any amendment and any alternative. This strict limitation on debate and this surprise presentation of today's measure with no public hearing and little warning show how fearful our Republican colleagues are of a legitimate discussion of this troubling issue. This is a horrible way to make critical foreign policy. It is only a step above doing it by tweets, which seems to be the approach of the day.

It favors going it alone with the current Israeli Government in defiance of our other allies and the 14 countries that unanimously voted for this Security Council measure.[[Page H120]]  Isolation--more and more isolation--is not the way to protect Those who demonstrate their friendship with Israel by following Mr.Netanyahu on one right turn after another are boxing in America and He is moving us further and further to the extremes so that we eventually go off a cliff into chaos.

Mr.Speaker, for what may or may not be their good intentions, this resolution and its authors undermined the security of families here and in This ``go it alone'' approach with the current Israeli Government--defying a unanimous vote of 14 countries and ignoring the concerns of many of our allies--is not a path to peace. We will not protect ourselves or our allies in Israel if we pursue the path of isolation.  For decades, we have enjoyed a bipartisan commitment to two states living in peace and security next door to one another. It has been a difficult goal to achieve, but now is not the time to give up on it. There are, sadly, some in Israel and some among the Palestinians who wholly reject this commitment. They believe it is all theirs. They believe in a divine entitlement to every piece of land west of the Jordan Their idea of a reasonable negotiation is that the other side gets next to nothing.

1500,topic-id,883,"Madam President, I rise today in support of the amendment Senator Hirono and I are offering to protect Medicare and Medicaid for the millions of Americans who currently count on these programs for health coverage.  This week, some of our colleagues are beginning the process of repealing the health care law. I want to be clear. I don't think it is a perfect law. In fact, I have long agreed with many of my colleagues in saying it has work to do, and for years we put forward ideas on ways we can work together to improve it.  The repeal strategy we are debating this week, however, is not about improving the health care system. It is about taking people's health care away. And make no mistake, the consequences are very real. A repeal strategy, particularly with no alternative, would throw our health care system into chaos, taking away coverage from nearly 30 million people, increasing premiums on working Hoosiers and families across this country, and threatening to take us back to a time where anyone with a preexisting condition could not get coverage.  It doesn't have to be this way. If we are serious about improving health care in this country, we can do this work together. That is what the American people expect. Just as Hoosiers go to work every day to make life better for their families, they expect us to come to work and do the same thing. At the very least, they expect us to do no harm. Doctors swear by the Hippocratic Oath, where they pledge first and foremost to do no harm when they are treating patients. We should appreciate this. We should approach this debate in the same manner. Do no harm. That is the basis of the Hirono-Donnelly amendment.  ``Do no harm'' means not cutting Medicare benefits or turning it into a voucher program. ``Do no harm'' means protecting the health care of those who use the Medicaid program, many of whom have health care for the first time.  Here is what we know: Repealing the health care law reduces Medicare's insolvency by 5 years to 2021. We know that some in Congress, including the nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, are intent on privatizing Medicare or turning it into a voucher program, ending the program as we know it.  The Hirono-Donnelly amendment makes it clear that we will not privatize The amendment protects Medicare both for the seniors who count on the program to age in dignity and for the tens of millions of Americans who are contributing to the program with the expectation that it will be there when they retire.  ``Do no harm'' also means we will protect insurance coverage for those who get their care through the Medicaid program, which, after the passage of the health care law, enabled millions of our friends and our neighbors to access affordable coverage for the first time in their lives. I know this is true because I worked with and supported our soon-to-be Vice President, Mike Pence, when he used ObamaCare to establish a program we call the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP 2.0. The innovative plan expanded health care coverage to over 200,000 of my neighbors in our beloved State and helped reduce the uninsured rate among Hoosiers by 30 percent. The HIP 2.0 program has been critical in our ongoing effort to provide treatment to those struggling with opioid abuse and heroin use in our Don't just take my word for it. In his farewell address as Governor to Hoosiers yesterday, Mr.Pence said:       Our innovative Healthy Indiana Plan is a national model of      how to provide affordable health care coverage to our most      vulnerable citizens. . . . With HIP 2.0, we have also made      great strides expanding treatment for those who struggled in      the grip of drug addiction.  I agree with the Vice President-elect that HIP 2.0 is something we can be very proud of because it helps Hoosier families across our State every single day. And it was done by working together, Republicans and Democrats, using the health care law to provide access to our friends and neighbors who wouldn't be able to obtain insurance otherwise. That is a great result.  The repeal plan before us today takes all of this away, including the very program that Vice President-Elect Pence and I worked to put in place. The amendment Senator Hirono and I put forth is simple. It says to seniors and to people participating in HIP 2.0 and Medicaid plans across the country: We will do no harm.  I am happy to work with anyone to strengthen the health care law, but we are not going to take away the health care people have come to rely on. I urge my colleagues to support the Hirono-Donnelly amendment. Instead of going forward with a plan that creates chaos by repealing the health care law with no alternative, we should work together to improve it. That is just common sense. Most of all, we should strive to do no harm. That should be our guiding principle in the My colleagues on both sides of the aisle can demonstrate their commitment to this principle by supporting our amendment.  I yield the floor.

394,topic-id,2208,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Texas, and I think the closing remarks were spot-on. We will disagree, we will debate, and we will have our differences, but we need to strive for common ground. That is what the American people sent us here to do. I hope we can find the common ground in this Chamber and in the House and with the new President after January 20. It is a challenge.  It is interesting to listen to the remarks from the Republican side of the aisle. There has been this appetite for so long to repeal I have lost track of how many times the Republican House of Representatives voted to repeal ObamaCare over the last 6 years. I believe it is over 60 times that they have voted to repeal it. Wouldn't you think that over a span of 6 years, with 60 different votes, they would have in their back pocket an alternative, a replacement? They don't. They still don't today.  For all of the speeches on the floor that have been given by my illustrious colleagues asking for a second opinion, most second opinions are something tangible that you can read, understand. But when it comes to a second opinion on ObamaCare, they have nothing to offer. Why is that? Why is it that they are so focused on this one issue--ObamaCare--and the Republicans have not come up with an alternative? It is hard. It is hard work. There are tough, difficult choices.  If we stick to the basic principles of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, we run into some problems in a hurry. The first basic principle accepted by President-Elect Trump is that we want to make sure that no health insurance company can ever discriminate against you or your family because of a preexisting condition--a baby born with cancer, a child with diabetes, a spouse who survives a cancer scare. In the old days before ObamaCare, that meant that you either were disqualified from insurance for your family or you couldn't afford it. So we said as part of the Affordable Care Act: No more--they cannot discriminate against those who are less than perfect when it comes to health because so many of us are less than perfect. OK, my friends in the Grand Old Party, how are you going to deal with that? How are we going to make sure that every family is protected with their health insurance plan? We haven't heard a word.  President-Elect Trump said he is going to stick by that basic principle. But there comes with that principle a requirement as well--that you have a large pool of insured people that includes those who are healthy and those who may be less than healthy. If we are going to have a large pool of people, we must make insurance mandatory for many The Republicans have said they want to eliminate that requirement automatically. So the first issue is the preexisting condition. This is a Republican problem--an issue they can't answer and one that they have refused to respond to.  What about lifetime limits on health insurance policies? What if there is a policy that you buy for $100,000 and then you get a cancer diagnosis and the treatment is going to cost $1 million? What then? We say that there cannot be a lifetime limit on a health insurance policy. The Republicans want to repeal that. What would they replace that with? There is no suggestion.  The list goes on and on. What if you have a child who just graduated from college who is looking for a job or maybe has a part-time job that doesn't have benefits and doesn't have health insurance? We keep them under the family health insurance plan until they are 26, which gives peace of mind to thousands of families across Illinois and The Republicans want to repeal that. What will they replace that with?  I say to those who are receiving Medicare today--40-plus million in America: We closed the prescription drug loophole that stated they had to start paying out of pocket for prescriptions during the course of the year--the so-called doughnut hole. Republicans want to repeal that. Will that make Illinois's seniors and millions of seniors across the country vulnerable to higher prices? When you get beyond the 144 characters of a tweet, get beyond a sign on the Senate floor, and when you get beyond the facile political speech and get into real policy, it gets exceedingly difficult.  The bottom line is that 29 million Americans now have health insurance because of the Affordable Care We have the lowest rate of uninsured Americans in modern history, and now the Republicans want to repeal this. They say they are going to replace it. I think it is not repeal and replace they are looking for. It is repeal and retreat. They don't know where to turn. They are running away from the mess they will create by repealing We have a right to demand that if they have a better way, they present it and bring it up for a vote. Let's have some certainty about our future.  Already I have been warned by hospitals all across Illinois that repealing ObamaCare--repealing the Affordable Care Act--will be devastating to hospitals, particularly in rural areas in my State and to inner city hospitals. What are we going to do about that? Will there be special funds to help those hospitals stay in business? They will need it.  It isn't the only issue we will take up. There is another issue equally compelling, and that is the issue of immigration. I remember the speeches, and you do too--the excerpts at night on the news--that the President-elect talked about building a wall to the high heavens and making the Mexicans pay for it, and he talked about all those who are coming across the border and the dangers they presented to When it comes to immigration, there are 11 million people living in this country. The overwhelming majority of them are law-abiding. They are working. They want to be part of America's future.  The group I have tried to focus on is a group we call the Fifteen years ago, I introduced the first[[Page S12]]DREAM It was a bill that addressed the following situation: A child or an infant, brought to the United States by an undocumented family, who grew up here, literally has no home, no country. They are undocumented in America and brought here as babies, infants, toddlers, children, teenagers. Now they are graduating high school, and they don't know where to turn. The law in America is graphic, and it is grim. It says that if someone is found in that position, they are required to leave America for 10 years and must petition to return. We have 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds who know no other country, who get up in the classroom every morning and pledge allegiance to the flag, just as the Members of the Senate do, and who believe in their heart of hearts that this is home. Yet they are undocumented.  So we introduced the DREAM Act, and we couldn't pass it. We passed it once in the Senate, and they passed it in the But we never could quite reach that super majority that we needed to pass it at the right moment. So President Obama stepped up and created DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which, under Executive order, allowed those who would be eligible for the DREAM Act to apply, pay a fee of almost $500, go through a criminal background check, and, if they were approved, receive temporary authority to stay in the United States without fear of deportation and to work in this country. As of today, over 750,000 have done that.  During the campaign, President-Elect Trump said that he would abolish this program. Fortunately, after the election, he had a more moderate position, which I would like to quote from Time magazine. He said:       We're going to work something out that's going to make      people happy and proud. They got brought here at a very young      age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here. Some      were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in      never-never land because they don't know what is going to      happen.  That is a very thoughtful, sensitive, and promising statement. I appreciate it. I hope the President-elect will keep DACA in place until we have something that can work to succeed it.  I want to salute my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Republican Lindsey Graham of South He and I have joined in introducing the BRIDGE Act, which would give President-Elect Trump an opportunity to allow these young people to stay subject to the same approval, the same criminal background check, the same filing fee, and the same tax liability to stay on a temporary basis until we do our work in the Senate and the House on the issue of immigration. The BRIDGE Act is also cosponsored by Senators Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake, Republicans from Alaska and Arizona, as well as by my colleague Senator Schumer, the leader on the Democratic side, and Senator Dianne Other Democrats want to join as well. We hope to have a very strong bipartisan bill.  In my view, DACA is a lawful exercise of the In the view of many Republicans, it is not. The BRIDGE Act is the answer to both points of view. This is a fair, reasonable way to protect these young people until Congress comes up with better, more comprehensive answers when it comes to immigration reform.  Over the years, I have come to the floor, telling the story of the It is one thing for a Senator to give a speech and put it in the Congressional Record, but it really doesn't come home until you see and meet the young people I am talking about.  Let me introduce one today. This is Fernando He was brought to the United States from Mexico at the age of 18 months. He grew up in the city of Milwaukee, WI, and became an excellent student. At his Catholic high school, he received many academic awards. He was a member of the National Honor Society and the Jesuit Honor Society, and he received first honors all 4 years of high school.  Fernando was involved in many volunteer activities--the Latin club, math club, track and field team, and he was an instructor for a class preparing his classmates to take college entrance exams. He volunteered with the Youth Leadership He also volunteered with his school's Key Club and Big Brother mentoring program and as a middle school soccer and basketball coach.  At his high school graduation, Fernando Espino of Milwaukee, WI--a DREAMer brought here from Mexico at the age of 18 months--received the Jesuit Secondary Education Association Award, the highest award given by a Jesuit high school, which is presented to one graduate who, in their words, is ``intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving, and committed to justice.''  This amazing student was then accepted at Harvard He continued to give back to the community there. He volunteered as a tutor for kids in elementary schools and as a peer adviser to freshmen students at He became a competitive ballroom dancer and worked on the Harvard Business School newspaper.  Thanks to DACA, the program I mentioned earlier, Fernando was able to support himself. You see, these DREAMers don't qualify for a penny of Federal assistance for education. They have to pay for it. They have to come up with the money.  With DACA, he could work. He worked as a bartender. In May 2015 he graduated from Harvard magna cum laude, the highest honors, with a degree in economics and sociology. He worked for an investment management firm in Los Angeles and then as a market research consultant in He is now preparing to pursue an MBA in business school. He wants to be a leader in a major corporation and start his own company. In a letter he sent to me, he wrote:       Optimistic hope, is ultimately, what I believe makes this      country so great. Living as an undocumented immigrant, it is      easy to lose that motivating influence. DACA was a refreshing      and reinvigorating influx of that very same hope. DACA now      allows me to look forward not with doubt but with confidence      that the future is bright!  If DACA is eliminated, Fernando Espino may lose his hope. The day after DACA, Fernando Espino will no longer have official legal status. He will not be able to get his master's in business administration, and at any moment he could be deported back to Mexico, where he hasn't lived since he was 18 months old.  Fernando and so many other DREAMers can help America be a greater nation. That talent and determination he brought to his young life is a talent and determination America needs in its future. I hope President-Elect Trump will understand this and continue the DACA Program, but if he decides to end it, then his administration can work with Congress and make sure the BRIDGE Act is there as a protection.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgS11.txt,326,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,3.0,January

620,topic-id,3342,"Mr.President, we are discussing the budget resolution. It is an interesting time to do it in the month ofThe fiscal year, the spending year for the Federal Government, starts October 1. We have tried, with no success, topass appropriations bills--12 of them--that would meet our obligation to fund the government for the entire fiscal year. We havehad two continuing resolutions, which are temporary spending bills. And here we are again discussing a budget resolution.  But it isn't really about the budget; it is about the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare, a law passed 6 years ago withthe goal of providing affordable health insurance for all I voted for that bill. It is one of the most importantbills I have ever voted for, and I believe that, despite shortcomings, it has achieved its goal and it has done it in a way thatmost American families would agree they want to see.  As an example, there are very few families in America who have every member of the family in perfect health. In the old daysbefore the Affordable Care Act, if you happened to have a child who had survived a cancer situation, a spouse with diabetes, andyou went to buy a health insurance plan, you ran into a problem: They might not want to insure your family because of that sickchild, or they might want to charge you a premium way beyond your reach. So in the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, we said: As ahealth insurance company, you cannot sell insurance in America and discriminate against a family or person because of apreexisting medical condition.  From where I am sitting, my own personal life experience and my family's experience, thank goodness. We had members of ourfamily with serious health issues. I worried about that all the time as a husband, as a father. The Affordable Care Act gave meand every other American the peace of mind that health insurance companies could not discriminate against us or our familiesbecause of a preexisting condition.  There was also a practice where they would put a limit on how much coverage you could buy in a health insurance policy. Somany people thought: I have a great health insurance policy. It has a $100,000 limit. I will never hit that number; I am ahealthy person.  The next accident, the next diagnosis, and that healthy person realized that $100,000 in today's world of health carecosts--you could eat that up in a minute and find yourself without any health insurance protection. What happens to you next?  You have been diagnosed with cancer. You start treatment. It is expensive, and now your health insurance policy has reacheda point where it doesn't cover you anymore. What then are your options? Stop treatment? Exhaust your savings? Throw yourself onthe mercy of a hospital and hope for the best?  We ended that. ObamaCare ended that. They can no longer put limits on health insurance policies because none of us--not oneof us--knows what kind of health crisis we might face or a member of our family might face tomorrow. That is important.  A third provision in ObamaCare, which most families would understand in a hurry, involved what to do with that recentcollege graduate. What are you going to do with that daughter whose graduation you are so proud to go to, and then it dawns onyou that she doesn't have a full-time job yet and that the part-time job she has doesn't have any health insurance benefits.  I remember calling my daughter and saying to her: Jennifer, I know you had health insurance as a student. What is yoursituation now?  Oh, Dad, I am fine. I am healthy. I am not worried.  I am worried, as a father, something is going to happen to her and she will have no health insurance protection.  Do you know what ObamaCare did? ObamaCare said I could keep my daughter under my family health insurance plan until shereached the age of 26. Peace of mind for 2, 3, 4 years while that son or daughter is starting their professional life, theirlife of employment. For thousands in Illinois and across the United States, more peace of mind that health insurance would bethere when your family really needed it.  We also said we don't think you ought to discriminate against people when you sell them health insurance just because, forexample, you happen to be a woman. Yes, the health insurance premiums charged women were higher than those for men. Obviously,women can have challenges in their lives but so can men. We said you cannot discriminate in health insurance premiums underObamaCare between men and women.  These are issues that affect the real world--what people pay for insurance, whether they qualify for insurance, and whetherinsurance will be there when you need it. That is what ObamaCare did. By providing helping hands to those in lower and middle-income categories, we extended the reach of health insurance under ObamaCare to cover 20 to 30 million more Wecurrently have the highest percentage of Americans with health insurance in modern history.  We had another provision too. We said: If you happen to be a senior citizen under Medicare and you are paying for yourprescription drugs, that can be expensive. Under the old law, before ObamaCare, there was a gap in coverage, and you might spend$1,000 or $2,000 out of your savings account each year just to keep taking your meds. We closed the gap so you had continuouscoverage under Medicare as a senior.  Important? You bet it is. A lot of seniors ended up retired with limited savings wanting their meds, their prescriptions, sothey can remain strong and independent as long as possible. Don't we want them to? So that, in a brief summary, will containfour or five of the main features of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act--more Americans with the guarantee of health insurancethan any time in our modern history in the United States of  How important is it to have health insurance? If you have ever been the father of a very sick child and you didn't havehealth insurance, it is a life experience you will never forget. I know. I lived through it. At that time, I thought, if I don'tdo anything else the rest of my life, I am always going to have health insurance, and I did. At some sacrifice to my wife andme, but we made sure we had it because for a period of time when we had no health insurance, I felt like I had let my familydown and I let my daughter down. I didn't want it to happen again.  I don't want anybody else to go through that. We want to make sure health insurance is there for all of us. Some people say:If you are rich, you ought to get it, but if you are not, tough luck.  I don't think so. I think health care and health insurance protection should be a basic right in this great Nation ofThat was the driving force behind passing ObamaCare, passing the Affordable Care  The Republicans hate the Affordable Care Act like the devil hates holy water. They despise it. Over 60 times they voted torepeal it in the House of It drives them into a rage. The first thing they say is, we can't wait to get a newPresident and abolish  The obvious responsible question to them is, And what happens the day after you abolish it? What happens when it comes topreexisting conditions? Can health insurance companies now discriminate against people again? What happens when it comes to thelimits on how much a health insurance policy would pay? Are we going to be back in the day when there isn't enough coverage whenyou and your family desperately need it?  What happens to those kids fresh out of college if they can't get on your family health insurance plan? Do you want to goout and buy an individual policy for that son or daughter who is still looking for a job? How about the seniors? Are they goingto go back to the time where they have to pay out of pocket for their prescription drugs? I think those are all legitimatequestions.  Do you know what the answer is on the Republican side? Trust us. We are just going to abolish this program, and someday, nottoday and not soon, but someday we will come up with another[[Page S42]]idea. That is irresponsible. They are replacing affordablecare with chaos. They are saying to the American people: Just trust us. Someday we will dream up a plan.  You know what, they have had 6 years to come up with a plan, 6 years to come up with an alternative to the Affordable They have been unable to do it. It is difficult. It is painful.  You know what is ironic, the Affordable Care Act is based on a Republican model of health insurance. This was what theRepublicans suggested years ago: Use private insurance companies and make it available to all That is what we did. Alot of Democrats felt there was a better way: Why don't we make a Medicare Program for every American a nonprofit program thatis there. We couldn't get it done. We didn't have the votes, and the Republicans wouldn't help us.  In the first step of the new year and the new Congress, the new Republican majority in the Senate wants to abolish theAffordable Care Act, wants to put millions of American families at the mercy of health insurance companies. They must think weare suffering from amnesia and that we had forgotten what that was all about--sitting on the phone for hour after weary hour withsome adjuster who may or may not be in the United States, trying to argue about whether your son or daughter can go into ahospital, whether your wife can receive the medical treatment the doctor asked about.  That is what it used to be, and that is what it is going to go back to when we abolish the Affordable Care Act and don'treplace it with something that is as good or better. That is the first step in the Republican program, make 20 to 30 millionAmericans more vulnerable when it comes to their health care. That is not the end of it.  I live in a State that has the great city of Chicago, Cook County regional area, but downstate we are very rural, smalltownI know from my congressional experience and from my life as a Senator representing that State, there are downstatehospitals that cannot survive without the Affordable Care In my State, some of those hospitals are the major employers intheir communities and the only go-to place for someone seriously ill or injured.  The Republicans have yet to suggest any suggestion at all about how we are going to keep those hospitals open. They arestarting to contact me now--the hospitals as well as the clinics and the health care providers, and they are asking: TheRepublicans really aren't going to do this, are they? They are not just going to abolish it and leave us with this chaos tofollow.  Sad to say, that is exactly what they are going to do. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky wrote an article today and said hethought it was wrong on the Republican side to do that. He said: The responsible thing to do is to have an alternative beforeyou abolish the Affordable Care Good for him. That is common sense. You would expect it from a party that says it isconservative in its approach to government. What they are suggesting with the Affordable Care Act is not conservative. It isdestructive. It is catastrophic. It is irresponsible.  I hope my colleagues will join me. We need two or three Republicans to join us to stop this effort. Let us sit downtogether, Democrats and Republicans, take the Affordable Care Act and make it more effective, fix the problems that are part ofit--and there are some--make sure we keep our promise to the American people that they will have access to affordable, qualityhealth care. Keep these providers covered by the Affordable Care Act in business in rural areas and inner cities and all acrossour That is our responsibility.                                  DACA  Mr.President, 16 days from now, and just a few steps from where the Senate Chamber is located, we will have an inaugurationfor the 45th President of the United States, Donald On that day, the fate of more than 750,000 young people in Americawill be hanging in the balance. They will be waiting to learn whether they have a place in our Nation's future or whether theywill be asked to leave.  It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President Obama, joined by Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of On abipartisan basis, we asked the President to stop the deportation of young immigrants who grew up in this country. We called themDREAMers, after a bill I introduced 15 years ago. Who are they? Babies, infants, toddlers, children, young adults under the ageof 16 brought to America by their parents from another country, and the proper papers were not filed. You can't hold the kidsresponsible. They didn't decide to come here. You certainly can't hold them responsible for not filing the papers. They werejust children at the time.  If anybody should be held responsible, it is the parents. What do we do about the kids who have lived their entire lives inthe United States believing this was their country, this was their future, and now come to realize in their teenage years theyare undocumented and their future is uncertain?  We asked President Obama: Will you give these young people a temporary opportunity to stay, study, and work in America, andhe agreed to do it. It was called It was the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals What it said was, if you arein that category of a child brought to America and you are undocumented, step forward, pay a filing fee of almost $500 so thegovernment can process your application, submit yourself to a criminal background check, including fingerprints, and let us lookinto your background and see if there is anything you have done that would disqualify you from staying in the United Ifyou are approved, for 2 years--renewable--you will not be deported and you can work in  Many young people in that circumstance were reluctant to step forward. Their parents had warned them their entire lives thatif they turned themselves into the government, they might be deported--in fact, their family might be deported with them. Theysaid: The President has offered us this opportunity for a chance. We are going to follow this, do the right thing, make anapplication. Almost 800,000 of them qualified. They are DACA recipients. Others will be eligible in the months ahead. DACA hasbeen a success.  What will President Donald Trump do with these DACA students? He made some pretty harsh statements during the course of thecampaign about immigration. I think he is reflecting on these kids as a special category. This is what President-Elect DonaldTrump said to TIME magazine just a few weeks ago about the DREAMers, the DACA recipients.       We'regoing to work something out that's going to make      people happy and proud. They got brought here at a very young      age, they'veworked here, they've gone to school here. Some      were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in      never-never landbecause they don't know what's going to      happen.  I appreciate Mr.Trump's comments, soon-to-be President I hope he will keep the DACA Program in place, but I amworking with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to give him an option. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of SouthCarolina, and I have joined the lead sponsors on what we call the BRIDGE The BRIDGE Act is an opportunity to protect theseyoung people legally, on a temporary basis, while Congress rolls up its sleeves and takes up immigration.  I am happy to have Senator Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake, Republicans from Alaska and Arizona as cosponsors, aswell as Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York, and I hope others will follow. I believe DACAwas a lawful exercise of the President's authority. Some disagree with that completely. Regardless of whether you agree ordisagree, I hope you will agree that these young people should be allowed to have a bridge so they aren't deported, they don'tlose their right to work or go to school.  Incidentally, when these young DACA DREAMers go to school, they have to pay for it right out of their pockets. They don'tqualify for any Federal assistance. It is a special effort and a special sacrifice. I have come to the floor over 100 times overthe last 10 or so years to tell the stories of these young people. I think the stories tell a lot morethan any speech I could give.  This young man is Luis Forgive me for being especially drawn to this photo because Luis is standing in front of mycollege, Georgetown[[Page S43]]University, wearing one of the Georgetown Hoyas shirts.  Let me tell you about He was 8 years old when his family came to the United States from He had a difficultchildhood in Santa Ana, His parents separated. He lived with his mom in a car garage for several years. After hismom remarried, he lived with his stepfather, who turned out to be abusive.  Luis overcame these circumstances and still was a good student. He graduated high school in the top 1 percent of his classwith a 4.69 GPA, and he passed all nine advanced placement exams that he took. He was involved in extracurricular and volunteeractivities. He was the secretary of the school's National Honor Society, and he helped organize an anti-bullying campaign in hislocal elementary school. He was a mentor to incoming freshmen in high school. Saturdays, instead of taking it easy, hevolunteered to tutor other kids in math, and he volunteered to help a teacher at a local school. He was active in his churchevery Sunday, translated the pastor's sermon into English for those who didn't speak Spanish, and cleaned up the church beforeand after the Sunday services.  Because of his outstanding record in high school, Luis was admitted to Georgetown He is currently a sophomoremajoring in American studies and minoring in government. He continues to use his spare time to help others. He is a member ofthe provost committee for diversity and co-chair of Hoya Saxa Weekend, a program that brings students from underrepresentedcommunities to Luis is a leader of Strive for College, a program that mentors students in the inner city highschools. His dream is to be a high school teacher, which isn't surprising given the strong commitment he has already shown.  He wrote me a letter and here's what he said:       DACA gave me the confidence and security I've nothad      before. I lived in fear and the shadows. Thanks to DACA,      however, I've been able to do things I otherwise wouldn't be      ableto do like travel through an airport or working on      campus. I've always felt that I am an American, but having      DACA allowed me tostop living in constant fear and      uncertainty. Now these fears have come back again.  If DACA is eliminated, Luis could be forced back into the shadows. The day after DACA, Luis will not be able to travel orwork on a campus. He will lose his legal status, and he could be deported back to Mexico, a country that he hasn't lived insince he was 8 years old.  Luis and other DREAMers have a lot to give Would we be stronger if we deport him, take this man's talent, drive,and energy and banish him from this country? I don't think so.  I hope President-Elect Trump will understand this and will continue the DACA program. If he decides to end DACA, then I hopethis administration will work with Congress to pass the BRIDGE Act into law for Luis and for thousands of others who will becounting on it.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1197,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, the pending business in the U.Senate is to set the stage procedurally so the Republican majority of 52 to 48 can repeal ObamaCare, the Affordable Care That is what we are about. That is the business of the day, the week, and probably the weeks to come. So we are addressing that issue and others related to the budget.  I would like to start by sharing a story that was told to me by a family who I represent, Richard and Mary Laidman, who live in Naperville, They told me a story, and I will recount it to you.       My 13-year-old son Sam was diagnosed with leukemia one day      after the ``no pre-existing conditions exclusions for      children''[[Page S76]]     protection went into effect [under the Affordable Care Act.]      The good news is that the form of leukemia has, so far, been      effectively controlled by a magic-bullet drug. My son is      currently a very robust young man and in otherwise good      health (while the drug keeps him alive). The bad news is that      the drug, as I understand it, costs [Blue Cross Blue Shield]      about $10,000 a MONTH! Without even going into the issue of      ``Big Pharma'' pricing--  They wrote--     this means that it would take about $6 million to get my son      into his 60's. Obviously we are feeling dependent on all the      clauses of the [Affordable Care Act] right now--no pre-     existing conditions exclusions, no caps on benefits, allowing      Sam to stay on our health insurance plan till [he reaches]      age 26.  Mr.President, the bottom line according to the Laidman family of Naperville, IL, is that the Affordable Care Act is critical to their family's health and financial survival. That is what this debate is about. It is not about talking about promises made in campaigns or slogans one way or the other. It is about families like the Laidman family in Naperville who understand that were it not for the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, their son might not be here today or they may be penniless.  That is what it was like in the old days. If you had a son with leukemia and wanted to buy a family health insurance plan, good luck. If they would sell it to you, you probably couldn't afford it. And secondly, many policies had limits on how much they would pay. Listen to what she tells us: $10,000 a month just for this drug that keeps her son alive. There were policies that had $100,000 limits on the amount they pay each year. Oh, they were affordable and cheap enough. What would the Laidman family have done if that is all they had to turn to?  Sadly, we know thousands, perhaps millions, of families across America face that. That is why the Affordable Care Act made a difference. That is why it is inconceivable that the Republicans are coming to the floor, saying they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act without any replacement.  They have had 6 years to come up with a better idea, 6 years to come up with a list of improvements, and they have failed and failed miserably. Why? Because it is hard. It is difficult. We found that when we wrote this law.  Let me concede a point to the Republican leader who was on the floor this morning. I am ready to sit down. I think other Democrats are as well. If you want to change and improve the Affordable Care Act to make sure that American families like the Laidmans of Naperville have a chance for these protections in a better situation, I want to be part of it, and I have wanted to be part of it for 6 years. But the Republican approach has been very simple: All we will propose is repeal. We will not come up with an alternative.  It is catching up with them this week in Have you noticed? Senators on the Republican side of the aisle and even some House Republicans are saying publicly: You know, we really ought to have a replacement.  It is not fair for us to say to America: We're going to repeal the only protection you have. Trust us. Some day in the future we might come up with a better plan.  The atmospherics have changed--maybe even changed with the President-elect. Remember a few weeks ago when he said he thought that provision about the preexisting conditions was a good idea? Well, he is right, and so is the provision to make sure you don't have limits under the policy, the provision that allows the Laidmans to keep their son under their family health insurance plan until he reaches the age of 26.

1518,topic-id,2033,"Mr.President, there was debate on the Senate floor that went on for years. It was a personal thing, a personal issue with two Senators--one was a Republican, the other a The Republican was Senator Pete Domenici of New The Democrat was Senator Paul Wellstone of The two of them had teamed up with a very simple goal in mind. They wanted to make sure every health insurance policy in America covered mental illness.  When you think about the fact that so many Americans suffer from some form of depression and that mental illness is something that so many families--at some point or another--face, you wonder: Well, why didn't the health insurance policies cover mental illness? The reason, of course, was that it takes some extended, and oftentimes expensive, care to help those with mental illness. In other cases, there was an argument made that you will not find a cure.  Things have changed a lot in the world of mental illness over the last few decades and changed for the better. There are new medications that are available and some even better ones on the way. There is new treatment available and more hope for people. Pete Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico, and Paul Wellstone, a Democrat from Minnesota, did not give up. They insisted on it, and they won.  They won with the requirement that health insurance policies cover not just mental illness and treatment but also substance abuse treatment. I will be honest with you. I followed that debate closely. I did not pay that much attention, at the time, to the substance abuse treatment part of their effort. Now I have. I think many people across America have. There was a supplement in the Chicago Sun Times this morning, published by USA It is entitled ``Obamacare repeal jeopardizes mental health, addiction coverage.''  I tore it out of the paper on the airplane to bring it to the floor of the Senate because this a good day for us to reflect on what this article has to say. We are now in the midst of the budget resolution effort that is designed by the Republican majority to repeal  The Republicans hate They hate it almost as much as the devil hates holy water. They have tried for 6 years to repeal it with a singular focus. I don't know how many times they voted in the House--some said over 60 times--to repeal it. They have said that for so many years, and we have said to them: What will you do after you repeal it? They said: Well, we have a plan. For 6 years, they have said: We have a plan to replace it.  We have never seen it. No one has ever seen it. It raises the question about whether they do have a plan. They certainly have a plan to repeal it, but when it comes to replacing it, they don't offer anything--but they are going to go ahead with it. They are bent on doing this regardless of the outcome. For a lot of people across America, this could be devastating. This article talks about a family in Kentucky, the home State of the Republican leader. Melissa Fleckinger of Edgewood, She had to pay for heroin treatment for her daughter Amanda before the Affordable Care Her son Brian's treatment for heroin addiction was covered by the ACA, but unfortunately he died of an overdose in 2015.  This article goes on to talk about what it means to have children who are addicted to drugs and parents who are desperately trying to find treatment. Some of the things that are said in the course of this are really worrisome because this article spells out what happens to families without health insurance that covers substance abuse treatment. They become helpless, unable to take care of their kids.  The Republicans have come back and said: Well, we will just do a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Listen to what this articles says:  Almost any route taken on Capitol Hill leads to an unraveling of addiction and mental health coverage for those people. Even the partial ACA repeal Congress is considering would eliminate the tax credits that reduce the premiums for about 85 percent of the people who buy insurance on the exchanges. Most of those who get the tax credits pay less than $100 a month for health insurance and have very low out-of-pocket costs that make it possible for them to afford coverage.  What they go on to say here is that putting a requirement in the health insurance policy that it cover mental health illness and substance abuse treatment means nothing if the people cannot afford to pay the premiums for the health insurance policy. So the Republican plan that would eliminate the tax credits families need to be able to afford the policy means there is no way they are going to get coverage for themselves and their kids.  Who is going to be affected by that? I will tell you what I found in What I found in Illinois is that the current opioid and heroin epidemic is everywhere. There is no town too small, and there is no suburb too wealthy to avoid it--story after story of teenagers and young people addicted who have no place to turn.  If the Republicans have their way in the Senate and the House, they will close the door for many of these young people. I see my colleague from the State of New I was stunned to read--I don't know if it is still the case, but I was stunned to read several months ago that when you look at the average number of deaths from opioids[[Page S139]]and heroin across the Nation--and Illinois is, I am not making any excuses here, we are average--the rate of death for heroin-opioid overdoses in West Virginia is twice the national average, and the rate in New Hampshire is three times the national average.  Listen to what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean in New I might say to the Senator from New Hampshire that she is quoted in this article.       Repealing the ACA would cause [in New Hampshire] nearly      120,000 people to lose coverage in the State, where federal      data show a nearly 200% increase in overdose deaths in the      past five years. More than 48,000 Medicaid claims were for      substance use disorder in 2015, making an ACA repeal [in the      words of Senator Shaheen] ``literally a matter of life and      death.''       At the Cincinnati Center for Addiction Treatment, CEO      Sandra Kuehn said about 30% of Kuehn's patients are covered      for treatment because of the expansion [under ACA]. Overdose      deaths in Ohio climbed from 2,531 in 2014 to 3,050 in 2015,      up more than 20 percent.        The home State of the Republican Senate leader.       Overdose deaths here totaled 1,248 in 2015, up 17% from the      previous year. Fentanyl--which is much stronger than heroin--     was involved in 420 fatal overdoses in 2015, up nearly 250%      over the previous year.  The lady who was quoted earlier who lost her son to the overdose was not surprised. She knows several other people who have overdosed and many others who have died, including one last week.        I am proud to represent it.       Up to 30% of the 9,000 inmates in the Cook County Jail have      a diagnosed mental illness. . . . ``The ACA has been a game      changer for those who were in and out of Cook County Jail,''      says Mark Ishaug, CEO of Thresholds, a Chicago treatment      provider. It costs less than $20,000 a year for Threshold's      highest level of community-based mental-health care with a      housing voucher. . . .  So $20,000 a year or less than that. Do you know what it costs to incarcerate that same person? It costs $70,000 a year to incarcerate them. About one-third of the patients being treated by Thresholds are covered by the Affordable Care What is the alternative, I say to my Republican friends. They can't wait to repeal this, but they don't have an alternative.  Meanwhile, in Illinois, in New Hampshire, in Maine, and every State in the Nation, mental illness is still a challenge, and substance abuse is on the rise and people are dying from heroin and opioid overdoses. This is the height of irresponsibility, to repeal this measure with no replacement. It is sad to say we have reached this point where a political score has to be settled now that the Republicans are in control of the House and the  Now that they have an incoming President, the Republicans finally get their day. Someone said to me: Why is public sentiment starting to change on this issue and even among Republican politicians? I said: They have been saying irresponsible things for a long time, but now people are taking them seriously. As they take them seriously, they realize what a devastating impact it is going to have.  Nicholas Kristof wrote in the New York Times last week:       If the Republicans ran a home renovation business, they      would start tearing down your roof this month and promise to      return in 2019 with some options for a new one--if you      survived.  Last week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky wrote an op-ed arguing that repeal should not be done without simultaneously being replaced. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, has said that repealing the law without replacing it is ``a flawed concept'' and that having a replacement ready first would be a more ``prudent approach'' in the Republican Senator's words.  Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has said she would like to see ``detailed framework'' accompanying any repeal.  Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said: ``I don't think we can just repeal ObamaCare and say we are going to get the answer 2 years from now.''  Over and over again, these Republican Senators are realizing how totally irresponsible it would be if we go forward with this proposal. I will tell you what troubles me as a representative of a State that has the great city of Chicago and a wonderful metropolitan area. I come from the other end of the State, the rural part of our I wonder what is going to happen to our rural hospitals if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. I think about Franklin Hospital in Benton, IL, population, 7,300. The hospital has been there 60 years. In the past 15 years, it has been teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. It all changed 6 years ago with the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of our Medicaid Program in  Because of those changes, Franklin Hospital found they could survive. Expanding Medicaid cut Franklin Hospital's uncompensated care in half. In Franklin's emergency room, they saw 600 fewer no-pay patients and 428 more Medicaid patients compared to the previous year. This, combined with increases in Medicaid funding, allowed Franklin Hospital to invest in much needed improvements and to consider bringing nuclear medicine and a retail pharmacy to Benton, What does that mean in that city? Well, it means all the difference in the world. There is something else that has to be said. If that hospital--Franklin Hospital in Benton--closes, it will not just mean a longer drive for critical health care, it is going to mean job losses. It will mean the loss of 4,300 jobs in the 12th congressional district, where Franklin Hospital is located.  So when the President-elect talks about saving 6 or 800 jobs at Carrier Corporation, good; I am glad. But then for his party to turn around and pass a measure which could kill 84,000 to 95,000 jobs in Illinois, that is a move in the wrong direction. I say to my Republican friends, go home and talk to the people you represent. Listen to what they have to say about what we are doing--addiction, mental illness, and rural hospitals that are on the brink of closing, if you have your way politically. This is no victory for the people of America to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement that is as good or better.  I yield the floor.

1532,topic-id,623,"Mr.President, I come to reflect on the 1-year anniversary of rain and winter storms that swept across the State of Illinois, causing widespread flooding and devastation.  In the midst of the holidays, heavy rainfall of over 7 inches a day in some areas caused water levels on rivers in Illinois to reach record, or near record, heights. The Mississippi River at Thebes reached its highest crest level on record at 47.7 feet.  Flooding forced many communities to evacuate their homes for their own safety. Damages to property in these Illinois communities totaled more than $15 million.  Sadly, these storms were so severe that flooded roadways tragically claimed the lives of 10 people whose vehicles were swept away by flooding.  Alexander and Randolph counties were two areas most impacted by this flood. I went to visit two towns in these areas--Olive Branch, IL, and Evansville, IL--and I saw miles of flood damage to agricultural lands, homes, and businesses. What I saw was heartbreaking.  I spoke with residents who were concerned about being able to recover from the flood and resulting damages and who were concerned about what could happen if levees overtop and breach again in the future.  People like Bruce Ford, from Olive Branch, IL, worked day and night to clean out debris and move equipment back into their businesses, but he worried about how long he would be out of business and whether or not he would be able to rebuild in the event of another disaster. And he is not alone--many residents in these communities worry that they will not have the means to fix properties and businesses all over again.  The Governor declared 23 counties State disaster areas, and State and local emergency responders were dispatched to affected areas. I supported his request for a Federal disaster declaration for 21 counties in the  The State disaster declaration allowed people in affected communities whose homes and businesses were damaged to start repairs and receive the help they needed.  And I want to say thanks for the hard work and dedication of James Joseph, head of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency; he was there when his constituents and communities needed him the most.  The State provided over 997,000 sandbags, over 4,000 tons of sand, and 117 Illinois Department of Transportation trucks for flood mitigation and response efforts.  The Small Business Administration also made loans available to homeowners and businesses in Christian, Iroquois, Ford, Kankakee, Macon, Montgomery, Sangamon, Shelby, and Vermilion  I want to acknowledge the dedication of the State and Federal employees who pitched in at every level, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to the Illinois Emergency Management  Finally, I can't overstate how proud I am of the volunteers, National Guard members, and local law enforcement agencies who came forward to keep our communities safe. Before flooding began, local law enforcement and emergency responders went door-to-door to advise residents to evacuate and move to higher ground, saving the lives of many who heeded the call and sought out shelter with family and friends before the flooding began.  There is still work to be done, but the people who live and work in the damaged communities have made incredible progress rebuilding. Thousands of volunteers have helped with the cleanup. People from all over the State pitched in to help their neighbors and even strangers get back on their feet. Hearing these kinds of stories make me proud to be from  Our thoughts remain with the many people who lost their loved ones, their homes, and other property last year.  I want to thank everyone who has been engaged in the rescue and cleanup.  We are rebuilding--as Illinoisans always do--and we will be stronger for it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS151-2.txt,326,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,9.0,January
1881,topic-id,617,"Mr.President, today, Senate Democrats will be voting to protect three programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social These programs represent core commitments our Nation has made to seniors, low-income Americans, children, and those living with disabilities.  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid reflect who we are as At one time or another throughout our lives, most of us have or will count on these programs for health care or for financial stability.  During last year's Presidential debate, President-Elect Trump sought to distinguish himself from the field of Republican candidates by stating he was the first and only Republican candidate who would promise not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Yet, in their first major action of the new Congress, Republicans have taken the first step to dramatically alter and decimate core programs that comprise our safety net. Congressional Republicans want to gut funding, limit benefits, constrict eligibility, and turn guaranteed earned benefits into a voucher and a ``good luck'' wish. Their approach would violate the pledge we have made to millions of Americans and truly disrupt lives. This is unacceptable. That is why I am cosponsoring Senator Sanders' amendment to prohibit the Senate from considering any legislation that would violate Donald Trump's promise of not cutting Medicare, Medicaid, or Social  I am committed to ensuring that we meet the promise we made to Sixty million Americans, including 2 million Illinoisans, depend on Social Security for their well-being, and we must make sure that this vital program is there for both current and future generations.  By 2034, without any reform, Social Security will be unable to fulfill its promise to its beneficiaries. If Congress does not act, beneficiaries would immediately see their benefits reduced by one-fifth.  It remains Congress's responsibility to look to the future and protect the long-term solvency of Social Security while ensuring benefits meet the needs of beneficiaries, especially the most vulnerable among us.  Waiting until tomorrow to do what we could do today--an approach that I have seen fail in Illinois--only makes the task more difficult and likely to cause disruption.  I was a member of the Simpson-Bowles Commission, where we tried to address our budget challenges and the long-term solvency of Social I voted for the Commission's report because I believe we must face the difficult reality that doing nothing may harm the very people we are trying to protect--beneficiaries that rely on the promises we have made. I firmly believe that we, as Members of Congress, have a duty to have these debates and make difficult decisions, not just wait for the inevitable.  While I did not support everything in the final Commission's report, I believe the report included some commonsense options to improve the longterm solvency of Social Security: accelerating the alignment of payroll taxes to their intended level of 90 percent of wages and realigning benefits to reflect current poverty levels among seniors.  I believe there can and should be evenhanded, bipartisan agreement on a path forward. To do so, we need a collaborative and good-faith partnership to examine the universe of policy options.  Make no mistake--I oppose privatization of Social And recent solvency changes have weighed heavily on beneficiaries. That is why conversations should be balanced and targeted. There must be a dual goal of ensuring the adequacy of benefits, especially for those who rely on Social Security the most, and the long-term solvency of this program.

1903,topic-id,470,"Mr.President, on December 28, 2016, President Obama designated the Bears Ears National Monument in Southern Utah, and I wish to commend him on protecting these important lands. This designation is an important step forward in the conservation of some of southern Utah's important national treasures.  The 1.35-million acre monument, which spans from forested mesas to redrock canyons and plateaus, will protect the region's abundant cultural resources, including well-preserved cliff dwellings, rock and art panels, artifacts, and Native American burials.  The Bears Ears National Monument, which derives its name from twin buttes that lie at the heart of the majestic Cedar Mesa, was requested by a coalition of five Native American tribes that united to protect a landscape revered in their shared histories and cultures. The Hopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, the Pueblo of Zuni, and the Ute Indian Tribe have all passed through the area at some time, leaving behind scores of fragile dwellings, pottery, petroglyphs, and pictographs. The Bears Ears region is a living natural and cultural landscape, where the people of these tribes still use the lands to collect herbs and medicines and pass their stories to the next generation.  I have fought to protect this area's resources through the America's Red Rock Wilderness Act, a bill I have introduced every Congress since 1997. My bill would safeguard 9.2 million acres of wilderness in Utah--some of the last great wild places in the lower 48  Historically, national monuments have been the first step in protecting some of our most beloved public lands--the Grand Canyon, the Grand Tetons, and indeed, four of Utah's five national parks. Not only do these monuments help preserve precious habitat, landscapes, and history, they create jobs and invigorate nearby communities.  President Obama's decision to protect the Bears Ears came after significant public input in Utah, with the administration holding multiple listening sessions. Those sessions made clear that even diverse stakeholders agreed the Bears Ears is special and needs to be protected. It is the right decision for the present, and it is the right decision for the future.  Republican President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law in 1906, and a review of its history and its controversy showed that, time and again, the temporary anger over designated lands was overshadowed by the long-term benefits to our Teddy Roosevelt said it best, ``Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.''

1014,topic-id,771,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, and I thank the Speaker for his words.  I want to start by thanking Chairman Ed Royce, who authored this resolution. I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor and glad to say that more than 30 Democrats representing a[[Page H148]]broad cross-section of our party have signed on as cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation.  Ed Royce and I have worked together for the past 4 years, and we believe that foreign policy should be bipartisan and that partisanship should stop at the water's edge. Frankly, this is what we are doing today. We are condemning what happened because we think it is unfair and unjust.  I want to also mention that I join with my friend from North Carolina (Mr.Price) in authoring an amendment to this resolution that wasn't accepted which emphasizes a two-state solution. I want to thank Mr.Price for his hard work on that approach, and I support it. We talk in this resolution about a two-state solution as well.  Mr.Speaker, throughout its entire history, the State of Israel has never gotten a fair shake from the United Year after year after year, member states manipulate the U.to bully our ally, Israel, to pile on with one-sided resolutions, placing all of the blame for the ongoing conflict on  We saw a resolution like this come before the Security Council a few weeks ago, and today the House of Representative will go on record saying that that U.resolution is wrong, plain and simple. And frankly, we should not have voted for that.  The Security Council resolution is highly critical of Israel yet asks nothing directly of the That is biased, that is unfair, and that is not balanced. Again, we should have opposed it. We should have vetoed it.  The language about Jerusalem is not new but it remains deeply offensive to Jews, whose holiest site lies on the Temple Mount in East The Kotel, the Holy Western Wall, is simply nonoccupied territory. And it is offensive to hear that.  So in the measure the House is considering today, we repudiate this flawed Security Council resolution. And at the same time, we will say once again that we support a two-state solution, that the only way to reach that goal is through direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and that this shameful Security Council resolution put that goal further out of reach.  Mr.Speaker, the international community faces the longest suppressing issues: mass killings in South Sudan, a crisis in Yemen, a humanitarian disaster in Syria, Russia's illegal occupation of the Ukraine, and North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Yet, rather than deal with those critical problems, the member states of the U.have chosen instead to use the international body to embarrass It is outrageous. This House Resolution that I am cosponsoring with Mr.Royce rightfully says that it is outrageous.  I think it was a mistake for the current administration to abstain on this vote in the U.I have been very clear about that, but I want to be fair. Before anyone turns this into another attack on President Obama, we should be aware of the history of this issue.  This is the first time in 8 years the Obama administration has allowed a resolution, opposed by Israel, to go forward. The George Bush administration allowed it to happen 6 times; the Clinton administration, 3 times; the first Bush administration, 6 times; and the Reagan administration, 10 times, including voting for one strongly condemning Israel for its ``premeditated and unprecedented attack of aggression'' when it wisely destroyed Iraq's nuclear weapons reactor in 1981.  But regardless of that history, it doesn't justify these latest abstentions. My mother used to say that two wrongs don't make a right. And she was right. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now.  I think allowing governments to bully Israel and the U.is a mistake, no matter who is in power. Instead, let's focus on what we should be doing when it comes to advancing the two-state solution.  This resolution calls for us to get back to the policy that many of us support: one, standing with Israel and the United Nations; two, stopping one-sided resolutions; and three, supporting direct negotiations as the only way to move toward a two-state solution.  This resolution says all that. Every one in this Congress should be voting for it because it is balanced. I am pleased to support this resolution, and I urge all Members to do the same.

The President's health law has pushed insurance markets to the brink of collapse. Premiums for hardworking families aresoaring, while patients' choices are dwindling. I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to face the facts thatObamaCare has failed to deliver on its core promises and is hurting far more than it is helping.  I know our colleagues on the other side of the aisle share our goal of a robust health care system for hardworking families,and I truly hope they will work with us to find common ground that delivers more choices and lowers costs. I welcome the inputfrom all the Nation's lawmakers as we endeavor to listen to the American people in this pursuit. But first, it is important toremember how we got here so that the actions that we will be taking this year are considered in proper context.  After the 2008 election, Democrats controlled the Presidency and had a majority in the House and a supermajority in theThis allowed Senate Democrats in 2009 to pass a health care plan without any Republican support, which is exactly whatthey did. House Democrats had initially approved a health care reform bill with several important differences. So congressionalDemocrats needed to address these concerns in a conference committee. But plans to iron out the differences between the Houseand Senate versions were derailed in early 2010, when Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority with the Massachusettsspecial election that resulted in placing Senator Scott Brown in the seat formerly held by the late Senator Ted He hadheld that seat since 1962.  With the filibuster-proof majority lost, Democrats in the House approved the Senate-passed health care bill without anyRepublican votes and sent it to the President, while vowing to use the budget reconciliation process to address theircolleagues' concerns with the Senate legislation.  Subsequent budget reconciliation legislation was passed by Democrats and signed into law by President Combined withthe initial health care bill, ObamaCare was created.  Now, I share this brief history of ObamaCare only as a reminder that, while my colleagues will surely complain about usingthe reconciliation process to untangle the country from this unworkable, unpopular, and unaffordable law, they should rememberthey actually employed the exact same procedure to secure the passage of  Recent headlines show the ObamaCare problem is only getting worse and discourages people from seeking so-called coverage.Last October, at Bloomberg's The Year Ahead Summit in New York, the CEO of Aetna discussed the issues surrounding their decisionnot to participate in ObamaCare exchanges, saying:       As the rates rise, the healthier people pull outbecause the      out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it. . . . Young people can      do the math. Gas for the car, beer on Fridays andSaturdays,      health insurance.  Now, if you are young and healthy, ObamaCare has made it an easy choice to opt out of health coverage. But if you are not sofortunate--for those who must have coverage--it quickly becomes a frightening reality. I have constituents in Wyoming who havewritten to me, with worry and concern about their surging health insurance premiums. I recently heard from a young woman who isexperiencing the worst of this law. She said:       Dear Senator Enzi,       I am writing with concernsspecifically in the way that our      country is heading in respect to healthcare services.       I am a 25 year old with no medicalconditions, I rarely need      a doctor visit, however as I looked into the health insurance      for me and my 8 month old son, alsowithout health problems, I      have found insurance to be incredibly expensive. Based on the      cost of our health care last year,which included a C-section      and the birth of our son, our family would spend less on      health care if we paid for medical expensesout of pocket and      did not have health insurance. However, in order to obey the      law this is not an option.       I have researchedand calculated the most cost effective      health care option for our family. We are looking at paying      almost $800 a month for ourinsurance, even with my husband      receiving insurance through work. This is almost 1/3 of our      family's monthly income. . . .Insurance is becoming a huge      burden for our family.  Now, that is the reality for many of our constituents across the country. She is trying to do the right thing for herfamily's health, but the law is crippling them financially. Our answer must beto not ignore these problems. For many Americans caught up in ObamaCare's tangled and expensive web of regulations, thesituation is grim and only getting worse by the day. It is time to act.  One of the most disturbing parts of this law is that Americans are now paying more in taxes to pay for the very health lawthat is driving up their insurance premiums. The law will saddle American households with $1 trillion--$1 trillion--in new taxesand penalties over the next 10 years, unless Congress acts. ObamaCare's crushing regulations mean smaller paychecks forfamilies, while holding back small businesses from expanding and hiring new workers. For every American, ObamaCare has meantmore government, more bureaucracy, and more rules and regulations, along with soaring health care costs--along with soaringhealth care costs.  It is time to lift the burdens and higher costs this law has placed on all The Senate is poised to pass a repealresolution that will set the stage for true legislative relief from ObamaCare that Americans have long demanded, while ensuringa stable transition in which those with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage.  Let me repeat that. The Senate is poised to pass a repeal resolution that will set the stage for true legislative relieffrom ObamaCare that Americans have long demanded, while ensuring a stable transition in which those with insurance will not loseaccess to health care coverage. This will allow us to move step-by-step on a new set of reforms, listening carefully to theadvice of the millions of Americans affected and to do our best to make sure that we proceed wisely and do no harm.  Fortunately, America now has a President committed to repealing ObamaCare and moving toward a system that offers morechoices, lower costs, and more individual control for millions of hardworking  The American people have endured a lot under ObamaCare and its broken promises. As a Presidential candidate not so long ago,then-Senator Barack Obama, a Democrat from Illinois serving here, promised Americans they could keep their health plan if theyliked it. Millions soon learned they couldn't, and others soon wouldn't. This is because ObamaCare has drastically reducedAmericans' choice of health care plans through a Federal takeover of the insurance marketplace. In fact, the President's promisethat ``if you like your plan, you can keep it'' has proven to be one of many unfulfilled and unattainable promises of  In Wyoming, we have seen the real impact of ObamaCare on our health insurance market. Wyoming now only has one healthinsurer in the individual market, both on and off the ObamaCare exchange. Many States are experiencing a similar issue of havinginsurers leaving the exchanges entirely. So for Wyomingites, the Obama administration's talking points about ``choice'' were inthe end just more empty promises.[[Page S33]]  Americans were also promised lower health care costs, but even the administration admits that ObamaCare is failing toaddress costs, with average premiums rising by 25 percent for silver-level plans on the Federal exchange. That is in 1 year.This means that families have to decide whether to purchase unaffordable insurance or to pay a fine. In most cases, they areliterally paying more money for less control over their health care.  Health care costs in Wyoming continue to be among the highest in the Nation, with other States not far behind. ObamaCare'smandates and taxes on employer-sponsored health plans are not only leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses but also to fewerchoices and fewer services for the 150 million Americans with employer-sponsored health benefits. Let me repeat that: Themandates and taxes on employer-sponsored health plans are not only leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses but to fewer choicesand services for the 150 million Americans with employer-sponsored health benefits.  According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, individual employees who have job-based insurance have seen theirout-of-pocket expenses climb by hundreds of dollars year after year. Employees workingfor small businesses now have deductibles of over $1,800 on average. Since ObamaCare became law, several large employers havestopped offering benefits to part-time employees altogether.  Over the past 50 years, our Nation has made great strides in improving the quality of life for all Americans, but thesetransformative changes are always forged in the spirit of bipartisan compromise and cooperation. These qualities are essentialto the success and longevity of crucial programs such as Medicare and  This is a crucial time for health care in We do not have the luxury of ignoring the growing problems in the healthinsurance markets and the crushing premiums faced by families across our country. That is why we are doing this first. Thefailures of ObamaCare have metastasized since its passage.  We must act now to repeal ObamaCare and provide relief to the millions of Americans who have been harmed by this law. Reliefwill require a stable transition period, which ensures those with coverage today continue to have access to health caretomorrow. Unwinding this tangle of partisan gridlock to make meaningful changes will not be easy. Our goal is to create a healthcare system where Washington makes fewer decisions and families are empowered to control their own health care with more choicesand lower costs.  This is where we find ourselves today. Congress and soon the new President will be in a position to begin the process ofrepealing Passing this resolution is just the first step on a path to repair health care for millions of hard-workingAmericans whose experiences with ObamaCare have meant broken promises, higher costs, and fewer choices.  This is the budget resolution we are debating now. As far as the budget part of it, all this is, is a statement of where weare at the moment. This budget went into effect last It has been changed a few times in the meantime, and this is areflection of the changes that have been made up to this point.  The difference is in title II, which is where the reconciliation can take place. You will notice that it is a very simpletitle. There is not much to it. It requires that the Committee on Finance of the Senate shall report changes in laws within itsjurisdiction to reduce the deficit by not less than $1 billion for the period of fiscal years 2017 through 2026. The Committeeon Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will report changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce the deficit by not lessthan $1 billion for the period of fiscal years 2017 through 2026. There is no specificity in this as to how the reconciliationwill take place. That is up to the Finance Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on the Senate sideand the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Committee on Ways and Means on the House side to come up with the reconciliationbill, which has to pass a lot of Senate rules in order to be done, but you will notice that there isn't any specificity in hereon how to do that.  That comes later. That will be another budget debate we will have, but it sets the stage so that can be done. Hopefully, itwill be done quickly and we will be able to find solutions for the hard-working Americans whose experiences with ObamaCare arebroken promises, higher costs, fewer choices. I hope our Democratic colleagues will join us in this effort so that we can comeup with solutions so that Americans can afford the insurance they want and need.  I remember when we started this debate, I think there were 30 million people uninsured. Today, I think there are 30 millionpeople uninsured. It is a different 30 million, though: The 30 million who couldn't get insurance now have insurance, and 30million people who had insurance now can't afford their insurance. It is time for us to take care of both 30 millions and notjust one. We will have that opportunity if we pass this concurrent resolution to fix  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

1212,topic-id,1907,"Madam President, today I have been listening to the diatribes against the repeal resolution we are working on, and I think some things need to be answered.  The Republicans are not trying to throw 30 million people off of their insurance. What we have seen over the time of ObamaCare is that there were 30 million people who were uninsured when we started that debate, and today there are 30 million people who are uninsured. Now it is a different 30 million people. The 30 million people who couldn't get insurance have insurance, and we want them to have insurance. And the 30 million people who are now off insurance used to have insurance, but they can no longer afford it. There has been a huge increase in the cost of health care. That is not how it was supposed to be. The prices were supposed to come down.  Yesterday we took the first step in fulfilling the promise of repealing ObamaCare, which will pave the way for real health care reforms to strengthen the doctor-patient relationships, expand choices, lower health care costs, and improve access to quality, affordable, innovative health care.  As I discussed yesterday, while Republicans will start by repealing ObamaCare immediately, we will ensure a stable transition in which those with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage. This will allow us to move step by step to a new set of reforms, listening carefully to the advice of millions of Americans affected and making sure we proceed wisely, doing no harm.  There is a common misconception that some of my friends across the aisle have promoted. It is the idea that ObamaCare was a success and that repeal will be tearing down a functioning program. That is not true. ObamaCare has put our health insurance markets on the brink of collapse in many parts of the country. And what Republicans face now is an imperative to do something that the Democrats couldn't bring themselves to do when they had control, and that is to fix the problems they created.  ObamaCare became the epitome of a sacred cow for them, and any changes, as you can see, unless done by Executive action, were out of the question.  Interestingly, President Obama recently admitted in October 2016 at Miami Dade College that the law has real problems and that, in his words, ``There are going to be people who are hurt by premium increases or a lack of competition and choice.'' That is the President of the United States talking about In that same speech, he went on to call these issues ``growing pains.'' I think that is a troubling[[Page S87]]blind spot about this law that he and many of my Democratic colleagues share. Millions are facing impossibly high health insurance premiums for plans they may not even want to have. Costs are going up, and they can't afford it. Somehow these casualties of ObamaCare don't deserve relief, apparently; they are just written off as growing pains by the authors of the law.  My colleagues will recall ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, who was paid in a number of different ways, who was famously exposed in 2014 for stating, amongst other things, that while crafting this bill, he believed that ``the lack of transparency is a huge political advantage'' and that it ``was written in a tortured way to make sure the CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.'' Mr.Gruber may have succeeded in masking the consequences of ObamaCare to obtain passage, but there is no way to hide the results.  A recent poll by the Gallup organization showed that more Americans continue to disapprove--53 percent--than approve--42 percent--of the law and that a majority of Americans want to see the law changed. Let me highlight that point again. A majority of Americans want to see ObamaCare either changed or replaced altogether. In fact, since passage of ObamaCare in 2010, there has never been a majority of Americans supporting the law. A quick glance around the Nation quickly explains why. For more and more Americans, there is only a single insurer from which they can select health plans, a monopoly. In fact, on Federal exchanges, one in five consumers will only be able to select plans from a single insurer. Many residents across the country only have one choice of health insurer. That is including my home State of Wyoming as well as the entire State of  What does this lack of competition mean? Prices are surging for hard-working families who now have to choose between unreasonable insurance rates or an unreasonable fine. That doesn't even include the deductible problem we have. That doesn't even include the additional taxes and prices people are paying as a result of other things that are built into the law, which I will go into later--not in this speech.  The irony of a Democrat-led effort to help resulting in the creation of a lose-lose proposition for families ran true to voters in the most recent election when they voted for change. In Wyoming, some families would be forced to pay more than 30 percent of their total income on premiums to obtain health care coverage, which often includes deductibles of over $1,000. One family faced premiums of more than $1,600 per month. That is one family, $1,600 a month. As an alternative, their tax penalty for not carrying coverage was only $1,700 for the whole year. So guess what they did. They paid the fine because they couldn't afford the insurance premium. They could also see no way that they were going to be able to get a benefit from that.  For those lucky enough to be able to afford insurance, particularly in the individual market, under the new health law, premiums are expected to increase faster in 2017 than in previous years. Some States will see insurance premiums rise by as much as 53 percent. I think that makes it truly an emergency.  After discussing the why, it is important to talk about how we are going to do this. Passing the repeal resolution we are currently debating today will allow Republicans to use the budget reconciliation process to untangle the country from this unworkable, unpopular, and unaffordable law. This is the exact same procedure congressional Democrats and President Obama used to secure passage of portions of Let me say that again. This is the exact same procedure congressional Democrats and President Obama used to secure passage of portions of  After Congress passes this repeal resolution, it can then move forward on reconciliation legislation that will provide for the repeal of ObamaCare and pave the way for real health care reforms. I think Members are looking forward to an open and serious debate about the future of America's health and its health care system and the importance of restoring the trust of hard-working taxpayers. I think that is something both sides can agree on, and that is what will happen.  This resolution we are debating does two things. It recognizes the point in the budget we are at considering the points of order and things that happened up to this point in time. We are just recognizing that is where this budget is. It still keeps in place the points of order to maintain some control over our spending, but the significant part is the repeal part. That is where we institute the reconciliation, and all that is, is an instruction to two committees on the Senate side and two committees on the House side. The two on the Senate side were the Finance Committee--they are the ones who deal with all of the taxes and the finance and the Medicare and the Medicaid, and they need to save $1 billion over 10 years. That is peanuts around here. They will do much better than that, I am certain. And then the HELP Committee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--also has an instruction to save $1 billion. That is it.  This isn't a debate over what the changes are going to be to ObamaCare; this is a debate about whether we are going to give two committees, which have jurisdiction over this situation, the ability to consider it and bring us something. It has to conform with the budget requirements, and that is going to save some money. That is why we have a very low threshold, each of them saving $1 billion. That is the time when we will have the debate on what is happening with health care. If somebody wants to raise the threshold of the $1 billion for each of the two committees, that would be perhaps acceptable--unnecessary but perhaps acceptable. If somebody wants to change the budget, we are going to have an actual chance to change the budget right after we finish this process because there is a budget for 2018. We are already a third of the way through 2017, and there are no spending bills approved. That is wrong, but that is what this budget reflects. That is where we are at this point in time on our spending. Hopefully, we will do well on the new budget and come up with a plan that is going to pull the United States out of the hole that we are in on our deficit spending, which results in huge debt.  I would like to make that distinction. Deficit is our overspending. Debt is the amount that we owe that we have to pay interest on--like pouring money down a hole--and that interest rate is going up. We get to make decisions on about $1 trillion each year, and the interest rate right now spends $200 billion right now by itself--that is at about 1 percent. If it goes to 5 percent, which is the norm for the United States, that would be $1 trillion dollars. That is the amount we get to make decisions on. What shape will our country would be in if we have to spend $1 trillion dollars on interest and that is all we have to make decisions on?  We have to do something. Health care is affecting more people in this country than anything else. So we will start immediately. We normally have a recess that would begin from the time we reorganize until the time the President is sworn in, but Republicans recognize that this is an emergency. This is something that needs to be taken care of. So we are going to stay around and get it solved.  We are going to do the processes we have to do. This is the first of the processes. There is another more important step, which has to be the actual savings part in order to do the reconciliation, and we are going to do that.  We will hear all kinds of stories of ways that people have been helped by health care, and we will hear stories about how people have been hurt by this health care. We need to fix it for both of them.  So I think Members are looking forward to an open and serious debate--I hope, a serious debate--about the future of America's health care system and the importance of restoring the trust of the hardworking taxpayers. I hope that is something we can both agree on.  Thank you. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING Who yields time?  If no one yields time, time will be charged to both sides.

You placed that so well that there should not be much doubt about what we are going to try to do. You heard it from the chairman of the Health He is the one that will be in charge of the health aspects of this.  The Finance Committee is a part of the bill too. But they are in charge of the monetary part of this. But without the health care part, that does not work. I love the way you expressed that in the way of taking care of a collapsed bridge, because I think people across America do realize that the bridge on health care has collapsed and they want to know what we are going to do about it.  You stated that very well. That should relax a lot of people. It probably won't because of the process that we are in, but I certainly hope that it does. So I thank you for your words and your effort and know that it is in good hands as we lead it through this process.  All that this resolution we are doing right now does is set it up so that this can be done. This really does not change any health care at this point. It sets it up so that we can do reconciliation, so that we can repeal what we can, so we can replace what we can, and then we can set up that system of bridges that will get us to the point where all Americans who want insurance can have insurance, but more importantly, so that all Americans can get the health care they need and deserve.

1709,topic-id,631,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am really pleased to rise today in support of this legislation, the Energy Efficient Government Technology  I want to thank my colleague and friend, Mr.Olson, for his wonderful description of the bill and his important support of it. I want to thank the new chairman of the full committee, Mr.Walden, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr.Pallone, for their support, and my legislative partner, Adam Kinzinger, for his partnership on this bill.  I hope that this, the 115th Congress, is going to be the magic charm. I have introduced this bill now in three Congresses, and it passed in each Congress, but it didn't make it to the President's desk. I hope this time it will.  The bill is really a very simple one. It is about bringing the Federal Government's IT and data centers into the 21st century. The Federal Government is the Nation's largest energy user. I want to say that again. The Federal Government is our Nation's largest energy user, and we should lead by example in this area.  By requiring Federal agencies to utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies, this bill will reduce the government's energy use. Very importantly, it is going to save taxpayer dollars, and it is going to also set an example for the private sector.  Today, the world generates more data in 12 hours than was generated in all of human history prior to 2003.  I can tell by the look on your face, Mr.Speaker, that that takes your breath away.  This data must be stored and processed at data centers, which are the backbone of the 21st century economy, but can be highly energy inefficient. While we now routinely hear about data centers, this was not the case when I began examining this issue over a decade ago. In those days, I had to explain to my colleagues what a data center was.  In 2005, I offered language in the Energy Policy Act which mandated an EPA study on the energy use and energy costs of data centers. This report was then transmitted to Congress in 2007, and today most Americans understand that data centers are a critical part of our national infrastructure and are found in nearly every sector of our economy.  According to the GSA, the Federal Government, alone, has more than 2,000 data centers which store everything from Social Security and tax records to e-books at the Library of  Several Silicon Valley companies have taken the lead in developing efficient, sustainable data centers, but we can do much, much more across the private sector and the government.  The Department of Energy estimates that the 70 billion kilowatt hours of electricity that are used by U.data centers annually could be slashed in half simply through implementation of best practices and existing technologies.  This bill, H.306, will drive energy efficiency improvements across the government's IT and data centers by requiring Federal agencies to, number one, utilize the best technologies and energy management strategies; two, formulate specific goals and periodically review their energy efficiency--it[[Page H268]]is very important to track the efficiencies--and, three, make government center data energy usage statistics public in a way that empowers further innovation.  Importantly, the bill requires government agencies to formulate specific performance goals and a means to calculate overall cost savings from implementation.  Mr.Speaker, as I said, I first introduced the legislation in 2013. It has passed the House by wide margins in each of the last two It is noncontroversial. It is bipartisan. It makes sense. I want to urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.  I thank my colleagues on a bipartisan basis at the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1585,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to put people before politics. As we speak, the Senate is moving to strip millions of families of their healthcare coverage and replace it with, well, nothing.  Now, I know that some of my colleagues ran on a platform of repealing the Affordable Care Act, and now they feel boxed in by politics. But let's be very clear about this. The political stakes of repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement are nothing compared to the terrible human cost.  I would like to share with my colleagues the experience of Suzie Clayton, my constituent from North Canaan, ``The ACA had a huge, positive impact on my life,'' Suzie wrote to me last week. Because Suzie is a breast cancer survivor, a preexisting condition, it was nearly impossible for her to get decent healthcare coverage before the  ``All that we had put away in retirement funds, nearly $70,000, had to be tapped in order to cover our health costs,'' she wrote. If it weren't for the coverage she gained through the Affordable Care Act, she and her husband would have lost everything they had worked for, quite likely, including their home.  Instead, with the ACA, her family is once again saving for retirement, completing some overdue home repairs, and getting their medical needs taken care of at an affordable price. All of that will go away if this House follows through on its political crusade to wipe away the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.  Mr.Speaker, there are millions of Suzie Claytons in this country, millions of people who will lose their homes, lose their savings, and some will even lose their lives if this Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.  In my home State of Connecticut alone, 180,000 people who have gained coverage since the ACA was implemented stand to lose their health care. That includes 43,000 children.  Think about that for a moment. If Congress repeals the ACA and doesn't replace it with anything, 43,000 children just in my State will lose their health coverage. When those children get sick, too many of their parents will be faced with a heart-wrenching choice: bankrupt the family to pay for their child's medical care or go without the health services their child needs to get better. All of us here who are parents know that that isn't really a choice.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues who are beating the drum for wholesale elimination of the Affordable Care Act: How can you, in good conscience, take away the health care from 43,000 children in my State just to score a political point? How can you throw our healthcare system into chaos just because you are in a political jam?  Let's work together. Let's work together to improve our healthcare system. Let's forge a sensible, bipartisan approach to lower healthcare costs and ensure access to quality care for everyone.  The politics of ObamaCare, no matter how fraught and divisive, should not, must not take priority over the well-being of the American people that we are here to serve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH241.txt,2114,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 26, REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE",2017.0,10.0,January
1729,topic-id,571,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.321, the INSPIRE Women  This bill calls on the NASA administrator to support initiatives that encourage girls and young women to study STEM fields and pursue careers in aerospace. Unfortunately, women are woefully underrepresented in many STEM fields, including aeronautics and aerospace. One of the key barriers to women entering technical fields is self-selection out of STEM degrees due to a lack of role models.  In the words of longtime children's advocate and activist, Marian Wright Edelman: ``You can't be what you can't see.''  Too many girls and young women decide not to pursue studies in technical fields such as science, engineering, and aerospace because they look at their teachers and their role models and they see no one who looks like them.  When students are able to visualize themselves working in technical fields, they gain the confidence they need to take the first step in pursuit of a challenging and rewarding STEM career, to their benefit and to the benefit of society as a whole.  NASA, with its extraordinary STEM workforce, is in a unique position to help close this gap. The agency has access to a diverse group of current and retired women astronauts, scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and innovators whose accomplishments and career paths are just the sort of inspiration that girls and young women need.  Astronaut Kate Rubins broke barriers and boundaries when she became the first person to ever sequence DNA in space during her spaceflight last year.  Just last Friday, Peggy Whitson, the first female commander of the International Space Station, completed her seventh space walk.  Vera Rubin's recent passing reminded us of her trailblazing career in astronomy in which she made the groundbreaking discovery of dark matter.  As has already been mentioned by my friend and colleague, Barbara Comstock, the newly released movie, ``Hidden Figures,'' highlights through the pioneering story of early NASA mathematicians and engineers Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson that women have been instrumental to our aerospace enterprise since its inception.  NASA has developed a number of programs aimed at leveraging its inspirational workforce to encourage girls and young women to pursue STEM degrees and STEM careers. This includes the NASA GIRLS program, the Aspire 2 Inspire program, and the Summer Institute in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Research, or SISTER program.  H.321 instructs the NASA administrator to continue supporting these and other programs that encourage women and girls to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, as well as to pursue careers in aerospace.  Additionally, the bill calls on NASA to develop a plan for how it can best facilitate and support current and retired astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators to engage with K-12 female STEM students.  Although retired engineers, astronauts, scientists, and engineers are invaluable to inspiring the next generation of NASA scientists, I am especially glad and thankful to my colleague for including early career female astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators in this plan. It is very important for America's young girls to have experiences interacting with young women who look like them in the STEM fields.

I rise in support of H.255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship  Our bill encourages the National Science Foundation to use its successful entrepreneurial education and training programs, such as the Innovation Corps, known as I-Corps, and Partnerships for Innovation, to inspire, recruit, and support women scientists and engineers who are interested in turning their laboratory discoveries into commercial technologies.  Mr.Speaker, you may ask: Why is it that we need a bill like this? We have these programs. Doesn't everyone know that we need more women in the STEM fields?  The answer is twofold:  Number one, we have a workforce shortage. If you take the field of advanced manufacturing by itself, in New England, there are 16,000 positions that are open currently. We have people who are looking for work--many of them women. They don't have the skill sets to meet that open job need right now, and that is a need for America to fill those jobs; so, number one, we need our qualified workforce with appropriate skills to meet the jobs of today.  We also need to think about the jobs of tomorrow. We are a wonderfully diverse country. Over half of our workforce is made up of women and people of color--historically, chronically, still--underrepresented in the STEM fields. There are problems we aren't even addressing and solutions we haven't thought of if we don't have more women with these power tools of the STEM skills to address the challenges and opportunities that this country is facing; so it is both a moral and an economic imperative that we equip more young women, and that is what our bill aims to do here today.  I have heard time and time again in my district, in which we have a lot of small startup companies and major universities, about this challenge that we face of bridging that gap between the laboratory and what happens in the commercial workforce. Through my work, I have formed a STEM advisory council and have met with them for the last 2 years. Among these are the problems they identified: limited access to capital, a lack of women mentors in the STEM fields, unmanageable expectations for work-life balance, and unconscious biases against women in the sciences. These are among the sorts of issues for which the I-Corps and the Partnerships for Innovation have been designed--in order to help close that gap to deal with these issues.  I want to give you examples of two of the women in my district with whom I have met who are benefiting from these programs and why we need to have more of them and the kind of difference that they will make.[[Page H274]]  The first is Zengmin She is a student at the University of Connecticut, and she helped the Wei Laboratory secure a National Science Foundation I-Corps grant to commercialize her work on tissue engineer scaffolds, innovative work which is going to help with bone repair and regeneration. She attributes her success to her female adviser and mentor, Professor Mei Wei, who encouraged her as a young woman to carry out her path forward in the biotech world. She helped her make that transition from the lab and the classroom out into the commercial world. She was lucky that she had a mentor with the experience to help close this gap.  Claire Leonardi is the CEO of Health Esense, which is a digital health startup firm in Avon, She received seed grant funding and gained access to hands-on training workshops to learn how to market her technology to consumers. She is now equipped with the tools to take her discovery and bring it into market.  Both of these women scientists are examples of the kind of innovation, the kind of economic engine, and the problem solving we need all Americans to participate in. That is what is at stake. That is why we are proposing this. This is not simply about having a poster with a diverse group of scientists to hang on the wall at the Air and Space Museum and inspire young people. That is important, but it is also important to build on the good work we have already done with the National Science Foundation--to really provide that equipment, those tools, those mentors, the training, and to take those lab discoveries, the basic R&D, and commercialize it.

937,topic-id,441,"Mr.Chairman, our Founding Fathers intended for us to have a limited government. If they saw what we have today, they would be appalled. Our government has gotten huge. It is out of control, and an alphabet soup of government agencies and unelected bureaucrats are writing the laws. They call them regulations, but they have the effect of laws.  I am going to disagree with my friend and colleague from Tennessee, any power these agencies have to write regulations was delegated to We are pulling some of that power back, back to Congress, back to people elected by the people; in fact, to where the Founding Fathers put it in Article I of the  That is why I am here today, to support the REINS It says that if an agency enacts a regulation that has an economic impact of more than $100 million, that has to come back before Congress for a positive vote before it takes effect.  Now, quite frankly, because the Constitution vests all of the legislative power in Congress, I think every single regulation that one of these agencies does should have to come back before Congress, but the REINS Act is a great start.  Throughout President Obama's administration, a flood of regulations has put extreme pressure and burdens on American job creators and American families. Take, for example, the EPA's waters of the U.rule. It is a power grab by the EPA attempting to regulate any body of water on a private land basically that is any bigger than a bathtub. It goes way beyond what the Clean Water Act says they can do.  Using its new interpretation of WOTUS, the EPA has full authority to bully land-owning American citizens like Wyoming rancher Andy Johnson who got a permit from the State and local government to build a stock pond so his cattle could have something to drink. Well, guess what, the EPA said, nope. They came in after the fact and said: if you don't take that out, we are going to hit you with $37,500 a day in fines. Finally, after drawn-out litigation, the EPA was slapped back and Johnson's $16 million in fines was erased.  This is just one of the many examples of the huge power grab these Federal agencies are doing.  We need people who are elected and answerable to the American people writing the laws, not unelected bureaucrats.

657,topic-id,570,"Mr.President, I rise to introduce the Extending Justice for Sex Crime Victims Act, a bill to extend thetime for minors to seek justice against their perpetrators.  Sex crimes committed against children tragically remain a vile and dangerous reality in communities across this country.  Just this past summer, as the world tuned into the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the Indianapolis Star reported thatUSA Gymnastics had failed to report to law enforcement allegations of child sexual abuse committed by some of its coaches.  Due to these purported failures, athletes as young as 7 years old were reported to have been abused for years, without anyaction taken to prevent the abuse.  Since the initial Indianapolis Star report, more and more young gymnasts have come forward about their abuse.  All over the world, and all over this country, sex abuse victims are bravely coming forward to tell their stories of abusewhen they were children.  In my home state of California, numerous victims have contacted my office. They have shared the amount of courage andstrength it took to finally come forward with their experiences.  These stories represent an untold amount of pain and suffering. They also represent how difficult it is to come forwarduntil later, in adulthood.  It has been estimated that 90 percent of child sex crime victims never go to the authorities concerning their abuse.  To put this into context, studies indicate that at least one in four girls and about one in five boys is sexually abused. 90percent of those victims never go to the authorities.  A great number of victims don't ever disclose their abuse. If they do, they do not come forward until many years later,after reaching adulthood.  This bill extends the civil statute of limitations in two ways for minor victims of Federal sex crimes to seek justiceagainst their perpetrators.  For one, the bill extends the statute of limitations for minor victims until the age of 28, from age 21, for injuriesstemming from sex crimes such as sexual abuse and child pornography.  Second, for the two laws that provide civil remedies for sex abuse and sex trafficking victims, the bill clarifies that thestatute of limitations does not begin to run until after the victim actually discovers the injury or the violation.  This is significant because victims of sex crimes are sometimes abused even before they can remember the abuse, some asyoung as 3 years old. Some victims are unable to connect their abuse to the injurious symptoms they exhibit throughout theirlives.  The bill therefore clarifies that the limitations period begins when the victim first discovers the injury or the violation.  Through these provisions, the bill ensures that minor victims have an extended period to seek justice against theirperpetrators after discovering their injury or violation.  I want to thank Senator Cornyn again for working so closely with me on this issue. I also want to thank the cosponsorsto this bill: Senators Klobuchar, Inhofe, Franken, Flake, Gillibrand, Tillis, and  I also want to acknowledge the support for this bill from the National Center for Victims of Crime, Rape Abuse & IncestNational Network, the National Children's Advocacy Center, SGS for Healing, National Crime Victim Law Institute, NationalAssociation of VOCA Assistance Administrators, National Network to End Domestic Violence, Stop the Silence, PROTECT, theNational Association to Protect Children, Rights4Girls, End Rape on Campus, National Children's Alliance, Lauren's Kids,Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault, and Survivors Network of those Abused by                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS60-2.txt,1332,PROMOTING WOMEN IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT,2017.0,4.0,January

The original impetus for this bill was the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico in April of 2010, whichdemonstrated yet again the risks of offshore oil and gas extraction.  When the Deepwater Horizon well blew out, 11 people died and 17 others were injured. Oil and gas rushed into the Gulf ofMexico for 87 days.  Oil slicks spread across the Gulf of Mexico, tar balls spoiled the pristine white sand beaches of Florida, wetlands werecoated with toxic sludge, and more than one-third of federal waters in the Gulf were closed to fishing.  While Deepwater Horizon served as an important reminder, the dangers of offshore oil and gas were already too well known toIn 1969, the Santa Barbara oil spill leaked up to 100,000 barrels of oil, and remains the third largest oil spillin the country to this day.[[Page S62]]  Like the Deepwater Horizon, the Santa Barbara oil spill was caused by a natural gas blowout when pressure in the drill holefluctuated.  It took 11 days to plug the hole with mud and cement, but oil and gas continued to seep for months.  Using containment technologies still in place today, the cleanup effort relied on skimmers, detergent, and booms.  There has been no new drilling in waters controlled by the State of California since then, and there has been no newdrilling in Federal waters off the coast of California since 1981.  Appropriately, the most recent plan from the Department of the Interior for Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing willnot allow new leasing off the Pacific Coast of California, Oregon or Washington through 2022.  The fact is that those of us on the Pacific coast do not want any further offshore oil or gas development.  In 2012 California's 19 coastal counties generated $662 billion in wages and $1.7 trillion in This accounts for 80percent of the economic activity in the  California's Ocean economy, including tourism, recreation, and marine transportation, accounts for over 489,000 jobs.  Unlike other areas of the country, any potential fossil fuel resources off the coast of California are likely to be foundwithin only 50 miles of the coast, because of the narrow shelf off the California coast. This means that any potential drilling,and any potential spills, would be in direct conflict with the ocean environment and economy that my state enjoys.  Enacting a permanent ban on offshore drilling would protect our coast for generations to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS60-2.txt,1332,PROMOTING WOMEN IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT,2017.0,4.0,January
1174,topic-id,1560,"Mr.President, today I am proud to introduce the Desert Protection and Recreation Act of 2017.  This bill, a decade in the making, charts a commonsense path forward for the California desert. The goal is simple: to manage California's fragile desert resources in a sustainable and comprehensive manner.  This bill provides something for everyone that appreciates the national treasure that is the California desert. That this bill provides something for everyone is a result of the painstaking effort to build consensus among the array of groups that use the desert, including: environmental groups; Federal, State, and local governments; the off-road community; cattle ranchers; mining interests; and energy companies and California's public utility companies.  As I will further describe later, the bill preserves 230,000 acres of wilderness and another 44,000 acres of national park land, each unrivaled for their unique natural landscapes. The bill also safeguards 77 miles of free-flowing rivers and the abundant life and rich biodiversity these rivers and streams often support.  Importantly, the bill provides certainty to off-road enthusiasts, establishing 142,000 acres of permanent off-highway recreation areas--a first for the I made a commitment to off-roaders to enact the entire bill, not just parts of the bill. I hope to fulfill that promise.  The efforts to protect the desert are a long time coming. This effort first began with the original California Desert Protection Act, signed into law more than twenty years ago.  Picking up where my predecessors left off, I introduced that bill only three months after I was sworn in as a senator. Through hard work and perseverance, we were able to pass that law on the last day of the 103rd Congress, and President Clinton signed the bill into law in October 1994.  The original Desert Protection Act was a crowning achievement for desert conservation, establishing 69 new Wilderness areas, creating the Mojave National Preserve, and converting Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Monuments into National All told, we were able to protect, or increase protections for, about 9.6 million acres.  It continues to attract millions of tourists to southern California, which is a boon for the economy.  It has ensured that these enduring landscapes will be preserved for future generations.  Since we passed the 1994 desert conservation bill, we've tried to build on this legacy of conservation. After years of collaboration with an array of stakeholders, we introduced new legislation in 2009.  The goal of that bill was simple: to help manage California's desert resources through a comprehensive approach that balanced conservation, recreation, energy production, among other needs.  After years of work, including two hearings in the Senate, we reached a major milestone this past February, when President Obama designated three new national monuments in the California desert: Castle Mountains, Mojave Trails, and Sand to  Those monuments, based on the legislation I had introduced, created one of the world's largest desert reserves, encompassing nearly 1.8 million acres of America's public lands.  Those monuments connect vital wildlife corridors and habitats, preserve cultural resources, and establish an important buffer to the inevitable changes climate change will usher in for these fragile desert ecosystems.  While the newly-designated desert monuments formed a cornerstone for future desert protection, our work is not complete. That is why I am introducing this legislation today.  While I supported President Obama's decision to create three national monuments in the Mojave Desert, his authority under the Antiquities Act did not allow him to include the many other valuable provisions in the original legislation.  Our intention has always been to balance the many uses of the desert through legislation, and that remains the case today. That is why I reintroduced that legislation immediately following the President's designation, and that is why I am introducing a bill again today: to make the rest of the provisions a reality.  The legislation I am introducing today therefore includes all of the provisions the President was not able to enact through executive action under the Antiquities  These negotiated provisions--which represent our best attempt to achieve consensus among desert stakeholders--deserve to become law.  That legislation includes many additional conservation areas and provides permanent protection for five Off-Highway Recreation Areas covering approximately 142,000 acres. Off-roaders were a vital part of the coalition we put together, and unfortunately those lands could not be designated under executive action. Off-roaders deserve certainty about their future use of the land, just as there is now certainty for conservation purposes. I gave them my word that I would fight for them, and I intend to do so again in this new  This bill would also expand wilderness areas in the desert, by designating five additional wilderness areas that cover 230,000 acres of land near Fort  The bill would ensure clean and free-flowing rivers, through the designation of 77 miles of rivers as Wild and Scenic Rivers; add to our national parks, by expanding Death Valley National Park Wilderness by 39,000 acres and Joshua Tree National Park by 4,500 acres; expand National Scenic Areas, by adding[[Page S115]]18,610 acres to the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo County; and protect 81,000 acres of land in San Bernardino and Imperial County, and requires the Department of the Interior to protect petroglyphs and other cultural resources important to the surrounding tribes and communities.  Lastly, the bill will facilitate renewable energy development in a way that protects delicate habitat.  I want to highlight some of the key provisions of this legislation:  By designating five new wilderness areas, this bill protects fragile desert ecosystems across 230,000 acres of wilderness near Fort This includes 88,000 acres of Avawatz Mountains, 8,000-acre Great Falls Basin Wilderness, the 80,000-acre Soda Mountains Wilderness, and the 32,500-acre Death Valley  The desert's sweeping desert vistas and rugged mountain terrain not only provide for a truly remarkable backcountry experience, but also provide vital refuge for everything from bighorn sheep and desert tortoises to Joshua Trees and Native American artifacts.  This bill is more than just wilderness, however. It also designates four new Wild and Scenic Rivers, totaling 77 miles in length. These beautiful waterways, carved through the heart of the arid desert, are Deep Creek and the Whitewater River in and near the San Bernardino National Forest, as well as the Amargosa River and Surprise Canyon Creek near Death Valley National  The bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing wilderness study area designation in response to requests from local government and recreation users. This will allow the land to be made available for other purposes, including recreational off-highway vehicle use on designated routes.  We must also take into account another use of the desert land: renewable energy. I believe that we can honor our commitment to conservation while fulfilling California's pledge to develop a clean energy portfolio.  Balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we just need to come up with the right solutions. Thankfully, some of these compromises are already in place.  By April 2009, solar and wind companies had proposed 28 projects to be included in the Mojave Trails National Monument, including sites on former Catellus lands intended for permanent conservation. I visited some of those sites at the time, including one particularly beautiful area known as the Broadwell Valley, where thousands of acres of pristine lands were proposed for development. Seeing it first hand, I quickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the right place for renewable energy development.  Since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. This is due in part to the state and federal governments' efforts to develop and finalize the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan--an ambitious effort to comprehensively manage renewable energy, conservation, and recreation on 22.5 million acres of California desert.  By working with our state to develop this Plan, the federal government has shown it can be an effective partner in the State's efforts to combat climate change, all while protecting the magnificent, yet fragile, California desert landscape.  The bill also makes use of about 370,000 acres of isolated, unusable parcels of State lands spread across the California desert. These small isolated parcels of State land in wilderness, national parks and monuments would be exchanged for Federal lands elsewhere that could potentially provide the State with viable sites for renewable energy development, off-highway vehicle recreation, or other commercial purposes.  This blueprint will help identify pristine lands that warrant protection and direct energy projects elsewhere.  This is a fair balancing of priorities, and I think it provides a clear path forward.  I strongly urge my colleagues to take a good look at this legislation. I hope they understand that the many stakeholders involved have made their voices heard.  As you can see, there are many diverse interests in California's desert lands, an it is not easy to bring them all into agreement. But after years of painstaking efforts, they have reached agreement on this bill.  Desert conservation has never been a partisan issue. Over the years, legislators have come together across party lines to preserve this great piece of land.  Given our past success, I am hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it forward. Most importantly, I hope this body recognizes the simple fact that desert conservation has never been a partisan issue.  Over the years, legislators have come together across party lines to preserve this great piece of land. It's the right thing to do.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS114.txt,1332,"INSPIRING THE NEXT SPACE PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, RESEARCHERS, AND",2017.0,5.0,January

It is a career that is characterized by unshakable dedication to the common good and supreme attention to detail. These qualities make Stephen Higgins a true professional. His service is a labor of love for our country and this institution in particular.  Stephen has worked in the Senate longer than all but nine of its current Members, serving this Chamber for 23 years. Stephen still remembers his first day on payroll: March 21, 1994. He began with Senator William Cohen of Maine as a counsel on the Juvenile Justice Subcommittee of the Judiciary There he began what would become a decades-long mission: to advance crime victims' rights.  A year later, Stephen joined the office of Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, where he would distinguish himself as a committed, talented lawyer over the next 18 years, serving as chief counsel in Senator Kyl's personal office and for 14 years as chief counsel on his Judiciary Committee staff. During that time, Stephen played the lead role, supporting efforts to pass a bipartisan crime victims' rights constitutional amendment. The end result: After 8 years of hard work, a landmark statute was passed by a vote of 96 to 1. This is one of Stephen's proudest accomplishments. ``We did something significant to help crime victims,'' he said. ``We enshrined into law the rights of crime victims to be informed, present, and heard.''  To put it simply, Stephen Higgins helped humanize America's criminal justice system. This work reflects his sincere beliefs about that system. ``The criminal justice system is about seeking the truth,'' he said. ``The truth matters.''  For Stephen Higgins, the truth has always mattered. He is a man of high character and great personal integrity. These attributes made him exceptionally well-suited for work in another critical realm of the Senate: judicial nominations. ``Judges hold people's lives in their hands,'' Stephen said. ``Their decisions have life-altering consequences.''  Most recently, Stephen played a key role in the nomination of Omaha attorney Bob Rossiter to serve as U.district court judge for the District of Nebraska, and last year, the Senate confirmed Judge Rossiter unanimously. This was a beautiful capstone to Stephen's Senate career.  He leaves the Senate now for a new position: managing director of the[[Page S102]]Human Ecology Institute at the Catholic University of This is an interdisciplinary research institute that will apply the rich intellectual tradition of the Catholic Church to contemporary problems in our society.

656,topic-id,1252,"Mr.President, I rise to speak today about legislation I am introducing, the Health Savings Account  Earlier this month, individuals across this country were once again faced with fewer choices and increased costs whenpurchasing health insurance coverage. Unfortunately, this has been a common occurrence since the Affordable Care Act'sinception, but no State, I can tell you, is feeling the pinch more than my State of Prior to the flawed rollout of theexchanges in 2013, Arizona had 24 health insurance companies offering plans in the individual market. Just last year, residentsin Arizona's most populous county Maricopa, where I live, had only 8 private providers to choose from on the exchange--so from 24to 8. Then, if that wasn't bad enough, a few months ago, individuals all across Arizona received notification that theirinsurance plans were no longer being offered, despite the current administration's hollow promise that they could keep theirplans. Now nearly stripped of their preferred health insurance, residents in 14 of 15 Arizona counties--14 out of 15counties--logged into the ObamaCare exchanges to shop for new plans only to discover that instead of the vibrant marketplace theyused to have, they were left with only one insurer to choose from--so from 24 to 8, to 1 for 14 of Arizona's 15 counties.  So today, when I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talking about preserving this wonderful program, I am saying``What State of denial do you live in?'' because it is certainly not working in In fact, Pinal County in Arizonabriefly held the unfortunate distinction as the only county in America without a single insurer willing to offer plans on itsexchange, not a single one. Fortunately, a few months later, one stepped in--just one. Of the plans that were ultimately madeavailable to Arizonans on the exchange, the average policy came with a premium hike of nearly 50 percent--an average of nearly 50percent. With only one game in town, there was no shopping around for a better deal.  To help put this in perspective, I would like to compare the average cost of health care coverage in Arizona to one of themost important purchases a family will ever make, and that is a home. Throughout most counties in Arizona, it is now cheaper toput a roof over your family's head than it is to pay your monthly health insurance premium under  Let me say that again. Throughout most counties in Arizona, it is now cheaper to put a roof over your family's head than itis to pay your monthly health insurance premium under This is for Maricopa It is the county in which I liveand includes Homeowners can expect to pay nearly $500 more per month on their health insurance than they do on theirhouse--$500 more on their health insurance than they do on their house. This is for the ObamaCare silver plan premium. This is afamily--age 40 with two children. So that's about the median, and this is the median mortgage payment with respect to MaricopaCounty--$500 more.  Let's see the visual for Pima Pima County is home to Health care premiums ran an average family $100 moreper month than their mortgage. So in Pima County you are still paying more--$100 more for your health insurance premium than youare for your mortgage.  Then there is Pinal County, the third largest in According to Arizona's Department of Insurance, the averagepremium for a silver plan in Pinal County for the average family of four is over $1700. That is double the median monthlymortgage payment for the same county. If you live in Pinal County, AZ, you are paying twice as much for your health insurancepremium.  Keep in mind, we are talking about the premium, to say nothing of what happens when you go to the hospital or to your doctorand you have to pay deductibles that are through the roof or co-pays that people have never experienced before. So when theyutilize that coverage they paid for with their premium, they realize they can't afford that either.  The situation isn't unique to these counties, the three most populous counties in In all 15 of Arizona's counties,premiums for a family of 4 dramatically exceed the median monthly mortgage.  It is unacceptable for the Federal Government to force families to spend upwards of $1,700 per month of their hard-earnedincome on a substandard product without options or choices, only to then slap them with a draconian penalty that they simplycan't afford to pay for an untenable law.  Arizona is, without a doubt, ground zero for the structural failures that are plaguing insurance markets around the country.Insurance exchanges are on the verge of collapsing; premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses are skyrocketing; and ourhealth care system is in desperate need of reform. That is why I stand here today to introduce the Health Savings AccountExpansion  The Health Savings Account Expansion Act goes a long way toward reforming our health care system by putting consumers backin charge of their own health care. The bill provides individuals and families with freedom to choose the health care that bestmeets their needs and allows them to use their health savings accounts on medical products and services they value most.[[Page S61]]  HSAs give consumers greater control over their health care dollars by providing them with a tax-advantaged savings optionfor their medical expenses. This means that the dollars they work so hard to save can grow over time, tax free, and can bewithdrawn tax free for qualified medical expenses. The HSA Expansion Act strengthens this important tool by nearly tripling thearbitrarily low contribution limits, thus allowing for greater tax equity and more universal participation in The billwould then allow individuals to use these expanded HSAs to help cover the costs of their monthly health insurance premiums. Thisis a critically important feature, particularly for middle-class families whose incomes fall slightly above the qualifiedthreshold for subsidies but whose health insurance has become unaffordable.  In Arizona, I like to go to the gym in the morning, and I like to get on an exercise bike. By that bike is kind of a hallwaywhere people will walk by. Inevitably, in the morning, I will have a lineup of people who will stand to tell me their ObamaCarehorror stories--how much their premiums have gone up or that they no longer have any options or that they have had to pay thepenalty or that when they go to utilize their care, they simply can't afford the co-pays and deductibles. I can tell you, it issobering to hear these stories again and again and again.  In addition to further incentivizing prudent savings for health expenses, this legislation repeals existing restrictions putin place by ObamaCare on over-the-counter medications while also reducing the penalty for withdrawing HSA funds for nonqualifiedpurchases. These reforms will help streamline HSAs while also making them more user-friendly for consumers.  Arizonans are struggling. They are struggling under the weight of bureaucracy that is complicating their health caredecisions that are some of the most personal and important decisions individuals make for themselves and their families. If wehope to lift that burden off the backs of our constituents, we have to recognize that the key to reforming our health caresystem is not more government intervention; rather, it is allowing individuals the freedom to take back control of their healthcare and incentivizing prudent decisionmaking.  As the Senate looks to repeal this disastrous law and replace it with real reforms that would successfully lower health carecosts and improve choice, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this legislation is included in thosenegotiations.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS60-2.txt,1633,ENERGY EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT,2017.0,4.0,January

I think the Senator speaking on the other side of the aisle talking about Republicans wanting to cut Medicare and Social Security has it a little backward. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, under current law Social Security's disability insurance trust fund will be exhausted by 2022 and its retirement fund will be exhausted by 2030. Once exhausted, Social Security beneficiaries could be subject to a cut in their benefits as high as 31 percent if we do nothing, unless we fix these programs.  The problem with the other side of the aisle right now is they don't want to fix these programs. If we adopt the Sanders amendment, it will make it difficult to actually go in and reform these programs in a manner that will make sure they survive for future generations.  We all know we have to have entitlement reform. We want to do it in a way that protects future generations. Unless we reform these programs--and they go in 2022 and 2030--if these benefits are exhausted, people might be subjected to a 31-percent cut. That is not what we want.

1892,topic-id,1415,"Madam President, I rise to speak on a subject that often goes overlooked in this body.  The subject of wasteful spending on parochial pet projects is often treated as a trivial matter--simply the cost of doing business around here. Imagine if every Member of Congress were as obsessed with searching for government waste as the players of the mobile game Pokemon Go are obsessed with finding the elusive Pokemon, as the chart shows here.  Just like the monsters in the popular game, government pork projects come in all shapes and sizes. They pop up just about everywhere. As individual expenses, these pet projects can seem rather harmless--cute, even. But taken together, their cost adds up to one very menacing boondoggle debt monster that continues to grow and threaten every taxpayer. In fact, within days, the U.national debt will top $20 trillion.  As we debate the budget resolution, we need to get serious about controlling the debt like the true national security challenge it is. We start by eliminating unnecessary spending and catching government waste.  My friend and former colleague Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma created an annual report cataloging some of the most egregious ways Washington wastes our tax dollars. It is called the Today, I am releasing the latest installment, which profiles 50 new examples of questionable expenditures. This year's edition is entitled ``Wastebook: PORKemon Go.''  Like the Pokedex, which lists the various Pokemon for players to catch, Wastebook provides an index of questionable expenditures lurking throughout the Federal budget. These collectively cost taxpayers more than $5 billion, but instead of Pikachu, we are looking out for PORKachu.[[Page S193]]  The top entry in this year's Wastebook is a spaceport--which is just a fancy word to say a rocket launch site--all the way over in It has been derided as space pork, not because it is launching an elite unit of porcine astronauts into the big trough in the sky, it is because Congress used earmarks to force the Department of Defense to build the facility, over the objections of the military, as part of an illegal kickback scheme.  A midlevel DOD employee, who was sentenced to prison for masterminding the plot, eventually confessed that building the launch facility ``doesn't make sense.'' He said the Pentagon ``just paid for meaningless work.'' Keep in mind, this was a contractor on that project. After sitting unused for several years, the Pentagon is now sinking another $80 million into the spaceport. This is despite the fact that it is not even equipped with the type of missiles that DOD plans to launch for the site.  Another entry, the National Comedy Center in New York must be laughing all the way to the bank with $1.7 million from the Economic Development Administration, or This will be spent to bring Lucille Ball back to the stage as a hologram. The three-dimensional illusion of Lucy is formed with light beams from a laser, which will replicate standup routines using existing audio recordings.  Holograms of other comedians who are no longer with us will also take the stage in the center's comedy club. Other features will include a boot camp on how to deliver jokes--maybe I need that one--as well as a heckle booth, which we can do without. This is likely to once again make Washington the punch line of jokes, but it is no laughing matter for taxpayers.  Next up, the U.Department of Agriculture, USDA, has a program that allows taxpayer-funded farm loans to literally be paid back with peanuts. This program shelled out $74 million in the past year. In typical Washington fashion, the government pays more for the peanuts than the market price, which has turned the program into a cash cow, or pig--however you want to view it--and the pile of surplus peanuts the government has amassed is so large that government can't even give it away.  Here we have a farm program where we are giving loans to farmers to grow peanuts. If they check at the end of the year and the market price for peanuts isn't very good, they can unload those peanuts on the government and keep the cost of the loan. Then, government has to store these peanuts, which we do in warehouses all over the country.  Based on USDA's own numbers, the Congressional Research Service is warning that the storage costs alone could pile up to $1 billion a year. That is not just peanuts; that is enough to make anyone salty about our debt and deficit.  Instead of filling potholes, $35,000 from the Department of Transportation literally went to pot. The money was paid for a giant glow-in-the-dark doobie displayed in Denver that was intended to remind motorists who smoke marijuana not to drive while they are stoned; $35,000 for a big poster or banner on a building of a giant joint.  Even the Nation's most prestigious science agencies are spending taxpayer funds investigating subjects that most of us would consider obvious or rather offbeat. Studies on the habits of college students funded with $5 million of NIH grants counted more than 500 different drinking games that are popular on college campuses.  According to researchers, ``All of these games have the same goal--causing participants to become intoxicated.'' I think that is rather obvious. They observed that fraternity brothers drink, smoke, and generally party more than other students, and they also sleep in later. This led the researchers to speculate that ``one explanation for this finding is that Greek students recognize their sleep needs.'' A more likely reason is that they are sleeping off their partying lifestyle, but you are paying for it.  NIH is also drilling down to determine why some people are afraid of the dentist as part of another $3.5 million research project. The researchers found that--surprise here--``fear of pain has been shown to be a critical component.''  The monkey business doesn't end there. NIH spent nearly $1 million to study the evolution of monkey drool and another $230,000 to determine if the color red makes female monkeys feel more romantic. In case you are wondering, it does.  As part of an effort supported by both the National Science Foundation and DOD to teach computers how to understand computer behavior, the machines were programmed to watch television shows. After viewing over 600 hours of ``Desperate Housewives,'' ``The Office,'' and other shows, the computers were still unable to predict how humans would behave in most situations. Anybody who has watched those shows realizes that is rather obvious.  A $1 million NASA project is preparing the world's religions for the possible discovery of extraterrestrial life forms--$1 million to prepare the world's religions for the possible discovery of extraterrestrial life forms. Do we need to spend that, really?  A major sticking point for the participants was defining what life is: ``Much of the discussion centered on the question, `What is life?' It turns out that life is notoriously difficult to define,'' they concluded.  The fishiest study of all tested how long a fish can run on a treadmill. This was part of a study paid for by a $565,000 grant from the National Science Everyone remembers the infamous shrimp on a treadmill funded by It turns out that last year's competitor had a leg, or several, up on the competition. With five pairs of walking legs and five pairs of swimming legs, the shrimp could run for hours. The latest NSF-funded treadmill study participant was literally a fish out of water. The experiment forced mudskippers to ``run'' for as long as 15 minutes at a time on a treadmill. These fish possess the unique ability to survive out of water for extended periods of time, using their fins like legs, although they didn't appear to enjoy running on the treadmill, as you can imagine.  Certainly, we have bigger fish to fry with our Federal research dollars and, I might add, better puns to find as well. I could go on and on with examples of completely unnecessary spending identified by this year's There is waste in every department, every agency. All you have to do is look. Ferreting out every bit of wasteful spending, no matter how small, is the only way to reduce our debt and to rein in the cost of our Federal It can be a daunting task because, much like Pokemon, these programs are good at hiding. Our mission is simple: You have to catch them all.  Madam President, I yield back.

1526,topic-id,1632,"Mr.President, like my colleagues here today, I rise to talk about the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care I have been talking to a lot of people in Minnesota who have health insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, or whose lives are changed by the protections in the ACA that benefit every Frankly, they are scared, hard-working people for whom this is literally life or death. If their health insurance is taken away, they do not know what they are going to do.  Today, on their behalf, I have one request for my Republican colleagues: Show us your health care plan. You must have one. We would like to hear it. We would like to see it now. You can understand the question, right? If your child had cancer and the Affordable Care Act was the reason you could get health insurance, you wouldn't want to rip up the ACA before knowing what would replace it. I am not the only Senator with constituents whose lives are on the line here, so I know that you don't intend to rip up the Affordable Care Act and leave them with nothing. You have to have a plan, right? So let's just see it.  Last week, President Obama said that if Republicans produce a plan that is ``demonstrably better than ObamaCare,'' he would support it, and so will Just show it to me. President-Elect Trump clearly has a plan. He laid it out, laid it all out during his campaign. His plan was, he said, to ``repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something terrific.'' That is what he said. Then he went into a little more detail and explained that ``something terrific'' would be ``so much better, so much better, so much better.''  So much better. That sounds great. Let's see it. One of Trump's top advisers said on MSNBC: ``We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance.'' Neither do we. Speaker Ryan said that there will ``be a bridge so that no one is left out in the cold, so that no one is worse off.'' That is wonderful. No one being worse off is exactly what we want to see.  I am sure Speaker Ryan's staff was mistaken when they later told a reporter that the ``no one worse off'' applied only to the transition period, not to the replacement period. Show me the plan, please. Please show me the plan that keeps coverage for the 20 million people who have gained coverage that would continue to bend the cost curve so the cost of the entire health care system continues to grow less quickly than it did before ACA was adopted, the plan that would ensure that nobody gets denied coverage when they need it or has to unfairly pay more than someone else because of their gender or a preexisting condition. Show me that plan.  I know Republicans have put forward some different plans, a lot of different plans, but a lot of plans is not a plan. A lot of plans is not a plan. We want to see the plan, you know, the one you have been working on for 6 years. I was here in 2009 when we passed the I know how hard it was. If I could, let me offer you something. Some of your Republican friends actually did come up with a health care plan a while ago. It all started at the Heritage Foundation, which is a bona fide conservative think tank.  Over at Heritage, they did not like the idea of single-payer health care insurance, where the government is everyone's insurer. So what they wanted to come up with was a way to use the magic of the marketplace to solve the problem of providing everyone access to insurance.  Here is what they came up with, a three-legged stool. The first leg is, insurance companies can't deny coverage to people with a preexisting condition. They can't charge them more. We can all agree on that, right? President-Elect Trump and I agree on that, for sure. It is a great idea--great idea--but there is a catch. If you can not turn people down because of preexisting conditions, you cannot charge them more, well then everyone would just wait to buy health insurance until they get sick and need care. But the whole idea of health insurance is that at any given moment, most of the people paying premiums are healthy. So their premiums cover the cost of the people who are sick.  If the only people with insurance are sick, the premiums will skyrocket. So you need a way to get healthy people into the system to bring the cost of insurance down, which brings us to leg 2. Everyone has to be insured, otherwise known as the individual mandate. Everyone has to be insured. The Heritage Foundation said that. They called it the free rider syndrome. They said, no, everyone has to be insured.  This is what conservatives now say they hate; that the government says everyone has to buy insurance. But if you have to sell everyone insurance, then everyone has to buy it or the cost explodes. Now, look, if you have a better way to keep people covered and keep costs down, show me the plan. Show me the plan. But this is the best one the Heritage Foundation could come up with.  But wait, what if someone can't afford that health insurance? That brings us to the third leg. The government will subsidize insurance for people who can't afford it. There you have it, the Heritage Foundation plan, which a Republican Governor then implemented in a State to huge success.  Let me ask you, my Republican friends, is that your plan? Because if it is, it works for me. Guess what. Then we don't even have to repeal the Affordable Care Act in order to replace it with this plan because this plan was the model for the Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Premiums went up a lot this fall for people buying insurance through the marketplace.  It is often ignored that subsidies cover the cost increases for about 70 percent of those folks, but for many those increases genuinely hurt. That is a real problem. Then the solution to it is to recognize that subsidies don't provide enough help and don't go to enough people. Let's fix that. There are places where there is not enough competition. The best and most direct solution that I know of is to introduce a public option.  If my Republican colleagues have another idea about how to address these costs and competition issues that would ensure that people don't lose their coverage, I am ready to roll up my sleeves and go to work. While we are honest about the shortcomings, let's not forget the bottom line. As a primary care doctor for Indiana University's Health Physicians said, ``I've been a registered Republican my whole life, but I support the Affordable Care Act because it allows patients to be taken care of.''  For 6 years, you have been blasting the ACA, promising to replace it with something better. Let's see what you have, but don't just tell me your plan. I want you to join me on a trip to Minnesota to see Dolly is one of my constituents who wrote to me about her husband's pulmonary embolism. Before the ACA, she and her husband both had jobs that did not offer health insurance, but once the ACA passed, they were able to buy insurance and go to the doctor.  The doctor discovered her husband's embolism and saved his life. I would like you to look Dolly in the eye and explain how your plan--your plan--will ensure that her husband's life will not be endangered.  I would like you to join me in talking to Before the ACA became law, Gina's father was undergoing treatment for leukemia. Then one day he was told he had hit the lifetime maximum on his insurance coverage. From that point on, the family would have to[[Page S149]]pay for his treatment out of pocket, but they did not have the money so they stopped treatment. Gina's father died 3 days later.  Since then, Gina's fiance was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. So I want you to explain to Gina how exactly under your plan Gina will not face the same kind of impossible financial situation with her future husband's condition that she did with her dad. Sit down with Gina and tell her that.  Now, once you are done calming Gina's concerns about what your plan might do to her family, we will go over and talk to Leanna's 3-year-old son Henry has been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. His treatment will last until at least April of 2018. He often needs around-the-clock care to manage his nausea, vomiting, pain, and sleepless nights. Little Henry's immune system is so compromised that he is not supposed to go to daycare. So Leanna has left her job to take care of him. They are supported by her spouse, but they could not pay for his treatment on one salary.  Leanna says:       It is because of the ACA that Henry gets proper health      care. Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to      maintain his health and work towards beating cancer. Henry is      still with us because of the  Let me say that again. ``Henry is still with us because of the ACA.'' I want you to sit down with Leanna, as she holds her precious 3-year-old son, and explain how Henry will still be with us under your plan. Show us your plan. Show us your plan.  I yield the floor.

1785,topic-id,1671,"Mr.Speaker, indeed, we do have an extraordinary country. Down through the last 230 years, this Congress has met, has discussed, decided, voted upon, and set in place policies that advanced our country. And we are so very fortunate, all of us Americans, to be living here with all the promise that this incredible history has given us.  But at this period of time, we also have some profound questions about where this country is going. We wake up and we say: What is happening here? What is happening in the international scene? What is all this about Russia hacking? What is all this about trying to influence the American election? Did they really, and did it really happen, and was it effective?  Well, we know it really happened. The American public is scratching their head and they are saying: What is it?  And then all this talk about change, all this talk about we are going to change things; we are going to repeal ObamaCare, and we are going to replace it with something great. I wonder what that might be. And I suspect all across this Nation there are men, women, families that are also wondering: What do they mean it will be great? What is it that is great?  Well, if you were to go around the Capitol, if you were to talk to Members in the House of Representatives or over in the Senate and say: So it is gonna be great; what is it?  Well, we will tell you tomorrow or we will tell you later, but it will be great.  Maybe, maybe not.  Right now, the Senate is working on a piece of legislation that will set the stage for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act--and some would derisively call it Repeal it.  Oh, yeah, get rid of that thing. But not to where it is going to be great as soon as it is gone.  Really? I don't think so.  I know that in my part of California, a lot of people--in fact, more than 20,000--don't think it is great at all. They are going to lose their health care. And there are a whole lot of seniors in my community that are going: Wow, it is going to be great.  Really?  But I will lose my annual check-up. And that awesome drug doughnut hole that was so frightening just years ago is going to come back? That is not so great.  I drove into town or into the Capitol today. I don't live so far away, but it is 20 degrees, and I decided I would rather drive than freeze. So I drove in and an advertisement came on the radio, and it said: You are going to get a trillion-dollar tax cut. The middle class will have a trillion-dollar tax cut. I said: Well, that is not what I saw last night when I read the statistics about the great repeal of the Affordable Care In fact, I read something quite different from the tax committees, from Americans, various people.  Let me put something up here. Here it is. Who gets that trillion-dollar tax cut? Who is it? Is it the middle class? Well, I don't think so, because when you look at the numbers, it goes to the very wealthy. They are the ones who are going to get the tax cut with the repeal of  When the Affordable Care Act is repealed the way it is presently going, the bill that is over in the Senate will require that the taxes that were put in place to support the Affordable Care Act and to provide insurance for 20 million people--that is both the government insurance, the Medicaid, Medi-[[Page H291]]Cal in California, and the subsidized insurance from the various programs that exist State by State--that money was raised from the wealthy.  When the tax cuts come into place, here is the real story. The top 1 percent--do you remember the 1 percenters? Do you remember all that discussion about the 1 percenters and the 99? The 1 percenters get 57 percent of that trillion dollars, and everyone else gets to split the remaining 43 percent. The top one-tenth of the taxpayers in California--we are talking about the superwealthy. We are talking about the folks that are actually going to be in the President-elect's Cabinet, you know, the billionaires that he is going to put in the We are talking about those guys--oh, roughly a $200,000-a-year tax break. But after all, they are hurting. They need a few more hundred thousand dollars along the way.  So the trillion-dollar tax break that is the foundation of the repeal, if you eliminate the money, the program is not working. There will not be annual visits for seniors so that they can stay healthy, so that they can control their blood pressure, diabetes, mammograms, and all the rest that go with it. There won't be money for the 3.7 million Californians that presently are able to get coverage under the Medi-Cal program. There won't be money for the almost 2 million Californians that are in the subsidized pool called Covered That money won't be there. Those folks are going to be out.  And by the way, the repeal will remove the insurance for 30 million Americans all across the country. But who gets the real benefit here? The superwealthy, the top 1 percent will get 57 percent of that trillion-dollar tax break, and the rest of us will share in the 43 percent remaining.  Another way to look at it, folks. It will be great, but for whom? Well, if you break the American public into the five sectors, the first 20 percent, next 20, next 20, next 20, and then the top 20--so these are the real poor down here in the lower 20 percent, and these are the superwealthy in the top 20 percent.  So what happens? When you repeal the Affordable Care Act, as is now happening in the Senate--and it will be over here either this week or early next week; and then this House will take it up and it, too, will vote on that very same budget bill that will create a trillion-dollar tax cut over the next decade--who will get the money? There you go. The top 20 percent will wind up with a full 74 percent of that.                              {time}  1930  Despite that little advertisement that I heard on the radio, which said, ``Oh, the poor and the middle class are going to get it,'' really?  Let's see. Of the bottom 20 percent--6.7--oh, and the next will get 5.9 percent of it--do you have any idea what they are going to lose?  They are going to lose the subsidies on their insurance programs. They won't be able to afford it. They will lose their insurance. For some of them, they are on the Medicaid or the Medi-Cal program in California, and they will be out of luck unless, of course, the State of California can find $16.8 billion to replace the money that just disappeared with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and that money is then transferred to the top 20 percent.  These folks down here, the bottom 20 percent--actually, the bottom 60 percent of the American public are the losers.  Who are the winners?  The ones who are already able to buy insurance. I love this trick. I was the Insurance Commissioner in I loved this little trick: ``Not to worry. We are going to give an opportunity for people to buy their own insurance and give them a tax break.''  Do you mean these people down here have enough money jingling around in their pockets that they are going to be able to go out and buy the insurance and get the tax break?  Uh-uh. It is the folks up here on top who will, once again, benefit.  This really is a massive shift of $1 trillion from those people who are now insured, for those people who are now able to get care in the clinics that have been established across America--in outlying areas and in rural areas in my district. It is a massive shift from the ability of those people to get health care, for those people who are on the exchanges and are able to get subsidized insurance so that they can afford it, for those people who are seniors and are able to get their free annual checkups and have their drug costs reduced as the doughnut hole shrinks. It is a massive shift of money being taken directly out of their benefits and their pockets and going to the wealthy of That is what is happening. That is what this repeal of the Affordable Care Act is.  Then you look at the implications of that. What about the hospitals that have been able to ramp up their services? What about the reforms that were in the Affordable Care Act--the insurance reforms--that said to the insurance companies: ``Oh, no, no, no, you can no longer discriminate because that person happens to be a woman or has a preexisting condition''?  This is important, Mr.If you are scratching your head and wondering what is going on here, listen carefully because this super rapid train is about to come into the House of Representatives and sweep through here, wiping out the healthcare benefits of 30 million For those who are not directly affected, they, too, are going to wind up in a very precarious situation because the reforms will also be repealed.  Joining me tonight to discuss this and Social Security--oh, by the way, Social Security is also on the chopping block--are two of my colleagues: Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, who has been an extraordinary leader on the issues of manufacturing, of making it in America, of looking out for seniors, and for people who are in need of help and support.

1793,topic-id,1248,"Mr.Speaker, it is always a pleasure for me to be on the floor with Representative Tonko because of his passion, his knowledge, his ability to articulate with clarity, in this case, the importance of the Social Security program, Medicare, as well as the Affordable Care The gentleman makes a compelling argument.  I want the public of America to really grasp the importance of what is happening here in Yes, we are going to have a new President, and there will be an inaugural and all of the celebration that goes with that.  Let me put it this way: When that is done, there is a majority of the Congress and the Senate, together with the President, that fully intend to embark on unraveling the very critical safety net for more than 30 million And for everyone else who has insurance at every age--Medicare all the way down who has insurance--they will also see a dislocation and an unraveling of their insurance benefits because this market could seriously unravel. So as the gentleman said so clearly, be academic, study the facts, and study the pros and the cons of the various alternatives that are out there.  I know, as an insurance commissioner and having been dealing in the issues of health care for many years now, that there are improvements needed in the Affordable Care There is no doubt. We have been saying that since shortly after it became law. And even when it became law, I said this should be done this way or that way a little differently. We are 8 years into this and, as you say, millions, tens of millions actually--around 30 million directly--are involved and benefiting from the program, either through Medicaid, through the exchanges, or through the various benefits that are out there. So it is really, really important.  I want to also pick up on something that Representative Kaptur brought to our attention. I am going to put one more chart up here. I was surprised and a little bit appalled, just before we broke for Christmas, that the new chairman of the subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee who deals with Social Security introduced a piece of legislation. We looked at it.  It was just before the Christmas holidays, so I picked it up and started looking at it. I go: whoa, wait, wait, wait. This is a major step to unravel the Social Security system. Remember, back in the George Bush administration, in the first 3 years of his administration, he tried to privatize Social He failed miserably at that. Thankfully, he failed. Congress wouldn't stand for it. At least, the Democrats in Congress wouldn't stand for it.[[Page H294]]  I see this piece of legislation introduced in the last session, in the last days, and I am going: Whoa, what does this mean? This man becomes the chairman of the subcommittee that deals with Social Security, and I am going: oh, no, they wouldn't; they wouldn't go after Social Security again. But the bill does. It does it in a way that, once again, gives enormous benefits to the wealthy and not so much for the others.  This is a little chart about what happens if that piece of legislation by Mr.Johnson actually becomes law. These are the benefits that would be received today. In 10 years, these would be the benefits. This is the top 20 percent rather, and right here is the middle. That is about a $3,000 a year reduction.  Keep in mind that, I think, well over 50 percent of the seniors in the United States depend upon Social Security as their principal source and, in many cases, their only source of income.  So you get a decline. What do they want to do? They want to increase the age to 69 before you could apply for full Social They want to radically change the cost-of-living index. I know what I heard from my constituents when there was no cost of living over the previous 2 years--and a very small one this last year--the cost of care for seniors continues to rise because they are on the expensive side of things. There are some other provisions in it. So this is a wake-up call. This is a wake-up call.  Clearly, the majority party here in the House and in the Senate have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which we have talked about. They have also made it clear that in the past--and we believe in the months ahead--they will attempt to privatize a large portion of the Medicare program. So Medicaid will be largely gutted, and the increases that we have seen through the Medicaid program will be wiped out.  The Medicare program will have significant benefit reductions, and, if they intend to voucherize it, which they have talked about, then as Representative Kaptur said, they will throw the seniors to the mercy of the insurance companies.  My basic point tonight was to raise the alarm and to begin to discuss here amongst our colleagues the reality of what is being planned for Don't look at this as a partisan issue, Republican or Look at this as a personal issue.  Look at this as an issue that was given to me by a woman who is a farmer in the community I represent north of Sacramento who never had insurance. She was an entrepreneur, a self-employed farmer. She never had insurance. If she needed care, she would go to the emergency room. That worked when she was young, but then she became a little older, and then cancer.                              {time}  2000  The treatments for her cancers were unaffordable. She would go bankrupt. The Affordable Care Act came along with guaranteed coverage and an insurance policy through the exchange in California that she could afford that would provide her with unlimited medical services for the rest of her life. No cap, no annual cap, no lifetime cap. She got her cancer treatments, and she has moved along. She said: I still need care. And if they repeal the Affordable Care Act, I won't get it and I will die.  That story is repeated across It is repeated in my district. I can give many more examples. So this really is, in her case and in many others, a life-or-death situation. So, yes, we will be academic as Mr.Tonko has said. We should be. We should understand the implications of one policy versus another. We should understand when you start with repealing a trillion dollars of taxes, that will have a profound impact on health care in And the benefits will go to the wealthy. That is academic.  But it is also this woman, a small farmer who developed cancer. She had no hope. The Affordable Care Act comes along, and she is able to get insurance and she is able to get the chemotherapy necessary to save her life. She is back on the farm.  Repeal the Affordable Care Act and this woman, along with millions of Americans, are in serious jeopardy. So be aware. Social Security on the chopping block; Medicare on the chopping block; the Affordable Care Act is on the chopping block. Tax reductions for whom? Yes, mom and pop would get $130 a year from the tax cuts. The billionaires in the Trump administration would get $200,000 a year in tax cuts. Mom and pop are likely to lose their insurance.  I now yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.Tonko).  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH290.txt,1973,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued",2017.0,10.0,January

The President-elect recently said: We're going to repeal ObamaCare, and it'll be great. And our Republican colleagues have bought into that and are now processing legislation to do that.  The discussion today from my two colleagues here indicates another path, and that is, make it better. Make the Affordable Care Act better. The drug issue, there is no reason in the world that the pharmaceutical companies should be prevented from price competition. They are. It is the law of the land that prevents the government and other purchasers--the government from negotiating prices. That is a law that can be changed.  There are many things that we could do to improve the health care of But two paths: one, working together to improve the Affordable Care Act and Medicare and Medicaid, and the Veterans Administration, the programs that provide the health care and the insurance for Americans; or another one, a path that is going to be extraordinarily destructive.[[Page H296]]  The repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is already underway in the Senate and will soon be over here in the House, promises Americans not just the 30 million that have insurance but all Americans with a very serious health problem in the future.

950,topic-id,480,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of the REINS Act, H.26, for any number of reasons.  I can't help but point out that I have heard my esteemed colleagues in opposition to this bill refer on multiple occasions to the Federal bureaucracy as a well-oiled machine. Mr.Chairman, there are, indeed, well-oiled machines that undergird this institution, but I would submit the Federal bureaucracy is not one of those.  We have heard that the regulatory burden, as it relates to the loss of jobs, is equal to a listeria outbreak. What I would submit is that if we could avoid a listeria outbreak, would we not choose to do just that?[[Page H130]]                                {time}  1530  While looking at the loss of jobs as related to Federal regulation, we overstep the argument by avoiding the jobs not created as a result of Federal regulations. Should these things also not be amongst the items that we consider?  A wise man once said that the bureaucracy will continue to expand to meet the expanding needs of the bureaucracy. In 2017, in the United States, indeed, it seems we find ourselves in that very situation.  Arguments that the REINS Act is contrary to the Constitution, I would submit, are actually 180 degrees from the truth. In fact, Article I of the Constitution gives the power to make law to this legislative branch of our government and gives the power to generate revenue, here, as well as spend.  The definition of ``law,'' according to the Oxford Dictionary, is: ``The system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties.''  I will submit that the very regulatory overreach that we consider here today is, in fact, tantamount to law and extraconstitutional in and of itself.  My esteemed colleague from Pennsylvania suggested, and I agree, that the REINS Act is but a good start. The power to spend is Article The power to make laws is Article  REINS is a rudder on the ship of constitutionality that will right that ship and move it only in the correct direction. Regulations that have the power to take liberty or property rights or the wealth of those earned by their own labor are tantamount to law and, indeed, extraordinary constitutionally as it relates to an executive branch entity, and they should not be exercised.  Mr.Chairman, we hear that the people's House is responsible for this and the people's House is responsible for that. Well, the people's House is to ensure that the people have a voice in the matters of spending and lawmaking that our Founders who laid out Article I of the Constitution envisioned, and currently, that is simply not the case. H.26 is simply a step back towards that right direction of constitutionality.  With that in mind, I strongly support the legislation.

578,topic-id,2691,"Mr.Speaker, it is an honor to get to come into this hallowed Hall and to have a chance to address ourpeers.  It was a rather enjoyable day yesterday, even with all the vitriol, but I was reminded and couldn't help butreminisce a bit and walk a bit down memory lane yesterday as we heard from Members of the House on the other side of the aisleexpressing repeatedly a desire to have open debate and not shut off debate.  The reminiscing took me back to a time last yearwhen, as far as we could find, the only time in American history one party in the United States Congress physically preventedanother party from coming to the floor and going into session and trying to begin debate and trying to discuss the business ofthe day. We can't find that any party ever staged such a sit-in.  We know there are House rules about not eating on the Housefloor and about not having things to drink on the House floor other than water, and yet our friends across the aisle were eatingand drinking. It is actually a violation of the House rules to sing on the House floor. Every now and then, people look theother way from the violation, but certainly not to take pictures and broadcast.  I approached the Sergeant at Arms and askedhim why this wasn't stopped.  I was told: Well, they won't stop; we have told them repeatedly.  I said: Well, you won'tlet Republicans get away with this kind of conduct. They are preventing debate. They are preventing a session from startingtimely. This has been going on for hours.  I was told: Well, Congressman, when we tell you Republicans that you are violatinga rule, you stop and you follow the rules. We have told them repeatedly, and they will not stop violating the rules. They willnot stop preventing you from going into session, so we don't know what else to do.  Mr.Speaker, I had issues like that whenI was a felony judge, and they didn't last long because we had bailiffs who would drag people out to stop such inappropriateconduct. It just seemed that, in this potentially last bastion of civility where we can use words and debate issues, it israther ironic, to say the least, to be preached to repeatedly about the desire for open debate and the desire to not be shutdown from speaking when that is exactly what happened last year by the very people who were standing up, and some of them werereading a script pointing out how offended they were by being prevented by the rules under which we have been proceeding fromgoing forward and debating. So it is rather ironic and rather incredible actually.  I also recall back when we were debatingObamaCare and some of us wanted to get amendments into Of course, some of us remember the fact that John Dingell waschairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce that had jurisdiction over the healthcare debate and the healthcare bill. Hehas been working for a healthcare bill, something like what passed, for all of his time, as I am aware of, in the  Iwas told by someone that his father may have worked for the same bill for years. So that was something that was going to be acrowning glory for an incredibly honorable man. We see differently on many issues, but I know him to be an honest and honorableman. His word has always been good. When he has given it, it was always the way it is. I have great respect for him.  Anyway,he understood that the cap-and-trade bill that was being pushed here in the House by then-Speaker Pelosi was going tounduly harm the Nation's poor more than anybody else in the country. If you are very rich, if you are on Wall Street, you arefriends of the Obama administration, and you have gotten $656 million in grants to open a non-carbon-based energy facility, youare not worried about the price of anything because your friends in the Obama administration were giving you millions andbillions of dollars that you could fritter away as you wished.  But for our Nation's middle class, lower middle class, andpoor that don't have the ability to absorb increasing energy costs, the cap-and-trade bill would have been devastating. That iswhy, when John Dingell was asked about the cap-and-trade bill, he responded something to the effect that it is not only a tax,it is a great big tax, it will unfairly hit the poor, and he was not going to bring that bill out of committee. So SpeakerPelosi, at that time, took whatever actions were required to remove him as chair and replace him with Henry  Chairman Waxman made clear: We don't need your votes; we don't want your input; so we don't care what you want in thehealthcare bill.  Joe Barton, the longest serving Texan in the House right now, had indicated, as a former chair of thatsame committee, that it is interesting if[[Page H89]]John Dingell--the consummate professional and honorable man that he is--had beenallowed to remain as chairman of that committee, he would have instinctively gotten Republican input into that bill and includedthings in the bill that Republicans would have had a hard time voting against. If he had been allowed to remain as chairman ofthe Energy and Commerce Committee, John Dingell would have probably been able to get a bill through that would not even be takenup by this body to be repealed and ripped out by its roots.  Hopefully that is what we are going to be able to do with theextremely partisan bill. There were groups that were telling Republicans: Look, of course we are negotiating with the We have got to have a seat at the table.  I would tell them: Not when you are on the menu.  But there weregroups like the Big Pharma, like the American Hospital Association, the AMA, and some of the health insurance businesses thatended up getting behind it. Of course, AARP totally sold out retired folks because they were going to makehundreds of millions--billions perhaps--more than they would have without ObamaCare being passed. They had no interest insupporting a bill like I proposed that would have ended any need for a senior citizen to ever have to pay for supplementalinsurance on top of Medicare; they would have been totally covered.  But I didn't realize, at the time I asked them tosupport it in 2009, that the year before they had made, I think, over $400 million or so in profit as a nonprofit organizationon getting their members to buy their insurance that they had sponsored and put their mark of approval on.  So anyway, therewere people that were going to make a lot of money. But I could see that in the end it would probably spell the doom of thepharmaceutical industry. Yes, it would be years down the road; yes, there would be executives at pharmaceutical companies whowould see massive billions of dollars come in more than would have otherwise; and, yes, they would likely take their goldenparachutes and their millions in severance in retirement and be gone before they were relegated to perhaps producing medicationswithout getting reimbursement for research and development. This is the way this whole ObamaCare thing would have eventuallyplayed out, and still they got on board with ObamaCare because they were going to make short-term extra billions of dollars.  So having all of that in mind, as it has all appeared to me, it had just been astounding to be here yesterday and hear allthe comments about the inability to have open debate.  I have talked to numerous friends across the aisle who were greatlytroubled over the last 6 years. Actually, the Office of Congressional Ethics was started by Speaker You are allowedto file complaints without anybody knowing who filed the complaint. The OCE is then able to go after a Member of Congress andstart demanding things that they could not possibly be entitled to under the Constitution if a Member of Congress were gettingdue process.  I haven't been run through the ringer like so many have. But when you set up a process like that, and you havethe Office of Congressional Ethics set up, they have no one at all to whom they are accountable--no one--and they are encouraged,even if they filed the complaints themselves, to enable them to continue to grow from the little office they had over here inthe Longworth I am told they have a massive amount of space in one of the big Federal buildings now, and they continueto grow. So apparently, they were offended that their budget was cut and they were put under the Ethics Committee so that theywould have some accountability. There were an awful lot of great people--good friends--across the country that did not know abouthow unconstitutionally they had been acting--I mean more abusive even than the IRS at times from the reports of some of mycolleagues to me of what they have been through.  I stand here, Mr.Speaker, as a judge who has had to look people in the eyeand sentence them to death--something that is never taken lightly. I may be the only person here in Congress who has ever lookedsomeone in the eye and sentenced them to death and been appointed as counsel against my wishes to represent an indigentdefendant on appeal from a capital murder conviction under sentence of death and was able, appropriately, to have his casereversed and to save his life as the law should have been. So I feel rather strongly that, yes, people should be accountable,but they must have due process, and that is not what is provided for by the                              {time}  1715  Wonderful people, including our incoming President, were not aware of just how crazy the abuses have been.One of the Members was telling me yesterday that he was out about half a million dollars in attorney's fees responding toridiculous demands and still never got to know who the accuser was. You don't get to necessarily even see what the specificcomplaint is.  So we didn't do a good job of educating people of how grossly unfair the OCE process was, could be, buteverybody in Congress, the judiciary, and executive branch needs someone to whom they are accountable, and that would includethe  We have got to do something about this, but we do need to go about it in an appropriate way to make sure that, onceagain, justice is done. But when you hear ``ethics watchdog group,'' then immediately you think, Gee, they are going to stop anethics watchdog group? That is outrageous. That is what I would think if I didn't know all the background.  So it made for aninteresting day yesterday, but I have been amazed, though, that some who have told me that they wanted to eliminate the OCE whostand up on the other side of the aisle and preach about ethics, apparently referring to the effort to place OCE and make themaccountable under somebody for a change--in this case, under the Ethics Committee--and would demagogue the issue, in essence, whenthey have been mistreated by the OCE, according to what I have been told by them in the past.  So I think if we can just setthe politics aside and work together for appropriate due process, we can have a bipartisan group that could work out somethingthat would create due process and would make people accountable so that when you have somebody with $90,000 of cold, hard cashin their freezer, there is accountability. In that case, it was a crime and it needed to be addressed. So there does need to beaccountability.  I know we have friends here. I saw my friend, Steve King, at the back just a moment ago. We feelstrongly that when a Federal judge intentionally refuses to go along with what they know the Constitution says, that ought to bean impeachable offense. They are not keeping their oath, and that is as offensive as anything is when it comes from a judge.They ought to be able to impeach a judge like that.  I don't think we have done enough removal, impeachment of judges whohave violated their oath. Yes, we were removing a judge who had committed sexual assault. Well, that should have been a no-brainer, but that took literally an act of Congress to eventually get that done.  For another judge, it was not until weactually impeached him for his terribly inappropriate actions of suppressing information when he was being investigated forbeing a Federal judge, but from his days as a State judge. Apparently, as a State judge, he didn't have a problem, if tuitionwas due for his son, to just send the secretary or somebody to one of the law offices which he often appoints and then have themfill up the envelope with a bunch of cash and use that to pay his son's tuition. That didn't seem to be a problem for thatjudge. Those are all things that should have been appropriately taken into account before he was ever made a Federal judge.  I see my friend here on the floor. I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa).  Mr.I was listening to the gentleman's remarks on a couple of these topics here that are veryimportant.  He led off with the situation that occurred with the sit-in that occurred here on this House floor last year,some months ago, and I found that to be very appalling for the decorum, for[[Page H90]]the honor, for the history, for all the thingsthat are important about conducting ourselves in a society where order is needed in order to conduct business.  This Housefloor was not treated with that respect that is necessary to have order, to have an honest debate, and a debate that isconstructive when you have a sit-in like that where basically the folks on the other side of the aisle--some of them--decided totake over the entire building outside of session, outside of the rules. As Mr.Gohmert mentioned, many rules were violated.  I had the appalling experience of walking on the floor just a few minutes after they concluded their sit-in and, honestly,the garbage that was laying on the floor. I saw food crumbs, old newspapers, magazines, a couple of blankets. They didn't evenpick up after themselves. They expected the staff of the building to pick it up and haul it off for them because their OccupyWall Street moment was over with. This is not the sixties. This is not the hippy era. This is the United States House of This week, rules were proposed that say, when you violate rules in such a fashion where videotaping orPeriscoping, as they call it, is occurring--sending these speeches during a nonofficial, non-session time, basically bootleggingthem to the American public via C-SPAN; and I am a little annoyed with C-SPAN actually playing along with the violation ofHouse rules of piping this out the way they did.  If you want to have a protest out on the front lawn, fine. That is withinthe rights of free speech, the First Amendment, and all that. You don't do it in violation of the rules of a fairly, some mightsay, sacred place--this House floor--the way that happened then. For them to be piping it out live that way, I found it to becompletely wrong.  There are those folks that might say: Well, this is all First Amendment rights, not in violation of thedecorum of the House rules. So I am glad Mr.Gohmert brought that up. Rules are put in place this week to address peoplethat are going to violate the very House rules that help us keep order and do business of the American public. We lost part of,I think, three session days that we could have been grinding out the important business that the people expect of this country.  We lost that session time and, indeed, had to come in here and the Speaker or whoever wasintroducing legislation that day had to yell over the process here to do things in order for the I find that appalling.It isn't very mature. I think with some of the penalties that are put in place by the rules this week, there will be a littlemore accountability for that.

579,topic-id,667,"I recall being told when that was going on and afterit happened that Republicans should not respond, and that we were assured that people who violated the rules back then would bepunished. Well, adopting rules now, specific penalties, don't really punish people that violated those very rules last year.  So I am surprised that there is any complaint at all since basically it means people who violated the rule with such abandonwould complain about inserting a specific penalty now, meaning they got a free one. They didn't even get probation. They gotnothing. They got pardoned, basically.  Perhaps it is not too late for those that feel like putting a penalty in place now isunfair. I don't think it is too late. It is not unusual to have punishment assessed in a felony case 6 months or more after anevent. Perhaps if they think it is unfair, then we ought to have ethics hearings on what happened back then.  I haven't heardof the OCE, by the way, taking any action on such widespread abuse that didn't require investigation. All you needed was footagethat was being streamed out from the very violators of the rules. So it should have been an easy thing to pursue, if OCE werereally that interested in making sure our rules were not violated.  I yield to my friend.  Mr.It wouldn't be inappropriate since OCE is a hot topic this week.  The accountability goes both directions. Sowe have heard our colleagues talk about unjust charges that can be brought from anywhere, out of the blue, against a Member ofthe House without justification, without even a due process for that Member to have a chance to address directly what thatcharge is, and then have their name run through the newspaper, giant headlines, and maybe a year's worth of investigation.  When you see it, Congressman being investigated, well, that is an ugly headline. It can be used to manipulate it forpolitical purpose when it might be a trumped-up charge, something that has no merit, and many times talking to my colleaguesthat have faced this, hundreds of thousands of dollars of cost to them for attorney's fees, their reputation besmirched by this,when, really, there is an investigative process that is open, with oversight.  Now we didn't have the perfect piece oflegislation in the rule this week. We probably need a little more time for it to be aired out and a little more widely. Itwas withdrawn after at least getting the idea out on the table.  So I am proud of my colleagues who are going to take this upand work in a bipartisan fashion and get the input to make some needed reforms to the OCE so that we have an ethics process thatis fair to the Members, but obviously enforces ethics for this House that are needed and clearly demanded by the public and us.  We are talking here tonight about a decorum, a code, a process that our House is to be conducted by. So that sit-in is oneextreme. The other one is charges that are, in many cases, absolved months later without giant headlines but are not evensometimes an oops or I am sorry for trumped-up charges being brought up against somebody that would affect them negatively intheir ability to serve their districts or to fend off the huge costs of legal matters that they have to go through.  So manyof my colleagues here strongly care and want to have a strong ethical process in this place, but there needs to beaccountability and balance to it. That is what we are all looking forward to, is accountability with OCE and our EthicsCommittee who, in a bipartisan fashion, can weed through all these processes.  I think we will get to that. For those thatare concerned around this country that some here want to get rid of that ethics process, that absolutely couldn't be furtherfrom the truth.

The date for the 60-daycompliance kicks in January 18, 2 days before President-elect Donald Trump would be able to strike such an arbitrary andcapricious regulation down.                              {time}  1730  Apparently, they must have backdatedthe 60-day compliance before they ever got notice saying you have got until January 18 to comply. So what we have heard from somany small-business owners, they get notices like this: You have all of a sudden got to comply. You have got to give us allthese records, those records.  It has cost them a fortune. It has stifled their ability to expand their business and hiremore people and give more people opportunity and give more people opportunity to make more money than they had been making.Those have been so completely stifled by this administration. I understand there was a political article glorifying the greatefforts of the Obama administration in helping the economy, and to justify that, took one quarter out of, I guess--four timeseight--32 quarters and said, ``Look what they did in this one quarter,'' when actually, as I understood, if you take the wholeterm that we have numbers on and adjust the growth for inflation, President Obama's administration, his policies,[[Page H91]]his cronycapitalism, helping people with no-bid contracts like IBM, giving $1.6 billion to this company to create mirrors to heat waterand however much it was, hundreds of millions for Solyndra--there are just so many companies. They have squandered so much money.And yet, with all the money squandered, the economy grew, when adjusted for inflation, at about half the growth rate during theJimmy Carter administration.  Now, I understand this administration is extremely proud of what they accomplished, but I wouldhumbly submit, Mr.Speaker, if your policies cause the economy to grow at half the rate of the Jimmy Carter administration, youhave done more damage to the American people and the American economy than you have done good, and that is for sure. And that isat a time when, scientifically, we were having such breakthroughs that we found out we could actually be totally energyindependent if this administration had not been spending so much money on too expensive of sources of energy and all the otherthings this administration supported.  We had a hearing in Chairman Rob Bishop's Committee on Natural Resources in ourSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, a hearing on some of the abuses. I know there are legitimate groups and businessesthat have invested in this idea of having this fantastic carbon-free energy production out in California, and, yes, it took amassive amount of acreage. I believe it was Federal land that they were allowed to use. I believe. I am not certain.  I wasintrigued, they were going to create all these mirrors that would reflect the Sun's light in concentrated amounts towards threedifferent towers, and the towers would then be superheated, superheat the water, turn the water to steam. The steam would turnturbines that would produce electricity. If I recall correctly, they got $1.6 billion in government loan; and to help them maketheir loan payment, they got over $600 million in grants.  When I asked over this period of time that they have beenoperating how much of their $1.6 billion in government loan was paid back, I believe he said $6 million had been paid back from,it may have been, $656 million that they had given to them by this administration.  But we also came to find out thatapparently there have been problems. One of the towers got super-superheated and was totaled, was destroyed because of themassive sunlight reflected and damaged to where it wouldn't function. Because, apparently, they had squandered so much of theirmoney, they had to find a cheap source, an extremely cheap source of energy because they had contracts to supply a certainamount of electricity. With the third tower not in operation, they were not able to supply over 30 percent of the energy theyhad contracted to provide. They very quickly, cheaply, efficiently built a natural gas electricity production plant, and, wow,apparently it is working great. Of course, anybody that studies natural gas understands, if they know what they are doing, thatnatural gas is an amazingly clean form of energy.  Anyway, now about a third of the energy is being produced using naturalgas, when the whole purpose of the massive $1.6 billion in the government-backed loan and the $656 million or so that was givento them was because it was not going to be carbon based at all.  But it is not just the one problem, apparently, of thetower. This is out in an arid area where there is not much water. Well, they didn't need much water other than what they had inthe towers, really; but what they didn't anticipate was something that I am told operators, others in the area refer to asflamers.  Flamers, as I was given to understand, those are birds, perhaps some of them endangered species, that make themistake of flying through the superheated beam of sunlight and immediately explode or burst into flame. Apparently, if you are abird that gets superheated and explodes, bursts into flame, then masses of fluid keep covering the mirrors, which need to bekept clean.  Normally, you would figure out in a desert or an arid area, you are not going to need to clean those mirrorsvery often, so you are not going to need much water. But then when it turns out you have got all these flamers that supercoatthe mirrors so they are constantly having to be recleaned, those poor birds that our nature-loving friends are exploding, it isrunning up the water bill as well because, gee, it is just not healthy to be exploding birds that fly through this superheatedbeam of sunlight.  So 8 years of misguided policies have made, probably, a lot of Democratic millionaires, but the Americanpublic has suffered; and when adjusted for inflation, the American people are, on average, worse off.  I was surprised to seea video where the President actually admitted, he had actually acknowledged, that in his administration, for the first time weare aware of in the history of the United States, 95 percent of the income in America went to the top 1 percent of the incomeearners. I have read articles since then about, actually, even that 1 percentthat was making 95 percent of the Nation's income, they still weren't making, many of them, quite as much as they had before,because that is what happens when you hurt and throttle down an economy, as has happened. We haven't really adjusted.  Ofcourse, we have had the Fed that has had interest rates down to basically nothing, and it was clear they were doing everythingthey could to try to help the Obama administration's economy look better than it was. Now that people have started having hopebecause we have President-elect Trump and the policies are going to change dramatically, we are going to hopefully be completelyrid of, or as completely as possible, the crony capitalism. I know my colleagues here in the House, actually on both sides ofthe aisle, have made clear we want to stop crony capitalism, and I am looking forward to that stopping once we get out fromunder this administration.  So the economy is showing great signs. I have got people back home telling me they are startingto hire again just based on the hope and the promise. President Obama was supposed to bring hope and change, but all myconstituents tell me so many of them are left with, after he has been President, a little change left from what they had when hetook office.  But there is real hope, and people are gearing up to grow, and the economy should take off, and we should getenergy independent. I expect President-elect Trump to keep his promises. He assured me personally he was going to. So I amexpecting great things. But just on that, the economy has started going up, on the assurance that President Obama would not bearound any longer than January 20, and as a result now, the Fed finally has started increasing interest rates because they don'thave to artificially try to protect President Obama's reputation and his poor economy.  So just the fact that the EPA wouldsend out regulations in such a capricious manner as they have, demanding that well operators start monitoring all theiremissions, something to that effect, I am looking forward to getting into it and just seeing how abusive the EPA has been asthese oligarchs. Not to give a chance for true input into an arbitrary and capricious rule, not to give businesses a chance toget ready and to adjust, I mean, this is the kind of thing that has stifled so much growth and has sent so many high school andcollege graduates to their parents' home.  I think there are a lot of people who voted for President Obama and were excited.I think it is unfortunate that so many people expressed that they voted for a President because of his skin color--and I am nottalking about Donald Trump--that they made a racist vote to vote for a man who was not White so they could feel good about votingfor someone who was not White, where some of us--and it is one of the things for which I love Alveda King, Martin Luther King'sniece. I mean, she believes in his dream, and the Americans that voted for Donald Trump, they believe that skin color should notmatter. It is racist to vote for a candidate because of what his race is.  Let's look at the character. Let's look at thequalifications. What have you built that you actually built that someone else didn't build for you? Let's look at those thingsand then make a determination rather than voting for[[Page H92]]someone just because of his race. Let's do as Martin Luther King, Jr.,was so profound in saying in looking forward to the day when people were judged by the content of their character rather thanthe color of their skin. I am looking forward to that day. That day has been set back tremendously.  It was a highlight forme back at the end of the fall to go back to my hometown of Mount Pleasant, I had mentioned to a reporter sometime back,though I didn't vote for President Obama, I had hopes that he would do for America what Coach Willie Williams did for ourfootball team. Actually, I didn't say ``football team.'' I said ``our team.''                              {time}  1745  Liberals immediately put up an article saying that I said my basketball coach, my favorite coach, wasAfrican Apparently, liberals think, if you are African American, you must be a coach of basketball because of yourrace. When actually, it was the year before I went to the varsity, I was on the junior varsity, and I enjoyed playing for CoachWilliams more than any coach I had ever played for.  And unfortunately, Coach Williams' memory is still intact. I haven'tseen him in decades. But I was asked to come give a motivational talk for the team I played for--the Mount Pleasant Itwas such a treat being with those players that morning. It had a rough year to that point. I got to be with them on the fieldduring the game. It was such a treat. Those young people were just inspirational. They fought hard, and some say it was the bestgame of the year. They won singlehandedly against a team from a bigger town than Mount They even gave me the gameball.  And as much as that meant to me, the real highlight was, as we went into halftime, somebody told me that my old coach,back from over 40 years ago, was up in the press box, and I got to go up. I was so thrilled to see him. We hugged and smiled bigas ever. I was so elated in seeing him and talking to him. Somebody said when I got back here--when I said: I finally got to seeCoach Williams after all these years. It was wonderful.  Well, did you get a picture?  I didn't even think about apicture. That is not a very good politician. But I didn't think about a picture. But it is a shame.  His memory is so goodbecause he remembered. We didn't have a lot of talent on that team. We didn't. He made us so cohesive. We played well together.We didn't have any outstanding talent, but we had a winning season. And it was a fun season because Coach Williams made it thatway. He inspired us together. Everybody got treated just the same. Nobody got special treatment. Nobody got treated more harshlythan anybody else. And we came together as a team.  He remembered. He said: Yeah, you guys didn't have much talent on yourteam, but you played so well together. Well, that was because of him. He brought us together.  And I so hoped that PresidentObama would do that for I didn't vote for him, but I thought it will be awesome if he can bring us even closertogether. And now at the end of his administration, it is so grievous that America seems more divided than ever.  I see anarticle here about more police officers again being shot in our U.cities. I heard the former police chief, I believe, inChicago this week saying that Black Lives Matter was supposedly organized to try to stop killings of Black, especially young,men. And yet, what Black Lives Matter has done is actually increase the number of people being shot.  I was absolutelyastounded to hear a quote from the A speech, apparently, he was making. I heard it on the radio. Maybe he was givingan interview. But he was saying that we know that cities that have more gun control laws just have less violence. That is calledgaslighting. That is called creating a fiction and trying to push it across and make somebody who knows the truth think thatthey are crazy and that this alternate truth is really what is going on.  The fact is that cities with the most gun controllaws, like Chicago, for heaven's sakes--I mean, the hundreds of precious Black lives that have been taken, been killed, themassive gun control laws have not helped They have got a massive number of gun control laws there than we do in anycity in east Texas, and yet nowhere in east Texas has that kind of violence at that percentage rate. It is insane.  It istime to quit trying to gaslight the American people, convince them they are going crazy, and that what they know to be true isfiction. It is time to just have a truthful assessment of where we are. We need to follow the law. We need to have enforcementof our borders.  We will continue to be the most generous Nation in the world, not just in giving funds to help others, notjust in giving lives of our citizens to help freedom for other countries like nowhere else in history, but also most generous inthe number of visas and the number of people that we allow to come into the United States and visit. Yet, that generosity hasbeen abused. As the border patrol has said, every time we hear somebody in the government in Washington say anything aboutlegalizing anything, or anybody that is here illegally, it is like a shiny object that draws even greater numbers illegallythrough our borders.  And what is our border patrol ordered to do? Don't turn them back and prevent them from entering theUnited Oh, no. Let them step foot on American soil, then in-process them, and we will ship them around different places.Although, I saw an article last week where there were some aliens illegally here who were just dropped off at a bus stop.  Ihave an article from Julia Edwards Ainsley, January 3, from Reuters: ``Trump Team Seeks Agency Records on Border BarriersSurveillance.'' It is fantastic. I mean, here they are trying to gear up, yet they want to know information. They don't want tobe gaslighted. They want to know what is the truth so that they can start making hard preparations for taking office on  An article, December 30, from Paul Bedard from the Washington Examiner says that the Department of Homeland Securitysays 94 percent of deportations are people illegally here, terror threats, or gang bangers. The CBP--border patrol--reportsassaults on border agents have skyrocketed 231 percent in 2017.  So not only has this President's rules of engagement gottenabout four times more Americans killed, our military members killed in Afghanistan, in the same amount of time as Commander inChief George Bush had, in addition to the rules of engagement getting our people killed four times faster than underCommander in Chief Bush, but also the assaults on our own agents have gone up 231 percent just in this year--in 1 year. We are getting our border patrol harmed.  Another article by Chris Tomlinson in Breitbart: ``600 `Underage'Migrants Turn Out to Be Adults.'' I mean, I have seen that in the middle of the night down on the border. People coming in,switching off Xeroxed indications they were going to use for their identification: This is who I am. For whatever reason, theywould look at their thing and switch out as to who was going to be who. They weren't able to vet those people, but they werestill ordered to in-process them anyway.  This article from Michael Patrick Leahy, December 7, reported that Somaliarefugees were arriving in the United States at the highest rate ever in the first two months of fiscal year 2017, which would beOctober and So just astounding when America was making very clear we need to protect American citizens. It is not justthe people in this room, as we did yesterday, who take that oath, but the President takes that oath. You have got cabinetmembers that take the oath, yet they are not doing their jobs. People are getting killed. 85,000 refugees under Obama, but lessthan 10 to the District of So, apparently, let's put those refugees in your backyard. We certainly don't want them inWashington, D.C.'s backyard, apparently, according to this administration.  Then it is pretty amazing, but just 10 Statesresettled more than half of recent refugees to the United Naturally, way more than anywhere else was California andThe Daily Caller reported that the ``State Department claims no one used sham visas from fake embassy.'' Yet, we haveseen hundreds and hundreds of people that--the report showed--had been[[Page H93]]given citizenship by mistake when they were supposedto have been deported. It doesn't seem like a very innocent mistake when it is that egregious.  Back in December, TheWashington Times reported that the ``Obama administration fails to check immigrants against FBI databases, approvescitizenship'' anyway.  The Afghan refugee program has not been totally successful. A report here, Afghan refugee in Decemberwas arrested for rape and murder of a top EU official's daughter. So, apparently, that was not working out so well. But that wasin the country of Germany where you have a like-minded leader in Angela Merkel, who wants to defeat terrorism, as our Presidentdoes, with love and compassion. Well, love is a stronger emotion than hate. Love can overcome evil.  But when people arereligiously dedicated to wiping another group of people off the planet for what they deem to be their holy god, those are peoplethat have to be defeated. They are at war with you. You defeat them militarily. That puts radical Islam back in a box until someother well-meaning fool like former President Carter--a fine man, just a foolish President--not demeaning his character, but hewas just very foolish--in citing the Ayatollah Khomeini as a man of peace, as he was so welcoming in the Ayatollah Khomeinitaking over That released radical Islam out of the box, gave them control of a major country, major country military, andthousands and thousands and thousands of people continue to die because of that mistake.  We know going back to the earlydays of the United States when so much of the Federal Treasury was used to pay ransom to get our sailors back who were beingcaptured by radical Islamists in North Africa, and Jefferson couldn't understand why they kept attacking American boats.                              {time}  1800  He asked the Islamist whom he was negotiating with why they keptattacking American ships. We are not a threat to you. We don't even have a  Reportedly, the response was, in essence:Look, if we die, in attacking someone like you, we go straight to paradise.  Jefferson was amazed. He couldn't believe therewas a world religion--or even people's interpretation of a world religion--that advocated that you could go to paradise forkilling innocent people. Of course, they maintained they are not innocent because they don't believe exactly like the radicalIslamists believe.  President Obama basically did the same thing with Qadhafi was not a good man; but, since 2003, thereports were clear, as others in North Africa and the Middle East reported, that he was about the best friend that the UnitedStates had in helping to fight terrorism in that area; yet this administration took him out. There were times on this floor thatI and others were begging the administration not to take out Qadhafi, not to keep helping the rebels, not to keep bombingQadhafi's troops until we knew how extensive al Qaeda was. We knew that at least a part of the people fighting were radicalIslamists, but the administration went on and turned the country into chaos.  Thank God America is going to have a newadministration before we completely go to chaos ourselves.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH88-3.txt,1801,ENDING THE REGULATION NATION,2017.0,4.0,January

1074,topic-id,2506,"Mr.Speaker, today we took up what was intended to be a very noble action on 11 to rein in the out-of-control and outrageous actions of so many despots that occupy positions of authority in the United The United Nations, whether you go back to Libya being in charge of human rights, you have U.troops molesting so many females. There are all kinds of problems that have been wrought, and yet the U.has the gall to continually show how bigoted it is and how anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli that it is.  It is easy to find, if anyone bothers to check, that the United Nations never asked once for any other country to pony up land, much less demand that other countries like Jordan, who is a good friend of the United States, but the U.never said: Look, you are occupying this land that they call Palestine, so you have to give it up. They never did until it was controlled by the Israeli people, thus making clear this is really a bigoted move by the U.to constantly slander and slam the nation of  Also, if one wants to conduct another test to check to see how bigoted, if it is, the U.is, you could check on the condemnations by the U.for activities of Compare the facts of those activities and self-defense efforts by Israel and compare them to acts of other nations--the genocide, for example, that even Secretary Kerry, as tough as it was for him to finally admit that there was a genocide of Christians going on in the Middle  Is there any outrage by the U.N.? In fact, the U.head of the refugees who is now the U.General Secretary made clear about over a year and a half ago or so that the reason that they weren't helping Christians to the extent that they were helping Muslim refugees is because of the historic importance Christians have in staying where they were--that means where they are being murdered, where they are having their throats slashed, being crucified, tortured, raped, incinerated. The U.General Secretary, when he was in charge of the refugee program, thought it was very important to leave Christians in the Middle East so they can be murdered in some of the most heinous and egregious fashions imaginable.  So it was just and proper, to borrow from history, that we condemn the United Nations Resolution 2334 as being an obstacle to peace in Palestinians have made clear they don't want peace with They want it eliminated from the map. They name holidays, squares, and all kinds of things for people who go out and kill innocent Jewish children and others just for being They reward the families of those who go and blow themselves up, killing, in atrocious fashions, innocent Israeli people. The United Nations turns a blind eye to it since the U.has become so racist, so bigoted, and so anti-Israel, the most antiterrorist country in all of the Middle East, including north Africa--although Egypt is of great help in that regard these days, and there are those in Libya who would like to. But after President Obama helped turn Libya into absolute anarchy and chaos, then Egypt is having their problems even coming from  What has the U.had to say about all that? Not really anything because if the Muslim Brotherhood supports it, so does, basically, the U.N., and far too often so has the Obama administration.  That is why, I guess, Israel got the lecture from Secretary John Secretary Kerry, even in the days when he talked about the heinous acts of Genghis Khan, never bothered to mention the plight of the poor Palestinians before 1967 when they were under control of the most non-Israeli people you could imagine. There has been no discussion about that, only leveling really bigoted allegations at  So we have 11 today, and I was thrilled because it meant that I was going to be able to come to the floor and vote to condemn the U.passage of U.Security Council Resolution 2334.  Unfortunately, as some of my friends here in Congress have pointed out, I am a bit anal at times. I actually want to read the things that we are going to vote on. So I got my copy of 11, immediately noting that, in the very first whereas, it says the United States has long supported a two-state solution. It does say ``sustainable two-state solution.'' It says: ``Whereas since 1993, the United States has facilitated direct, bilateral negotiations between both parties toward achieving a two-state solution . . . .''  Well, it is the truth that President Clinton twisted the arm of the Israeli Prime Minister and convinced him to basically give Arafat almost everything he wanted. Now, if you believe what Scripture says about Moses going and pleading to Pharaoh to let the Jewish people, the children of Israel, go, we are told that God hardens Pharaoh's heart so that He could make a big demonstration of His power and glory down the road. Although there was suffering that came--great suffering--ultimately, incredible miracles were performed as a result of his hardened heart.  I think it is likely that when Arafat got everything he wanted--almost everything he wanted--in the offer from Israel, I thank God that Arafat turned him down. For anybody that has been in the military and goes to Israel, you can see readily, if Arafat had accepted what the Prime Minister of Israel had been willing, finally, to offer, it would have virtually made Israel indefensible unless they were using nuclear weapons or the threat of nuclear weapons.  Israel needs to be able to defend itself. King David was ruling from Hebron in the year around 1020 B.to around 1012 B.Then he moved, and he was ruling over What is now called the West Bank was actually called Israel--I mean, it was part of the nation of Solomon had control, but he did so from the City of David because that is where, up to Jerusalem, that David had moved the capital from Hebron, which is also where Abraham and Sarah are buried.[[Page H177]]  I have also visited the tomb of David's father, Jesse, that is there in To be told: Oh, no, this needs to be Palestinian lands. The reason some of us think that Hebron, Judea, and Samaria should be Palestinian lands is because 1,600 years after David ruled from Hebron and then Jerusalem, Mohammed came along. Some say it was a vision, some say a dream. Some say he actually, during one night, was taken by a winged horse or donkey and flown to Some say he actually got there and back to bed before morning. Whatever the case, 1,600 years before that did or didn't happen, David was ruling over that whole country.  There is no one alive today descended from any occupants of the Promised Land, the land of Israel, descended from people who lived in that land predating King David and King Saul before him, King Solomon after him--nobody. Nobody alive today has a prior claim. There is nobody, no country, from whom the United Nations has demanded a secession of land back to people that attacked that country and the land was taken back in a defensive mode in protection from the attack.  So at page 3 of our 11, it points out that the U.resolution is a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution. At the bottom of page 5, it says: ``A durable and sustainable peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians will come only through direct bilateral negotiations between the parties resulting in a Jewish, democratic state living side-by-side next to a demilitarized Palestinian state in peace and security.''  Mr.Speaker, there cannot be peace and security in the Middle East when a people are allowed to occupy an area, and those people continue, with the encouragement of the United Nations, with John Kerry and this President, to conduct intensive terrorism on the people of Israel and we continue to condemn the victims of that terrorism.  You can't have peace in a land where the most powerful nation--possibly the most powerful nation up to now. We were at one time. Our Navy is down, I think, to pre-World War I standards, and our troops are down below pre-World War But at one time, we were the most powerful nation. The most powerful or near most powerful nation is taking up for the victims and encouraging that the victims give away more of the land that they have already given so much of to those who are inflicting terror upon them. It is like my friends on the far left, constantly complaining about bullies, who never had been bullied like I was as a small child because I was very small in elementary school.                              {time}  2045  I got beat up a lot, and I defended myself, but it didn't matter. When people are coming after you that are a foot and a half taller than you are and they flunked two grades, you are not going to come out well.  My fifth grade teacher, after I got beat up trying to get back my football I got for Christmas, took me up in front of the class. My nose is still bleeding, dripping down my shirt. She said: I want everybody to see what happens when the little boys try to play with the big boys.  She always took up for the bullies. And that is what this administration has been doing and this is what this United Nations has been doing: taking up for the terrorist bullies.  I am amazed that the nation of Israel has held back all hell breaking loose on the Gaza Strip because of the continued assaults day after day, sending rockets into Israel, Israel spending millions of dollars to protect themselves against the constant attack from the Gaza  And what happens?  They try to protect themselves with a legitimate blockade to make sure nobody is taking rockets in, and the U.and world opinion goes nuts over that.  Page 6 of our resolution we voted on today goes on to say that the House of Representatives calls for United Nations Security Council 2334 to be repealed or fundamentally altered so that it is no longer one-sided and anti- Here is my problem again. B, it allows all final status issues toward a two-state solution be resolved and have direct negotiations between the parties.  Nobody at the U.N., if we are a part of it, and nobody in the United States administration should even mention the little phrase ``two-state solution.'' This body should not even mention in a resolution that we are in any way endorsing a two-state solution.  I know there are a lot of Christians that aren't as familiar with the Bible, perhaps, as they will be one day, but my friend, Joel Rosenberg, pointed out numerous times in the book of Joel, chapter 3:       For look. In those days and at that time I will return the      exiles to Judah and Then I will gather all the      nations. I will bring them down to the Valley of      I will enter into judgment against them there concerning my      people Israel, who are my inheritance, whom they scattered      among the nations.  Then it lists the number one grievance that the God of the Bible, the God I believe in, had against those nations he is going to rain down only hell judgment on. The number one grievance is: they partitioned my land. They divided my land, the promised land.  When the United States Congress embraces, demands that Israel be divided into separate states instead of being able to live in, peacefully, the land that was occupied and promised over 3,000 years ago, I think we are making a big mistake. That is why I had to vote ``no'' on the resolution.  Now just as our leadership rushed this resolution to the floor, I am hopeful they will rush 311 to the floor. I filed it today, this afternoon. 311 is very basic. It says:  ``To withhold United States assessed and voluntary contributions to the United Nations, and for other purposes.  ``Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,  ``Section 1. Short title.  ``This Act may be cited as the `Refusing to Assist Paying for United Nations Actions Against Israel Act' ''.  United States assessed involuntary contributions to the United That is section 2. And the operative wording says:  ``No funds are authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available for assessed or voluntary contributions of the United States to the United Nations or to any organ, specialized agency, commission, treaty or treaty body, or other affiliated body of the United Nations . . . `'  It goes on: `` . . . until such time as United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, regarding Israel's Settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, is repealed in its entirety.''  Then, section 3 says: ``No funds are authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to pay interest on assessed or voluntary contributions that are withheld under this Act.''  So the purpose of that is I am hoping and praying that this body will not just pay lip service to a U.resolution, and actually embrace, as John Kerry, apparently, was saying that day, not much difference between AIPAC's position in supporting this resolution. He may not have mentioned they would support the resolution, but AIPAC's position and John Kerry's position. If you look at what is in the resolution, he may have something there.  This would actually put some teeth into it. This is something that would send a message to the United Nations and the nations around the world that if you are going to continue to be so anti-Israel, so bigoted, so racist, so anti-Jewish, then the United States is not going to continue to fund your outrageous, bigoted activities, your lush, lavish lifestyle.  I would think if we could pass this, the United Nations delayed in withdrawing that resolution or rescinding it, then that should ultimately lead to our denial of any visas to diplomats of the United Then, once that occurs, apparently under the deed to the United Nations, it was only for such time as the headquarters in New York--is the main headquarters of the United So if they can't get diplomats there, they will have to move the headquarters elsewhere and that land would be ceded back to the foundation.  Hopefully, if we will go ahead and do something that has teeth in it and not embrace language that will be fatal to this nation of Israel, we can make a difference. That can bring peace in the world. Terrorists only understand power, and sometimes power is conveyed in the way of money.[[Page H178]]  We should not be funding a United Nations that is so bigoted and so hateful to the nation of  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH176.txt,1801,OBAMACARE,2017.0,5.0,January

1443,topic-id,3733,"Mr.Speaker, it is an honor to be here tonight at the beginning of this new year. It has been great being in east Texas this weekend, last weekend, hearing all of the hope that has arisen as we have entered this new year, 2017. I think it is going to be a good year.  I am told that just on the basis of a new President coming in who is promising to throttle back, remove so much of the heavy, iron boot off of the throat of the economy that firms are starting to hire again. Businesses are making plans to expand and grow. And then we are seeing reports of plants that are deciding to stay in the United States instead of going elsewhere. There is a lot of optimism out there.  There are young people that are asking what was it like back when you came out of college and had multiple job opportunities for most of the people coming out of college instead of opportunities to live with your parents or your grandparents or a parent or the other parent. They actually had multiple job opportunities, and that optimism has arisen.  As we entered this year, also, it is very sad to see a form of racism and negativity that arises. I have said before publicly, and I think it is still true, we need go back no further than the confirmation hearing for Clarence Thomas to the Supreme But the more you look, the more you find that the most persecuted person to be in America these days is a conservative African If you are Black and you are conservative, you can expect[[Page H228]]slings and arrows and hate from all over the country--vicious, mean.  And it was yet another slap, as if the high-tech lynching of the Senate confirmation hearing, as grossly unfair as it was, that woman that withheld any complaints whatsoever, followed a man from job to job, never raised a complaint until he gets ready to be confirmed to the United States Supreme Court, raised allegations that can't possibly be denied or supplemented, verified--not effectively.                              {time}  2030  You raise them 20-plus years. That is why we have laws on the books to protect from allegations too many years after the fact. We have statutes of limitations.  If you sit on something and don't tell people for years and years, and then all of a sudden, for political reasons, you raise up allegations against someone who is basically defenseless--the thing is Clarence Thomas was not defenseless. There were like 15 people, 15 women, who came forward and said: Look, I was there around Anita Hill when these things were going on. Those things never happened. Clarence Thomas is a brilliant, fine man, over and over.  Does any of that come up when HBO talks about him? Of course not because they were out to slander him, libel him, make him appear to be some crazy guy.  The guy is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Some say: well, yeah, of course the only way he got into Harvard--which, at the time, was too conservative, he thought, for him, law school after Holy Cross, and then it was too conservative, and he ends up applying to Yale and going there, one he didn't think quite as conservative.  But he began to notice, as he points out in his book, that the liberals would talk to him about sports and oppression of Black people in America, and that is all they wanted to talk about. But he began to notice that two or three other conservatives, the few that there were in Yale at the time, Yale Law School, basically would talk to him about anything, and I have had a conversation, in prior years, with him about that at  But it is interesting. You know, the liberals say: oh, yeah, we are the ones that care. Now you are only here because we pushed for affirmative action. You couldn't possibly be smart enough to be in a place where I am, the liberals think. So yeah, it is because of us liberals you are here.  No, the guy is brilliant; he deserved to be there on his own merit, on his own intellect. He deserves to be a member of the United States Supreme He deserves the acclaim that he has never properly gotten. But people who have clerked at that Court know the integrity, the intellect, the consistency of Clarence  He was maligned. They thought, basically, it was an effort to ``Bork,'' as it has come to become, or become a verb, what was done to Justice Bork, accuse him of outrageous offenses, derail his confirmation, so that this conservative, principled, qualified individual doesn't make it to the Supreme  Well, the effort worked on assassinating so grossly unfairly the character of Justice Bork, but it didn't work on Clarence Thomas because he is a man of steadfast faith, integrity, and not just the brilliant intellect.  And it is really heartbreaking. I mean, I thought--even though I didn't support President Obama because I didn't want him taking us down a socialist road, a socialist health care road. He talked about these things. The videos were out there. He wanted to get us to where the government controlled health care, single-payer, in other words, socialized medicine, where the government gets to decide whether you get health care or whether it is any good or not and, of course, it ends up not being, most of the time, once the government has total unfettered control.  I didn't want to go those places he wanted to go, but, I think the good thing is, it shows that America is above racism, and this is a man who can bind up this Nation as never before.  And yet, he has spent right at 8 years now creating more division in this country than we have had since the sixties. And who was stirring it up back then? Well, he was in the middle of groups that were stirring it up back then, protege of Bill First fundraiser he had in the home of someone who felt like it was a good idea to kill police, at least try to.  I hear constant allegations that are so unfair. Those who know Jeff Sessions make some very fair observations. I noted the great fairness of someone with whom I disagree often, but Senator Susan  This article from CNN Politics says: `` . . . a moderate Republican elected to the Senate the same year as Sessions in 1996, admits that she and Sessions `don't agree on a host of issues,' but she was happy to accept his''--Jeff Sessions--``request to introduce him at his confirmation hearing alongside senior Alabama Richard Shelby.''  `` `He's a decent, honorable, patriotic individual,' Collins said in an interview in her Senate office. `I felt bad he was not getting a fair shake from those who were denigrating him.' ''  ``The Maine lawmaker''--Susan Collins--``is referring to allegations of racial insensitivity--the same Democrats used to block Sessions from moving through committee thirty years ago.''  ``Collins explained that she is basing her endorsement of Sessions' character on her own experience working with him over the past 20 years.''  Well, isn't that a good thing, Mr.Speaker? You have a Senator that says: You know what? I'm not going to listen to the slings and arrows. I'm going to go based on the evidence that I have seen, heard, and known for myself.  You can denigrate someone all you want, but we are going based on what is real, what is factual; and God bless her for doing so.  ``I don't know what happened more than 30 years ago, when Jeff was nominated to be a district court judge, and his nomination failed,' she said. `But I do know the Jeff Sessions that I have worked with in the past 20 years. And he is a good person, and I believe that he will perform very well as attorney general.''  ``Another Republican colleague who went out of his way to get to know Sessions is Tim Scott, the only African-American GOP In December, Scott invited Sessions to visit his home state of South Carolina, where the two lawmakers met with criminal justice professionals in Charleston.''  And, you know, I have such great regard for my colleagues across the aisle, but I am heartbroken that 30 years after the denial of Jeff Sessions a judicial bench, when the Jeff Sessions that I have come to know in the 12 years I have been in Congress--I have come to know him, I feel like, pretty well. He is a good, decent, fair man. He tries to follow the teachings of Jesus He tries to treat people fairly and equally.  I saw this quote from assistant--he was Assistant District Attorney Thomas Harrison, who had started in helping prosecute regarding the lynching of a 19-year-old--just horrific--19-year-old African American, Michael Donald in And the Assistant District Attorney Harrison, at the time, who prosecuted the case in State Court, he was quoted as saying: ``Sessions asked what we needed''--because Sessions was U.Attorney, what they needed, in other words, to go after the culprits that would do such a horrendous criminal act. And he says: `` . . . I said, in order to get a capital murder conviction, we need these things, and he''--talking about Jeff Sessions--``said that in that regard whatever the federal agents did or the FBI did he would make those things available. He did in fact do that.''  I don't know, that is the kind of Jeff Sessions I have gotten to know over the years, and it is a little heartbreaking to hear allegations about a guy. I really like him.  And then to hear allegations that I have heard made about me in a grossly unfair manner. And I can't explain all of the allegations about--that are so grossly unfair about Jeff But I can address some of the things that have been alleged to make him unfit to be Attorney General that I know are ridiculous.  One of the points that was made was regarding his concern or opposition to the new Voting Rights Act extension, I guess that is what they were talking about, and I know a great deal about that. That comes through the Judiciary Committee, and I know my friend,[[Page H229]]fellow Republican, Jim Sensenbrenner, had reached an agreement with Democrat John Conyers and others, and they weren't letting amendments get through.  I was trying to make the point clear, if you want to save the Voting Rights Act, you can't keep punishing a State because they did something wrong 50 years ago. That is not constitutional. And if you insist on continuing to put these punitive positions in the Voting Rights Act that will continue to punish southern States that have recorded these days, and it was pretty well true across the South, they had less racial disparity than places in the North, in Wisconsin, in Massachusetts, in  Yet, people from these other States, because they made a majority, said: we don't care that they are--there is less racial disparateness in those southern states. There was harm 50 years ago, and there was, and it needed to be cleaned up. It desperately needed to be cleaned up, and we needed a Voting Rights Act in order to help cure the evils.  But what was pushed through in a voting rights extension, with my opposition--and I don't know what Jeff's arguments were, but I know how wrong it was. And I came down here, and my friend--and I mean that--my friend, John Conyers, was sitting right there, and it was toward the end of the year. And I said: Look, I have talked to liberal law deans from different parts of the country, New York, California, Texas; and when we discuss what you have put in the Voting Rights Act, you are still treating States punitively that are now doing better than California, New York, Massachusetts, at least some districts in those Wisconsin had a district with a huge problem.  You can't do that. It is going to be ruled unconstitutional. And I still cannot support it, but why don't we do a joint amendment and fix this?  And my friend, John Conyers, he is a very honorable man, and he said: Let me talk to some of our folks. And when I talked to him before the end of the year, he said: We think it is okay, and the people I talked to think it is okay. We don't need to amend it. We are going to leave it just like it is.  Well, it is wrong. Whether it is in a Voting Rights Act, whether it is in a criminal bill, a civil bill, if you are punishing people for the sins of their grandfathers or fathers, it is wrong. It is un-And I don't know if Jeff Sessions has called something like that un-American, but I will.  When you try to punish an individual for something their father or grandfather did, that is un-That is wrong.  And lo and behold, the liberal law professors and deans that I have talked to across the country, before I begged--well, I begged Jim He was sitting at the back right back there.                              {time}  2045  He said: Nope, we are not touching that bill.  They were happy to let it go to the Supreme Court one day just the way it was. Just as I explained to John Conyers right here, just as I explained to Jim Sensenbrenner right back there, this should be struck down if the U.Supreme Court is going to be fair and partial and follow the  You can't keep punishing people for something their fathers or grandfathers did when they are doing better than people in your own State and you vote to punish them. Why? Because you can. Their fathers or grandfathers committed a wrong many years ago. A grievous wrong it was, and it needed correction. There are some places where it still does, but you don't keep punishing people 50 years after they bring up their problem.  So I hear people say Jeff Sessions is not fit because he opposed the Voting Rights I tried to clean it up. It had an un-American provision in there.  I just can't believe anybody on either side of the aisle would continue to support the idea that we should punish children or grandchildren for something their father or grandfather did many years ago. This child has become an adult and they have made sure there is fairness abounding. Well, there is always going to be injustice.  One of the great problems in this Justice Department is that it was always quick to take up for someone who had been shot by policemen--before they knew any of the facts--and demonize the local police. Sometimes--in rare cases, but every now and then--they did deserve demonizing. But the Department of Justice should not demonize them before we find out the facts.  In most of those cases, when we find out the facts, whether it is Baltimore or other places, most of the time people or even a professor of some kind, like the President, said he acted stupidly, talking about the policeman. It turned out the policeman conducted himself very reasonably. We never did hear whether the President apologized to the policeman or not, but the point is that the President and the Justice Department have spent 8 years dividing us in ways I did not believe were possible 8 years ago.  So I hear my friends come in here and start condemning a man as not being fit to serve because of things like opposing an unconstitutional, un-American provision in the Voting Rights It was then, it is today. If somebody tries to pass a punishment of some group of people for something their grandparents did, it is wrong, it is un-I will say it to the day I die.  Now, it is very unfair. I saw it as a felony judge. It broke my heart. In chambers, but never in the courtroom itself, it would bring me to tears. I would break down when I saw the suffering of children because of the sins of their parents. But the government should not be in the business of punishing people intentionally. There was a provision in the Voting Rights Act that did just that.  I also heard an allegation about Jeff Sessions either opposing a hate crime extension or hate crime bill. I can tell you from conversations I had years past, back when we were talking about hate crimes bills, we did not need hate crime laws.  What was the fake news that was trotted out here in Washington, trotted out around the country?  Remember what happened down in south Texas?  It wasn't in my district, but I am familiar with what happened down there. There were three White guys that took a poor, decent African American, used a chain, tied him to their truck, and drug him until he was dead. It was in print and publicly.  I would personally have no problem with a jury ordering a sentence, if we could put it in the law, so that the family of that victim could decide what they were going to use to drag the defendants and the terrain they would drag those White defendants over, but that is not the law.  The law in Texas is that our juries can find you guilty and sentence you. Well, the juries don't actually sentence death. That is left to the judge. The juries answer three questions. I know. I have put it to juries three times.  On one occasion the jury came back locked up, so I sentenced that defendant to life. On two occasions of three capital murder cases I tried to completion, the jury found unanimously, number one, he committed the murder and he knew that a murder was going to be committed; number two, that he is a future danger to society; and number three, there was no evidence that mitigated against the imposition of the death penalty.  The jury comes back with yes, yes, and no; and it is left to a judge like me to look a man in the eyes and tell him that I sentence him to death. There is nothing that goes to your soul like looking someone in the eye and saying: You are going to be taken to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and you are going to be put to death for the crimes you have committed.  I believe in the death penalty, but I believe with all my heart you have to make sure due process occurs. I could care less about race.  I hear these allegations about Jeff I know Jeff and I know this is ridiculous. As I was listening to some of these broad statements just taking a swat at Jeff Sessions, a really fine, decent man, it took me right back to 20 years or so ago when I was that felony district judge in Texas and I tried capital murder cases, murder cases. Never mind the fact that I was court-appointed to appeal the capital murder conviction of an African American man and I did everything I possibly could ethically and within the[[Page H230]]law for my client, who I believed was wrongly convicted in this case.  His case was overturned after my argument. I was the only one arguing for our side. I was the one that solely did the brief. Even though the family paid thousands of dollars to somebody from another State, I did the whole thing. I did it all. I didn't have a clerk do it. I did it all.  His capital murder conviction was reversed. His mother used to bring me wonderful food. I loved her. I went to her funeral. She was just an incredible Christian woman and her funeral did her justice. Of course, then her daughter ran against me for Congress three times, but that is another story.  Nonetheless, I can remember back when I was a felony judge and I got served with a subpoena by a defense lawyer. They had taken the position in a pleading in another court that, because I had allegedly appointed a disparate number of White people to be grand jury foremen over African Americans, I must be bigoted. Therefore, convictions in Smith County should be overturned. I think they subpoenaed another district judge or two. We had three.  I knew that lawyer. He knew I wasn't a racist. He subpoenaed me and made allegations in print before he even knew who had been on my grand juries during those years I was a felony district judge, but he made the broad-based allegation that I must be racist and we have got to throw out these cases.  Before I came to testify, he actually got the list of my grand jurors. I didn't get to choose the grand jurors. Those were chosen by grand jury commissioners. The commissioners chose the grand jury members. I got to choose the grand jury foremen. I didn't care about race. I didn't care about gender. I appointed people because, when I looked at the background, the little bios we had on each of the grand jury members, I wanted somebody that was going to be a leader on that grand jury. I didn't care about race.  When the criminal defense lawyers did their homework after they made allegations, they notified me that I would not be called as a witness because I appointed too many African American grand jury foremen. Therefore, it was a disparate number of African It was too many. Therefore, I would hurt their case because I would show that maybe I was more biased for African Americans than against them. I didn't care about race.  I can remember a couple of grand jury foremen. One of them was, I think, an assistant school superintendent. I knew the guy. He was a solid citizen. I had seen him in action. He was a real leader in the community. He was an honest, fair man. I thought he would be great as a grand jury foreman. And he was.  Probably the best grand jury foreman I ever appointed--she was a saint--was ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgH227-3.txt,1801,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONTHE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--MOTION TO PROCEED",2017.0,9.0,January

That is a nice thing, being in a body where I actually have respect for the people in the body, a good thing.  We know that elections, as President Obama told us quite succinctly 8 years ago, have consequences. Elections do have consequences, and we have a new team coming to town. One of the things that has concerned me greatly, and I know it has concerned many in this body, is that we as a Nation have had the ability to give protection basically to this idea of freedom that our Founders had, cultivated, and gave their lives to create.  As I have mentioned from this podium previously, as I was told by some west African Christians in Togo, they said:       We were so excited when you elected your first Black      President, but since your President has been there, we have      seen America get weaker and weaker.

And that is while America is supposed to be the strongest nation in the world.  Mr.Speaker, I see a friend is here on the floor, and I now yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.Mooney).

1781,topic-id,4035,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate so much my friend Mr.Mooney's points. Well made.  This administration hasn't turned around health care in America, hasn't seen more choices, people keeping their doctors, keeping their insurance policies they liked. They have seen deductibles skyrocket, such that so many people across America have had $5-, $6-, $7-, $8,000 deductibles. We never had deductibles that high before.  What that effectively meant was they weren't going to get any health insurance help. They were totally on their own, that every single payment that they made, even if they got subsidies from the Federal Government, was for nothing. They got no help. They could never come up with enough money in 1 year to meet the deductible so that the insurance would start paying in.  What is even more egregious is that apparently we found out that much of this was known would happen before people had ObamaCare forced onto them.  Then, in the last week we have had this story from Stephen Dinan, from The Washington Times, finding out that the IRS prioritized their role in ObamaCare over taxpayer customer service. That is what their own inspector general report said.  You would think that an administration that says their number one concern was America's health care, that they would not drive so many people off of the insurance they had, they loved, that they could afford, that had the doctor in the system they could use, had the medicine in the policy covered that they could use. Millions have been driven off of their policies to Medicaid, which so many doctors don't even take, and this administration has called that a great victory.  Yet, in the midst of all of this, we knew--it was talked about back in 2010 when this bill was being passed--that there could be 18,000, 17-, 18,000 new IRS agents that would force ObamaCare upon the country. And as so many people have reported, when you get notice from the Internal Revenue Service that they are coming after you, it does not do anything to enhance your health.  KLTV, in my hometown, contacted me here today, wanting to know more about what was happening with the It has been outrageous what they have been doing across the country in their local taxpayer service assistance offices.  It was reported to us that a sign was put up by one of the IRS employees that, basically, if you don't like the long line and the bad service, then contact your Member of Congress--and fortunately, many did, so we became acutely aware of it.  And what was worse, I mean, we had an office in Some people are able to go--are required to go get documentation from the IRS in order to do[[Page H287]]what they need, whether it is with insurance, with their employer, and they couldn't get into the IRS office. The IRS office closed in Longview, making it so much more difficult for Americans in east Texas to get the customer service they needed.  Well, this article from The Washington Times points out that the IRS has made things much more painful for taxpayers than it should have been, and that is according to the IRS' inspector general. That was in a report Thursday that accused the agency of cutting money for customer service and ignoring phone calls while moving the money over to keep ObamaCare and other administration priorities on track.  Well, what that means is the IRS would be there to bully people who had concerns about or problems with ObamaCare, which certainly would not help their health at all.  But one reporter had told me that previously they were told by the IRS that Congress cut funding and, you know, that is why customer service was cut. Yet, when we presented the actual facts of what had happened, yes, in the past 6 years, the House of Representatives--not the Senate, for heaven's sake. They haven't cut anything in their own House of But the House of Representatives cut our own budgets about 22 percent over a 3-year period, and that is pretty dramatic.  Anybody that has ever had to cut their budget by a fourth understands. Americans have had to do that across the country. We did it right here in the House of Representatives, and it has been very difficult for some of our offices to provide the care for constituents. So many areas, we are it. We are the ones that can help them stand up against the bureaucracy and demand that they get what the government is required to provide, and yet we were able to do it.  On the other hand, the IRS wasn't cut 22 percent like the House cut ourselves down to the bone. In fact, they had a substantially smaller cut over 2 years, I believe it was.  In this past year, we increased the amount of money the IRS got by millions and millions of dollars. What the IRS chose to do is not help taxpayer service, which could also help the IRS from increasing their punitive work against taxpayers that make mistakes because they didn't get proper advice or service from the IRS assistance.  But no, they moved the money. The massive increase we gave to the IRS, they moved it over to be a bigger bully regarding ObamaCare and cut out offices, like the one in Longview, and fell more into the stereotype than I have ever seen for the IRS, this as ``IRS employees ignored more than 30 million phone calls from desperate taxpayers seeking help in the run-up to the 2015 filing deadline--and those who did get through often waited a half hour before getting help.  ``The IRS apologized publicly for the poor service and blamed Congress, saying lawmakers needed to pony up more money if they wanted better results.  ``But Inspector General Russell George said the IRS cut its own funding by eliminating nearly $150 million from customer service, slashing more than 2,000 staff positions''--and that is so they could go after more enforcement of ObamaCare, as if ObamaCare wasn't doing enough damage to people's health as it was.  As my friend, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady pointed out: ``The IRS is running out of excuses for its abysmal customer service record and poor management decisions.'' This new report is even more proof the IRS is failing the very people it was created to serve--American taxpayers.  Congress did add more money for the agency last year, just as I was saying, Mr.This article also echoes the same thing. The IRS doubled the number of calls it was able to answer, but the agency has promised to maintain a level of service for next year.  But let's face it, the IRS has shown they will target people because of their political beliefs. They will allow themselves--not just allow themselves. They insert themselves and have allowed themselves to be political weapons. Certainly saw that occurred from what has come out from 2012.  Did they affect the election? It is hard to say. But they certainly prevented many conservative groups from being able to organize.  I have heard some who are liberal, not that smart, asking questions: Well, I don't see how that would hurt conservative groups just because the IRS did not recognize them. They could still have gone ahead and organized and done their thing.  Again, apparently they pay too much attention to the mainstream media and don't think for themselves, because when one begins to understand the power of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States, you put a group together and you pool your money into one pool to start spending as a group, somebody's going to be in trouble and going to be accounting for that money as income. I mean, there may be creative ways to handle it, but the way you are supposed to handle it is to get recognition from the Internal Revenue Service that you have a group that can come together, put your money together, and work together toward a common goal. Liberal groups have not had much problem getting that kind of approval, but conservative groups really were targeted by the  And there is a law--we didn't need to pass a new one--that, according to the facts that have come out regarding Lois Lerner and others at the IRS, it certainly appears that there is probable cause to believe crimes were committed and should have been pursued. Yet nothing was done.  Why?  Because they were groups that were persecuted, not allowed to organize, that did not support this administration; therefore, according to the Justice Department that became more of ``just us department,'' they weren't going to pursue anything like that.  And in the further category of further de-Americanization of America, this report from Paul Bedard that U.shipped 6 of 10 refugees to the United States, even more this year.  Then there is a list from the United Nations refugee resettlement referrals. This report just came out in the last week, less than a week. The U.reports that of the 134,044 refugees settled in 2015, gee, 82,491 of the 134,000 were sent to the United States, that despite the fact information came out, study done, that actually we can support 12 refugees in place in the Middle East for the same price of bringing 1 refugee to the United                              {time}  1845  In fact, this administration didn't have to use the term redline. This administration could have simply said: we are going to make sure there is a safe zone in which people can live in the Middle East in a certain area and the U.will assist them with food--hopefully, without raping the women and girls, because they have in some areas. We will provide them a safe zone, and their needs will be cared for there. We can handle 12 times as many for the same price as bringing 1 into the United  I think voters understood that, when they voted Donald Trump as President, there are so many of these refugees that simply cannot be vetted.  We know this administration has made mistake after mistake, not only with people that we have no information to use to determine whether or not they are a threat because we have no background information on so many of these, but also, once they are here, we don't know where they are, we don't know where they go. We don't know even the threat.  Then, on top of that, we find out hundreds, maybe thousands--we know hundreds--of people were supposed to be deported that this administration accidentally--instead of deporting them and getting them out of the country so they were no longer a threat, this administration accidentally granted them citizenship.  There are some things that this government could do and you would say: well, it is easy to understand. That is an easy mistake. Instead of a 1, they put an 11. Or, instead of a 0, they put a 3.  Instead of deporting people and getting them out of our country, this administration accidentally gives them citizenship and has made clear that they are not capable of protecting us from the threats that we are seeing all over Europe and other areas of the world.  A point of personal privilege, really, I would like, Mr.Speaker, a shout out to the TSA, which is underneath our[[Page H288]]Department of Homeland It was such an honor to be singled out last Friday for the two molestations. Apparently, I am attractive when it comes to TSA agents. They want to feel up and down, make sure all the parts are actually attached.  They did a very good job of that both times on Friday evening when I was flying back to So my thanks to the Job well done. It delayed me 30 minutes or so. I kept thinking the TSA agent was going to lie back and have a cigarette or something, but that never happened.  Anyway, due regards for the I am really and truly hoping that we can change substantially management of the TSA in this coming year. At airport after airport, we see two, three, four times longer lines for the TSA PreCheck than there is for the general boarding. Yet, TSA continues to encourage people to go ahead and apply. We can streamline your getting through the inspection. And yes, that does mean when you are in PreCheck, you will enjoy having hands laid on you, not in a Christian kind of sense.  Over and over, there are good TSA agents, I am finding, all over the country, but the management is atrocious. How long would any security agency stay in business if every day they had longer lines in one area that was the least threat to our security as they do in the general boarding lines that need to be more carefully monitored, we are told? Well, you would fire them. You would hire another security agency.  I haven't seen a study done on this, but, as I recall--I was watching back during my days as a judge and chief justice, and I will have to go back and look--there were so many screams from Congress, especially the Senate, especially on the other side of the aisle, that we have got to have the Federal Government take over security at the airports. We have got to. We are in such danger. We have to have that happen.  Has security been enhanced by adding tens of thousands of people to the government unions? No, it hasn't. It really hasn't.  So, what I want to go back and look at, it seems like I remember back years ago, after the Democrats were able to prevail over Republicans who were in the majority and get them to agree to federalize the security at airports so that they could get them in the government unions, I was thinking, I don't know that that is really going to help. Are we going to see a better quality of TSA agent than we had in private security? I would like to see an official number.  Maybe if somebody in Homeland Security is listening, Mr.Speaker, they could, in their time between looking the other way as people come into the country illegally, they might just look up how many private security airport personnel were not hired by  The reason for federalizing the security was so that we will get a better quality of security. It seems like there was a lawsuit back there by a couple hundred people, maybe. We are the only ones not hired by Out of the thousands and thousands, we are the only ones that weren't hired.  It seems like there was a problem in response that yeah, we really needed people that could read and had finished high school. If you couldn't read or hadn't finished high school, we really needed that level.  So, basically, it seems what happened is one group here in Congress--and it wasn't the Republicans--had their way. The security at airports was federalized. We are not seeing an increased percentage of capturing items that are coming in, but I have got to say they do a good job of feeling up and down my person.  I am not really a threat, though Homeland Security would assume that. Well, I was in the Army for 4 years. I am a strong I believe in the Bible, and I believe in the United States Constitution as the greatest governing document that was ever promulgated.  Apparently, according to the minds at the top of this Homeland Security Department, that makes me more of a threat than most anybody in the country. I was even told back in London, coming back, I believe that was from another trip to Egypt or maybe Israel, and I had to go out from security and come back through. I was told by one of the security guys: Sir, I know who you are and your position, but your Homeland Security Department tells us we have to thoroughly inspect your baggage and you personally. I got it from the British security folks as well.  Apparently, if you believe in the Constitution, you believe in the Bible, you have served your country in the United States Army, and you are a Christian then you are a big-time threat.  It will be so nice to have an administration that doesn't see the world the way this administration has seen it.  We had a lecture from the Secretary of The President of the United States said amen and hallelujah when he condemned Israel over and over and over. We stabbed our friend, Israel, in the back. There are reports in some sectors that not only did we abstain but we encouraged the resolution to be brought forward so that Israel could be condemned.  It apparently generated this article from Victor Davis Hanson from National He said:  ``Secretary of State John Kerry, echoing other policymakers in the Obama administration, blasted Israel last week in a 70-minute rant about its supposedly self-destructive policies. Why does the world, including now the U.S.''--I would submit, Mr.Speaker, not for much longer--``single out liberal and lawful Israel but refrain from chastising truly illiberal countries? Kerry has never sermonized for so long about his plan to solve the Syrian crisis that has led to some 500,000 deaths or the vast migrant crisis that has nearly wrecked the European No one in this administration has shown as much anger about the many thousands who have been killed and jailed in the Castro brothers' Cuba, much less about the current Stone Age conditions in Venezuela or the nightmarish government of President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, an ally nation.  ``President Obama did not champion the cause of the oppressed during the Green Revolution of 2009 in Did Kerry and Obama become so outraged after Russia occupied South Ossetia, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine?  ``Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power was never so impassioned over the borders of Chinese-occupied Tibet, or over Turkish-occupied Northern  ``In terms of harkening back to the Palestinian `refugee' crisis that started in the late 1940s, no one talks today in similar fashion about the Jews who survived the Holocaust and walked home, only to find that their houses in Eastern Europe were gone or occupied by others. Much less do we recall the 11 million German civilians who were ethnically cleansed from Eastern Europe in 1945 by the Soviets and their imposed Communist governments. Certainly, there are not still `refugee' camps outside Dresden for those persons displaced from East Prussia 70 years ago.  ``More recently, few nations at the U.faulted the Kuwaiti government for the expulsion of 200,000 Palestinians after the liberation of Kuwait by coalition forces in 1991. Yet on nearly every issue--from `settlements' to human rights to the status of women--U.members that routinely violate human rights target a liberal Israel.''                              {time}  1900  ``When President Obama entered office, among his first acts were to give an interview with the Saudi-owned news outlet Al Arabiya championing his outreach to the most nondemocratic Islamic world and to blast democratic Israel on `settlements.'  ``Partly, the reason for such inordinate criticism of Israel''--well, the article says ``sheer cowardice,'' but that might be inappropriate for a Member to say about the President, so I am not even going to read that part. ``If Israel had 100 million people and was geographically large, the world would not so readily play the bully.  ``Instead, the United Nations and Europe would likely leave it alone--just as they give a pass to human-rights offenders such as Pakistan and If Israel were as big as Iran, and Iran as small as Israel, then the Obama administration would have not reached out to Iran and would have left Israel alone.  ``Israel's supposed Western friends sort out Israel's enemies by their relative natural resources, geography, and population--and conclude that supporting Israel is a bad deal in cost/benefit terms.[[Page H289]]  ``Partly, the criticism of Israel is explained by oil--an issue that is changing daily as both the U.and Israel cease to be oil importers.  ``Still, about 40 percent of the world's oil is sold by Persian Gulf nations.''  And I might add parenthetically, when we have a new President, that will drop even further because the United States will begin to produce more of the energy that we have been blessed with. There will be more nations in the world that will not have to go begging to Russia, which supposedly those on the left are so concerned about these days. Well, if they are so concerned, let us produce more west Texas oil, more east Texas natural gas, more oil and gas from around the country, and, boy, we will be energy independent. And as smart people have pointed out for a long time, it is a whole lot easier to take on terrorists who are throwing rocks than terrorists who are launching nuclear weapons.  Back to this point being made here in National Review: ``Partly, the criticism of Israel is explained by oil--an issue that is changing daily as both the U.and Israel cease to be oil importers.  ``Still, about 40 percent of the world's oil is sold by Persian Gulf nations. Influential nations in Europe and China continue to count on oil imports from the Middle East--and make political adjustments accordingly.  ``Partly, anti-Israel rhetoric is due to herd politics. The Palestinians--illiberal and reactionary on cherished Western issues like gender equality, homosexuality, religious tolerance, and diversity--have grafted their cause to the popular campus agendas of race/class/gender victimization.  ``Western nations in general do not worry much about assorted non-Western crimes such as genocides, mass cleansings, or politically induced famines. Instead, they prefer sermons to other Westerners as a sort of virtue-signaling, without any worries over offending politically correct groups.  ``Partly, the piling on Israel is due to American leverage over Israel as a recipient of U.aid. As a benefactor, the Obama administration expects that Israel must match U.generosity with obeisance. Yet the U.rarely gives similar `how dare you' lectures to less liberal recipients of American aid, such as the Palestinians,'' for example, ``for their lack of free elections,'' not to mention their lack of paying, encouraging, immortalizing people who are suicide bombers who are successful in killing innocent victims.  The article says: ``Partly, the cause of global hostility toward Israel is jealousy. If Israel were mired in Venezuela-like chaos, few nations would care. Instead, the image of a proud, successful, Westernized nation as an atoll in a sea of self-inflicted misery is grating to many. And the astounding success of Israel bothers so many failed states that the entire world takes notice.  ``But partly, the source of anti-Israelism is ancient anti- ``If Israelis were Egyptians administering Gaza or Jordanians running the West Bank'' as they did for 20 years or so, ``no one would care. The world's problem is that Israelis are Thus, Israel earns negative scrutiny that is never extended commensurately to others.  ``Obama and his diplomatic team should have known all this. Perhaps they do, but they simply do not care.''  Then we find out this administration, we see what happens when there is yet another terrorist attack in What does this administration do after such a powerful chastising of our dear friend Israel?  But ``a Palestinian who may be linked to ISIS rammed his speeding truck into a group of Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem Sunday, killing four people and wounding 15 others before being shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a year-long campaign of violence.''  Now, even that, from friends at FOX News, is not as accurate as it could be. Yes, they were soldiers that were killed. They were on a sight-seeing tour, and apparently the insidious radical Islamist sat parked and waited for them to be in a vulnerable position, not in a position to use weapons, not fighting. They were sightseeing. As this radical Islamist saw these people getting off the bus, that is when he moved and became the murdering, blood-thirsty, radical Islamist that he was.

1782,topic-id,1460,"Mr.Speaker, I wanted to finish talking about this issue that has been raised about the Russians being such a big threat to our elections. Some of us have been screaming here on Capitol Hill that we need to have security of the And as part of that, one of the last things we needed to do was give control over Web site determinations to the international community. That was created as an American entity, the We had control over ICANN, the organization controlling the Web sites, and this President did irreparable damage to our security. Oh, I know he thinks he didn't, so I am not accusing anything untoward, but irreparable damage was done by giving over that power to the so-called international community.  This article from John Fund, who had a great book about election fraud, points out, and he quotes from a former colleague, Rahm Emanuel: ```You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,' Rahm Emanuel, Obama's just-named chief of staff, told a Wall Street Journal conference of top CEOs in November 2008 while his boss was still President-elect. Since then a slew of constitutionally dubious executive orders, presidential emergencies, and rushed legislation have characterized the Obama presidency. Now he is leaving office by issuing a blizzard of `midnight regulations' and edicts.  ``One of the most troublesome came last Friday and gave the federal government the power to begin centralizing our election systems. The Constitution explicitly gives states the power to set the `times, manner and places of holding elections.'  ``But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson used the excuse of Friday's release of a report on Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee to declare that state and local voting systems will be designated as `pieces of critical infrastructure' so that the U.Department of Homeland Security can protect them from hackers.  ``His move--coming just 15 days before President Obama leaves office--led many experts to question both its wisdom and its constitutionality. `While the Federal Government has the general power to protect the nation's cyber infrastructure, it cannot intrude into areas of state sovereignty without clear constitutional mandate,' John Yoo, a law professor at UC Berkeley, told CNSNews.com.  ```There is no federal power to control or secure elections. Each state administers its own elections, restricted only by constitutional protections for voting rights,' agreed Illya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato `It may make sense for states to request federal support here, but it would set a dangerous precedent for a federal agency to unilaterally take over state electoral processes.  ``Secretary Johnson's decision sparked outrage among many of those who are most knowledgeable about our election system--the 50 secretaries of state who, along with local officials, run the election process. Even Johnson admitted that `many of them are opposed to this designation.'  ``Secretary of State Brian Kemp of Georgia, told me in an interview that Johnson's action `uses security as an excuse to subvert the Constitution and establish the basis for Federal encroachment into election systems.'''  Now, Mr.Speaker, I think it is important to pause and look at what happened in this last election. Now, there have been some people saying, as I heard down at the Senate in the Kennedy Room at Jeff Sessions' hearing this morning, there were 17 intelligence agencies that agreed about the Russian hacking. Well, I am not sure. They must have seen something I didn't, but I had understood there was, like, three, and that we have been told actually they had these conclusions, but people have admitted--no, actually, they didn't hack our election system. They didn't hack any voting machines. Clapper even admitted that. Of course, he has said: I have testified very falsely. He has admitted under oath that he has not been truthful under oath to the Senate before.  So as a law professor once asked: If you have admitted lying, well--he[[Page H290]]would say--are you lying now or were you lying then? If you admit you are lying, which one is really the lie?  We don't know. Is he lying now or lying then?  You have said--you have told us you are a liar. Which one is it?  What we find among smart juries, once they found you lied to them, is that they are not going to trust you about anything else. I think that contributed to the voting results we had.  But Conservative HQ had an article: ``Russian Hacking Story A Twofer For Obama And the Left.'' Say, gee, they get to blame the Russians and they get to take control of the voting system.                              {time}  1915  Well, all that has come out is somebody hacked John Podesta's emails--most likely an unprotected server like Hillary Clinton was using--and we lost secrets we may never know. But it was unprotected. Podesta's was at least protected. And people saw published what Democratic people participating in the Hillary Clinton campaign had said about Christians, Catholics, the duplicity of trying to bring down Bernie Sanders, the duplicity at debates, the if it is not illegal, the certainly rule-violating strategies of revealing questions before a debate.  Shockingly, when the truth was revealed and certain people in the Hillary Clinton administration, or in their campaign, were exposed as lying about so many things, those people are now saying: Hey, when America found out we were lying, they voted against They hurt our election. They affected our election because we were exposed as liars and it cost us votes. That is grossly unfair. The American people should never have known the truth that we were lying about so many things, that we were conspiring to bring down Bernie Sanders and defeat him unfairly. The American people weren't supposed to find those things out and, doggone it, those Russians need to be punished.  Well, I don't know where it came from. And I also know, as a fact, that some intelligence personnel have lied to the chairman of our Intel Committee in the last I know it is a fact. I don't know who it was, but they did.  When you have Clapper say, Yeah, I came in here and testified about a bunch of stuff that wasn't true, you wonder wouldn't it be a good idea to take those incredible individuals in our intelligence agencies that have been faithful to our country, served our country, not their political agenda, and done great things for America, let's get them in the positions of authority in the intelligence agencies. And since they have been working there, they will know what to do; they will know who to trust, who not to trust.  As you find out, if you ever sit on the bench as a felony judge very long, it doesn't matter what area of life you are in, there are people that are not honest. Fortunately, in law enforcement, intelligence agencies, homeland security, places like that, in my opinion, there is a much higher number of good, honorable, honest people that care about providing for the safety of the American people. That is where we need to go. Find those people in those departments and put them in positions of leadership.  We have a great opportunity now before us, and if you are agnostic or atheist, you should believe it was all a roll of the dice. This kind of stuff happens. Hey, even a pragmatist agnostic would probably say: Well, if I am honest, somebody--Julian Assange said it wasn't the Indications were it may well have been an unhappy Democratic operative in the party that provided. But wherever they came from, information was provided to the American public showing the terribly unfair and untruthful things that have been said or done, and they voted against the party that had apparently done the unfair, untruthful things.  So I think we need to look, as Shakespeare would say, not to our stars, but in ourselves. Personally, I think we were mercifully given another chance to give back to the American people the power that this Congress and the executive branch has used for far too long and let America be America, not the evil parts--the KKK, the lynchings, the horrid things that mar our history--but the goodness, the part of America that would say, ``I don't care about the I am going to take you into my home. I am going to protect you''; the parts of America that said, ``I don't care what color your skin is. We are fellow human beings and we have got some good ideas and we are going to work together and we are going to raise this Nation to heights it has never seen before.'' I am hoping and praying that is where we are headed.

536,topic-id,876,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker,Federal bureaucrats are continuously creating new and more complicated and costly burdens on hardworking Americans in the formof unnecessarily burdensome regulations. Clearly, some regulation is necessary to protect public safety, set general rules ofthe road, and accomplish other important goals.  However, despite the fact that these goals can often be accomplished withrelatively simple guidance, Washington bureaucrats seem more determined than ever to create the most complicated puzzles theycan imagine, regardless of the compliance costs for small businesses or the new and innovative products entrepreneurs are forcedto shelve in order to comply with these overly complicated regulations.  Bureaucrats also don't seem to care that Americanfamilies face higher prices for goods and have fewer job opportunities when employers are unnecessarily forced to factorwasteful costs of complying with overly burdensome regulations into their bottom lines.  That is why, at the very beginningof the 115th Congress, we are prioritizing legislation to remove unnecessary regulatory burdens. Doing so is one of thefundamental steps we can take to make America more competitive again[[Page H75]]and put more Americans back to work again.  Today,our specific focus is on reforming regulations that are hastily cobbled together in the waning weeks and months of an outgoingadministration. These regulations are particularly susceptible to abuse and, thus, have an even greater potential to underminejob opportunities, wages, and American competitiveness.  As the Obama administration rushes to a close, Americans' freedomand prosperity are increasingly threatened by one of the most abusive features of modern bureaucracy--midnight regulation.  Midnight regulation is one of the most vexing problems in Washington's overreaching regulatory system. Administration afteradministration, there is a spike in rulemaking activity during the last year of a President's term--particularly between electionday and Inauguration Day, but even in the months before then.  These successive waves of midnight regulation present deeplytroubling issues. First and foremost, because outgoing administrations are no longer accountable to the voters, they are muchmore prone to issue midnight regulations that fly in the face of the electoral mandate the voters just gave the new, incomingadministration.  Waves of midnight rules can also be very hard for Congress or a new administration to check adequately. As anew Congress and President begin their terms, both understandably must be focused on implementing the new priorities within themandates the voters have given them. That doesn't always leave time to focus on cleaning up all of the last acts of thedeparting administration.  In addition, the Congressional Review Act currently allows Congress to disapprove ofregulations--including midnight regulations--only one at a time. A wave of midnight regulations can easily overwhelm Congress'ability to use one-rule-at-a-time resolutions as an effective check.  Finally, it is well-documented that the rush byoutgoing administrations to impose midnight rules before the clock strikes 12 leads to more poorly analyzed rules with lowerquality and lower benefits.  The Obama administration has imposed more runaway regulation than any other in memory, and itsmidnight rulemaking period is no exception. When the House considered this legislation in the wake of last November's election,the administration had issued or planned to issue at least 180 midnight rules within the scope of this bill, including multiplebillion-dollar rules and more than 20 major rules imposing $100 million or more in costs per year.  In the intervening weeks,these figures have rapidly ballooned to the 226 midnight rules issued or planned. During just the week of December 12, theadministration issued 18 midnight regulations, imposing over $2 billion in new costs. But this is not a partisan issue.Administrations of both parties have issued midnight rules in the past.  The Judiciary Committee has been searching for aneffective solution to this problem for some time, and I applaud our colleague, Mr.Issa, for offering the Midnight RulesRelief Act to respond to the need. This bill offers a simple and powerful means to stop the problem of abusive midnightrules--allowing Congress to disapprove of any and all midnight regulations in one fell swoop by one en bloc disapprovalresolution under the Congressional Review  Any outgoing administration understanding that it has this Sword of Damocleshanging over its head will surely hesitate much more before abusing midnight rules. Further, once enabled to dispatch of allimproper midnight rules with one simple resolution, Congress and succeeding administrations would be free to focus more of theirenergies on the voters' new priorities, rather than the mess left by midnight rules.  The relief offered by the bill,moreover, is highly flexible. No set number of regulations would have to be covered by a resolution. No category of regulationwould have to be included in or excluded from a resolution. On the contrary, any midnight rule disapproval resolution could besweeping or narrow, depending on how many rules merited inclusion.  Finally, the Midnight Rules Relief Act offers a solutionthat is not intrusive upon legitimate executive branch authority. An outgoing administration remains free to conduct necessaryrulemaking activity up to the stroke of midnight on Inauguration It then falls to Congress to respond swiftly andsurgically to the results, to accept the good and excise the bad.  This is truly a better way to govern. That is why thereform embodied in this bill is featured in Speaker Ryan's Better Way agenda.  I thank Mr.Issa for his work onthis important legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

We also hope that it will inspire many more Americans to read the Constitution themselves.  The text we will read today reflects the changes to the document made by the 27 amendments to it. Those portions superseded by amendment will not be read.  In order to ensure fairness to all those interested in participating, we have asked Members to line up to be recognized on a first-come, first-served basis. I will recognize Members based on this guidance. Each Member will approach the podium and read the passage laid out for him or her.

931,topic-id,606,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, regulatory reform plays a critical role in ensuring that our Nation finally achieves a full economic recovery and retains its competitive edge in the global marketplace. Congress must advance pro-growth policies that create jobs and restore economic prosperity for families and businesses across the Nation and make sure that any administration and its regulatory apparatus is held accountable to the American people.  America's small-business owners are suffocating under mountains of endlessly growing, bureaucratic red tape; and the uncertainty about the cost of upcoming regulations discourages employers from hiring new employees and expanding their businesses. Excessive regulation means higher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, less economic growth, and a less competitive  Today, Americans face a burden of over $3 trillion per year from Federal taxation and regulation. In fact, our Federal regulatory burden is larger than the 2014 gross domestic product of all but the top eight countries in the world. That burden adds up to about $15,000 per American household--nearly 30 percent of average household income in 2015.  Everyone knows it has been this way for far too long; but the Obama administration, instead of fixing the problem, has known only one response: increase taxes, increase spending, and increase regulation. The results have painfully demonstrated a simple truth: America cannot tax, spend, and regulate its way to economic recovery, economic growth, and durable prosperity for the American people.  Consider just a few facts that reveal the economic weakness the Obama administration has produced. In the December 2016 jobs report, the number of unemployed workers, workers who can only find part-time jobs, and workers who are now only marginally attached to the labor force stood at 9.3 percent. They number 15 million America's labor force participation rate remains at lows not seen since the Carter administration, and median household income is still below the level achieved before the financial crisis, which is after the entirety of the Obama administration.  The contrast between America's current condition and the recovery Ronald Reagan achieved as President is particularly stark in that, 4\1/2\ years after a recession began in 1981, the Reagan administration, through policies opposite to those of the Obama administration's, had achieved a recovery that created 7.8 million more jobs than when the recession began. Real per capita gross domestic product rose by $3,091, and real median household income rose by 7.7 percent.  To truly fix America's problems, the REINS Act is one of the simplest, clearest, and most powerful measures we can adopt. The level of new major regulation from the Obama administration is without modern precedent. Testimony before the Judiciary Committee during recent Congresses has[[Page H125]]plainly shown the connection between skyrocketing levels of regulation and declining levels of jobs and growth.  The REINS Act responds by requiring an up-or-down vote by the people's representatives in Congress before any new major regulation, which is defined in the bill generally as a rule that has an effect on the economy of at least $100 million, can be imposed on our economy. It does not prohibit new major regulation. It simply establishes the principle: ``no major regulation without representation.''  The REINS Act provides Congress and, ultimately, the people with a much-needed tool to check the one-way cost ratchet that Washington's regulatory bureaucrats too often turn. During the 114th, 113th, and 112th Congresses, the REINS Act was passed multiple times by the full House of Representatives, each time with bipartisan support.  I thank Mr.Collins of Georgia for reintroducing this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the REINS  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Doug Collins,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Collins: Serious regulatory reform is      needed to revitalize entrepreneurship, small business growth,      our economy, and quality job creation. Therefore, the Small      Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) strongly      supports the Regulations from the Executive In Need of      Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017.       U.entrepreneurship and startup activity are in a frail      state. While economic uncertainty and difficulties accessing      capital present barriers to new business formation, excessive      government regulation drives uncertainty and creates new      obstacles. When the policy ecosystem becomes noxious for      startups and small businesses, our entire economy suffers.      For existing businesses, overregulation is driving costs      higher and undermining confidence, investment and growth. The      system is out-of-control, and common sense tools and      solutions are needed to rein in the explosive growth of      federal red tape.       The REINS Act requires that Congress take an up-or-down      vote on every new major rule--defined as having an economic      impact of $100 million or more--before such a rule could be      enforced. This substantive regulatory reform measure would      serve as an important check on the regulatory system, and      have a positive effect in terms of how regulation affects      small businesses, and therefore, consumers, America's      workforce and the economy.       The REINS Act will bring needed accountability to our      nation's regulatory system, and SBE Council thanks you for      your leadership in spearheading this important legislative      effort.           Sincerely,                                                   Karen Kerrigan,     President and                                  ____                                                  National Roofing                                      Contractors Association,                                  Washington, DC, January 3, 2017.     To All Members of the House of       Dear Representative, The National Roofing Contractors      Association (NRCA) strongly supports the Regulations from the      Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act and urges you to      support this legislation when it comes to the House floor for      a vote.       Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the nation's oldest      trade associations and the voice of professional roofing      contractors worldwide. NRCA has about 3,500 contractors in      all 50 states who are typically small, privately held      companies with the average member employing 45 people and      attaining sales of about $4.5 million per year.       The roofing industry has faced an avalanche of new      regulations from numerous government agencies in recent      years. The cumulative burden of often counterproductive      regulations is highly disruptive to entrepreneurs who seek to      start or grow businesses that provide high-quality jobs. Most      important, federal agencies have failed to work with industry      representatives to provide greater flexibility for employers      in achieving regulatory goals and minimizing adverse impacts      on economic growth and job creation.       NRCA strongly supports regulatory reform to provide small      and midsized businesses with much-needed relief from      burdensome regulations, and the REINS Act is a key component      of regulatory relief. It would require Congress to approve,      with an up-or-down vote, any new major regulation issued by a      federal agency before the regulation would become effective.      Under the REINS Act, a major regulation is defined as any      rule that is estimated to have an economic impact of at least      $100 million on the private sector; would result in a major      increase in costs or prices; and would have significant      adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,      productivity or U.competitiveness.       NRCA believes the REINS Act, by requiring major regulations      undergo a vote in Congress to become effective, would      substantially increase accountability among federal agencies      seeking to issue new regulations. This legislation would help      provide employers in the roofing industry with the certainty      they need to invest in their businesses and create more jobs.       NRCA supports the REINS Act and urges you to vote for this      legislation in the If you have any questions or need      more information, please contact NRCA's Washington, D.C.,      office.                                                Dennis Conway,                               Commercial Roofers Inc., Las Vegas,     NRCA Chairman of the                                  ____                                               Associated Builders                                        and Contractors, Inc.,                                  Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and      Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade      association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000      chapter members, I am writing in regard to the Regulations      from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017      (H.26) introduced by Doug Collins (R-GA) as well as      the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 (H.21) introduced by      Darrell Issa (R-CA).       From 2009 to present, the federal government imposed nearly      $900 billion in regulatory costs on the American people which      requires billions of hours of paperwork. Many of these      regulations have been or will be imposed on the construction      industry. ABC is committed to reforming the broken federal      regulatory process and ensuring industry stakeholders' voices      are heard and rights are protected. ABC supports increased      transparency and opportunities for regulatory oversight by      Congress and ultimately, the American people.       The Obama administration issued numerous rulemakings that      detrimentally impact the construction industry. In some      cases, these regulations are based on conjecture and      speculation, lacking foundation in sound scientific analysis.      For the construction industry, unjustified and unnecessary      regulations translate to higher costs, which are then passed      along to the consumer or lead to construction projects being      priced out of the market. This chain reaction ultimately      results in fewer projects, and hinders businesses' ability to      hire and expand.       ABC members understand the value of standards and      regulations when they are based on solid evidence, with      appropriate consideration paid to implementation costs and      input from the business community. Federal agencies must be      held accountable for full compliance with existing rulemaking      statutes and requirements when promulgating regulations to      ensure they are necessary, current and cost-effective for      businesses to implement.       ABC opposes unnecessary, burdensome and costly regulations      resulting from the efforts of Washington bureaucrats who have      little accountability for their actions. H.26 will help to      bring greater accountability to the rulemaking process as it      would require any executive branch rule or regulation with an      annual economic impact of $100 million or more to come before      Congress for an up-or-down vote before being enacted.      Moreover, H.21 will further enhance congressional      oversight of the overreaching regulations often issued during      the final months of a president's term and help to revive the      division of powers.       Thank you for your attention on this important matter and      we urge the House to pass the Regulations from the Executive      in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017 and Midnight Rules      Relief Act of 2017 when they come to the floor for a vote.

957,topic-id,314,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I offer this manager's amendment to assure that, just as the REINS Act strengthens Congress' check on rules that impose major new costs on the economy, it does not unduly delay the effectiveness of major new deregulatory actions, those that alleviate regulatory burdens of $100 million or more.  When first introduced in the 112th Congress, the REINS Act incorporated the definition of major rule in the underlying Congressional Review Act--generally, a rule that has ``an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more.''  This was done in the interest of consistency with prior terminology, and it[[Page H135]]swept in both actions that imposed costs and actions that lifted costs. But, especially after the regulatory onslaught we have witnessed during the Obama administration, it is time to revise that definition.  We should assure that the REINS Act focuses Congress' highest attention on the rules that hurt the economy the most: those that impose $100 million or more in costs per year. We should likewise make sure that the REINS Act does not impose additional hurdles in the way of the most important and desperately needed deregulatory actions: those that free the economy of $100 million or more in annual regulatory burdens. A deregulatory action with that level of economic effect is one that Congress should be encouraging, not slowing down.  This refinement of the REINS Act's major rule definition is also needed to assure consistency with the major Administrative Procedure Act reform legislation the House is due to consider next week, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. That measure already modernizes the major rule standard for APA purposes to $100 million or more in annual costs imposed on the economy. The REINS Act should mirror it.

1057,topic-id,309,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  On the floor of this House in 2011, the President of the United States promised the American people ``to reduce barriers to growth and investment . . . when we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them.''  But, Mr.Speaker, those were just President Obama's words. His actions were starkly different. Throughout the entire 8 years of the Obama administration, a flood of new, major regulations has been burying America's job creators and households at record levels; and to make matters worse, when Congress declined to legislate the President's misguided policies for him, he increasingly resorted to unilateral regulatory actions to legislate by executive fiat.  It is time to say, ``Never again.'' The REINS Act, in one fell swoop, puts a stop to abuses like President Obama's and assures that Congress--the body to which the Constitution assigns the power to legislate--has the necessary tools to block the most overreaching[[Page H173]]regulations and mandates on the American people.  This motion to recommit seeks only to distract from the urgent need to reform our regulatory system and reduce unnecessary burdens on the public.

1243,topic-id,1183,"Mr.President, it is because of ObamaCare that the health insurance markets in this country are badly damaged. They have gotten worse each year. They are now near collapse.  You were told 8 years ago that if you like your health insurance, you can keep it. Millions can't. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Millions of Americans were not able to keep their doctor. You were told that your health insurance premiums would go down $2,500. They have actually gone up probably $3,500. Some people don't have a choice in plans. Some counties don't even have a plan in the exchange. If you could get a plan, you might not be able to afford it. If you could afford the plan, you might not be able to use it because of the high copayments you have to have. So it is not a very good situation.  It took 6 years for the health insurance market to get as bad as I just described. It will take time for those markets to be restored. The next few years in health care will be challenging if ObamaCare is repealed or even if it is not repealed. If ObamaCare is not repealed, it will be even longer before Americans have access to a functioning health insurance market and the insurance plans they want.  When it comes to health care, every second counts. We owe it to the American people who are sick or who could get sick, as well as families and businesses trying to plan for the future, to start fixing that problem right now. That is the result of the election. That is what the Senate is going to do.  The Affordable Care Act, which could more appropriately be called the Unaffordable Care Act, has been a case of over-promise and under-delivery. People were told that their premiums would go down and that if they liked their doctor, their hospital, or their health care plan, they could keep all of it. The reality is much different. More than half of the country had two or fewer insurance plans from which to choose this year. Some regions had no insurance plans available at all. Even those who were strong supporters of the health care law, like the Minnesota Governor whom I like to quote, have[[Page S106]]said the Affordable Care Act ``is no longer affordable to many Americans.''  In my State of Iowa, the Affordable Care Act premium increases this year were over 40 percent for many individuals. Few people, of course, can afford that. Families that did manage to purchase Affordable Care Act insurance found that they could no longer afford to use it.  One Iowan recently called my office and told me that his premiums have increased 400 percent in 3 years. He also said that his deductible went up to--can you believe it--$14,000. Last year, one of his children had a major medical problem, and they had to pay for all of that care out of their pocket--not from the insurance. The family paid $12,000 for the Affordable Care Act insurance, which did not pay for any health care. Of course, that just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  The problem is that the Affordable Care Act did nothing to address the underlying causes of the high cost of health care; that is, what it costs for a hospital or a doctor to purchase or maintain medical equipment, purchase medicines, carry malpractice insurance, and a lot of other costs they have.  Rather than address the actual cost to care, President Obama and his colleagues chose to bypass real health care reform for an unsustainable entitlement and bureaucratic mandates that have priced people out of the health insurance market, rather than provide those same people with affordable and quality coverage.  So we are at it now. It is time for real health care reform, not the misguided policies that we were promised 8 years ago that now have turned out to be what I describe as misguided policies. It is time to deliver to Americans what we were promised. It is time to provide accessible, affordable health care to all But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to work with us. They know that the Affordable Care Act is falling apart. They know it is unaffordable.  As we have heard in speeches this week, the other side is trying to distract attention from the Affordable Care Act collapse by using scare tactics, like you recently heard. It is time for the Democrats to step up, instead of doubling down. It is time for statesmanship, not gamesmanship. It is time for the Democrats to stop defending the ``un-Affordable Care Act'' and deliver Americans what was promised.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Trump administration to deliver affordable health care to all Americans in the tradition of the Senate, which is what didn't happen in 2009. It was strictly a one-party program put before the Congress to pass. That is why it has failed--because so many of the people who could have made a good bill pass in 2009 were shut out of the process because this body had 60 Democratic Members and they didn't have to pay any attention to  They spent maybe 8 or 9 months trying to work with the Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan deal. But before that was completed, they said: Take it or leave it. The Republican minority at that time was not going to be dictated to, and we were pushed out of the room.  Then what ended up being the Affordable Care Act was written in the big black hole of Senate Majority Leader Reid's office, without the bipartisan input which has made so many social programs in America successful. I would name the Social Security I would name civil rights legislation, Medicare legislation, and Medicaid legislation, which all had broad bipartisan support to get them passed. In the case of the Civil Rights Act, a higher proportion of Republicans voted for it than Democrats voted for it--just one example.  That is the tradition of the Senate when you have major social legislation that has been successful, and that is why the Affordable Care Act was not successful--because it was strictly a partisan approach that was used to have it become law.

965,topic-id,524,"Mr.Chairman, for years my Republican friends have been trying to convince everyone that Federal agencies are scary and unpopular. In reality, Americans support Federal rules that protect them from injuries, diseases, and death. They always have and they always will. The people we represent don't want those rules to go away. They want stronger rules to protect their jobs, their pay, their health, and their fair treatment in the workplace.  Let's remember that it takes years to finalize most rules. Before an agency makes a rule, it considers science, costs, benefits, public stakeholder input, and public comments. Republicans have invented stories about surprise regulations that appear out of nowhere. These stories sound interesting until you realize they were invented to help their corporate friends get where they want. We know where this will lead us. Big banks got away with robbing us and creating a major recession because they weren't regulated strongly enough. Republicans think the answer is making it harder to regulate them.  If this bill passes, it won't be the nameless, faceless, unelected corporate CEOs who feel the pain. It will be the Americans from big cities and small towns who need Federal standards to keep their environment clean, to keep their workplace safe, and to make sure the products they buy won't hurt their families.  My Democratic colleagues are offering amendments today that exempt certain kinds of rules from the unrealistic burdens this bill creates. I support these amendments.  My amendment is a little different. It is not nearly enough to save this terrible bill, but it takes a big step in the right direction. It acknowledges that doing nothing carries a major cost.                              {time}  1600  It acknowledges human-caused climate change and requires agencies that propose regulations to report on how a rule impacts greenhouse gas emissions. If we require reporting a rule's costs, we should also report its impacts to our planet and to our way of life.  It also requires an analysis of a rule's impacts on low-income and rural communities. My Republican friends are deeply concerned about whether new regulations make big business and Wall Street investors happy. I think it is time we assess the impacts of regulations on the urban poor, the rural poor, or on coastal Native American tribes already fleeing the impacts of climate change, or the farmers in the West and South struggling to cope with drought, flooding, and extreme weather.[[Page H137]]  Finally, my amendment requires congressional approval of any regulation that would increase carbon pollution by 25,000 metric tons or more, or could increase cancer, birth defects, kidney disease, or cardiovascular or respiratory illness.  If House Republicans are so eager to rewrite the regulatory process, they should be willing to cast recorded votes allowing the release of tens of thousands of metric tons of pollution into our air. They should publicly vote to increase the rates of these terrible diseases among their constituents.

Tonight, millions of Americans, including myself, will tune in to the College Football Playoff National Championship between the University of Alabama and Clemson As with any college or professional competition, both teams will have healthcare practitioners traveling with them to the game.  Unfortunately, many States do not provide legal protection for sports medicine practitioners who travel with these athletes since they are not licensed to practice medicine in the secondary The Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act, which I introduced with Mr.Richmond of Louisiana, would ensure that sports medicine professionals can provide high-quality and timely health care to athletes without having to worry about potential liability when traveling across State lines with their teams.  The nature of sports medicine professionals' jobs require them to frequently travel between States so that athletes can receive proper care the moment they are injured. However, providers are at great personal and professional risk because medical liability insurance does not cover costs for lawsuits related to care provided in States in which they are not licensed. It is not a reasonable solution to require practitioners to become licensed in every State where their teams will play during a given season.  This came to my attention, and I talked to a friend of mine who is an emergency room physician in Auburn, He travels with Auburn At the time, a few years ago, they were playing in what was then the BCS game.

From settlements, to water, to restricting the Muslim call to prayer in Jerusalem, it seems that anything goes.  Today, as America embarks on its own experiment with strongman politics, this Congress is falling in line. This Congress that allowed our Chamber to be used for an Israeli campaign rally and TV commercials is bending to pressure from abroad and pressure here at home.

Two State Solution Is Still The Path To Peace In The Middle East            [Luis Gutierrez Floor Remarks, 6, 2016]       Mr.Speaker, I am very concerned about what is going on in      Israel and I think it has implications both for U.foreign      policy and for domestic policy and for our great ally,            As the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu      consolidates power and becomes in many ways the one-party      rulers of Israel, a number of things are changing that should      be of concern to all       Specifically, the increasing dominance of the Likud Party      as the one-party in Israel jeopardizes the two state solution      that I and many others in the United States and Israel feel      is the only way to achieve long-term peace in the Middle            There is a retrenchment of hard line policies--aimed at      solidifying alliances with smaller religious and hardline      parties that keeps Likud in power--that will make it harder      for Israelis and their allies in America--and anyone who      seeks a lasting peace--to maintain progress towards a two      state solution.       Right now, the Knesset is considering legislation to      legalize all Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory on      the West Bank, even those constructed on private Palestinian      land.       Boom, 400,000 people in settlements across the West Bank,      it's all legal because they say it is legal. But it's not.       And Israel is destroying Palestinian homes at a pace faster      than we have seen before.       It is provocative, sweeping, and designed to make it harder      to ever reach an agreement with the       The plan to restrict the Muslim call to prayer in Jerusalem      has been revived, again to placate hardline religious      constituents, by Prime Minister       There is no clearer statement to people of the Islamic      faith that they do not matter, they do not belong, and they      will not be tolerated than to restrict the Muslim call to      prayer in Jerusalem, a city that has heard the Muslim call to      prayer for thousands of years.       I think what is going on in Israel with Prime Minister      Netanyahu presents a cautionary tale about the consequences      of following a political strongman. The strongman has to keep      proving that he is a strongman over and over.       Like other strongmen who ride fear into leadership--when      you base your political career on injecting fear and      resentment into political affairs--when you use the backdrop      of terrorism and the understandable fear of the Israeli      people as a political tool for years and decades--this is the      kind of policy that results.       There is an appetite for constant escalation of what you      are doing to stand up to the enemy you have constructed--an      enemy based on, but not the same as the enemies that fight      against the state of Israel and tolerance and peace in real      life.       Strongmen construct a foil--in this case based on the      Palestinians, but sometimes exaggerated beyond recognition--     and they need to feed the thirst for more and more action to      attack the caricature that has been constructed.       But strongman politics in Israel have the impact of making      a long-lasting solution that brings peace to the Middle East      harder to achieve.       The fundamental rights of Palestinians to have their own      state, a state alongside the Israeli state where they have      the basic rights and dignity to govern themselves and raise      their families in peace--that is what many Israelis, many      Palestinians, and many around the world have been fighting      for.       If we are ever going to achieve the permanent peace that      allows Israel to exist without fear and Palestine to exist      without occupation, we must continue to fight for the two      state solution.       When I was just a freshman, almost 25 years ago, we      celebrated the accomplishments of Rabin and Arafat and      President Clinton to build towards a peace that recognizes      the rights and dignity of Israelis and the rights and      dignities of the Palestinian people.       For decades, the United States--under different leaders in      different parties from Carter to Reagan to Bush and Obama--     have recognized that peace will only come with mutual respect      and tolerance.       That is what we have based our foreign policy on and should      continue to base our foreign policy on.       Having talked with average people and with leaders on both      sides of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict--I am convinced      that it is the only path to peace.       America has been a catalyst--a constructive influence from      outside--a nation based on religious freedom and democracy      that has served as a model for both Palestinians and      Israelis--and we have worked towards helping parties continue      to move in the direction of two separate but mutually      respectful countries, two nations that are not at war with      each other or subservient to one another.       I fear, Mr.Speaker, that Israel herself is moving away      from the two state solution as a goal and that we as her      closest ally must remind her--and ourselves--of what is at      stake if we lose sight of this important goal.

I will be in Washington late that evening because the event that I am going to is on January 21. It is the Women's March on  You can get more information on Facebook, which is how I heard about it, or should I say, how my wife, Soraida, heard about it. I said to her a little after the election: You know, honey, I don't think I can go to D.and watch Donald Trump get sworn in.  And she said: Oh, you are going to D.C., just not for that. And she told me about the Women's She said: You and I are going together.  Now, I can already hear the phones ringing in my office with people calling to say: Oh, you Democrats are sore losers and you just hate  I went to George Bush's inauguration and I work with Republicans all the time. Just read Breitbart, which seems to write an article anytime I even glance favorably at a Republican colleague.  But this is different. I knew that George Bush and I would disagree on many issues from trade to health care, to the war in Iraq, but I never thought that George Bush was trying to make my own country hostile to me personally, to my wife, to my daughters, to my grandson. I never felt he was a threat to the Nation that I love so deeply and have served now for more than a quarter of a century.  The reason that I am not going is that I cannot bring myself to justify morally or intellectually the immense power we are placing in that man's hands.  I could not look at my wife, my daughters, or my grandson in the eye if I sat there and attended as if everything that the candidate said about the women, about the Latinos, the Blacks, the Muslims or any of the other things he said in those speeches and tweets, and that all of that is okay or erased from our collective memory.  We all heard the tape when Donald Trump was bragging--bragging--about grabbing women by their private parts without their consent. It is something I just can't unhear, bragging to that guy on TV that he would grab women below the belt, as if that was hitting on them. It is never okay. It is never just locker room talk. It is offensive and, if he ever actually did it, it is a crime.  I hang out with Republicans, with Republican-elected officials in an actual locker room in the Rayburn Building, and if they ever started talking like that, I wouldn't just walk away. I would tell them to their faces that they are wrong, and I wouldn't allow it to go unnoticed or dismissed as normal or excusable. I don't know a Republican colleague of mine in this body who would let that type of comment just slide as if it were just okay.  So that is why I will hold hands with my wife and march with the women on January 21 in D.And that is why I am calling on all of my progressive allies to come and march with the women as well. If you care about a living wage, come and join the women. If you care about the environment, come and join the march. We know as a society that when women win, we all win. So I plan to be there.  It is deeply personal and deeply patriotic to march, to make my opinions known by walking with my allies arm in arm. I want to be able to look at my two beautiful Latina daughters and my beautiful half-Puerto Rican, half-Mexican, but 100 percent American grandson, Luis Andres, in the eye with a clear conscience.  When the new President denigrates Latinos or Mexicans or immigrants as drug dealers and criminals, I want to be able to say that I did not condone or allow that type of speech to go mainstream. That was not normalized on my watch.  Because the future President said that the American-born children of immigrants were not capable of being American judges, I cannot sit there as if this inauguration is okay and I forgave him.  I am deeply honored to return to the U.Congress, and I want to thank the people of the Fourth Congressional My constituents knew that when[[Page H242]]they voted for me, I would be a fighter; and I don't intend to let them down.

I will use whatever peaceful means available to make sure the words and the actions of our new President do not become the new mainstream and normal in  That, Mr.Speaker, is why I will not be here for Inauguration Day and why I will be marching with my wife and with a million women from across this country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH241-2.txt,478,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued",2017.0,10.0,January

1158,topic-id,359,"Mr.President, in the final hour of our legislative business early last December 10, we passed a remarkable bill. It had no ideological division, did not cost the taxpayers a dime, and will benefit Americans in every part of the country. And, like the House did, we passed it unanimously.  This bill had the somewhat unwieldy title of the Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification While not lending itself to a catchy acronym, it is accurately descriptive. For more than 50 years, a Federal law has provided legal protection for art loaned by foreign governments for exhibition in the United Confidence in that protection is an essential piece of the complex arrangements that can take years to complete in order to bring wonderful exhibits to American museums for everyone to enjoy.  America has hundreds of museums of all sorts. The art museum at Brigham Young University, for example, is one of the largest and best attended in the Mountain When it began working on a major exhibition of art from Islamic countries, some of its loan requests were unexpectedly denied. It turns out that a 2007 Federal court decision had made such loans risky, rather than secure. After that court decision, the act of lending, even after State Department review and approval, could actually lead to a new category of lawsuits against the foreign lenders.  This legislation, now signed into law, reverses that court decision and clarifies that lending art after State Department review does not raise the possibility of new litigation. Foreign governments can once again have confidence that lending art for exhibition will improve cultural understanding and enrich people's lives without the threat of new lawsuits.  The bill has two narrow exceptions. I want to thank Wesley Fisher, director of research at the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany, and Rabbi Andrew Baker, director of International Jewish Affairs at the American Jewish Committee, for their help in drafting the exception for Nazi-era claims. The second exception covers comparable state-sponsored coercive campaigns of cultural plunder.

1219,topic-id,1706,"Madam President, I rise today in support of 3 and the ongoing effort to repeal the most harmful elements of the so-called Affordable Care  While our friends on the other side of the aisle have been trying to convince the American people that there is nothing to see here and that this poorly named law is working according to plan, the vast majority of our citizens know the truth: ObamaCare just doesn't work.  According to the results of a recent Gallup poll, 80 percent of Americans want Congress to either change the Affordable Care Act significantly or repeal and replace it altogether. Let me repeat that. Eight out of every 10 people in this country agree that the status quo is unacceptable and that we need a major change in what is going on around here.  We need a major course correction in our health care system. It is not hard to see why this is the case. After all, under ObamaCare, the cost of health insurance has increased dramatically and will continue to do so well into the future. Under ObamaCare, individuals and families are being left with fewer and fewer choices when it comes to buying health insurance. Under ObamaCare, patients have fewer options and reduced access to health care providers. Under ObamaCare, the American people have been hit with steep taxes, burdensome mandates, and a health care system that simply does not meet their needs.  This year alone, premiums in the benchmark plan for the ObamaCare exchanges have gone up by an average of 25 percent, and in some parts of the country, the increases have been significantly larger than that. In addition, over the past 2 years, insurance plans have been dropping out of markets all over the country. As a result, it is estimated that more than half of the counties in the United States will have two or fewer available health insurance plans on the exchanges--and that is this year--and about a third of them have only one available option.  I am quite certain that every single Member of this Chamber has heard from a number of their constituents about these problems, about the problems they have faced as the Affordable Care Act has been implemented. I know I have. A number of Utahns have written to me to express their concerns about the increases in their insurance premiums. For example, last month, Austin from Provo, UT, told me that due to the growing cost of his insurance plan, ``I'm going to have to drop the insurance and face the penalty next year. I'm worried because, as a young husband and father, I'm barely making ends meet, and I'm not sure I can afford to pay the penalty for not having insurance.'' Similarly, Eryn from Spanish Fork, UT, noted that because her family's previous insurer dropped out of the Utah marketplace, the remaining plan that best met her family's needs was ``a plan with a small list of in-network providers and no coverage for out-of-network providers.'' She continued, saying that under this new plan, ``We will have a higher deductible ($13,000 for the family), we will have to pay the full cost of any visit to the doctor . . . and we will not be able to save as much money in our Health Savings Account each month because of the high premiums, which add up to $11,000 a year. . . . The premium is basically another mortgage payment for us, only we have no property to show for it. This is too much.''  No family should have to choose between paying their mortgage and paying for their health insurance. Yet, with all of ObamaCare's failures and broken promises, families throughout the country are currently having to make those kinds of choices.  Unfortunately, it does not get any better from here, not without a major change to the status quo. In fact, I think it is safe to say that if we fail to act, the worst is yet to come. Therefore, it is only fitting that we begin this new Congress by repealing ObamaCare and setting the stage for workable reforms that will actually bring down costs, provide more options, and let the American people--and not Washington bureaucrats--make their own health care choices. The budget resolution before us is the first step in this effort.  As we all know, the resolution contains reconciliation instructions to the relevant committees, including the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair, to draft legislation to repeal So after approving this resolution, the next step will be for the Finance Committee, the HELP Committee, as well as the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees over in the House, to get to work on putting together a repeal package. This process will be more difficult than it sounds. We don't want to be reckless, and we don't want to inflict more harm on the American people or our health care system; therefore, in addition to repealing ObamaCare, the legislation we draft pursuant to this budget resolution will have to include a stable transition period to give us the time and space we need to provide more sensible reforms.  Under the budget resolution, the legislation to repeal ObamaCare and provide that transition period will need to be reported to the Budget Committee by January 27. Then both the House and Senate will debate the legislation, hopefully passing it by simple majority votes and sending it to the desk of the incoming Once we pass this repeal legislation, we will come to the most important step in the process: replacing ObamaCare with a health care system worthy of the American people.  This will not be a simple endeavor. It is going to take a great deal of work, and it will almost certainly require the efforts of people from both parties. The Finance Committee is going to have a[[Page S92]]major role to play throughout this process of repealing ObamaCare, providing for a secure transition, and replacing the law with more effective reforms. Our committee has jurisdiction over all the major Federal health programs, including Medicare and In addition, we will have jurisdiction over the tax provisions, which include all of ObamaCare's harmful taxes as well as the premium tax credits provided to purchase plans in the ObamaCare exchanges.  I have spoken at length to my Republican colleagues on the Finance Committee about these issues, and all of them are ready and willing to do whatever is necessary to put our Nation's health care system on a more responsible path. We are going to get it done. In that I have no doubts.  To be sure, the first few steps in this effort are going to happen quickly. Once again, the plan is to produce repeal legislation before the end of this month. This, of course, is how it has to be. The American people don't have the time for us to wait around on these issues, and we don't have the luxury of sitting back and watching the problems get worse over time. The problems facing our health care system are growing by the day. We need to take the swiftest possible action.  We intend to act quickly and methodically to begin providing relief for the millions of Americans who are currently suffering as a result of ObamaCare and the unworkable system it has created. As I noted, if that effort is going to be successful, it should be bipartisan. Both Congress and the incoming administration will need to work together.                          Cabinet Nominations  On that point, Madam President, I do want to note that my friends on the other side of the aisle have as recently as this morning made a number of statements and issued several demands with regard to the process for considering and confirming the President-elect's Cabinet nominees. According to my colleagues' statements, they want multiple rounds of hearings on every nominee, which, by the way, is unprecedented. This morning, they even went further, issuing demands that certain preconditions be met before hearings could even be held on a particular nomination. These tactics are, to put it bluntly, preposterous. My colleagues are certainly free to oppose any nominee and to try to convince others to do the same. It is unfortunate that they have decided to go further by politicizing the process by which we consider nominations.  Speaking for the Senate Finance Committee, I have to say that we have an established set of vetting procedures for all executive branch nominees. Republicans and Democrats alike have those particular procedures. That process has been in place for decades and has traditionally been bipartisan.  By all accounts, the Finance Committee's longstanding vetting process is exceptionally thorough and fair, and it is deeply regrettable that some of our colleagues would try to undermine that process and not provide the incoming Trump administration's nominees the same respect and regard our committee has provided for nominees in the Obama administration and prior administrations as well. As chairman, I take this process very seriously. I have made no efforts to abbreviate or short-circuit our procedures for any nominee and have no intention of doing so in the future. I am certain all of our chairmen here in the Senate can say the same thing.  My hope is that my colleagues will stop politicizing this process at every step and allow the Senate to function as it has under both Republican and Democratic administrations. My friends on the other side may not like the results of the recent election, but their disappointment of the outcome is no justification for reinventing the way we do business here in the  I hope we will all take this into consideration and we will start cooperating with each other and get this government moving again and that we will support and sustain these people who are qualified and good people who are being chosen by the Trump-elect administration. I think it is important that we do these things and do them carefully and that we treat each other with the respect that is well deserved in this body. I hope that the petty, cheap politics will be discontinued.  Mr.President, with that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Hoeven).

1525,topic-id,1371,"Mr.President, I am here tonight to join my colleague the senior Senator from New Mexico and all my other colleagues on the Senate floor to stand up for hundreds of thousands of my constituents in New Mexico who will lose their health care coverage if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw our Nation's health care system into chaos.  It is absolutely criminal for Republicans to strip millions of their health care without even a conceptual replacement plan in place. To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I want to make it clear that ``we will fix it later'' simply doesn't cut it.  They promised repeal and replace, and now they are giving us repeal and run, and that will cause chaos in our health care system. In my home State of New Mexico, according to the Urban Institute, an estimated 266,000 people will lose their health care coverage. This is not a change to their plan or a different premium. They will lose their coverage in its entirety. Thousands more of our State's 2 million residents will lose access to birth control and other preventive services and Medicare prescription drug coverage. Nearly everyone will be subjected to higher costs for lower quality insurance, especially those with preexisting conditions. Dismantling our health care system would also put at risk many of the gains we made in protecting the 860,000 New Mexicans who have preexisting conditions like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. These individuals will be forced to pay more for their health care coverage and possibly lose access altogether.  This is not a game; this is a matter of life and death. Without any plan in place, this repeal and run maneuver will cause health care costs for all Americans to skyrocket. Dismantling our health care system literally means taking hundreds of dollars each month away from hard-working families. In my book, that is highway robbery. How? It is simple. This reckless Republican repeal and run will strip away the tax credits that help many working Americans afford their premiums. More than 32,000 New Mexicans rely on those tax credits, which average about $200 a month--well over half of their monthly premium for health care coverage. Many of the sickest, oldest, and the poorest of our neighbors and family members will lose their health care coverage altogether.  Over 20,000 New Mexican seniors will be forced to pay $1,000 more per year for their prescription drugs. Fixed income seniors can't afford to pay more for prescription drugs.  Dismantling our health care system is particularly problematic in our Nation's rural areas, including much of the State of New Last fall I went on a multiday rural health care listening tour across communities throughout Northeastern New Rural hospitals like those in Raton, Clayton, and Santa Rosa are often the only health care providers for hundreds of miles in any direction. Under the Affordable Care Act, rural hospitals agree to exchange higher rates of insurance coverage for their patients for a reduction in reimbursement rates. In other words, they aren't being paid as much per patient as they once were, but the number of patients who come in without any insurance is dramatically lower. Now Republicans are going to take away coverage from a quarter million New Mexicans, but they aren't going to give rural hospitals their higher reimbursement premiums back. This repeal and run maneuver will cause many rural hospitals that already are operating on the margins to shut their doors or to simply turn away sick patients.  Nationwide, nearly 700 local hospitals in rural communities face the risk of imminent closure. Think about that. That is nearly one-third of the Nation's hospitals. Almost all of them would be forced to turn away patients if the Republicans move forward in dismantling our Nation's health care system. In New Mexico, that would mean forcing many of my constituents to drive for hours to access critical lifesaving care. It would also shake our State's economy to its core.  Health care jobs were one of the few economic bright spots in New Mexico over the past 6 years, particularly in rural communities, but this reckless plan--or I should say lack of one, to be accurate--throws our Nation's health care system into chaos and scars New Mexico's rural communities for years to come. A community whose hospital shuts down may never recover. That is what is at stake here. Denying a family health care, denying a whole community health care is reckless and immoral.  You might hear Republicans say they want to tear everything apart now, but we shouldn't worry because they will fix it later. Let me be clear: We have the capacity to fix and improve our current health care system in a bipartisan way without throwing it all into chaos, but Republicans have to make that choice before it is too late. I would welcome honest attempts to find ways to improve our Nation's health care laws, to make them work better for all  In the past, I have taken the lead on commonsense fixes to our Nation's health care policies. In 2010, in the House of Representatives, I led the fight to extend coverage to the children of military families covered by TRICARE up until the time they are 26 years old. After hearing from many small businesses in New Mexico, I fought to repeal unnecessary 1099 tax reporting requirements for small businesses. To this day, I continue to work with Republicans like Dean Heller of Nevada to eliminate the so-called Cadillac tax that would place an incredibly unfair tax burden on employer-provided health insurance that many working families rely on.  Republicans need to put partisan politics aside and remember why Congress passed the ACA in the first place: To expand access to quality health care for all Before we passed health care reform, New Mexico had the second highest rate of uninsured citizens in the entire  I have heard from a lot of New Mexicans who have told me how access to health care coverage has impacted their lives, even saved their lives.

As a nurse, Karen has seen how health care reform and the reduction of uninsured and uncompensated care has helped community hospitals better serve their patients. But the real impact of health care reform for Karen has been personal. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, Karen's insurance company dropped her coverage. When she had to pay out of pocket for her coverage, her costs doubled. As she went through several more recurrences of cancer, Karen went bankrupt. She lost her home.  In a letter to me, she said: ``Cancer is hard enough, but not to be able to afford my co-pays and appointments caused me so much stress it made me more vulnerable for complications.''  Today, Karen is able to afford health care coverage even with her preexisting condition. But Republicans are threatening to take that all away from her and from hundreds of millions of other  Karen went on to say in her letter:       No one should go without health care because of income.

The Bataan death marchers were forced to endure 3 and a half years of brutal captivity. They were marched for days in the scorching heat through the Philippine jungles. Thousands died. Those who survived faced the hardships of a prisoner of war camp. Others were wounded or killed when unmarked enemy ships transporting prisoners of war to Japan were sunk by U.air and naval forces.  After returning to Taos after the war, Mr.Reyna opened Tony Reyna's Indian Shop in 1950, which has remained open to this day. He served two terms as governor of Taos He also served the Town of Taos as a police commissioner and as a museum board member. He was a lifetime member of the Taos Pueblo tribal council.  He leaves behind an enduring legacy thanks to his lifelong efforts to preserve the culture, resources, and traditions of Taos He played a vital role in the return of Blue Lake, the Pueblo's sacred headwaters in 1970.

1032,topic-id,344,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to reiterate the strong, bipartisan support for our ally, Israel, in the United States  Support for Israel has always been a bipartisan value, and it reflects the values of our country. Although we are entering a period of one-party government, bipartisan support for Israel remains a strategic asset, and those who support Israel need to be careful not to jeopardize that. I think none of my colleagues do that. I want to make it clear.  In supporting this House resolution, we are expressing our deep concern regarding the decision to abstain in the U.Security Council Resolution 2334. Some may point out that the decision to abstain does not veer from the actions of past administrations. They would be right. It does not. That may be true, but it does not justify, in my view, this particular vote.  Allowing a one-sided resolution, which I perceived the U.resolution to be, to be adopted at this juncture sends the wrong signal and emboldens Israel's and America's enemies.  The United Nations is notorious for its disproportionate criticism of As Ambassador Samantha Power said before the U.Security Council vote on Resolution 2334: ``As long as Israel has been a member of this institution, Israel has been treated differently from other nations at the United Nations.''  She also noted that, in 2016 alone, the U.adopted more resolutions critical of Israel than it did nations that brazenly violate international law and violate human rights--more than Syria, more than Iran, more than North Korea, more than South Sudan, more than Russia, combined.  A one-sided resolution that assigns exclusive blame to Israel for the continuation of the conflict--without addressing Palestinian incitement to violence, Hamas control of Gaza, or their continued insistence on the so-called right of return and refusing to accept Israel as a Jewish state--undermines prospects for a two-state solution.  Also deeply concerning is this resolution's reference of Israeli presence in East Jerusalem, including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City and the Western Wall, as illegal.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1772,topic-id,671,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Representative Hurd for his work, which has been an ongoing continuing work on this issue and on this particular program.  I rise in support of this bipartisan bill, which builds on the work that Majority Leader McCarthy and I and others in this House have been doing to modernize government technology and renew America's faith in government.  In 2016, exit polls showed that dissatisfaction with the government spanned the political spectrum. That is a shame because government is supposed to be a force for improving people's lives, keeping our country safe, and expanding opportunities for all  That is why I unveiled the House Democrats' Renewing Faith in Government agenda last summer. We must present bold solutions to reform our democracy and our government. Certainly, on both sides of the equation, that is what the American people were saying in the last election.  One of the goals of our agenda is modernizing government technology. Most Americans understand the transformative power of technology--the Majority Leader spoke of it in so many different aspects of our lives--and how digitizing businesses makes them more efficient, transparent, and accountable. We have seen it in the private sector. Every day, millions of Americans shop on sites like Amazon or Etsy and catch a ride using Uber or  Government technology is in terrible shape, and bringing the latest practices from Silicon Valley into government would make a huge difference in serving our citizens and streamlining the way government works for the American people.  Last year, I worked closely with the Obama administration and Tony Scott to advance one of its top priorities in this area: creating a technology modernization fund for the rapid upgrade of[[Page H285]]the most outdated, costly, and insecure technology systems across the Federal Mr.Hurd was involved deeply in that effort. The result was the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which the House passed overwhelmingly with the help of Chairman Chaffetz and Majority Leader  Last month, Majority Leader McCarthy and I expressed our bipartisan support for one of President Obama's most successful efforts at bringing Silicon Valley talent into the Federal workforce: the U.Digital Service and GSA's 18F program. In fact, I visited the 18F program in San Francisco and was extraordinarily impressed with the individuals who peopled that project and were giving of their time. I guess we were paying them a little bit, but, relatively speaking, they were giving their time.  Today's bill, the TALENT Act, would make permanent the precursor to both these programs: the Presidential Innovation This program has a proven track record of bringing top talent from the innovation economy into the Federal workforce where it is sorely needed.  I hope the next administration will continue all of these innovative programs, which have begun to change the culture within our government.  I also hope that the talented individuals--many of whom, as I referenced, left high-paying jobs in the private sector--will stay on through the transition and continue to serve their country by improving government technology.  President Obama made real progress in this area, including with the launch of his Open Data Directive, his We the People petition platform, and his Cyber National Action More could have been achieved if Congress had agreed to his request to invest more in these areas. We have seen a dramatic example of why cybersecurity investment is so critically important for our country, not for Democrats, not for Republicans, but for all This is an effort toward that end.  I hope we can work together in this new Congress to unleash the transformative power of modern technology within government and help renew America's faith in our government. That is critical if we are to be successful as a I am sure it hopefully is what all of us want to do on a bipartisan basis.  I thank Representative DeSaulnier for his efforts, and I thank Representative Hurd for his leadership on this effort.

1664,topic-id,787,"I thank the chairman for his leadership.  Mr.Chairman, we all know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy. We meet them in our districts and we see firsthand the benefits that their dreams and hard work provide to our constituents and to our communities.  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are really small-business people who are critical for our country's economic prosperity. Small businesses helped to create more than 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over the past two decades. So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage the success and growth of our small businesses and our startups.  In order to succeed, these companies need capital and credit--the lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet, the government continues[[Page H261]]to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing as smaller companies are caught up in red tape that was created, frankly, for the largest public companies, but those public companies have the financial means to hire lawyers and accountants and management consultants and all of those things that would then guide them through the sheer weight, volume, and complexity of the Federal securities laws.  Congress has made strides in tailoring the regulatory environment for smaller companies, most notably when we passed with strong bipartisan support the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, in 2012. The JOBS Act's benefits are notable as more and more companies use its provisions to raise investment capital in both the public and private markets.  One essential form of capital for many startups comes from angel investors--sophisticated, high net-worth individuals who invest their own money into startups and other early stage companies. Not many college students of whom I am aware would fit that definition of a sophisticated, high net-worth individual. In 2015, angel investors deployed over $24 billion to about 71,000 startups--many of these investments going to companies in their own communities and Beyond capital, angels provide advice and guidance to help these companies succeed and create jobs.  Mr.Chairman, I believe that it is important to note that companies such as Amazon, Costco, Facebook, Google, and Starbucks, among a myriad of others that we have not necessarily heard of as public names, were all initially funded by angel investors. Without angel investors, these very successful companies would have never gotten off the ground.  Yet, the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose neglect of its statutory mission to facilitate capital formation necessitated that Congress pass the JOBS Act in the first place, has further restricted startups from interacting with angel investors at demo days and similar pitch events. Startups rely on demo days and similar events to build relationships with angels and other investors and generate interest in their companies and their ideas. These events existed prior to the JOBS Act, but the SEC's rules jeopardize their future.  H.79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS Act, is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that is aimed at removing a significant regulatory hurdle for innovative companies and startups that seek early stage equity investments. Specifically, the HALOS Act would clarify that these demo days, which are sponsored by angel investor groups, universities, municipalities, and nonprofits, are not considered to be general solicitations and would, instead, ensure that angel funding remains available to those businesses that seek investment capital. These are really educational opportunities.                              {time}  1430  Mr.Speaker, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim that the HALOS Act guts critical investor protections and will subject honest, hardworking Americans to rampant fraud. We just had an example of college students being brought up. That is simply not true.  A company that offers securities to investors under these rules may only sell their securities to sophisticated or accredited investors. If these individuals do not meet the standards of an accredited investor, they are not then eligible or even allowed to invest in these types of startups that would participate in a demo day.  Instead, the HALOS Act is a simple, bipartisan, bicameral, and, I might add, short bill that will provide small innovative companies and startups the ability to interact with angels and other investors who can provide the capital that they need to succeed, grow, and create jobs.  Indeed, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it best when he introduced the HALOS Act last Congress: ``I have heard from local entrepreneurs and interested backers alike that the most important thing we can do to help these businesses is to make it easier for angel investors to put capital behind them--and that is exactly what our bipartisan HALOS Act will do.''

1685,topic-id,544,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I have actually had the pleasure and the honor of sitting through a number of these demo days and seeing these pitches being made. People are coming in, and they are literally laying out their dreams, their hopes, and, frankly, their hard work because they wouldn't be there that day if it wasn't for their hard work. They are looking for a couple of things. As small businesses and entrepreneurs, they are looking for capital and credit. We use the word ``capital'' a lot around here, but think of it as cash and credit. They really are looking for someone who will buy into their dream, who will look at their hard work, and who will understand that their dreams can become a reality with hope. This bill is trying to do that.  Members are hearing a lot of doom and gloom on the other side. In fact, I think the phrase was just thrown out, financial doom for the retail investor. Let's talk about these retail investors.  For you to become an accredited investor, someone who would qualify to be able to invest in these startup companies, according to SEC rule 501, you need to be married, jointly; $300,000 in income; and $1 million of net worth, excluding your home. So you cannot include a million-dollar home. You have to have $1 million net worth outside of your home and have an income of $300,000. Earlier, college students were brought up. Not a whole lot of college students that I am aware of have $300,000 annual income or $1 million net worth.  These are people who are sophisticated, typically. They are high net worth, by definition. Interestingly enough, as Members of Congress, if we allowed some of these amendments to go through and these restrictions to go through, as Members of Congress, we would be excluded from the room. We would be excluded. We couldn't even go in there to educate ourselves about how this process works. That, ultimately, is what this is about.  Those pitch days are not just for those people who are going to invest. Those pitch days are not just for the people who are going to do the investing. Those pitch days are for others to learn, to have an understanding.  If you are a college student sitting in the back row, to understand what it looks like to become an entrepreneur, to really become a part of that engine of the American economy, you should be in the room. If you are someone who might be making a pitch later on and want to see how this happens and[[Page H264]]works, you ought to be in the room. Let's not exclude those people.  Why would we have a government closed off, closed room, a government-sanctioned closed room that would keep people from understanding and achieving their hopes and dreams and success?  I am pleased to be up here and to talk about this issue because we know that for our standing in the world, we need to have a dynamic economy.

1689,topic-id,413,"Mr.Chairman, so here is the alternate reality you are expected to believe in this scenario that has been created. You are going to have somebody wander off the street with their checkbook in their pocket, listen to a 3- to 5-minute pitch on an idea that is going to change the world, and then they are going to sign away their financial future and life savings. That is the scenario that is being painted for you out there today by the opponents of this commonsense legislation.  Again, to be an investor, you must be an accredited investor, according to the SEC rules, Rule 501, that says you have $300,000 of income annually and a net worth of $1 million outside of your home. Owning your house doesn't count towards that.  I have been to these pitch days. You know what you are walking into. You don't just stumble on it and go: Wow, what's going on here?  I have never thought about this. Tell you what, I am going to write a five- or six- or seven-figure check today and put myself into financial ruin. That is not how these things work.  Mr.Chairman, at the end of the day, I think it is important to just review a little bit of the history here.  First of all, this amendment isn't necessary. It would create yet another SEC-required disclosure and further burden the ability for startups to present their ideas to demo days.  I would note that this amendment could have been offered last March, either in committee or while we here in the House had consideration last April 2016. However, in both cases that didn't occur.  Let's remember why we are here today, Mr.When the SEC promulgated the rules to implement Title II of the JOBS Act, the agency made something that was legal prior to April 5 of 2012 suddenly illegal. The SEC decided that demo days that bring together those entrepreneurs and those companies suddenly became a general solicitation.  That isn't the case, and this amendment would require the SEC to prescribe a disclosure that ``describes the nature of the event and the risks of investing in securities being advertised.''  There is no sale that day, Mr.No sale at all is going to happen. There is no exchange that happens at that event.  This amendment is unnecessary, overly broad, and would delay the return to the certainty that the pre-JOBS Act had brought.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Today, I am proud to speak in support of the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS I would also thank Chairman Chabot and Congressman Sinema for putting forth this important bipartisan legislation, and I am a proud cosponsor.  I am fortunate enough to regularly hear from innovators across Illinois and through my work on the House Science, Space, and Technology These are the people who harness technology to accomplish the impossible, whether that is making life-changing medical breakthroughs or just finding a better way to do everyday tasks.  As we all know, startups are the job creators that drive our economy by creating new jobs that can get our constituents back to work.  Angel investors play a key role in the earliest stages of these startups. They provide the initial rounds of funding to help these life-changing ideas get off the ground. We shouldn't have unnecessary barriers in place for our innovators to have access to the capital they need to grow.  The situation we currently find ourselves facing is frustrating for startups and potential investors. There is some regulatory uncertainty from implementation of the JOBS In short, Regulation D may imply a demo day is a general solicitation, which would require companies to identify if investors meet the definition of accredited.  If demo days are treated as general solicitations, startups and investors are required to comply with burdensome, third-party verification rules. However, the purpose of these demo days is not to seek investors. It simply is to promote good ideas. No solicitations or sales of securities take place. This confusion may prevent any conversation--even a very informal one--between angel investors and startups from happening. This can be easily clarified by the legislation under consideration today.  As I mentioned, startup companies frequently participate in demo days to increase the visibility of their company, explain their ideas, and hope to informally attract investors. These demo days are sponsored by a variety of organizations interested in promoting innovation and job creation. For example, the University of Illinois' Research Park told me that this bill would make things like the Cozad New Venture Competition, Urbana-Champaign Angel Network or UCAN angel presentations, the Share the Vision technology showcase, pitch practice at EnterpriseWorks, and other public forums for startups in Illinois problematic. They want to encourage showcases of startups without fear of these programs constituting a formal fundraising solicitation to report to the  The bill simply clarifies SEC regulations to ensure startups may participate in educational demo days without having to verify that attendees are accredited investors.

Adherence to decades-old policy regarding technology costs our taxpayers billions of dollars, stifles creativity, and needlessly prevents our government from utilizing private sector technologies.

1770,topic-id,597,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), the majority leader.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, the government is many things. It is large, it is complicated, and it is ineffective. I don't think anyone would call it modern. While the world is rushing forward with things like voice-based interfaces, autonomous vehicles, online retail, and data analytics, government is stubbornly years, or even decades, behind.  We do not have to accept it. One of the purposes of the Innovation Initiative, our effort here in the House, is to bring government into the modern age.  Right now, it can still take hours for citizens to get the IRS on the phone to ask the most basic questions. Parents and students still deal with the clunky user interfaces when applying for tuition assistance. And the VA still uses a scheduling system that is a quarter century old. It doesn't have to be this way.  We have a program right now, the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, that brings in highly talented professionals from across the country to help upgrade our government's use of technology. Now, these are engineers, designers, innovators, and thinkers. They challenge the old ways of thinking and introduce new approaches to make our government work the way the American people deserve it to work.  I sponsored the TALENT Act to make sure this innovation program continues into the future. By drawing on the great talent of the American people, we can make government effective, efficient, and accountable.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong support of the TALENT Act, a bill to ensure that we continue to bring top private sector innovators into government to help solve complex technological problems at Federal agencies.  The Presidential Innovation Fellows program was established by President Obama in 2012 to identify and pursue projects that apply and implement innovative private sector techniques in as little as 6 months. The program was made permanent by Executive Order 13704 in 2015, and would be codified by the bill before us today.  H.39 would require the General Services Administration to continue managing the program with guidance from an advisory board comprised of representatives from different executive branch agencies. Over 100 Presidential Innovation Fellows have already been appointed to work alongside dedicated civil servants at 25 Federal agencies and departments.  At those agencies, fellows have been able to merge their experience from top universities, pioneering companies, and successful nonprofits with their desire to contribute to society through public service. This collaboration has allowed the Federal Government to obtain new tools, develop new technologies, and ultimately become more effective and efficient.  Presidential Innovation Fellows have reshaped the way Americans interact with their government in areas ranging from health care and science to law enforcement and disaster response. Fifteen million Americans can access their health data as a result of the program's Blue Button initiative, and cancer patients can search for clinical trials as part of work to support the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot initiative.  Scientists can now obtain more weather data collected by NOAA, and veterans can now more readily access custom prosthetic designs.  Citizens can review police records, including crime statistics and data on officer-involved shootings. And FEMA and other first responders can better target and prioritize their response to natural disasters.  All of these things have been made possible through the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, and it is crucial that we continue our support of these and other endeavors by ensuring its permanency.  I urge my colleagues to support H.39.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH283-3.txt,2269,MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,January

Today, I am urging my colleagues to support H.39, the TALENT Act, introduced by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of This bill passed the House on a strong bipartisan vote in the 114th Congress, and I am glad to be part of the team working to enact this important legislation into law.  The TALENT Act makes permanent the Presidential Innovation Fellows program that was created in 2012. This highly competitive program recruits talented, private sector innovators and technologists from across the United  Presidential Innovation Fellows serve in the Washington, D.C., area for 12 months at an executive agency. These agencies include the Department of Energy, NASA, and the Department of Veterans  Fellows bring with them their experience in the private sector to help government turn ideas into tangible results that ultimately benefit the American people. Since 2012, at least 96 top innovators have participated in the program.  Past and current fellows have come from companies large and small and hold degrees from top universities across the country. They have won a variety of awards, including Fulbright scholarships, Silicon Valley Business Journal's 40 Under 40 recognition, and Truman National Security Project fellowships. These fellows truly are the best and the brightest the United States has to offer, and they seek to utilize their skills for the American people.  Presidential Innovation Fellows are giving the Federal Government the tools it needs to successfully operate in the 21st century. Previous projects completed by fellows include Uncle Sam's Fellows created a database to offer a centralized information center in which agencies can forgo buying new commodity IT and support services in favor of existing services provided by the Federal agencies. This program has saved an estimated $2.5 billion, and it is helping government become more effective and efficient.  I commend Majority Leader McCarthy for the work to bring this innovation to the government. Again, I urge support for this bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.

544,topic-id,609,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, floor debate isboth for the people in the room and the people watching.  Many of the new Members have not yet voted on a substantive pieceof legislation. So, Mr.Speaker, I reach out with a little piece of history--a large piece of history, perhaps--for the freshmenof both parties.  First of all, this legislation is bipartisan. It is sponsored by both Republicans and  Secondof all, when Mr.Conyers, Mr.Nadler, and I were 16 years younger, in March of 2001, it was the last and only timethat the underlying law allowed for a regulation to be repealed. It was prominently called ergonomics. It was repealed. I hadthe honor of voting for that as a freshman.  Since that time, in spite of the many regulations that some people don't like inone party or another, we have not seen fit to have a joint resolution repeal a regulation.  So let's talk about what it takesto do that. It takes both Houses of the Congress and the President of the United States to repeal a regulation created by abureaucrat, or many bureaucrats--a regulation that may or may not be consistent with the law passed by this body, by the Senate,and by a President in this or a previous  Again, for the freshmen, we are the body that creates laws, and we do sothrough a complex and difficult procedure. We pass it out of the House or We then pass it out of the other body. If thePresident signs it, it then still is subject to court challenge.                              {time}  1400  Now, let's go through the regulatory process: Proposed by a bureaucrat, given a period of time in which dissenters may be100 percent, and still it becomes law if this body does not act. So now that gives you a little feel for the underlying law.Used once on a bipartisan basis to take back an unpopular regulation that has never been resubmitted under both 8 years of aRepublican and 8 years of a Democrat in the White House, and I repeat, the regulation that was previously recalled was so inerror that it has never been redone in 16 years by two  Now, let's talk about the bill we have before us today.We all know that the House is a body that, when it wants to, can move fairly quickly, and the Senate is a body that seeminglymoves quickly only in recess. The fact is that the Senate takes a long time, and we have many regulations that may or may not beconsidered now or in the future.  All this legislation does is allow for us to dispose of one or more regulations in anexpedited fashion in this body and have it seen in the same form in the Nothing more than that. It doesn't change theunderlying law. It doesn't change the fact that the House, the Senate, and a President must concur on taking back what isessentially a law--that is what a regulation is--created by bureaucrats not elected by any of us. So let's keep it as simple asthat.  For the freshmen of either party, when you go to make a vote on this, remember, we are not changing the underlyinglaw. Only one regulation under the underlying law has ever been repealed, and it was bipartisan in both the House and the Senatewhen it was repealed. It has been 16 years, and the few that will likely be considered under this act and the underlying lawwill be just that, a relatively few regulations that are believed to be unnecessary and for which the House, the Senate, and thePresident concur.

The gentlewomanfrom Florida, I am sure, is well intended, but there is nothing more transparent than calling up to the floor of this House anddebating the removal of regulations that have been found to be excessive or extreme or simply not consistent with the law. Thatis a transparent process. The term ``regular order,'' in fact, could not be more appropriate to that process. We passed a lawnearly three Presidents ago, if you will, that simply called for this procedure.  All I am saying is we should not be mireddown, if there are five or six or eight bad regulations, in not combining them together for purposes of getting them disposed ofin a timely fashion. I might suggest to everyone that they remember that many of us did not support the regulation changeyesterday as to the ethics oversight, because we do believe in transparency and will continue to believe in transparency.  Again, nothing is more transparent than bringing to the House floor the debate about something that is believed to have beenwrong done by unelected bureaucrats. ``Bureaucrat'' is not a dirty word, but ``unelected'' fits this process.

From 2009 to present, the federal government imposed nearly      $900 billion in regulatory costs on the Americanpeople which      requires billions of hours of paperwork. Many of these      regulations have been or will be imposed on the      constructionindustry. ABC is committed to reforming the      broken federal regulatory process and ensuring industry      stakeholders' voices areheard and rights are protected. ABC      supports increased transparency and opportunities for      regulatory oversight by Congress andultimately, the American      people.       The Obama administration issued numerous rulemakings that      detrimentally impact theconstruction industry. In some cases,      these regulations are based on conjecture and speculation,      lacking foundation in soundscientific analysis. For the      construction industry, unjustified and unnecessary      regulations translate to higher costs, which arethen passed      along to the consumer or lead to construction projects being      priced out of the market. This chain reactionultimately      results in fewer projects, and hinders businesses' ability to      hire and expand.       ABC members understand the value ofstandards and      regulations when they are based on solid evidence, with      appropriate consideration paid to implementation costs      andinput from the business community. Federal agencies must      be held accountable for full compliance with existing      rulemakingstatutes and requirements when promulgating      regulations to ensure they are necessary, current and cost-     effective for businessesto implement.       ABC opposes unnecessary, burdensome and costly regulations      resulting from the efforts of Washington bureaucratswho have      little accountability for their actions. H.26 will help to      bring greater accountability to the rulemaking process asit      would require any executive branch rule or regulation with an      annual economic impact of $100 million or more to come      beforeCongress for an up-or-down vote before being enacted.      Moreover, H.21 will further enhance congressional      oversight of theoverreaching regulations often issued during      the final months of a president's term and help to revive the      division ofpowers.

The NAMis the largest manufacturing association in the      United States, representing small and large manufacturers in      every industrialsector and in all 50 states. Manufacturing      employs nearly 12 million men and women, contributes more      than $1.8 trillion to theU.economy annually, has the      largest economic impact of any major sector, and accounts for      two-thirds of private sectorresearch and development. The NAM      is the leading advocate for a policy agenda that helps      manufacturers compete in the globaleconomy and create jobs      across the United       The Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 would amend the      Congressional ReviewAct to provide Congress the authority to      consider one joint resolution of disapproval for regulations      en bloc as opposed to asingle regulation at a time. As the      end of an Administration approaches, there is an incentive      for federal agencies to issue asignificant number of      regulations. These are known as midnight rules, and H.21      would allow Congress to effectively respond toregulations      that conflict with congressional intent, exceed an agency's      statutory authority or are hastily drafted and issued asan      Administration prepares its departure.       The problem of midnight rules is not new and is not unique      to a particularpolitical party. As an administration attempts      to complete its regulatory agenda, an abundance of midnight      rules can overwhelmCongress' ability to engage in proper      oversight of federal agencies. Midnight rules can be issued      without justification andwithout an agency conducting proper      regulatory analysis. Congress should be granted the authority      needed to appropriatelyrespond to the issuance of a midnight      rules that might not be drafted in accordance with sound      regulatoryprinciples.       Manufacturers support a regulatory system that results in      regulations that efficiently and effectively achievepolicy      objectives, and we urge you to support passage of H.21,      the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017.       Thank you for yourconsideration.

Republicans are expected todelay repealing      parts of Obamacare to allow for more time to design a      replacement health care plan. President Obama is expectedto      meet with Congressional Democrats on Wednesday as well to      discuss plans for defending Obamacare from repeal.       Last week theDepartment of Justice (DOJ) announced that      they had reached final agreements with Swiss banks on the      Swiss Bank Theprogram aims to help financial      institutions avoid criminal liabilities due to U.tax      crimes by granting banks non-prosecutioneligibility if they      meet certain requirements. The Swiss Bank program was      initially announced in 2013.               Eakinomics: The Regulatory Cleanup Begins       The tally has been mounting for years--over 3,000costly      regulations totaling nearly $875 billion in finalized burden      costs. As the economy became increasingly festooned withrule      making and regulatory drag, conservatives have promised to      bring the regulatory state to sanity given the      firstopportunity. That moment has presumably arrived.      Congress returns from the holidays with plans to get started.       Specifically,I expect that the House will begin cleaning up      the midnight regulatory onslaught by the Obama      administration. Historically, thiswould have required a      regulation-by-regulation use of the Congressional Review Act      (CRA). Instead, the House will consider abill (HR 5982 in the      last Congress), which would permit Congress to disapprove      multiple midnight rules en banc--in a singleresolution.       That takes care of the last-gasp efforts of the outgoing      president. But what guarantees better performance in      thefuture? The House will next turn to the Regulations from      the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) With the REINS      Act,Congress would have 70 legislative days to approve a      major rule with economic impact over $100 million. Only then      would it besent to the president for signature. Without a      positive vote, the regulation would not take effect. If      enacted, REINS could savemore than $27 billion in annual      regulatory costs and 11.5 million paperwork burden hours      according to AAF research by       Passage of the REINS Act (or other, similar, legislation)      would insert Congress more firmly into the regulatoryprocess,      a significant change that is not done lightly. However, the      lesson of the past eight years is that even withoutexecutive      overreach the regulatory process does not correctly balance      benefits and costs; a recalibration of the underlyingprocess      is overdue.

Darrell Issa,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear RepresentativeIssa: The Small Business      Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) strongly supports the      ``Midnight Rules Relief Act.'' Thislegislation is vital as it      provides a needed check against the surge in new and      questionable regulatory activity that isflooding into the      Federal Register, which will eventually make its way to small      businesses.       While ``midnight regulations''have been a problem across      Administrations, what is happening in the current period is      staggering. According to the AmericanAction Forum, the      current output of midnight rules is up 42 percent over 2008,      and 48 percent over 2000. This regulatory surgemust be      ``checked'' and contained by Congress before it causes      permanent damage to the competitiveness of many types of      smallbusinesses.       The end-game push on the regulatory front will undoubtedly      show that shortcuts were taken in a process meant toprotect      small businesses. Mercatus Center research found that the      quality of analysis suffers during the midnight      regulatoryperiod, which means these regulations are      ``excessively costly'' or ineffective. Poorly constructed and      politically-drivenregulation will only create more      uncertainty and costs for our nation's struggling small      businesses.       Your legislation willprovide Congress with needed      flexibility in using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by      allowing a CRA resolution to addressmore than one regulation.      This important reform enhances the CRA and allows Congress to      use its time efficiently to address themany issues that face      our economy and nation.

Particularly egregious were his recent announcements      onenergy and environmental policy: He rejected the permit for      the Dakota access pipeline, exempted wind farm companies      fromkilling eagles, abused the Antiquities Act to remove      western lands from economic development, and prohibited      federal offshoredrilling and mineral leases on millions of      acres across the country, including 115 million acres off the      coast of      This flurry of regulatory activity is simply the latest in      a long line of overreaches from the Obama White      Theoutgoing president has consistently sought ways to enact      his agenda unilaterally over his two terms--notoriously      ``working aroundCongress'' in order to do so. A recent report      from the American Action Forum found that the Obama      administration issued 600major regulations totaling $743      billion over the course of his presidency. This is an average      of 81 majorregulations--regulations that exceed $100 million      by agency estimates--per year.       Thankfully, the House of Representatives ispoised to hit      the ground running in slowing the growth of the regulatory      state. Representatives will consider two importantbills on      the floor as one of their first orders of business for the      year. Both bills, once passed by the Senate and signed      byfuture President Trump, will bring meaningful relief to the      American families and businesses across the country who      arecurrently drowning in red tape.       The first bill, Darrell Issa's Midnight Rule Relief      Act, is particularly important giventhe onslaught of      regulations coming from the White House and the scarcity of      available floor time in It would allowCongress to      disapprove of multiple so-called ``midnight rules''--     regulations finalized in the waning days of      theadministration--using a single Congressional Review Act      (CRA) resolution, as opposed to disapproving of these rules      individually.This change will make it easier for Congress to      disapprove of the Obama administration's recent spate of      economically dangerousactions.       The second bill, the Regulations from the Executive in Need      of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, is also important. This wouldrequire      executive agencies to submit ``major'' rules--those with an      annual economic impact of $100 million or more--to      Congressfor review and a clear up-or-down vote before the      rules take effect. This would assert Congress's proper role      in approving therules that govern the country, an authority      which has been increasingly delegated to executive agencies.      It would also encouragemore debate among lawmakers about the      size and scope of the federal government. Incoming Todd      Young championed thisimportant legislation during his time in      the House; it's good to see Doug Collins introduce it in      this new      Both of these bills received bipartisan support in past      Congresses; they may enjoy even more in this current      one.Strange bedfellows could emerge in anticipation of the      Trump presidency. Democrats in Congress who want to limit the      ability ofa Republican White House to enact new rules, as      well as Republicans who principally support limiting the size      and scope ofgovernment.       Americans across the county voted for President-elect      Donald Trump and a Republican majority in Congress      becausethey are tired of President Obama's harmful regulatory      agenda. It's little surprise that President-elect Donald      Trump swept rustbelt states and the upper Midwest in the      recent election--these parts of the country have been      devastated by President Obama'sregulatory overreach, and they      stood to lose even further under the threats of a Hillary      Clinton administration.       Congress isright to reverse President Obama's regulatory      assault on job creation and economic growth in this county,      and it should workclosely with President-elect Trump in      peeling it back. Representatives should support the two      regulatory reform bills when theycome up on the floor this      week, and they should seek additional efforts to overturn      these myriad rules, including futureCongressional Review Act      resolutions of disapproval and adding appropriations riders      that would prohibit funding forimplementation of the worst      rules, while executive agencies promulgate new rules to      eliminate them.       Doing so will send astrong message that lawmakers are      willing to stand up to the executive overreach of the past      eight years.

562,topic-id,772,"Mr.Speaker, the fact is we are hearing many people talk about importantregulations and of their somehow being taken out. Let's understand that regulations can go both ways. These changes and theunderlying law can also protect the other way. The fact is now we are in the future. You could have an administration that, inits final days, changes regulations to make them more lenient to large businesses, more lenient to polluters, more lenient tothe employers to the detriment of their employees. Regulations can go both ways, and only the most extreme regulations--literallyone since the enactment of the underlying legislation--has ever been repealed.  I don't want to belittle my own legislation,but let's understand that there won't be 61 en bloc being brought. There will be some, I hope, and there may be more than one.Yet for Congress to take back, piece by piece, its responsibility and then live up to that responsibility should be all of ourgoals.  Now, this legislation was limited to midnight rules. Let's understand that midnight rules are the rules done in thewaning days of an administration--7-plus years into this administration--and many of these rules, in fact, were enacted after thelast vote of the people. I think it is important to understand that, on election day, the American people delivered a resoundingmessage to Washington: stop the regulatory, Big Government onslaught that is killing jobs.  One of my colleagues earlierspoke of the fact that we had had so many jobs--15 million jobs--created in the last 8 years. The percentage of the workforce thatis working in America today is the smallest in my lifetime. It is smaller than it was 8 years ago, 16 years ago, or 21 yearsago. We are not creating jobs at the rate of our population. We should not have some sort of an accolade for regulations havingcreated a great economy if, in fact, that economy has grown less than 2 percent a year and has not kept up with any historic 8-year period. To me, that is an important part. Although the discussion I just had was about more than regulations, let'sunderstand that the growth of regulations--of lawmaking--is certainly not the creator of jobs.  I think, when we look at thecost--and that is a lot of what we are dealing with in the manager's amendment in this bill--we are dealing with the recognitionthat we are looking at regulations in light of how much they cost. Now, that cost is based on independent scoring. It is not theadministration's scoring and it is not my scoring. It is that of the Congressional Budget Office's, an independent agency thatdoesn't always give a score I want, but the score is not arrived through partisan activities.  I reach out again to theMembers who may not yet know that what we are asking is simply to assert our normal ability in Congress and put together one ormore ideas for the efficiency of the body, to send it from here to the Senate, and from the Senate to the What we areproposing in this legislation as a small change to the underlying legislation that has been with us for three Presidents is, infact, consistent with this body's doing its job, in regular order, in the clear light of day.  I think the important messagefor this piece of bipartisan legislation is: we are taking back a limited amount of our capability, trying to streamline it, andgiving the President an opportunity to accept or reject a piece of legislation voted on by a majority of the House and amajority of the Senate before it gets to the The President, if he feels we have included even one regulationinappropriately that he would like to retain, would veto our bill.  Lastly, I beg everyone to look at this for what it is,not for what others say it is, because it is simply Congress doing its job in an efficient fashion and consistent with 20-plusyears of history and with there being only one piece--one time--when a regulation was withdrawn. No President since that time hastried to produce or has asked Congress to pass a law so as to put into effect a regulation that, on a bipartisan basis, theHouse, the Senate, and a President thought should go. I urge the support for this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back thebalance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

So, in order to pass it today, because she did not set it up to excludethese items and have them immediately considered, I cannot support her motion to recommit.  What I will say is that when welook at regulations to put into a package that may be a package of one or a package, if this passes, of more than one, Icertainly will expect that those regulations will have to do with things which could have been done sooner, would have been donesooner, and were done in the waning days of the administration for no reason that was time sensitive.  The Affordable CareAct was passed in the first days of the administration. If there is something in the last days of the administration that hasmerit, I certainly would urge my colleagues not[[Page H86]]to rescind that regulation. But if there is something that should have beendone in year one, two, three, four, five, or six, I would ask why it wasn't done then.  Having said that, it is unfortunatethat this motion to recommit was written in a way that would send it back to committee and, thus, cause a substantial delay.  I would caution my colleagues that, at least from this Member, if you have a motion to recommit and you want the amendmentitself considered, make it one that is immediate and not back to committee.

1201,topic-id,3571,"Mr.President, I rise to offer this amendment, amendment 8, with Senator Murphy and other Senators, to the budget resolution we are currently considering, and the purpose of amendment 8 would be to create a point of order against considering any legislation that would either strip Americans of health insurance coverage, make health care more expensive, or reduce the quality of health coverage.  Our amendment creates a high hurdle to any legislation that would make America sick again, and basically that is what we are trying to do. If we are going to either strip coverage from people or make health insurance more expensive or reduce the quality of health coverage for Americans that they currently have, we shouldn't make that easy to do. We should have a high hurdle in place so we consider it before we do it.  The point of order is necessary because the entire purpose of this budget resolution is not to really address the budgetary matters facing the country.

A budget resolution is a tool to set forth the guidelines for spending in  We know, in the history of this body, we are not always successful in passing a budget through both Houses of Congress and approving that budget through a conference process, but at least some progress is usually made; for example, both Houses doing their budget resolutions. As you know, that did not happen in 2016. Last year, our GOP counterparts in each House decided, for the first time in the modern budget era, not to hold a hearing on the President's submitted budget, not to have any activity on a budget in the Senate, either in the committee or on the floor.  To begin, I have to ask, if the budget wasn't important enough for us to consider last year, why is it now so important for us to be taking up a budget? The answer is obvious. We are debating a budget for the sole purpose--the sole purpose--of setting in motion a process to repeal health care coverage for tens of millions of This is really about an attack on people's health care.  I and many of my colleagues have said there is a significant need to make improvements to the Affordable Care Act and, more generally, to our health care system.  Mr.President, you were a chief executive of a State, just like I was. I learned something in my first year as Governor of Virginia, which was, when I looked at all the bills that were put on my desk for signature, amendment, or veto at the end of my State's legislative session, three-quarters of the bills were not new legislation or not repeals of legislation; three-quarters of the bills were improvements of existing law. That is the work of a legislative body. Overwhelmingly, it should be improvements to existing law. The Affordable Care Act needs significant improvement, just as other health care laws do, just as virtually everything we do needs improvement.  There is no reason, while we acknowledge the need for improvement, to repeal a law outright without having a sense of what the replacement will be because, by doing so, what we do is create chaos in the economy, chaos in the health insurance market, and especially chaos in the most intimate and important area of people's lives, their health.  Actually, on that subject, there was a wonderful letter that was sent on January 3 by the American Medical Association to the congressional leadership on[[Page S80]]this very point, don't do a repeal that creates chaos for people. I am going to read some sections of the letter.  The AMA supported passage of the Affordable Care Act because it was a significant improvement on the status quo at that time.       We continue to embrace the primary goal of the law to make      high-quality, affordable health care coverage accessible to      all We also recognize that the ACA is imperfect,      and there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.  Continuing the quote:       It is essential that gains in the number of Americans with      health insurance coverage be maintained.  The letter concludes, from the American Medical Association, the largest organization representing American physicians:       Consistent with this core principle, we believe that before      any action is taken, through reconciliation or other means,      that would potentially alter coverage, policymakers should      lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what      will replace current policies. Patients and other      stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy      to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about      whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process      of health reform.  The amendment Senator Murphy and I propose is designed to accomplish exactly the goal, exactly the goal the AMA has specified in the letter of January 3.  We would create a 60-vote point of order against any legislation that would, first, reduce the number of Americans who are enrolled in public or private health insurance coverage, so there would be a 60-vote point of order against any proposal that would reduce coverage for Americans; second, the point of order would also lie against any plan that would increase health care premiums or total out-of-pocket health care costs for Americans with private health insurance; and, third, the point of order would lie against any proposed plan on the table that would reduce the scope and scale of benefits offered by private health insurance because the ACA was not only about affordable care and it was not only about coverage, it was also about the quality of care.  Could your coverage discriminate against you because you are a woman? Could your coverage expire once you get diagnosed with an illness and now have a preexisting condition?  These bill of rights protections for patients were an important and integral part of the Affordable Care Act, and the budget point of order that we would put on the table would establish a 60-vote threshold for considering any legislation if it triggered one of those three concerns: reduction in coverage, increase in cost, reduction in quality.  The point of order actually goes right to promises that the President-elect has made. In September of 2015, President-elect Trump said:       I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it      costs me votes or not. Everybody is going to be taken care of      much better than they are taken care of now.  He has made a promise to the American public that we will not rush into a new health care chapter that reduces coverage, that reduces quality, or that increases costs.  Just 2 days ago, the key spokesperson for the President-elect Kellyanne Conway said: We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance.  She is not setting a threshold of 1 million people or 100,000 people or 10,000 people or 10 people. She is saying the threshold is this: We do not want anyone who has insurance to have that insurance jeopardized by actions of  This is what a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, without a replacement plan, will mean. It will have three significant consequences, and then I want to finish with some personal stories.  First, a repeal with no replacement will inflict a significant wound on the American economy. Health care is one-sixth of the American economy, one-sixth. You cannot inject uncertainty into one-sixth of the American economy without having significant negative effects on our  Congress should be in the business of increasing certainty, not increasing uncertainty, and if we go into the biggest sector of the American economy with a repeal, without any replacement strategy, it is the equivalent of, ``I am now going to jump off a cliff and I will figure out how to land once I am in midair.'' This will be economic malpractice to affect that many people.  Second, the effect of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is sort of an under-the-table tax cut for the wealthiest Millionaires, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed--there are two taxes on high earners that are part of the financing of the Affordable Care Act, and these taxes on high-earning Americans would expire, and this is hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years of a tax cut. Millionaires would get 53 percent of the tax cuts from a repeal, which is more than double the same group's share of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that were done during the Bush administration.  Just to put that in some context, Americans in the top 0.1 percent economically would get an average tax cut of $197,000 if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. That is one way to sort of look at this repeal without a replacement. It is essentially a tax cut for the wealthiest, financed by reductions of health care on the people who are most in need.  Third, the impact that is the most significant is the impact on the health care of average The Urban Institute did a study in December and said: If there is a repeal with no replacement or a repeal with a delayed replacement to something that we know not what it will be, there will be 30 million Americans who will lose their health insurance. About 20 million will be people who got health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and an additional 10 million will be people who will lose their insurance because of the chaos created in the insurance market.  I want to put that number, 30 million, into a context because numbers can just sound big and mysterious. Here is what 30 million people is. The number of people who would lose health insurance because of an ACA repeal is equal to the combined population of 19 States: Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota, Alaska, South Dakota, Delaware, Montana, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Kansas, and Nineteen States' combined populations, that is 30 million people, and that is who is going to lose health care coverage if we go forward with a repeal without a replacement.  Eighty-two percent of these 30 million who would become uninsured are working families, 38 percent will be between the ages of 18 and 34, and 56 percent are non-Hispanic Eighty percent of the adults becoming uninsured are people who do not have college degrees. There will be 12.9 million fewer people who have Medicaid or CHIP coverage in 2019 if the repeal goes through. These are some sobering statistics. These statistics show that, at a minimum, what we are doing here is very, very consequential and very, very important and should not be rushed into in a partisan 51-vote budget reconciliation process.  I want to conclude and tell a couple of stories from Virginians of people who are going to be impacted by this. When we essentially recessed in the Senate on December 9--between then and now--I went around the State and talked to people. I heard a story that I want to share, and then I will tell a couple of quick ones.  I met with Ashley Hawkins, a young mother in Richmond, a mother of two kids. We sat around a conference table in a federally chartered community health center in Richmond and talked to stakeholders. Ashley told her story. She had a preexisting health condition. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance was unaffordable. After the Affordable Care Act passed, she could suddenly get insurance.  Ashley owns a small business. She runs a nonprofit group that provides community arts education that serves others. Because of the ACA, she has been able to sign up on exchanges and get health insurance. Because of her income, she can receive subsidies to make that health insurance affordable. She makes $45,000 a year.  Without health insurance, the recent hospital bill for the birth of her youngest child would have been close to $16,000. With the Affordable Care Act, she receives a subsidy, and she is able to access high quality health insurance for her and her two kids for $280 a month. That is the difference between[[Page S81]]not being able to afford to go to a hospital and deliver a child and to be able to afford, as a small business owner, a health insurance policy that covers her and her two kids for less than $300 a month.  This is what she said as we sat around the table and talked about what it means to have affordable insurance. She said: ``It has to do with self esteem and security and well-being.''  Having health insurance is about security, even when you are not sick. Obviously, when you are sick or when you are delivering a child, health insurance is needed. But when you are a mother of two children, even if you are at the peak of your health and even if your children are at the peak of their health, you would go to bed at night--and Ashley described this--wondering: What will happen tomorrow if my child gets sick? What will happen tomorrow if I am in an accident? Not having health insurance for a parent is a continuous agitating voice in your mind, an anxiety creator, about what is going to happen to my family if we get sick or get in an accident, which is something that happens to virtually every family. It has to do with self-esteem, with security, and with well-being. Without the protection for people with preexisting conditions, without the subsidies in the marketplace, people like Ashley will go back to not being able to afford coverage for their families.  After the Affordable Care Act passed, I happened to be in a position where I was trying to buy health insurance in the open market without an employer subsidy for the first time in my life. When I say I was doing this, what I mean is that my wife was doing all the work because she is the one who does all the work. She talked to two insurance companies who said: Hey, sorry, Anne, we can't afford your entire family because of preexisting conditions. One company would not cover me. One company would not cover one of my children. My wife said: Hold on a second. The Affordable Care Act just passed. You can't turn somebody down on a preexisting condition now.  In each case the insurance company said: I have to talk to my supervisor. They had to call back and say: You are right; we are wrong. We have to provide insurance for your entire family.  Can I tell you this? My family is the healthiest family in the United At the time my wife was making those phone calls, of the five of us, the only time any of us had ever been hospitalized was in the three occasions my wife went to the hospital to give birth to our kids. We are a healthy family, and we were turned down twice because of a preexisting condition by insurance companies that had to say: We are wrong, and because of the Affordable Care Act, now we can write a policy for your entire family.  I had a woman write me a letter--a Virginian from Williamsburg--a couple of years ago who said: My husband and I are self-employed, and we could never afford insurance. Because we couldn't afford insurance, we decided that we couldn't have children. We couldn't pay a hospital bill. This is what the Affordable Care Act has meant to them. We often talk about life and death issues in the sense of illnesses, sicknesses, cancer diagnoses, and preexisting medical conditions. They can be life or death issues, but they can also be life issues, in the sense of this couple who wrote and said that because they could now get insurance as self-employed individuals with subsidies to make it affordable, they are now going to start a family because of the Affordable Care They could start a family.  Finally--and I will always remember this because this gives me great motivation--as I was getting outside of my native Virginia and exploring other States on an interesting 105-day summer vacation as part of a national ticket, I went to the Iowa State I told this story once before on the floor, but I am going to tell it again. A grandfather came up with a little boy in his arms. I said: What is that child's name? Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. There is Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, a place where children have been able to go to get medical care.  I knew there must be a story. I said: Hey, Jude, tell me about Jude was a 3\1/2\-year-old who was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect and by age 3\1/2\--as his grandfather told me the story, now mom and dad were coming around me as well--Jude had to have multiple heart operations at the Children's Hospital in The grandfather said to me that Jude would not have been able to have those operations and Jude would be uninsurable for the rest of his life if it were not for the Affordable Care  Then Jude's father put his hand on my shoulders. He was a big guy. He said to me: You have to tell me that you will do everything you can to make sure that Jude isn't stripped away and consigned again into the outer reaches of preexisting conditions and uninsurable, with an uncertain future for my son. I made a pledge to him. I said: I am only one person. I don't know what, at the end of the day, I can do, but I can tell you this. I can stand up to make sure that your child and other children--such as Ashley's two kids and the family that wrote me about wanting to have children--will not be left high and dry and without the security of health insurance in the wealthiest and, to my way of thinking, still the most compassionate Nation on the face of this planet.  I encourage every Member of this body to ask their constituents for stories like Ashley's, like Jude's, like my family's, and like the family in Williamsburg about how an ACA repeal with no plan would impact them.  I will go back to the purpose of the amendment. The ACA is not perfect. We ought to be talking about reform. If Republicans want to call it replace and we want to call it reform or improvement, I don't care what we call it. We should have the AMA, hospitals, patients, and Members of Congress from both parties around the table to lay down what are our concern, what are our problems, and talk about how to fix them. There is so much we can do. There is so much we can improve. But by pushing an immediate repeal through a partisan budget process, we won't have the opportunity to work together to build on that common ground.  This is not a game. Sometimes we get into a budget vote-arama, and it has a little bit of a game aspect to it. I have been here until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. when amendments are put on the table, there are 1-minute presentations of why it is good or bad, and we have a vote. It has a little bit of a feeling of a game. This is not a game. This is life and death.  Is there anything more important to someone than their health, because their health forms the foundation of their relationship with their spouse or their loved ones or their children? Health is what keeps a parent up at night worrying about the family. Health is what keeps a child worrying about an elderly parent. This is the most important thing to any person in this country, regardless of party, regardless of State, regardless of political persuasion. The worst thing we can do on a value of such importance is to rush and create chaos in the lives of millions of people.  So I conclude by saying that the amendment that Senator Murphy, I, and others offer would seek to protect what we have--protect coverage, protect costs, protect quality--by making it harder to enact legislation that would strip these important items away from tens of millions of  We should be sitting down at the table to talk about reforms. So many of us want to do that. But we should not be rushing into a repeal that would jeopardize people's lives.  I urge my colleagues to please support amendment 8.

1556,topic-id,1962,"Mr.President, I rise with my colleagues, and I am thrilled to be here with them, to save our health care and to try to convince our colleagues that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would be health care malpractice, and because health care is one-sixth of the American economy, it would be economic malpractice as well.  What I thought I would do basically is just tell two stories. I am going to tell a Virginia story from before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and I am going to tell a Virginia story since the passage of the act.  I was first elected to statewide office in 2001, and I became the Lieutenant Governor of Shortly after, I started to attend, on a fairly regular basis, a most amazing annual event. It is called the Remote Area Medical clinic in Wise County, It is in the heart of Appalachia, in a community on the border of Kentucky where my wife's family is from. This was an annual medical clinic that was set up by some Catholic nuns who were driving a van around trying to offer medical care to people who didn't have it, and they decided they would recruit volunteers. They would set up at a dusty county fairground, the Virginia-Kentucky fairground in Wise, VA, and open the doors on Saturday to people who didn't have health care. It had been going for many years when I first went as Lieutenant I had heard so much about it, and I was anxious to go see it.  Here is what I saw when I first went there. People start to come on about Tuesday of the week when it is going to open on Friday, and they come in groups of three or four families, and then they come in groups of ten or dozens, and then hundreds, and then thousands, to this dusty county fairground in late July--hot in Southwestern They gather so that on Friday morning, at about 7 o'clock when it opens, they have gotten a number, they know where they are in the line, and sometime over the course of Friday and Saturday, they will be able to see a doctor, in some instances for the first time in their lives. There are doctors, dentists, medical students, the Lions Club volunteers to give vision screenings, hundreds of volunteers, and thousands of people seeking medical care.  The first year I went to this, I was overwhelmed at the magnitude of the philanthropic spirit of the volunteers, and I was also overwhelmed at the depth of the need. Something made it more palpable by walking around the parking lot to see where people had come from.  This is a community that is on the border of Virginia and Kentucky so I wasn't surprised to see Virginia license plates and Kentucky license plates. It is kind of near West Virginia so I wasn't surprised to see West Virginia license plates. It is near I saw Tennessee license plates. I saw North Carolina license plates. What struck me as I went through the parking lot was to see license plates from Georgia and license plates from Alabama and license plates from as far away as  We are the richest Nation on We are the most compassionate Nation on Yet, in order to get medical care, people would get in their cars and drive for days, and then camp for days, for the chance to see a doctor or a dentist.  It reminded me that first year, and it reminds me still, of the way health care was delivered in the poor country of Honduras where I served as a missionary in 1980 and 1981. There wasn't really a health care network. Occasionally, missionaries or others would set up a clinic in a mountain community once a year--maybe less than that--and people would gather, and that was the way we were delivering health care in a successful State, in the most compassionate and wealthiest Nation on It is just not right. It is just not right.  The RAM clinic still goes on. It hasn't gone away, but I will tell my colleagues what has happened since the passage of the Affordable Care The percentage of Americans without health insurance has dropped from over 16 percent to about 8 percent. It has almost been cut in half, and the uninsurance rate in this country is at its nearly lowest percentage since we have been able to record that number. That means there is less of a need for the RAM clinics because more people can have a medical home and can seek care. That decline has also been significant because in Virginia, we were about 14 percent uninsured in 2010, and that number has now come down to about 9 percent.  So that first story--the story of this RAM clinic, pre-Affordable Care Act, with one in six Americans not having health insurance--we have done a good thing as a Congress to provide access to dramatically reduce that number.  Let me tell my colleagues a second story. The second story is just about a family, a story in a letter that I received just a few days ago. It is a different aspect of the Affordable Care It is not so much about the reduction in the uninsured, but it is about more peace of mind and security for the majority of Americans who do have health insurance.       Dear Senator Kaine,       As a Senator, you have been charged with an immense task.      Your constituents rely on you to work on our behalf to uphold      and protect the freedoms we enjoy as Virginians and      We also rely on you to safeguard the legislation      that exists to keep our family and so many of our friends and      neighbors healthy and safe.       When I graduated from the University of Virginia, I was      fortunate to enter a career through which I received      excellent benefits. I taught second grade and kindergarten in      both Chesterfield and Albemarle My health insurance      was comprehensive and affordable. I didn't know how good I      had it.       After years in the classroom, I put my career on hold while      I stayed at home with our children. We were so lucky to have      been in a position to be able to make that choice. I know      that being able to rely on a single income is not a reality      for many We enrolled in a private health      insurance plan through my husband's company, a small business      based out of Richmond,       Our new plan came at a higher cost than my excellent      public-school teachers' insurance, but it was comprehensive      and it allowed my husband and me, and especially our      children, access to outstanding health care. Just this past      year, my husband, who was by then a part-owner in the      company, left his position to open his own Financial Advisory      firm. It was a move that was made easier because we had the      option of enrolling in a health insurance plan through the      Affordable Care Act, which we did in July of 2016.       In addition to well checkups, sick visits, prescriptions      for antibiotics, and vaccinations, we rely on our health      insurance made affordable through ``ObamaCare'' to, quite      literally, save our children's lives.       Our oldest son is ``medically complex.'' He was diagnosed      with multiple and severe food allergies when he was just 10      months old. Though he was initially highly reactive to over      13 foods, with the help of a vigilant pediatric allergist,      multiple blood draws, tens of skin prick tests, and four in-     office, hours-long oral food challenges, my son can now      safely eat all foods except for nuts, peanuts, milk, and      shellfish. Still, we pay a premium for life-saving      prescriptions that we hope he'll never need: Epi-pens. He      needs one at school and one that travels with him from home      to extracurricular activities. Even after insurance, we pay      nearly $1,000 each year for these prescriptions.       In addition to his pediatrician and allergist, we have been      to a psychologist for his anxiety and a cardiologist for a      detected heart murmur. More recently, after his pediatrician      became concerned about his stagnation on his growth chart, my      nine-year old has been subjected to more blood draws, weight      checks, countless hemoglobin level checks, and a consultation      with a gastroenterologist. Next week he will undergo an      endoscopy and a colonoscopy to, hopefully, diagnose a      treatable condition that, once known and treated, will enable      him to get back on that weight chart and thriving.       Because of our health insurance, we have the peace of mind      of being able to afford these doctors' visits, lab work, and      medical procedures for our son. Our medical insurance through      the Affordable Care Act allows us access to the best medical      care and professionals in our area.       Please do what is right for our family. Please do what is      right for your constituents. Please do what is right for our      country. Please save the Affordable Care       Thank you for taking the time to read one little piece of      our family's story.       Sarah Harris, Crozet,  My first story was about people who didn't have health insurance. My second story is about people who do have[[Page S164]]health insurance, but the health insurance is now affordable and comprehensive. My second story about the Harris family is also about something else important. Her husband was able to leave a job with health benefits to start his own company, which we want to encourage in this country. We want to encourage entrepreneurs. We want to encourage innovators. Before the Affordable Care Act, somebody like Mr.Harris couldn't leave his job and start a company because he wouldn't have been able to buy insurance that would have covered a child with a preexisting condition. Imagine being a parent with a dream, like so many have, of starting your own business, and realizing you could not achieve that dream and you would have to put it on hold because if you changed your job, you would not be able to get health insurance for your child.  I gave a speech about this on the floor last week. I will just conclude and say this. Health insurance is to provide a protection for you when you are ill or injured, but that is not all it is about because if you are a parent, even if your child is healthy, but you do not have health insurance, you go to bed at night wondering what is going to happen to my family if my child gets sick tomorrow or if I am in an accident tomorrow. Who is going to be there? How is my family going to be taken care of?  So what the Affordable Care Act is about is, as Sarah Harris said, peace of mind. It is about coverage, but it is also about the peace of mind that you need as a parent to know that your child will be protected if you are ill or if your child is injured. That is what the Affordable Care Act has done for the Harris family of Crozet, That is what it has done for tens of millions of  The Urban Institute indicated that if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without a replacement, or even a delayed replacement, it could cause 30 million Americans to lose their health insurance--and 30 million Americans is the combined population of 19 States in this country. This is not a game. This is very, very serious, life and death, that we are grappling with in this body. My strong hope is that our colleagues will join together and decide that we want to fix and improve the health care system of our Nation but not break it.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

I am very proud to say that our family is one of those families who would have been completely destroyed had it not been for Social Security and Those didn't exist when my parents were born and grandparents were[[Page H292]]living in our country. But in 1935, after our country crashed economically and there were major bank failures and the stock market crashed and wiped out the savings of millions of Americans, the Nation turned to the Federal Government, to the President, to guarantee for a large segment of our society--senior citizens--decent incomes.  The Social Security Insurance Act was enacted at the urging of Democratic President Franklin Delano He was regarded as a saint in our household because what happened around our country was that seniors before that time--many of them--were living in what we called poorhouses. They were dying in terrible circumstances, and there was no security as a person aged.  Can you imagine how revolutionary it was at that time to create a social insurance program--probably the largest insurance program America has ever had--to ensure that as people aged or if workers became disabled in the workplace or if they died that their children would have sources of income?  The program did all of that. In thinking back, gosh, over 70 years, how transformational was that?  As for our grandpa, who died in a county hospital in Ohio before the enactment of Medicare, I know the conditions that he died under. And I know that, when our mother died, it was a different situation. She had Social Security and Medicare, and we were able to take care of her. The same was true with our father.  Intergenerationally, I see our country getting better. I am proud of that. I am also proud to be a Democrat and a member of a party that has created Social Security, which has become an indispensable part of our way of life. As I have said to seniors and to workers, it is an earned benefit. People pay for it every time their paychecks are nicked, and their employers match it.  Obviously, to survivors--and, obviously, I have neighbors who have lost spouses, whose children then benefit from the survivor benefit--what an incredible gift this idea is to the American people. There are 35 million people today in our country who depend on Social Security--one out of every six Every day, Social Security lifts 20 million people out of poverty--people who used to live in poverty.  Can you imagine what that was like?  We don't ever, ever want to go back to that world.  In 2014, the latest data show us that more than 6 million children under the age of 18 live in families who receive income from Social Security, lifting more than a million children out of poverty. Social Security has never been a welfare program. It is an earned benefit, and all Americans who contribute to it during their working lifetimes receive benefits. Social Security is a compact of trust between generations. It is the ever-present sentry at the economic security gate for retirees, for those hurt on the job, or for their survivors, and it is America's greatest insurance program ever.  I happened to be living when Lyndon Johnson helped to create the Medicare program, which provides health insurance coverage now to over 55 million people in our country--essential health security for seniors. Today, only 2 percent of the elderly in our country lack health insurance compared to 48 percent--half the people of this country--in 1962, after World War II, before Medicare even existed. That seems sort of modern times, the 1960s; yet it really was not. I would say that that is a ``wow'' by any measure.  Yes, people are living longer. Thank God the program is working. People are getting free preventative healthcare screenings and are lowering the long-term costs of care because of early diagnosis. Seniors don't have to pay for mammograms or diabetes or cancer screenings, thanks to the Affordable Care Act; so we keep trying to make the system better.  Since House Republicans won the majority in 2011, every House Republican budget has tried to end the Medicare guarantee and turn Medicare into a privatized voucher program.  Do you know what that is going to do?  It is going to shut out millions of Americans who are elderly--or who are about to be elderly--from insurance. The reason we have Medicare is that insurers weren't insuring seniors--that is the reason it exists in the first place--or they will make the price so high that people won't be able to pay for it; or they will cherry-pick only the healthy people. Then those who have diabetes, those who have had prior cancers, those who have multiple sclerosis, those who have Parkinson's will be cast aside.  What kind of a country would this be, for heaven's sake?  The American Association of Retired Persons and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare completely opposed the Republicans' plan to voucherize and let every senior go out there in the market and try to find a plan of his own, because they know what that means. These two programs are the most pro-life programs this Nation has ever created. We should be so proud of what we have been able to do as a country over the last century.  The Republican attacks on Social Security and Medicare need to stop. They are America's bulwark for millions and millions of people, and they have proven themselves to be America's most important, lifetime security programs.  I thank Congressman Garamendi and Congressman Tonko for being down here tonight. I know how passionately you care about the people of our country way beyond just your districts and why we are here.

1796,topic-id,505,"Mr.Speaker, I am honored to join Mr.Garamendi and Mr.Tonko, and I want to place in the Record, since both of you have talked so eloquently about the Affordable Care Act, you know how you will be walking through your district, maybe at a parade or some public event, and someone will break from the crowd and run toward you. I am thinking about one particular woman who came up to me in one of my smaller communities. She was in tears. This was during the summertime. She has cerebral palsy, and she never was able to get care. I don't know why she didn't qualify for insurance, I don't know all of that, but she hugged me and thanked me.  And then around the corner from where we live, there is a little produce market that I go into all the time. I am friends with one of the women who works there. This little business couldn't afford insurance, so their employees, when the Affordable Care Act passed, went to the private marketplace to get a plan. This particular woman who works long hours and lost her husband to cancer told me: Marcy, why are people complaining about the Affordable Care Act? Guess what, now I have cancer.  She said: I was able to go and get all of the tests, and now they have me on chemotherapy.  So, with cancer, this woman is working. She was only able to get insurance through the Affordable Care Multiply that times 10,000, 20,000, 1 million, 20 million, whatever the number is. Think about the number of people in our country who were without insurance. Sometimes I am speechless when I meet these citizens because I think: Where were you hiding before? Where were you?  Another place I was, a woman was mixing up. She said: Well, I have health insurance, right? I pay car insurance.  I said: Car insurance doesn't cover health insurance.  People sometimes don't act in their own self-interest. She didn't even know that because she had auto insurance, that didn't cover health insurance. Can you believe that? So she was in a job where, with the Affordable Care Act, she could go out to the exchange and buy a plan.  It is amazing to me some of the things that have happened and how I see the Affordable Care Act off to a very good start.  As Mr.Tonko said, don't just repeal it until you have something to replace it with. You cannot pull the rug out from under these people's lives. It would be unconscionable to do that.  We have several Christians, several other denominations in this It would be very unChristian to do that, for those who are And for those of other denominations--pick your denomination--I just think it would be very cruel.  I thank the gentleman for allowing us to speak out this evening on behalf of citizens who can't speak for themselves and to try to help perfect what we as a Republic can do for our citizenry.                              {time}  2015  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH290.txt,616,PROVIDING FOR THE DESIGNATION OF CERTAIN MINORITY EMPLOYEES,2017.0,10.0,January

She told me, she said: You know, Marcy, I have to cut my pills in half. Can you help me try to find pills so that I can afford to pay for all the medicines that I need to take care of myself?  Rather than repealing, can't we find a majority of Republicans to help us, to help our citizens be able to get medicine at prices they can afford?  Why can't we have competitive bidding for pharmaceuticals? Why can't we have that? We have it for the We have it for the Department of Why can't we have it for the rest of our citizenry so that we can get the best price?  But I thought: Cutting your pills in half?

And I thought, this is crazy. This is crazy.  Can't we do better as a country than this for our people?  I have never understood why the price of pharmaceuticals has shot up so much.

The resolution expresses the House's disapproval of UNSC Resolution 2334, which passed 14 to 0 with the United States abstaining from the vote.  11 mischaracterizes the UN resolution and falsely claims that the United States has never abstained from votes on similar resolutions. The UN resolution reaffirms that Israel's settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are a ``major obstacle'' to peace, which has been long-standing US policy. 11 states that the Obama Administration took an unprecedented step by abstaining from the vote when in fact the decision is not unique. The Reagan Administration took a similar step when it abstained from voting on UNSCR 605 that identified Jerusalem as part of the Palestinian and Arab Territories which is now occupied by Both Republican and Democratic presidents have continued similar U.policies.

1564,topic-id,1688,"Mr.President, my colleagues have spoken tonight eloquently about a number of consequences that would follow from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act: increasing drug costs for seniors, a devastating impact on rural hospitals, elimination of consumer protection in everybody's health insurance--not just those on the Affordable Care Act--and limitations on mental health coverage and substance abuse. All of those issues have been presented eloquently and passionately.  I want to do something a little different. This isn't easy for me, but I want to tell my own story and why I feel so strongly about the issue of health insurance for all of our people.  Forty-three years ago--I think it was just about this week--I was a young staff member here in the I was a junior staff member who was covered by health insurance provided by my employer, the U.I paid a share, and the Senate paid a share. The health insurance that I had, as part of it, had free preventive care--exactly like that required by the Affordable Care  The other thing the plan I chose had was a Wednesday night doctor's session. So because I had a free checkup and because it was on Wednesday night and I didn't have to miss any work, in late January or early February of 1974, I went in for a checkup--the first one I had had in 8 or 9 years. Everything looked fine. As I was putting my shirt back on, the doctor said: Well, you have a mole on your back, Angus, and I think you ought to keep an eye on it.  That night, I went home and mentioned it to my wife. The next morning, she said: I don't like the looks of that thing. Let's have it taken off.  I went back in the following Wednesday night because they had Wednesday night hours and I didn't have to take off from work. I had coverage so I didn't have to worry about what it was going to cost me, and the mole was removed. When they called me to come back in--I will never forget this moment as long as I live--the doctor said: Angus, I think you had better sit down. He told me that I had what was called malignant melanoma.  At the time, I didn't know what it meant. I thought it was simply a skin cancer. You hear about those all the time. You have them taken off, and it is no big deal. No, malignant melanoma is one of the most virulent forms of cancer. One of its characteristics is that it starts with a mole, but if you don't treat it, it then gets into your system and goes somewhere else. If you don't catch it in time, you will die.  I caught it in time. I had surgery. They took out a big hunk of my back in surgery and up under my arm. To this day, my shoulder is still numb from that surgery, but here I am.  It has haunted me since that day that I was treated and my life saved because I had health insurance. I know to a certainty that had I not had that coverage, had I not had that free checkup, I would not be here today. It has always stayed with me that somewhere in America that week, that month, that year, there was a young man or a young woman who had a mole on their arm or their back or their neck, couldn't do anything about it, didn't really think about it, didn't do anything about it until it was too late, and they are gone. And I am here. I don't know why I was saved. Maybe I was saved in order to be here tonight. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out why anyone would want to take health insurance away from millions of people. It is a death sentence for some significant percentage of those people.  In 2009, the American Journal of Public Health did a study--a comprehensive study. What they concluded was that for every million people who are uninsured, you can predict about 1,000 premature unnecessary deaths. So the math is pretty simple. Right now, we are talking about over 20 million people who have been afforded health insurance, either through the exchanges or through the expansion of Medicaid, who didn't have it before. If we take that away, that is 22,000 deaths a year. How can we do that with good conscience? How can we sentence people to death? We are talking about bankruptcies. We are talking about all the kinds of stories we have heard. They are all valid. They are all important. But for me, this is personal. This is about life itself. It is about our ethics, our morality, and our obligation to our fellow citizens.  Like all the other speakers, I know there are lots of problems with the Affordable Care I wasn't here when it passed. It isn't exactly the way I would have worked on it or written it. I am ready to sit down with anybody who wants to talk about finding a solution, but let's not talk about the solution being ripping coverage away from people who desperately need it. It is just wrong.  I understand the political impulse. Folks on the other side of the aisle have been talking about this for 6 years, and, by golly, they are going to repeal it and get rid of it, and people cheer and all of that kind of thing. But now it is real. This isn't rhetoric anymore. This isn't a bumper sticker anymore. This isn't a rally anymore. This is real people's lives.  So let's just slow down. If people want to come up with a different solution, if they want to modify the current system, if they want to try to make changes that make it easier for small businesses and change the hours of work and the definition of full time--all of those things can be discussed. I don't care who leads it. I don't care whether we call it TrumpCare, McConnellCare, or We can call it whatever we want, but the fundamental principle here is that health insurance is a life or death matter, and we should honor the commitment that has been made to those millions of people--including over 80,000 people in Maine--who have taken advantage of this program, many of whom have never had health care before, many of whom have had tragic stories that we have heard all night about children born with birth defects or children that had some disease at a young age or an adult who, as we just heard a few minutes ago, finds they had cancer and if they hadn't had the coverage and gone in, they wouldn't be here.  This isn't politics. This is people's lives. I can't believe that the good people that I know in this body on both sides of the aisle can't figure out a way to say: Let's slow down. Let's slow down and talk about how to fix it, how to change it, how to replace it. But put that before repeal because once repeal occurs, there are all kinds of bad results, even if they are grandfathered.  People say we are going to repeal and delay. That is repeal and chaos. The insurance industry is going to start to pull back. The health care industry is going to say: Well, we don't know what the situation is going to be. We are going to have to slow down. We are going to stop hiring. We are going to lay people off.[[Page S175]]  All those changes are going to start happening right away. They can't be prevented. To tell people don't worry, we are going to cover you--that is cruel. I don't think my colleagues intend to be cruel. There is not a mean-spirited person in this body. We just have a different view of how to achieve these results. But the fundamental results should be people have health insurance so they don't have to risk their lives every day and live under that threat. That is what this discussion is all about. That is why I am here.  I view this as much more than a political issue. I understand the differences, I understand the history, and I understand the politics of it, but I just think that now that it is real, let's slow down and find another way to solve this problem that protects the gains that have been made and sands off the rough edges of the law but allows us to protect the fundamental idea of helping people to find health insurance they can afford and keep them from being denied health insurance for reasons through no fault of their own.  I think this is a moral and ethical issue, and I go back and I feel so strongly about this because of my own experience. I feel I owe it to that young man in 1974 who didn't have insurance, who didn't have the checkup, who had melanoma, and who died. I have an obligation to that young man to see that doesn't continue to happen in the wealthiest, most developed society on  This is something we have within our power to do. I deeply hope that we can take a deep breath, back away from this idea that we have to repeal, and talk about fundamental principles of helping people to cope with this most serious and personal of issues.  I have confidence in this body. I have confidence in the good will of this body and of the American people. If we can get away from talking about it in the abstract as a political issue, we can talk about real people. That is what I hope we can do over the next weeks and months, and I am convinced we can come to a solution--not that will make everybody happy but that will save lives and make our country a better place.

1893,topic-id,2457,"Madam President, I rise this afternoon to supplement some remarks I made on the floor last evening about the Affordable Care Last night, I talked about my own experience as a young staff member in the U.Senate 43 years ago when, because I had an insurance policy provided by my employer--that policy had preventive care as part of the policy, just as Affordable Care Act policies do today--I had a routine physical checkup. It was the first I had in a number of years, which caught malignant melanoma, a particularly virulent form of cancer. Because it was caught early and because I was treated, here I am today.  As I mentioned last night, it has always haunted me that someone who didn't have insurance, a young man or a young woman somewhere in the country who was in exactly my situation, because they didn't have insurance, they didn't have preventive care, didn't get the checkup, the disease wasn't caught, and they are gone.  I find it very hard to justify that, to understand that. It doesn't seem fair. It doesn't seem ethical. It doesn't seem moral. Today I wanted to also bring to the attention of the Senate some stories from today about the effect of the Affordable Care Act in Maine, where we have over 80,000 people enrolled, many of whom had never been able to have insurance before.  A young woman, Whitney, who graduated from college in 2013, said:       I graduated . . . with a degree in wildlife ecology, [but      it was very difficult to find a job.]       Thanks to the ACA, I was able to stay on my family health      insurance plan through this period of unemployment. I did      finally get employed in my field, but permanent, year-round      jobs with benefits are the equivalent of winning the lottery.[[Page S194]]  Many young people are in that situation. It even has a name. It is called the gig economy, people who work gigs, who work short periods of time, several months here, several months there, but there are no benefits attached to those jobs. She said:       Many of us work seasonal jobs, building trails on the      Appalachian Trail, rescuing lost hikers, managing volunteers,      and running programs for veterans to reconnect with Maine's      woods. We do good work in this state. Before the ACA we      worked dangerous outdoor jobs that only provided minimum      worker's comp. . . . But with the ACA and the tax credit, I      could afford a silver plan, I could get dental for my teeth,      could go to the doctor again, get flu shots and get my joints      looked at.  It is important to realize that without the ACA, this young woman would have literally no options. A health savings account is unrealistic for somebody who is making $15,000 to $20,000 a year. Buying insurance across State lines isn't going to help this young woman.  She said getting the ACA coverage ``was life changing. I know it is not perfect but I am terrified of going back to [where we were] before, where health and financial ruin was one wrong step away.''  Another letter from an older adult:       My wife is sixty-three years old she is no longer able to      work full time. She has had major back surgery and has      arthritis in her neck. Because of these health issues she had      to reduce her work hours.  Here is the catch-22. She had to reduce her work hours. Therefore, her employer dropped her from her health care coverage.       We were fortunate [enough] to obtain coverage for her      through the Affordable Care It is expensive and is not      the best coverage--  Nobody in this body says it is best possible result and that the law is perfect. We all agree it needs to be repaired and fixed and modified. The writer goes on to say--     but it is good enough for us to know that a major health      issue will not bankrupt us.       We are appealing to you as our representative to insure      that a reasonable replacement will be put in place when the      Affordable Care Act is ended. Better yet, improve it, don't      destroy it.  I couldn't have said it better myself. Donald, in his letter to me, says: ``Better yet, improve it, don't destroy it.'' That is what we ought to be talking about.  This letter is from a fellow named Ryan in North Central He also makes an important point about the Affordable Care The term that I refer to is ``job lock.'' There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in this country who are locked into the jobs they have that they don't really like, that isn't giving them the satisfaction they want because they can't afford to leave their health care.  One of the hidden benefits of the Affordable Care Act is it has allowed those people to follow their dreams, to start a business and not have to worry about having health insurance. This is an entrepreneur in Maine, a small business person. He said:       Affordable healthcare is a major roadblock to those      calculating whether they can take the leap to become self-     employed. As we prepare for next year's ice cream season, I      am about to leave my benefit-providing job in order to commit      to making the volume of ice cream we need. This is a scary      and questionable decision given our financial situation and      the fact that we are raising our two small children of four      and seven years old. The first comment I hear from everyone      who finds out I am leaving my job is, ``Are you sure? What      are you going to do about health insurance??''  The answer is, the Affordable Care It enables this young man, this gentleman, to follow his dream, to start his business, to commit to his business, and this is good for the country. This is a hidden benefit that is rarely discussed about the Affordable Care Act to allow people to give vent to their dreams and their innovation and their contribution to the economy.  Here is how he ends his letter. He says:       Please don't let me down. Please don't let my family down.      Please don't let down the millions of families who really are      on the bottom of this country and are the very ones that all      of you from every party claim to support. I don't care about      the details of how it gets done, whether the ACA is thrown      out, or just revised, or what compromises have to be made by      either party, but please make sure there is a health care      option available and that it is at an affordable price for      those of us with the guts to take a stab at our own small      business. The key is ``Affordable Care.'' It matters.  As in my own case, health insurance also saves lives. There was a study done by the Journal of Public Health in 2009, which basically concluded that for every million people without health insurance, there are a thousand premature deaths. It is pretty easy math. Before the Affordable Care Act, we had 45 million people without health insurance in this country. The calculation in this extensive study was that 46,000 deaths were attributable to not having health insurance. I am living proof of that. If I hadn't had health insurance, I would be gone. With the disease that I had, either you catch it in time or you are a goner. That is why I am so passionate about this.  We would not let people die in our front yards. If we saw somebody who was in danger of losing their life, we wouldn't stand by. Nobody in this body would stand by and say: Sorry, we can't help you. But not providing health insurance to people is a death sentence to 10, 20, 30, 40,000 people.  The Affordable Care Act is now covering something like 25 million people. That is 25,000 lives saved. If we take it away, it will be 25,000 lives lost.  Here's the letter:       I am a Maine woman in my late 30s, who works 2 part-time      jobs and also run my own business.       Because we were on [ACA] health insurance that had an      affordable deductible, after not feeling well for a while, my      husband went to a doctor and had a CT scan of his lungs. . .      . It turned out he had a very rare form of an illness, even      though he was only 38 at the time. Had we not had this      insurance and such an affordable premium and deductible, he      would never have gotten that CT scan done. This insurance      saved his life and covered every expense we've had over the      last 2 years with multiple stays at MidCoast Hospital and      Maine Med, 2 surgeries, pick-lines, medications, therapies,      the list goes on. There is no cure for what he has but he's      doing better now, thanks to the  Another person from Maine:       My sisters and I watched my mom die. We were physically in      the room when it happened. We cried for probably half an hour      straight.       Before the Affordable Care Act, most of her illnesses were      considered pre-existing conditions. She survived cancer three      times . . . but had to pay exorbitant monthly premiums just      to have to pay most of her treatment out of pocket.  He said:       I don't care about the ACA because of some theory or      ideology. I watched my mom die, sooner than she needed to,      because she couldn't afford to get preventative care early      enough. I watched my mom die because market solutions refused      to solve her problems. An open insurance market actively      refused to compete to cover my mom. The insurance market      before the ACA is one of a number of factors that led to my      mom's death.       This is a real, physical, immediate memory for me whenever      someone talks about healthcare, and it always comes to mind      when people talk about it in vague terms and market forces. I      am crying even as I write this, and it has been years.  He writes to me:       I am begging you, as a son who watched his mom who was      younger than you--  Than me--     die in a hospital because she couldn't afford the care she      needed, please protect the Affordable Care Protect it as      a legislator, protect it by recognizing how appointments you      choose to confirm or deny will affect my family's ability to      stay healthy and alive. Through grants and research, you've      worked to improve access to health care. Please, protect the       Another one--one more. This is a letter I received just back in the fall, a little before Christmas:       I have an incurable, generally non-lethal form of bone      cancer and have been under treatment for over 12 years. The      multiple surgeries [and costs] . . . I cannot afford to pay      for ongoing treatment without insurance. I am very pleased      the current ACA does not allow for ``preexisting      disqualification'' and I would hate to see that removed.      Having this condition is naturally stressful, debilitating      and undesired. I do not want or need the added stress of      having to worry about the details of coverage.       Additionally I have two boys, aged 23 and 26, both of whom      have benefited from remaining on our family insurance policy.      That is a great policy and my boys are healthier as a result.       Finally, access to quality health care is and must be a      right as it benefits both the individual and society. Health      is key to happiness and success and happy successful people      pay taxes, support the government, [and] give back to the      community.  I understand the debate that surrounded this. I understand the emotion. I understand the pressure that people feel in order to maintain a campaign promise or to meet promises[[Page S195]]made over the last several years. But we are not talking about maybe what will happen; we are talking about real cases, real people. I am talking about real people in Maine, in small towns and cities. I am talking about rural hospitals that are on the verge of being rendered financially incapacitated because if this law is repealed, it will take away a significant part of their support. I am talking about seniors having to pay more for drugs. But mostly, I am talking about people's lives.  These cases are people who can give specific examples. There are thousands, tens of thousands, and millions that we can't articulate--people who are saved who don't even know it because they went in to get that checkup, who are saved the stress of wondering how they are going to pay for some kind of treatment.  As a parent, I remember having to stress about whether to take my child to a doctor because I didn't know whether I could afford to pay that bill. Yet we all know that is the proper course. We shouldn't have to make those kinds of choices. We have a vehicle, imperfect as it is. Imperfect as it is, we have a vehicle for providing that care.  Let's slow down. Let's take a breath and say: We talked about repeal, but it isn't really practical. We can't harm that many people. Let's talk about what we are going to replace it with. The idea that we are going to repeal it today and replace it 3 years from now is just cruel. That is what I am hearing from people: Don't put us through that. People who finally got insurance after preexisting conditions, who have insurance and have a condition now--they depend upon that insurance. Let's not make them go through that pressure, the financial anxiety added to the health anxiety. We have an opportunity to rise above politics. This really shouldn't be political or a policy or something that divides us.  There is nobody in this body who wants to see people suffer, who wants to unnecessarily put people through the pressure of both health problems and financial problems. We ought to be able to find a solution. Every other industrialized country in the world has found a solution. It is not like this is some impenetrable box.  I realize that part of the solution has to involve controlling costs and facing the fact that we pay twice as much for health care per capita as anyone else in the world. That is an issue the Affordable Care Act does not sufficiently address, in my view, and we have to talk about that.  In the meantime, let us remember those people who are counting on us for their very lives. That is a commitment I believe we can respect and should meet.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

1557,topic-id,376,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership. He recently led a letter which a number of us joined in on to suggest that we make reforms to this bill. I said the day it passed that the Affordable Care Act was not an end but a beginning.  But we have not had opportunity, save for just a few examples where we changed some tax-reporting provisions under 1099. I was one of the people who led the successful efforts to suspend the medical device tax--something the Presiding Officer cares a lot about in his home State--but in truth, we have not had the opportunity that Senator Kaine suggested to make changes to this bill. Instead, we have been faced with the thought of just simply repealing this bill, with no replacement, with no plan in place. So we would all say to our colleagues across the aisle: Show us the plan. Show me the plan. Once we see that, we can start talking, but that is not what is happening today.  Additional changes could be made to the act, including increasing the amount of subsidies available to exchange enrollees, something important in my State; establishing perhaps State-based reinsurance programs; doing something about the pharmaceutical prices, something I have long advocated for. I have been ready and willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and to find additional commonsense improvements to the law, but repealing without a replacement plan is simply unacceptable. It is chaos.  As my colleague from Virginia reminded us with a touching letter that he read from his constituent, let's remember what health care reform means to families across this country, why we have this bill in the first place. Americans with preexisting conditions, like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, can no longer be denied access to health insurance coverage. Children can stay on their parents' plans until they are 26, a dramatic change that helps so many families across Women are no longer charged more than men for health insurance.  We had a lot of issues when we debated this bill, making sure that being a woman or being a victim of domestic violence was not a preexisting condition.

Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the REINS Act because it fulfills a promise Congress made to American businessowners to get onerous regulations off the backs of job creators.  It sets a very reasonable standard. If a new regulation has an economic impact of $100 million or more, it needs to come to Congress for an up-or-down vote. Congress will then have a say. We will debate the merits, and then we will decide.  The Obama administration handed down a record-breaking 600 major new regulations imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in costs on the U.economy and millions of hours of compliance busywork on the employers and employees across the country.  All of that excessive red tape places a huge burden on small- and medium-sized businesses that create jobs in New Jersey, the State I represent, and across the I have toured quite a few businesses, and the consensus is clear: let American workers innovate, build, and create, and not spend time complying with regulations that are impractical and often a waste of time and money.

Also, a joint resolution satisfies the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the  The REINS Act will bring an important check against out-of-control Federal regulations and foster stronger economic growth.

1534,topic-id,2866,"Mr.President, last week the junior Senator from Texas spoke about Secretary of State Kerry's recent speech explaining the administration's decision to not veto U.Security Council Resolution 2334 and supporting a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the The Senator asserted that Secretary Kerry ``equated'' Israel and Hamas, that President Obama and Secretary Kerry are ``relentless enemies of Israel'' who ``consider the existence and creation of Israel to be a disaster.'' He said their actions toward Israel were intended to ``facilitate assaults on the nation of Israel.'' He also accused them of ``turning a blind eye'' to terrorism.  Anyone who reads Secretary Kerry's speech will recognize the fallacy of those baseless and inflammatory accusations. To the contrary, Secretary Kerry eloquently and compellingly and with a foreboding sense of urgency about the receding prospects for a two-state solution reaffirmed the administration's condemnation of terrorism and incitement, its unprecedented support for Israel's security, and his own longstanding commitment to Israel's survival as a democratic state, living in peace with its Arab neighbors.  I urge all Senators to read his speech and to arrive at their own conclusions. The situation the Secretary describes should be alarming to anyone who wants peace and security for Israel and a viable, independent state for the Palestinian people, which are of vital importance to the national interests of the United While the Secretary's speech is too long to be printed in the Record in full, I ask unanimous consent that the first half of his remarks be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Remarks of John Kerry, Secretary of State, The Dean Acheson Auditorium,                    Washington, DC, December 28, 2016       Thank you very much. For those of you who celebrated      I hope you had a wonderful Happy      And to everybody here. I know it's the middle of a      holiday week. I understand. But I wish you all a very, very      productive and Happy New       Today, I want to share candid thoughts about an issue which      for decades has animated the foreign policy dialogue here and      around the world--the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.       Throughout his Administration, President Obama has been      deeply committed to Israel and its security, and that      commitment has guided his pursuit of peace in the Middle      This is an issue which, all of you know, I have worked      on intensively during my time as Secretary of State for one      simple reason: because the two-state solution is the only[[Page S152]]     way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and      It is the only way to ensure Israel's future as      a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security      with its neighbors. It is the only way to ensure a future of      freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people. And it is an      important way of advancing United States interests in the      region.       Now, I'd like to explain why that future is now in      jeopardy, and provide some context for why we could not, in      good conscience, stand in the way of a resolution at the      United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now      to preserve the possibility of peace.       I'm also here to share my conviction that there is still a      way forward if the responsible parties are willing to act.      And I want to share practical suggestions for how to preserve      and advance the prospects for the just and lasting peace that      both sides deserve.       So it is vital that we have an honest, clear-eyed      conversation about the uncomfortable truths and difficult      choices, because the alternative that is fast becoming the      reality on the ground is in nobody's interest--not the      Israelis, not the Palestinians, not the region--and not the      United       Now, I want to stress that there is an important point      here: My job, above all, is to defend the United States of      America--to stand up for and defend our values and our      interests in the world. And if we were to stand idly by and      know that in doing so we are allowing a dangerous dynamic to      take hold which promises greater conflict and instability to      a region in which we have vital interests, we would be      derelict in our own responsibilities.       Regrettably, some seem to believe that the U.friendship      means the U.must accept any policy, regardless of our own      interests, our own positions, our own words, our own      principles--even after urging again and again that the policy      must change. Friends need to tell each other the hard truths,      and friendships require mutual respect.       Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations,      who does not support a two-state solution, said after the      vote last week, quote, ``It was to be expected that Israel's      greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we      share,'' and veto this resolution. I am compelled to respond      today that the United States did, in fact, vote in accordance      with our values, just as previous U.administrations have      done at the Security Council before us.       They fail to recognize that this friend, the United States      of America, that has done more to support Israel than any      other country, this friend that has blocked countless efforts      to delegitimize Israel, cannot be true to our own values--or      even the stated democratic values of Israel--and we cannot      properly defend and protect Israel if we allow a viable two-     state solution to be destroyed before our own eyes.       And that's the bottom line: the vote in the United Nations      was about preserving the two-state solution. That's what we      were standing up for: Israel's future as a Jewish and      democratic state, living side by side in peace and security      with its neighbors. That's what we are trying to preserve for      our sake and for theirs.       In fact, this Administration has been Israel's greatest      friend and supporter, with an absolutely unwavering      commitment to advancing Israel's security and protecting its      legitimacy.       On this point, I want to be very clear: No American      administration has done more for Israel's security than      Barack Obama's. The Israeli prime minister himself has noted      our, quote, ``unprecedented'' military and intelligence      cooperation. Our military exercises are more advanced than      ever. Our assistance for Iron Dome has saved countless      Israeli lives. We have consistently supported Israel's right      to defend itself, by itself, including during actions in Gaza      that sparked great controversy.       Time and again we have demonstrated that we have Israel's      back. We have strongly opposed boycotts, divestment      campaigns, and sanctions targeting Israel in international      fora, whenever and wherever its legitimacy was attacked, and      we have fought for its inclusion across the UN system. In the      midst of our own financial crisis and budget deficits, we      repeatedly increased funding to support In fact, more      than one-half of our entire global Foreign Military Financing      goes to And this fall, we concluded an historic $38      billion memorandum of understanding that exceeds any military      assistance package the United States has provided to any      country, at any time, and that will invest in cutting-edge      missile defense and sustain Israel's qualitative military      edge for years to come. That's the measure of our support.       This commitment to Israel's security is actually very      personal for me. On my first trip to Israel as a young      senator in 1986, I was captivated by a special country, one      that I immediately admired and soon grew to love. Over the      years, like so many others who are drawn to this      extraordinary place, I have climbed Masada, swum in the Dead      Sea, driven from one Biblical city to another.       I've also seen the dark side of Hizballah's rocket storage      facilities just across the border in Lebanon, walked through      exhibits of the hell of the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, stood on      the Golan Heights, and piloted an Israeli jet over the tiny      airspace of Israel, which would make anyone understand the      importance of security to Out of those experiences      came a steadfast commitment to Israel's security that has      never wavered for a single minute in my 28 years in the      Senate or my four years as       I have also often visited West Bank communities, where I      met Palestinians struggling for basic freedom and dignity      amidst the occupation, passed by military checkpoints that      can make even the most routine daily trips to work or school      an ordeal, and heard from business leaders who could not get      the permits that they needed to get their products to the      market and families who have struggled to secure permission      just to travel for needed medical care.       And I have witnessed firsthand the ravages of a conflict      that has gone on for far too long. I've seen Israeli children      in Sderot whose playgrounds had been hit by Katyusha rockets.      I've visited shelters next to schools in Kiryat Shmona that      kids had 15 seconds to get to after a warning siren went off.      I've also seen the devastation of war in the Gaza Strip,      where Palestinian girls in lzbet Abed Rabo played in the      rubble of a bombed-out building.       No children--Israeli or Palestinian--should have to live      like that.       So, despite the obvious difficulties that I understood when      I became Secretary of State, I knew that I had to do      everything in my power to help end this conflict. And I was      grateful to be working for President Obama, who was prepared      to take risks for peace and was deeply committed to that      effort.       Like previous U.administrations, we have committed our      influence and our resources to trying to resolve the Arab-     Israeli conflict because, yes, it would serve American      interests to stabilize a volatile region and fulfill      America's commitment to the survival, security and well-being      of an Israel at peace with its Arab neighbors.       Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state      solution is now in serious jeopardy. The truth is that trends      on the ground--violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement      expansion and the seemingly endless occupation--they are      combining to destroy hopes for peace on both sides and      increasingly cementing an irreversible one-state reality that      most people do not actually want.       Today, there are a similar number of Jews and Palestinians      living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean      They have a choice. They can choose to live together in one      state, or they can separate into two states. But here is a      fundamental reality: if the choice is one state, Israel can      either be Jewish or democratic--it cannot be both--and it      won't ever really be at peace. Moreover, the Palestinians      will never fully realize their vast potential in a homeland      of their own with a one-state solution.       Now, most on both sides understand this basic choice, and      that is why it is important that polls of Israelis and      Palestinians show that there is still strong support for the      two-state solution--in theory. They just don't believe that      it can happen.       After decades of conflict, many no longer see the other      side as people, only as threats and enemies. Both sides      continue to push a narrative that plays to people's fears and      reinforces the worst stereotypes rather than working to      change perceptions and build up belief in the possibility of      peace.       And the truth is the extraordinary polarization in this      conflict extends beyond Israelis and Allies of      both sides are content to reinforce this with an us or--     ``you're with us or against us'' mentality where too often      anyone who questions Palestinian actions is an apologist for      the occupation and anyone who disagrees with Israel policy is      cast as anti-Israel or even anti-      That's one of the most striking realities about the current      situation: This critical decision about the future--one state      or two states--is effectively being made on the ground every      single day, despite the expressed opinion of the majority of      the people.       The status quo is leading towards one state and perpetual      occupation, but most of the public either ignores it or has      given up hope that anything can be done to change it. And      with this passive resignation, the problem only gets worse,      the risks get greater and the choices are narrowed.       This sense of hopelessness among Israelis is exacerbated by      the continuing violence, terrorist attacks against civilians      and incitement, which are destroying belief in the      possibility of peace.       Let me say it again: There is absolutely no justification      for terrorism, and there never will be. And the most recent      wave of Palestinian violence has included hundreds of      terrorist attacks in the past year, including stabbings,      shootings, vehicular attacks and bombings, many by      individuals who have been radicalized by social media. Yet      the murderers of innocents are still glorified on Fatah      websites, including showing attackers next to Palestinian      leaders following attacks. And despite statements by      President Abbas and his party's leaders making clear their      opposition to violence, too often they send a different      message by failing to condemn specific terrorist attacks and      naming public squares, streets and schools after terrorists.       President Obama and I have made it clear to the Palestinian      leadership countless times, publicly and privately, that all      incitement to violence must stop. We have consistently      condemned violence and terrorism, and even condemned the      Palestinian leadership for not condemning it.       Far too often, the Palestinians have pursued efforts to      delegitimize Israel in international fora. We have strongly      opposed[[Page S153]]     these initiatives, including the recent wholly unbalanced and      inflammatory UNESCO resolution regarding And we      have made clear our strong opposition to Palestinian efforts      against Israel at the ICC, which only sets back the prospects      for peace.       And we all understand that the Palestinian Authority has a      lot more to do to strengthen its institutions and improve      governance.       Most troubling of all, Hamas continues to pursue an      extremist agenda: they refuse to accept Israel's very right      to exist. They have a one-state vision of their own: all of      the land is Hamas and other radical factions are      responsible for the most explicit forms of incitement to      violence, and many of the images that they use are truly      appalling. And they are willing to kill innocents in Israel      and put the people of Gaza at risk in order to advance that      agenda.       Compounding this, the humanitarian situation in Gaza,      exacerbated by the closings of the crossings, is dire. Gaza      is home to one of the world's densest concentrations of      people enduring extreme hardships with few opportunities. 1.3      million people out of Gaza's population of 1.8 million are in      need of daily assistance--food and shelter. Most have      electricity less than half the time and only 5 percent of the      water is safe to drink. And yet despite the urgency of these      needs, Hamas and other militant groups continue to re-arm and      divert reconstruction materials to build tunnels, threatening      more attacks on Israeli civilians that no government can      tolerate.       Now, at the same time, we have to be clear about what is      happening in the West The Israeli prime minister      publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current      coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history, with an      agenda driven by the most extreme elements. The result is      that policies of this government, which the prime minister      himself just described as ``more committed to settlements      than any in Israel's history,'' are leading in the opposite      direction. They're leading towards one state. In fact, Israel      has increasingly consolidated control over much of the West      Bank for its own purposes, effectively reversing the      transitions to greater Palestinian civil authority that were      called for by the Oslo       I don't think most people in Israel, and certainly in the      world, have any idea how broad and systematic the process has      become. But the facts speak for themselves. The number of      settlers in the roughly 130 Israeli settlements east of the      1967 lines has steadily grown. The settler population in the      West Bank alone, not including East Jerusalem, has increased      by nearly 270,000 since Oslo, including 100,000 just since      2009, when President Obama's term began.       There's no point in pretending that these are just in large      settlement blocks. Nearly 90,000 settlers are living east of      the separation barrier that was created by Israel itself in      the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be      the future Palestinian state. And the population of these      distant settlements has grown by 20,000 just since 2009. In      fact, just recently the government approved a significant new      settlement well east of the barrier, closer to Jordan than to      What does that say to Palestinians in particular--but      also to the United States and the world--about Israel's      intentions?       Let me emphasize, this is not to say that the settlements      are the whole or even the primary cause of this conflict. Of      course they are not. Nor can you say that if the settlements      were suddenly removed, you'd have peace. Without a broader      agreement, you would not. And we understand that in a final      status agreement, certain settlements would become part of      Israel to account for the changes that have taken place over      the last 49 years--we understand that--including the new      democratic demographic realities that exist on the ground.      They would have to be factored in.       But if more and more settlers are moving into the middle of      Palestinian areas, it's going to be just that much harder to      separate, that much harder to imagine transferring      sovereignty, and that is exactly the outcome that some are      purposefully accelerating.

1890,topic-id,1224,"Mr.President, the 115th Congress convened just last week. I had hoped that with all the turmoil in the country that we would begin the year with a renewed sense of cooperation. But I am sorry to say, my friends in the Republican Party have chosen a different path.  The very first thing on the agenda is to press forward with a sham budget. If you ask why we have a sham budget, a fake budget, an unrealistic budget--we find out that its only purpose is to set up a process to repeal the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority vote. Why? Because they know the American people would never allow a repeal to pass otherwise.[[Page S192]]  So instead of working to finalize appropriations bills for this year--already more than 3 months in--or to invest in our Nation's critical infrastructure, or to truly bolster our Nation's cyber security, when we see countries such as Russia and other places attacking our cyber systems, or even to improve the Affordable Care Act so we can ensure that more people can receive affordable coverage, I am afraid the Republicans are recklessly rushing forward solely to fulfill an ill-considered campaign promise.  They are pushing American families over the cliff with the vague promise: Yeah, we will repeal it, but don't worry because eventually we will come up with a plan to replace it.  Jump first, plan later is anything but a responsible formula for someone's health, for sound decisions; and all the more so when the health insurance of tens of millions of Americans and American families all over the country--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike--is at stake.  The majority leader and others have said the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is only the first step. They say that a full repeal is necessary to pave the way for a replacement. They say: Let's leave ObamaCare in the past. Well, when you strip away the rhetoric and get rid of it, the only alternative they offer the American people is don't get sick--because if you get sick, you are in trouble.  The American people have a right to know what a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act really means. A repeal of this law would not just take away the rights and care of millions of patients and their families; it would eliminate insurance coverage for millions more--especially the aging, the elderly, men and women with preexisting conditions, and the most vulnerable children.  A repeal of the Affordable Care Act would turn back the clock to a bad time in this country where once again women would have to pay more for health insurance than men, where insurance companies could rescind a health insurance policy simply because someone gets sick, and coverage could forever be denied to someone born with a disease or ailment, and that includes children. So you could buy a health insurance policy so you were covered in case you got sick, but the insurance companies could then say: Oh, you are sick. Sorry, no more insurance.  Now, in my State of Vermont, the Affordable Care Act has reduced the number of Vermonters without insurance by 53 percent. Tens of thousands have gained coverage under the expansion of And because the Affordable Care Act closed the prescription drug ``donut hole,'' more than 10,000 Vermont seniors saved $12 million in prescription drugs in 2015 alone. And this is just in the second smallest State in the Can you imagine what it is like in larger States?  I have heard stories from many Vermonters about how vital this law is to them and their families. I have heard from family doctors, like one in the southwest corner of our State in Bennington, who remembers when his patients couldn't afford treatment because of lifetime and annual limits on health care coverage, something that was very common. Or a woman from Westminster, VT, whose family hit hard times--she moved from job to job. She couldn't afford continuous health coverage until the Affordable Care Act offered her a quality plan she could keep. Now, we are talking about throwing her off.  Other young Vermonters are able to pursue careers in public service or the arts because they can stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26. Countless others have underscored that because of previous health issues, such as diabetes or cancer, health coverage would otherwise be unaffordable.  It would be a vicious cycle. They had a disease, but they couldn't afford to do anything about it, and they would go into greater debt. Now, even though they have a preexisting condition, they have guarantees and subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act so they can have health coverage, instead of health coverage being unaffordable.  Opponents of the Affordable Care Act have gone to new lengths to repeat and prolong this political battle. And that is all this is. They have had 6 years to propose a better alternative. Instead, congressional Republicans and the President-elect have decided to put the cart before the horse. They want to dismantle our health care system, and they don't want to figure out how to fix it. They just want to figure out how to get rid of it. And, by the way, they say somebody is going to come up with a bright idea for something better.  The American people rightly expect us to work together and make progress on the many challenges that we face today. Instead, we are engaging in dangerous political gamesmanship that will not affect Members of the Congress, but the millions of families we represent throughout this country because they will not have health insurance, and their children will not have health insurance. Just think what this is eventually going to cost Americans--a lot more than we pay now.  I will not support a return to less protection, less coverage, less fairness, and higher costs because that is what a repeal means. The Affordable Care Act extended health insurance to millions of families, not only in Vermont, but across the country. Those who represent the American people in Congress should stand ready to get to work for their constituents. Not to make their constituents sick, but to give them a program that works.  I will not support an effort to reverse the many reforms and achievements we have made through the Affordable Care Act and instead cobble back together a broken system that for too long burdened most American households with health coverage uncertainty and crippling costs.  I am not going to go and tell Vermonters: Too bad that you have cancer. We just fixed it so you can't have insurance. Too bad that you have diabetes. We just fixed it so you can't get insurance. Too bad that your child was born with a physical defect. Too bad. We just fixed it so you can't get insurance. Or to the person who just lost a job who doesn't have insurance: Too bad that you are without health insurance. Better pray you don't get sick because, if you do, you will lose a lot more than your job.  No, I can't look Vermonters in the eye and say that is what I support.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1238,topic-id,1574,"Madam President, on January 20 of this year, change is coming to the White But until that day, it appears that President Obama will desperately cling to the status quo and continue to do what he has done on far too many occasions: abuse his Executive powers to put in place unpopular policies without the cooperation of Congress and then pretend as if everyone somehow supports him.  The most recent case in point involves President Obama's recent decision to designate as a new national monument some 1.35 million acres of public land in San Juan County, UT--the poorest county in the State of Utah, nearly the size of This is a small county that is tucked into the southeast corner of our It includes--and the national monument is named after--the region's distinctive Bears Ears buttes, which mark the ancestral homeland and sacred site of many members of the Navajo and Ute Tribes who live in San Juan County,  President Obama announced the Bears Ears National Monument on December 28, right between Christmas and New Year's Eve, as most Americans were busy enjoying the holiday season and when he was still enjoying time with his family in That same day, his administration released an explanatory document that was officially christened a ``Fact Sheet.'' It was christened that way by the White House officials who wrote it. But, in reality, it reads much more like an elaborate book of fiction.  Of all the falsehoods peddled in this bogus fact sheet, the most egregious--and, in many ways, the most insulting--is the claim that the residents in San Juan County, including local members of the Navajo Nation and members of the Ute Tribe, supported the President's decision to turn Bears Ears into a national monument.  The document says:       The creation of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah [.      . .] follow[s] years of robust public input from tribes,      local elected officials, and diverse stakeholders, and draws      from legislation introduced in In addition to      protecting more land and water than any administration in      history--  And here is the kicker--       President Obama has taken unprecedented steps to elevate      the voices of Native peoples in the management of our      national resources.  ``Unprecedented steps to elevate the voices of Native peoples.'' Nothing could be further from the truth in this situation. Perhaps if we replace the word ``elevate'' with the word ``exploit,'' that sentence might apply to the situation in Bears  Now, there is no denying that many Native American people supported President Obama's designation of the Bears Ears National But the inconvenient truth too often ignored by the Obama administration and its supporters is that virtually all of this tribal support came from Native Americans residing outside of Utah, not inside Utah, and certainly not within San Juan County where this 1.35 million-acre designation occurred.  In fact, the most prominent Native American group that advocated for a national monument in Utah is actually an alliance called the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, which is made up of several tribes, and most of its members reside outside of the State of  Yet, national monument advocates routinely invoke the Inter-Tribal Coalition as the authoritative mouthpiece of all Native Americans in the Southwestern United  So how did a coalition of Native American tribes from Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico rise to such a position of prominence in a debate over a national monument in a remote corner of Utah? Well, part of the answer can be found in the cozy relationships between well-funded environmental advocacy groups, powerful outdoor retail companies, and tribal organizations.  Recent investigative reporting by the Deseret News shows how radical wealthy environmental organizations, supported by the outdoor recreational industry, channeled millions of dollars to the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition only after they realized that ``hitching [their] success'' to the Navajo Nation was the only way they could achieve their longstanding goal of creating a national monument in Southeastern  The ability of uber-rich environmentalists to essentially buy a national monument in Bears Ears explains why the people of San Juan County--including the Navajo residents, whose lives and livelihoods are intricately linked to the Bears Ears Utes--stand united in opposition to a monument designation.  For the people of the Navajo Nation who live in San Juan County, taking care of their ancestral land--protecting and preserving it for the next generation--isn't optional, it is a sacred duty. It is part of their faith. It is part of who they are.  The same is true in many respects in my own faith. As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I share many of these views. My church teaches that the Earth is a divine creation that belongs to This means that human beings have a spiritual responsibility--an obligation to God--to be wise stewards over the Earth, to conserve it for our children and our grandchildren.  The Navajo people of San Juan County have always faithfully fulfilled their responsibility in the Bears Ears region, and so have the Utes who reside in the area. Caring for their homelands--and respecting it as their forefathers did--is the cultural lifeblood of the Native American people of Southeastern Take away their access to their land--restrict their stewardship over the Earth's bounty for the sake of increasing the access of wealthy urbanites who use the outdoors for their own purposes--and it won't be long before their culture begins to fade away.  The people of San Juan County understand this. They have seen their worst nightmares become reality in other Utah counties as a result of Presidential national monument designations. That is why on December 29, the day after President Obama announced the Bears Ears monument, a crowd of Utahns assembled to hold a protest on the steps of the San Juan County  Braving the frigid weather of that day, they gathered together to demonstrate that they--the individuals and the families who will be most directly affected by a Bears Ears national monument--believe that the President has no business seizing vast stretches of land to be micromanaged and mismanaged by distant Federal land agencies.  But the protesters weren't just angry. They were resolute, confident about the future, and determined to keep fighting for their right to participate in the management of the land in their community--the land that most directly affects them.  Of course, environmentalists and national monument advocates want the people of San Juan County to believe that this fight is simply over, that they have lost, that there is nothing they can do about something that affects them in a very real, very personal, very intimate way. In their view, President Obama's proclamation of the Bears Ears National Monument is permanent. It is irreversible, as if it were carved into stone. As one White House official recently told the Washington Post: ``We do not see that the Trump administration has authority to undo this.''  But they say this only because they are not looking hard enough. The truth is what can be done through unilateral[[Page S103]]Executive action can also be undone the same way. Such is the impermanence of Executive power in our constitutional republic, where major policy changes require broad consensus, forged through legislative compromise, to endure the test of time.  In a recent Wall Street Journal article, two prominent constitutional scholars, Todd Gaziano and John Yoo, explain this point as it relates specifically to President Obama's use of the Antiquities Act to designate the Bears Ears National The Antiquities Act of 1906, as they explain, does not create an irreversible monument. When a President uses it, its use is not necessarily indelible.  Gaziano and Yoo write:       After studying the President's legal authority [under the      Antiquities Act], we conclude that he can rescind monument      designations [. . .] the law's text and original purposes      strongly support a president's ability to unilaterally      correct his predecessor's abuses.  In other words, starting on January 20, President-Elect Trump can use his Executive powers to rescind President Obama's designation of the Bears Ears National I have asked the future Trump administration to do precisely that.  I have also recently cosponsored Senator Murkowski's bill, the Improved National Monument Designation Process Act, which would require all future Presidents to obtain congressional and State approval prior to designating a national monument. I have done these things, and I will do more, because I believe the preponderance of evidence proves that President Obama abused his powers--the powers granted to him under the Antiquities Act--in designating the Bears Ears National  This isn't just my opinion. It is the opinion of most of my fellow Utahns, including those patriots who assembled on the county courthouse steps in the rural town of Monticello on December 29.  These are the people who were ignored by the Obama administration. These are the people who were cut out of the decisionmaking process that produced this particular national monument designation. These are the voices that were stifled by the wealthy, out-of-State, well-connected environmental groups that spent millions of dollars to lock up our land for their exclusive use.  So it is fitting to let one of them--one of the residents of San Juan County--have the last word today. I think Suzy Johnson put it best when she said:       Mr.Obama, you have failed the grassroots natives. A true      leader listens and finds common ground. The fight for our      land is not over.

He said that the Supreme Court's disastrous decision to gut voting rights was good news for the In the 1980s, he was rejected from serving as a Federal judge due to his blatantly racist comments.  Any one of these statements should be disqualifying. In the proposed, bigoted Trump administration, frankly, I am not surprised; but I am appalled that the President-elect would choose such an extreme and divisive figure to serve as Attorney Clearly, someone who has publicly displayed prejudice and intolerance is not qualified to serve as our chief law enforcement officer for our civil rights laws.  By that standard alone, one thing is clear: Senator Sessions is wholly unfit to serve as Attorney Senator Sessions has forcefully degraded the LGBT community, has voted against the Violence Against Women Act, and has undermined the cornerstone of the civil rights movement and the Voting Rights His nomination really is a chilling indication of how a Trump administration intends to govern. This country has made tremendous progress in the fight to protect, preserve, and expand civil rights for all We will not allow a Trump administration to drag us back into the past.  As the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus is a voice for the marginalized. Our message to the Trump administration and to President-elect Donald Trump is simple: A vote to confirm Senator Jeff Sessions is a vote against justice. We will fight to protect any rollback on civil or human rights. We will not be silent.  I call on all of my colleagues to oppose Senator Sessions' nomination as the United States Attorney General because his history disqualifies him for this important position.

1049,topic-id,343,"Mr.Speaker, any measure that seeks to promote a peaceful resolution to tensions between Israelis and Palestinians--whether coming from the United Nations or from this Chamber--should provide a balanced picture of the facts on the ground and the challenges confronting both sides. The recent UN Security Resolution on Israeli settlements failed that test by blaming Israel almost solely for impeding a two-states solution for peace and by using prejudicial language that places an unfair burden on Israel in depicting the basis for future negotiations. Calling any settlement activity by Israel since 1967 a major obstacle to peace, as the UN resolution does, ignores the reality that geographical adjustments will have to be made as part of any two-states solution reached by parties through direct negotiations.  However, the resolution before us today is also not balanced in that it too ignores conditions on the ground. Expressing the sense of Congress to repeal the UN Resolution does not focus on the increasingly fragile state of the two-states solution, and on conditions that make its potential achievement increasingly difficult to obtain. Prime Minister Netanyahu has called his government the most pro-settlement in history. President-elect Trump further diminishes chances for the two-states solution by choosing envoys who undercut the prospects for peace by expressing support for major settlement expansions, and whose opposition to a two-states solution reinforces opposition within the Israeli government. These positions threaten to continue to move momentum dangerously away from the possibility of a two-states solution.  I believe that the two-states approach, as challenging as it is to achieve, is the only way to ensure a Jewish and democratic state of Israel living in security with a non-militarized Palestinian state. It is important for peace in the Middle East and U.national interests.  This resolution is at present the only vehicle to express my concerns with the UN resolution, and I will therefore support it. However, I will continue to speak out on further actions that I believe will diminish the chance of a two-states solution and on other issues vital to peace in the Middle  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH146.txt,683,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued",2017.0,5.0,January

Only the Israelis and the Palestinians can resolve their complicated differences through direct negotiation. That is why it has been longstanding policy to defend our ally Israel against one-sided U.Security Council resolutions seeking to impose solutions.  Last year, Congresswoman Granger and I led a letter to President Obama signed by 394 Members of this body[[Page H162]]cautioning against one-sided U.initiatives that dangerously hinder the prospects for resuming direct negotiations.

I first thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Smith, for his continued leadership on the Science  H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, prioritizes improving weather forecasting for the protection of lives and property at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric This bill does so by focusing research and computing resources on improved weather forecasting, quantitative observing data planning, next generation modeling, and an emphasis on research-to-operations technology transfer.  As a Representative from Oklahoma, I understand the need for accurate and timely weather predictions firsthand. Every year, the loss of life from deadly tornadoes in my home State is a stark reminder that we can do better to predict severe weather events and provide longer lead times to protect Americans in harm's way.  I am proud that the legislation has a dedicated Tornado Warning Improvement The goal of this program is to reduce the loss of life from tornadoes by advancing the understanding of fundamental meteorological science allowing detection and notifications that are more accurate, effective, and timely. Constituents in my home State will benefit greatly from longer tornado warning lead times, which will save lives and better protect property.  H.353 makes clear that NOAA will prioritize weather research and protect lives and property through a focused, affordable, attainable, forward-looking research plan at the agency's Research  The bill also encourages innovations and new technology capacities by creating a joint technology transfer fund in NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric This transfer is[[Page H215]]essential to get new forecasting, models, and technologies out of the research side of NOAA and into our operational forecast to better protect our country.  The bill directs NOAA to develop plans to restore our country's leadership in weather forecasting. It is no secret that many people in our weather community are distraught that our forecasting capacities have deteriorated in recent years.  While other countries are making great strides in weather advancements, Americans are paying the price for diminished leadership with their lives and their wallets. This is yet another reminder that we can do better.  This legislation directs NOAA to actively consider new commercial data and private sector solutions to further enhance our weather forecasting capacities. The bill also includes a pilot project, which will provide NOAA a clear and credible demonstration of the valuable data from commercial technologies available today.  H.353 is the result of 4 years of work to craft a meaningful package that will create new and real improvements to our country's weather forecasting systems. The time has come for Americans to have the most accurate and timely weather predictions. They deserve nothing less.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

539,topic-id,400,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today instrong support of the Midnight Rules Relief  Recently, impossible opportunities exist for this body to reassert itsauthority and work on behalf of the American people. The Midnight Rules Relief Act would provide Congress with an important toolto begin the process of dismantling the onerous regulatory burdens imposed over the past 8 years.  As the chairman of theSubcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, I have dedicated considerable time over the past 2 years toclosely monitoring the growth of the administrative state. The estimated regulatory costs across all years of the Obamaadministration are staggering. However, the regulatory onslaught in its final year alone--disastrous--shows the damage alreadydone and the greater impact that will fall on our economy.  In 2016, 401 regulations were finalized. The total compliancecost for this period exceeds $164 billion and amounts to nearly 121 million paperwork hours. That is 401 regulations and $164billion. This is only during the final year of the Obama administration. It is no wonder that the American people sought a new,more promising direction for our country.  Finally, the Congress has an opportunity to act to protect the American people andrepeal many of these crushing regulations. For us in Congress, we cannot forget what these numbers represent. For myconstituents and for Americans across the country, the billions in dollars of costs imposed on the economy represent jobs lost,routine bills that cannot be paid, and the American Dream slipping from their grasp.  The true story of this regulatoryonslaught is told by workers at shuttered stores, factories, and power plants across the country. Their concerns and fears areours. As this current administration exits, we must remain vigilant to last-ditch efforts at crippling our economy.  On topof those in recent months, a number of new regulations may still be finalized in a hurried, nontransparent fashion. The Americanpeople are concerned that our current regulatory process ignores the balancing of costs and benefits and the regulatory impacton their lives. From what we have seen over the past 8 years, it is clear that they should be.  Starting this week, Congresshas an opportunity to reassert its constitutional authority and act for all The Midnight Rules Relief Act is a well-advised measure that gives Congress the ability to quickly examine and eliminate the mass of regulations promulgated in recentmonths. This has been done by both Republican and Democrat administrations.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to supportthis bill.

933,topic-id,505,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the REINS I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr.Collins) for taking charge of this bill in the 115th Congress and Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte for quickly bringing it to the floor.  This week and next, the primary focus of debate here in the House is the stranglehold of regulation on the economy and its intrusion into the everyday lives of These onerous burdens are well-known to Members of Congress on both sides.  Over the past several years, I have spent countless hours traveling across the nearly 6,600 square miles of my district. I have met with my constituents in their homes, in their workplaces and social halls. They have pleaded with me for release from the regulations that limit their ability to prosper, innovate, and grow.  Unlike the nameless, faceless, ever-growing bureaucracy here in Washington, we have listened to the people's concerns. We have made regulatory reform a priority and the focal point for jump-starting our economy. By placing final approval of major regulations in the hands of Congress, the REINS Act is an important launch point in our efforts to dismantle the administrative state and make government more accountable to the American people.  Our Founders vested in Congress--and Congress alone--the power to write the laws. Unfortunately, over our history, we have delegated much of that power away. The Founders could not have imagined our current scenario where the complaints of many fall on the deaf ears of an unelected few in  Thinking over the past 8 years, the REINS Act could have prevented numerous regulations that the American people knew were threats to their very way of life. Perhaps a trillion dollars in costs could have been avoided. I cannot even imagine how many jobs might have been saved or created if we avoided the regulatory barrage brought on by the Obama administration.  For example, we could have prevented the waters of the United States regulation that impacts the farmers near my home in rural The FCC's net neutrality rule might have been overturned, a classic rulemaking bait and switch where the FCC ignored the mountains of public comment to achieve its own political ends. An unaccountable sum of environmental regulations might have been avoided before destroying large swaths of our industry and imposing huge costs on taxpayers.  Our prime takeaway from these instances and others is that the runaway regulators issued wide-ranging and economy-destroying regulations with complete disregard for the hardworking American citizens whose livelihoods were at stake.  Today we take an important step to reassert the voice of the American people in our government. The REINS Act reestablishes the Congress as the final judge of whether or not any particular regulation actually does what the Congress meant it to do.  Returning this responsibility to the branch of government most attentive and accountable to the people adheres to the principles of our Nation's founding. It is an effort that all elected to Congress should support.  I urge my colleagues to support the REINS  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH124.txt,2053,ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT,2017.0,5.0,January

995,topic-id,320,"Mr.Chair, the amendment carves out of the REINS Act's congressional approval procedures regulations that attempt to improve employment, retention, and earnings, particularly for those with significant barriers to employment.  The danger in the amendment is the strong incentive it gives agencies to manipulate their analysis of a major regulation's jobs and wages impacts. Far too often, agencies will be tempted to shade the analysis to skirt the bill's congressional approval requirement.  In addition, regulations alleged to create new job prospects often do so by destroying real, existing jobs and creating new, hoped-for jobs associated with regulatory compliance. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act rules have shut down existing power plants all over the country, throwing myriads of workers out of work. EPA and OMB attempt to justify that with claims that more new green jobs have been created as a result.  In the end, this is just another way in which government picks the jobs winners and the jobs losers, and there is no guarantee that all of the new green jobs will ever actually exist.  The REINS Act is not intended to force any particular outcome. It does not choose between clean air and dirty air. It does not choose between new jobs and old jobs.  Instead, the REINS Act chooses between two ways of making laws. It chooses the way the Framers intended in which accountability for laws with major economic impact rests with It rejects the way Washington has operated for too long in which there is no accountability because decisions are made by unelected agency officials.

1491,topic-id,2092,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about this impending attack upon the Affordable Care Act and the impact it can have on the hospitals of our country, in terms of draining revenue from them; on the issue of the impact on community health centers across our country and the impact it can have upon them; upon the impact that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would have on the access of those who are addicted to opioids who need help for opioids, who are in a situation where they are going to need the Affordable Care Act, the access to coverage, so their problems can be taken care of.  So this is no small threat. In fact, this goes right to the core of what started in Massachusetts back 10 years ago when we as a Commonwealth decided that care for people who needed health care was going to be made available to them. We have proven in Massachusetts that we are able to provide health care for 98 percent of our population, at the same time having an unemployment rate of 3.2 percent, while simultaneously having the highest scores for kids in the 4th, 8th, and 10th grades in math, verbal, and science, while having the strongest protections for the environment in the United States, while having an energy efficiency standard that is the tops in the United  We have proved conclusively that it is possible to ensure that people do, in fact, receive access to the health care which they need while simultaneously discharging our responsibilities to the economy, to education, to the environment, to all of the other interests, all of the other important stakes that we have in our country to ensure that they are given the attention which they need.  It would be tragic if what we did as part of the Affordable Care Act was to once again flood the emergency rooms of America with people who otherwise would have had health care coverage under the Affordable Care That is a system we have used for 100 years, and it doesn't work because it winds up with the insurance rates of people who do have coverage going up in order to cover it. It winds up with the whole rest of the medical system, in a very chaotic way, being forced to deal with the consequences.  If we begin simultaneously to defund the community health centers across the country and their ability to provide health care, then what we have is a cascading impact that ultimately hits those people who are the poorest, those people who are the most vulnerable. They are the ones who are caught in the crosshairs of this incredible, almost unbelievable attack which the Republicans are waging upon a health care system that has already transformed the lives of 22 million people in the United  It is unimaginable to me that we could be in that kind of discussion right now on the floor of the Senate, but I understand it. This is ideological. It is something that is completely and totally detached from the reality of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, as they have in fact already positively affected tens of millions of families inside the United  This week we are about to have an incredible battle waged against the Affordable Care Understand this, right in the crosshairs are the hospitals of our country, not just the famous, big hospitals we all know the names of but Catholic hospitals across our country, hospitals that provide the service for people now under a much more orderly system than they would have done if we had never put the Affordable Care Act on the books in the first place.  At the forefront of all these issues, though, is this largest of all public health epidemics that has ever faced the country, the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic, like OxyContin, which is claiming the lives of more than 90 people every single day across this country. In Massachusetts alone, when all the final numbers have been gathered, 2,000 people will have died in the State of Massachusetts in the year 2016, and 1,500 of them will have been found to have had fentanyl in their blood system. This is an epidemic of unbelievable proportions. Fentanyl is the Godzilla of opioids. It is powerful and deadly and knocking people down the streets all over Massachusetts, all over New England, and all over our country. People are being robbed of their potential and God-given abilities from this epidemic that knows no socioeconomic, ethnic, or political boundaries, and Congress has recognized the importance of tackling the Tsunami of heroin and prescription opioid addiction that is laying waste to these communities.  Just 1 month ago, on the Senate floor, Republicans and Democrats came together and passed a bill to provide $1 billion in new resources to States to address the opioid crisis, resources that can be and are being dedicated to increasing access to treatment for opioid use disorders. Yet, today, pending before the Senate is a Republican budget whose entire premise is to repeal coverage for the exact same vulnerable people who need access to treatment. Not only is that nonsensical, it is downright cruel for all those families and individuals who finally felt a sense of hope, the hope that new resources could mean the difference between life and death for their loved ones. If you kicked this policy in the heart, you would break your toe. That is how heartless it is going to be in terms of its impact upon ordinary families. With this budget, Republicans are repealing the hope that has given families a reason to ensure that they will have the coverage. This is going to make the problem even worse.  Medicaid pays $1 out of every $5 for substance use disorder treatment in the United Without Federal investment in the Medicaid program, States like Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, which are bearing the brunt of the opioid epidemic today, will have to find even more money in their already dwindling State budgets to aid those who need treatment. We all know what happens in this scenario when States cannot find that money. The most vulnerable among us, the ones who don't have a voice, are the ones who will suffer the most.  The repeal of Medicaid expansion would rip coverage from an estimated 1.6 million newly insured individuals with substance use disorders. At the same time, repeal will put big insurance companies back in charge. If the Republicans have their way, insurance companies would be able to discriminate against people, including individuals with a preexisting condition like an addiction disorder. OxyContin, heroin, fentanyl coverage--gone under the proposal the Republicans are making on the Senate floor this week.  Let's recognize that the Republicans are not just repealing ObamaCare; they are repealing hope. Those suffering from addiction don't have time for Republicans to come up--possibly, maybe, potentially soon, sometime, in the indefinite future--with a replacement plan.  There are 1.6 million people who have insurance for substance disorders right now for heroin, for OxyContin, for fentanyl. These are the people who could potentially die because they don't have medical coverage. What is the plan the Republicans have to deal with these 1.6 million people who are already under a substance disorder medical coverage plan? What is their plan for these families who are already desperate for the medical help they are going need in order to stay alive, in order to get the help they and their families need? Those families know that any delay in a replacement being put on the books could be the difference between getting clean or getting buried.  This repeal effort is the worst kind of bait and switch. It is happening at a[[Page S128]]time when the American people can least afford it. Repeal is being done at the same time the Republican budget gives billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations and to the wealthy in tax breaks. So look at that as the balance we are talking about: 1.6 million people who have an addiction, a substance abuse problem, lose their coverage, but billionaires and corporations get the money through tax breaks that are going to be saved from cutting those programs for those who have a medical problem. That is immoral, ladies and gentlemen. That is plain and simply immoral.  You cannot give tax breaks to the wealthiest in our country until you take care of those who are the sickest, until you take care of those who are most in need, until you take care of those with substance abuse disorders in our country. It is immoral to cut the programs so you can give tax breaks to the wealthiest within our society.  We will not save lives and stop this scourge by paying lip service to providing treatment, but this is not the only casualty of this misguided budget before us. The hospitals that each and every one of our constituents depends upon are also at risk. The Affordable Care Act became law in no small part due to the support of those hospitals across the country. During that debate they knew full well the impact that a lack of insurance had not just on individuals but on the entire health care system.  The hospitals are on the frontlines of witnessing the financial burden that uninsured patients have on the system. We tell them they can never turn away a patient in need; then, when these patients cannot afford to pay for the care, it is up to the hospitals to foot the bill. So the hospitals told us that if we worked to reduce the number of uninsured they had to care for, then they would help us pay for improving the entire system.  They did pay, in no small part. That is why we have a new system in our country. As part of the ACA, the hospitals agreed to give up over $150 billion in payment reductions between 2010 and 2019. Those payment reductions came largely from Medicare and were attacked relentlessly by opponents of ObamaCare as an act to destroy the program, but the prophesied destruction did not occur, and the impact on Medicare has been quite the opposite.  Since passage of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare has seen its lowest per-member rate of spending growth in its 50-year history. Premiums paid by enrollees in Medicare Parts B and D have gone down. Perhaps most importantly, the savings have contributed to keeping our promise to America's seniors by ensuring that the program will continue to be there for them. Medicare's projected insolvency in the year 2017 has been extended for over a decade. All of this is possible, thanks to America's hospitals.  Here is what the Republicans are saying to Grandma and Grandpa: Yes, the Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of Medicare 10 years beyond 2017. We are repealing that bill. So, insolvency comes almost immediately to the Medicare system. What a great signal to send to Grandma and Grandpa this year with this bill on the Senate floor: insolvency of the Medicare system, the one thing that Grandma and Grandpa, and, by the way, everybody else inside every family in America is depending upon to take care of Grandma and  So will the budget before us return the savings they are expecting from this bill to the hospitals to help them cover the cost of Grandma and Grandpa? For that to happen, Medicare costs will go up. Higher costs will lead to higher premiums for every enrollee in Medicare Parts B and These higher costs will also be realized in the entirety of the Medicare Part A program, reducing the time of insolvency from 2028, down to 2024, 2023, 2022, or even earlier.  Those results are unacceptable to the Members of this Chamber and to their constituents, so it is now going to be a historic debate that we have. We can decide instead to simply not cut off the 20 million Americans from the insurance they need. We can ensure that hospitals have the resources to focus on the care for patients when it matters most. We can keep the promise to America's seniors that Medicare will be there to cover their needs when necessary.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1555,topic-id,1512,"Thank you, Mr. I just want to follow up on the statements made by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr.Blumenthal, and the Senator from Hawaii, Mr.They have laid out in eye-watering detail the problems that the Republicans are creating by their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care What Senator Schatz and Senator Blumenthal did was just get to the heart of this matter.  What the United States did for 100 years was to not run a health care system but to run a sick care system--a system that spent 97 cents on what happens after people got sick and only 3 cents of every dollar on trying to prevent people from getting sick. For the first time in American history, that changed in the Affordable Care  What President Obama did, what America did was to create a Prevention and Public Health Fund, and that fund in the Affordable Care Act is spent on prevention programs. It is spent on looking at people who could get asthma, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, stroke, or die from too much smoking and just say for the first time, in a comprehensive way, that the United States was going to put programs in place that would prevent people from getting the diseases that every preceding generation of Americans have suffered from. That is what the prevention fund is all about. That is what the Republicans are going to repeal, take off the books--this fundamental change to the direction toward prevention, toward wellness that all Americans of all generations want to see remain on the books.  In Massachusetts, if you are in New Bedford or Fall River or if you are in Springfield, those programs target racial minorities, they target low-income families, they target seniors who would otherwise be vulnerable to diseases that these programs can help to prevent. That money is just going to be sliced out of the Federal budget. What will be the consequences? Well, quite clearly, it will cost America a lot more money.  For example, my father died from lung cancer, smoking two packs of Camels a day. How many other fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers die from a totally preventable disease? Well, ladies and gentlemen, this prevention fund put into place the kind of funding on a consistent basis not just for antismoking programs but for all programs across the books.  I will give you a good example. Back in the 1930s, no women, for the most part, died from lung cancer in the United But in the 1950s and 1960s, the tobacco industry hired the smartest PR person in This campaign basically said: ``You've come a long way, baby.'' You have an equal right to get cancer, as your husband, boyfriend, father, or brother has, and 20 years later, unbelievably, women began to die in the United States from lung cancer at a rate that was higher than the number of women who were dying from breast cancer.  Now that is a public relations success of the first and highest magnitude. We didn't have prevention programs in place. We didn't have a warning system to say to women, to say to kids: This is dangerous to your health. What did we see? We saw just about every family in America with somebody who died from lung cancer--pretty much every family--and it was totally preventable.  Well, inside of the Affordable Care Act we have this huge, great, innovative breakthrough--a health and prevention program that could be used in every city, every town, and every State across the whole country, targeting the most vulnerable, the most likely to be targeted, the ones most likely to be engaging in dangerous behaviors that are otherwise preventable. We have cured most of the diseases that our grandparents died from. The diseases that people die from today are the diseases that they give to themselves. They are behavioral choices. They are environmental situations into which they are placed that then result in them, unfortunately, contracting the chronic diseases that wind up first harming them and ultimately killing them.  What is a good example? Well, a good example is opioids. Opioids are now a killer of a magnitude that is almost incomprehensible. In Massachusetts, 2,000 people died in 2016 from opioid overdoses. Now, we are only 2 percent of the population of the United States of If you multiply that by 50, it is 100,000 people dying from opioid overdoses if they die at the same rate as the people who are dying in Massachusetts--100,000 a year, two Vietnam wars of deaths every single year from opioid overdoses. If ever there was a preventable disease, if ever there was something that was completely and totally subject to having programs put in place that could help people avoid ever getting into that addiction situation--or, once they did, giving them the program money which they need--then opioid addiction is it.  Well, what the Republicans are doing here is just wiping it out. They are wiping out that prevention fund. Moreover, just for the sake of understanding how incredible everything they are considering is going to be in terms of prevention of opioid disease, Medicaid right now pays $1 out of every $5 for substance use disorder treatment in the United States of In other words, without these prevention funds, without Medicaid funding, the only choice for these families is either getting help or getting buried. That is the bottom line. What the Republicans are doing is just wiping out the help.  So the option is going to be not just 2,000 in Massachusetts multiplied by 50,000, 100,000 deaths a year, we are just going to see this number skyrocket because without public health, without prevention programs, this is an inexorability, it is an inevitability. This is the future. This is just a repetition of everything America did for the preceding 100 years before we put the Affordable Care Act on the books. It doesn't make any difference whether you come from Connecticut or Hawaii, from Virginia or Michigan, from Massachusetts or from any other State in the Union, there are no barriers to opioid overdose, tobacco deaths, obesity, all of these preventable diseases. It is all coming as a preview of coming attractions to families all across the country. Here it is. This is what the Republicans are promising you: your family, once again, exposed.  Listen to this number. When the Affordable Care Act gets repealed by the Republicans, if they are successful--listen to this number: 1.6 million people who right now are covered for substance use disorders will no longer have coverage. Let me say that again: 1.6 million people who have coverage for substance use disorders will no longer be covered. So we have the prevention fund over here, we have the insurance over here--both gone.  I say to my colleagues, these Republicans--it is almost unbelievable. If you kick them in the heart, you are going to break their toe. We are talking about the most vulnerable people in our country. We are looking at the children. We are looking at people who have substance abuse disorders. We are looking at people who otherwise would never have smoked a day in their life if prevention programs were in place. We are looking at people who would never have to suffer through a life of obesity because the programs were put in place.  What are they saying? They are saying we are going to substitute and create a new program. When? Maybe soon. Maybe just around the corner. Maybe next year. Maybe whenever we get to it. What do you say to those families? What do we say to them?  This isn't just health care; this is also hope. This is also hope for these families who have chronic diseases, these families who have diseases that were otherwise preventable.  What the Republicans are saying is, we are just going to pull a bait and switch on you. We are going to repeal right now and replace at some point of our choosing in the future, even though we have harbored an ancient animosity toward the creation of a national law in the first place, and the American people are supposed to gullibly accept that argument. Well, we know what they have always wanted to do: leave all of these health care programs, from Medicare to Medicaid, to Social Security, as death-soaked relics of the programs as they have been created by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, by Lyndon Johnson, by Bill Clinton, by Barack They have always harbored[[Page S163]]that animosity toward those programs. This is just the beginning of an assault upon generations of promises to American families who have been transformed by these programs.  Let us fight hard, I say to my colleagues, to make sure these prevention funds are not taken off the books. It is the transformative way of looking at health care which the Affordable Care Act introduced into our society.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today because the current administration has literally undermined peace with their shameful failure to veto U.Resolution 2334.

I can tell you that after defending freedom in the U.S., I chose to volunteer alongside the Israeli Defense Forces because our countries do share the uncommon ideals of freedom, democracy, and mutual respect for all people. During my time with the IDF, I did learn at the tables of Israeli families just how much each one of them truly desire peace.

396,topic-id,2135,"Mr.President, this is the first day in which a new Senate is assembled in which we ponder traditions of this body. Indeed, it has been described, as my colleague from Texas mentioned, as the world's greatest deliberative body. But over the time I have been familiar with the Senate, it has lost the ability to claim that title, the ``greatest deliberative body.'' It is a completely different institution from the one I first saw in 1976 when I came as an intern for Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, because at that point we[[Page S13]]saw deliberation on the floor about the issues we face. We saw that the use of the filibuster to obstruct ordinary bills was rarely invoked. We saw bipartisan cooperation on big issues facing But that dialogue on the floor is largely missing.  One reason I wanted to sit here and listen to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle speak today was to ponder that tradition in which people listen to each other and ponder the opportunity to address those substantial issues that we have before us. My colleague from Texas, the Republican leader, noted that this past election, the people of America spoke loud and clear about the direction they want this country to go in. Well, certainly that is not the case. The majority of American citizens rejected the policies put forward by President-Elect By 3 million votes, the citizen election overwhelmingly rejected those policies. Indeed, had it not been for a strategy of voter suppression on the Republican side, it would have been far more than 3 million votes rejecting those policies.  Let us be clear that this strategy of voter suppression is an attack on the Our Constitution was founded on the principle that we would pursue policies here that support the success of all That is where our Constitution starts, with these three words: ``We the People.'' That is why the Founders wrote those three words in supersized font--so when you saw the written Constitution from across the room, you couldn't read the fine print but you could see the mission statement: ``We the People.'' It is why Abraham Lincoln summarized the genius of our country as being a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  Let us be clear. Without voter suppression, those 3 million votes, the majority that rejected the Trump policies would have been far larger. Let's remember that if it were not for Russian hacking of the election, that 3-million vote majority that rejected the Trump policies would have been larger yet. Let's remember that if it were not for an out-of-control FBI Director intervening in the final days of the campaign, the citizen vote rejecting Trump would have been even larger.  By the citizen-vote calculation, Trump lost the debate over the direction of If we consider the votes cast for Members of the Senate, overwhelmingly those votes rejected the Republican agenda. So here we are with colleagues who say the American people spoke loud and clear. If you consider the vision of our country and the citizen vote for the Presidency and the citizen vote for Members of the Senate, that loud and clear message is a rejection of the Trump policies.  There is no mandate here to throw millions of people off of their health care. My colleague from Texas said the American people deserve health care they can afford. Well, isn't that the challenge, that when health care has a price tag and there is no ability afforded you, you get no health care? You get health care for the upper middle class and health care for the wealthy but not health care for every citizen. Shouldn't we have a nation in which quality health care is accessible, is affordable to every single citizen? Twenty million more people have access to that now than they had 8 years ago. It is an incredible change.  A woman came up to me at a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis, and she said: Senator, things are so different this year.  I said: What do you mean?  She said: A year ago, before we had the Affordable Care Act, if you got a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, you were in deep trouble. It is a complicated, mysterious disease. It is an expensive disease, and if you had insurance, it likely wasn't going to cover the costs associated with it because of annual limits or lifetime limits.  She noted that if you didn't have insurance, you wouldn't be able to get insurance because you would now have a preexisting condition and no insurer would give you the opportunity to be able to have an affordable health care plan.  She said: Well, what a different place we are in now because now we have the peace of mind that our loved ones afflicted with this terrible disease will be able to get the health care they need.  Isn't that what we should seek--a health care system where people have peace of mind, where we no longer have thousands of bankruptcies based on health care costs, bankruptcies that you don't see in other developed nations that have done a better job of making health care available to every single citizen?  Let's not turn the clock back to whether health care was only for the healthy or the wealthy. Let's not turn the clock back to where our young folks were in a health care desert between the time they left their parent's policy and before they had a career of their own, before we said they could stay on their parent's policy to age 26.  Let's not turn the clock back to the point where we didn't make preventive policies for seniors free, and we found that that ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure. We did that in the Affordable Care Act, and people across the Nation have appreciated that.  It is not just on health care that we see no mandate for the Trump agenda; we don't see any mandate for the Trump agenda on the environment. There is a proposal by the President-elect to put an individual in charge of our environmental policies who has been all about increasing pollution--increasing fine particle pollution that causes asthma and other diseases; increasing mercury pollution, which is a toxic attack on the nervous system and affects the development of our youngsters. A neurotoxin like mercury is something to be controlled, not increased.  There was a commentary by my colleague from Texas that we should expedite the nominees. We know full well that my Republican colleagues did everything they could to obstruct President Obama's nominees. It was not so long ago we were here on the floor and we couldn't get a Department of Labor nominee through this Chamber, or Gina McCarthy with the Environmental Protection Agency, or various judges slated for the DC Circuit  I believe the nomination system needs to be reformed. I believe a President's nominee should get a timely vote. So why don't we consider the possibility of establishing a rule that gives people a timely vote? Why not put a 100-day clock on all nominees but the Supreme Court? If that 100 days ripens and we haven't had a vote on this floor and if a group of Senators wants a vote, then why not hold that vote, with an hour of debate, and hold the vote the next day? But to do that, we would have to have a debate over the rules under which this body functions.  There is no clear path to consider rules, which means we are often trapped by the precedents of the past that have become unworkable. So shouldn't we consider a rule change that gives a clear path for rule changes to be considered on this floor? Isn't that something on which Senators could come together on a bipartisan basis? And by establishing such a course of action, we could consider the possibility of having a 100-day clock on nominees so that they would not be trapped forever in purgatory, not knowing if they are ever going to get a vote. And we know that so many of President Obama's nominees were trapped in purgatory. It has had a terrible impact on those who are willing to consider the possibility of serving the executive branch, not knowing if they will ever get a vote. Couldn't we improve on this?  Isn't improving the nomination process something that is important in the balance of powers, the balance between the legislative branches? Our Constitution created three coequal branches, not a vision in which the legislative branch or half of a legislative branch can run a continuous attack on the judiciary, a continuous attack on the executive branch.  There are other rule changes we ought to consider. We could consider that for Supreme Court nominees, if they are filibustered, it has to be a talking filibuster so that it takes time and effort to obstruct, using the power of the minority, so that there is a conversation directly held day and night, on through the weekend, on through the next week and the following week, on whether debate should be closed on a nominee to the Supreme Currently, we don't have a talking filibuster for the Supreme Court, so if you simply can't get enough votes to close debate, this Chamber is silent. It sits silent rather than being in an engaged dialogue in front of the American people so the American people can weigh[[Page S14]]in on whether the use of the filibuster on a Supreme Court nominee makes you a hero or makes you a bum.  Should we not consider a strategy by which, on ordinary issues of policy, the filibuster is restricted to final passage of a bill rather than having obstruction with each amendment and obstruction with the motion to proceed to a bill, so that we can spend our time debating bills rather than debating whether to debate bills? And what goes hand in hand with moving the filibuster only to final passage is a clear way for amendments to be offered by Members on both sides of the aisle that are relevant to a bill, that are germane to a bill. If we have the ability to clearly debate amendments, we will be closer to being a deliberative body and therefore maybe even the possibility of becoming a great deliberative body or even the world's greatest deliberative body once again. But when we are paralyzed and unable to get bills to the floor or when they are on the floor but we are unable to propose amendments, we won't be there. These two things go hand in hand.  These are all ideas I advocated for when I was in the majority. Today I stand here in the minority arguing for these same fundamental changes. They will strengthen the success of this body for the majority and the minority and strengthen our ability to work together to produce legislation that addresses the big issues facing this  Let's be clear. There is no mandate for the Trump agenda, no mandate for dismantling health care for millions of There is no mandate for increasing air and water pollution, no mandate for tax giveaways to the richest Americans, no mandate for increasing the disparity in compensation between ordinary workers and the best off, the most powerful, and the most privileged.  We will indeed, as our Democratic leader noted, hold the President-elect accountable. The President-elect said, ``I am going to drain the swamp,'' but he has proposed turning the economy over to Goldman Sachs, to the banking world, and he has proposed turning over our foreign policy to Exxon, the fossil fuel world. That is the opposite of draining the swamp. We will hold the President-elect accountable.  The President-elect said he was going to fight for working people. Well, proposing a Secretary of Labor who is against working people getting fair compensation is inconsistent, to say the least, with a pledge to fight for working people. We will hold the President-elect accountable.  There is much work to be done, but if we hold as our North Star the vision that we are here as a legislative body to fight for the vision of ``we the people,'' policies that lift up all Americans, give an opportunity for every American to thrive, then perhaps we will find a course in which we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to make America greater and greater.

1562,topic-id,1633,"Mr.President, the Hippocratic Oath that guides health care practitioners begins with these powerful words: ``First, do no harm.'' This is certainly good guidance for our doctors and other health care practitioners, but isn't it good guidance also for those who are in the realm of health care policy, for those who are health care policy practitioners, as well as the doctors themselves? ``First, do no harm.''  Those powerful first words of the Hippocratic Oath, very relevant to this discussion, are being ignored by my colleagues across the aisle, by the Republicans who have come to power and said: We are going to dismantle health care across this Nation for millions of Americans, and we don't know what we are going to do next. We are going to repeal this plan, and we are going to run away, and in a few years we might figure out how to replace these health care provisions. This is an irresponsible perspective. We hold in our hands the health care challenges of America, and to repeal and run will do a tremendous amount of harm.  The irresponsibility of it is terrifying families across They are scared of what the future holds, of the uncertainty that awaits them under this strategy of making America sick again. Folks are afraid that if they have ever been sick or injured they will soon be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition. They are afraid that they may be one of the more than 20 million Americans who will lose insurance, having gained insurance and access to affordable quality health care through the They are scared that premium hikes will make health care unaffordable to lower and middle-income They are afraid of an unforeseen emergency wiping them out financially, driving them into bankruptcy.  Our seniors are afraid as well. They remember the situation that existed before they reached 65 or if they had health care needs and didn't have insurance, they had to wrestle between paying for their prescriptions or paying their heating bills. They don't want to be in that position again. They know how much progress we have made by filling the doughnut hole that paid for prescriptions throughout the continuum, and they don't want us to go backward.  From so many different directions, Americans are terrified of the Republican repeal-and-run strategy threatening to do harm to their lives. How do I know this? I know this because they are writing to me and to my colleagues, and we are sharing those stories tonight.  The letter I have from a young woman in Portland starts out:       I must implore you to protect the Its existence saves      the lives of millions, including mine. I was born in full      renal failure. I currently maintain Stage 3 renal function      with the help of prescription medication. If I am unable to      afford my medication, I will enter end-stage renal function,      i.e., kidney failure. I will die.  She ended her message by saying:       I am so scared. . . . I am only 26, I have so much more to      do.  Cameron of Beaver Creek writes:       My wife and daughter both have chronic health conditions,      and the ACA has allowed us to have them covered by health      insurance despite having preexisting conditions. If the ACA      is repealed, we will lose this protection and I don't know      how we could afford to pay for their medical costs directly.  Lisa in Wilsonville wrote to me about the impact that repealing the ACA will have on her special needs daughter. Lisa says: ``If the ACA is repealed, we lose funding that directly impacts her programs, her respite care, her Medicaid, and I will no longer get support to take care of my daughter.''  Just before Christmas I got a message from Nick in Nick wrote to share his story of a recent medical emergency that threatened his life. He said:       Without notice this past March, my heart suffered a      debilitating viral infection which resulted in congestive      heart failure. As things stand, I require a new heart, and      await that occurrence with patience and resolve. Thanks to      the ACA, I was able to purchase health insurance the month      prior to that diagnosis. Without it, I don't know how I could      have paid for my initial three-week hospitalization. . . .      Without it, my ability to obtain a replacement organ would be      uncertain. And without it, I envision a bankruptcy filing as      the only viable financial option.  Those individuals are writing about their challenges as patients, but doctors are also writing to share their observations as folks who see hundreds of patients in the course of a year.  Meg writes:[[Page S172]]         I have practiced both before and after the Affordable Care      Act, and witness the sense of hope and relief the expansion      of Medicaid in Oregon brought to my patients who are facing      serious illnesses. We have been able to participate in      community and state level innovations to help transform      health care delivery, lowering costs, improving outcomes, and      making people's lives better.  Isn't that what we should be about? Not a strategy of doing harm to millions of Americans but a strategy to make these people's lives better.  A physician from Roseburg, a hand surgeon, wrote about the challenges that he and his wife face, the serious medical challenges, and says:       Prior to the Affordable Care Act, we were uninsurable due      to these preexisting conditions. It seems clear that the ACA      will be repealed, and we, among millions of other Americans,      will again be uninsurable. This will not simply be a matter      of insurance being expensive; it will be a matter of the      insurance not being available at any cost.  And he continues:       So I am pleading to you to enact legislation prohibiting      insurers from denying the ability to sell policies to      individuals with prior medical conditions. The health of      millions of Americans rests on your shoulders.  And I might add that the health of millions of Americans rests on the debate and the discussion and the decision of the U.

960,topic-id,360,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his help on this amendment as well. It is an amendment designed to take an already very good bill and make it just a little better.  A good friend of mine, former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, used to say ``you'd be amazed how much government you'll never miss'' when talking about reducing the size of government bureaucracy.  So much of government's excess is created by unelected officials who wield enormous influence over our everyday lives. Last year, Federal agencies issued 18 rules and regulations for every one law that passed That is a grand total of 3,853 regulations in 2016 alone. In 2015, Federal regulations cost the American economy nearly $1.9 trillion--T, trillion dollars--in lost growth and productivity.  Think about that for a second. A $1.9 trillion tax, a government burden on the American people. That means lost jobs, stagnant wages, and decreasing benefits for workers.  My amendment looks to help change all that. Very simply, my amendment requires every agency issuing a new rule to first identify, then repeal or amend at least one existing rule to offset any annual costs the new rule would have on the U.economy. This isn't some new radical idea. President-[[Page H136]]elect Trump announced his administration will implement a new practice that for every new regulation, two would have to be repealed.  Governments in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands have all implemented similar versions of one-in/one-out when addressing new rules and regulations. In fact, in Canada, bureaucrats used the new direction to find and cut more red tape than was even required by the law. My amendment gives the new administration that same flexibility.  Mr.Chair, it is past time we stop bureaucratic abuse and shift the balance of power from government back to the people, where it belongs. That can start today by passing the REINS Act and putting our government on a path to reduce the amount of red tape that our businesses and the American people deal with every day.

414,topic-id,577,"Mr.President, although the time of this administration is short and the inauguration of a new President is now just weeks away, the Obama administration isn't coming to a quiet ending. From issuing controversial regulations to transferring unprecedented numbers of detainees from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, the outgoing administration has repeatedly acted in direct opposition to the bipartisan will of Congress and to the values of many American people. The clearest examples of this are the recent American actions at the United Nations Security Council, performed at the expense of Israel, an American ally and strategic partner in the Middle  This December, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said:       Decades of political maneuvering have created a      disproportionate number of resolutions, reports and      committees against In many cases, instead of helping      the Palestinian issue, this reality has foiled the ability of      the UN to fulfill its role effectively.  The U.N.'s anti-Israel bias was evident on December 23 when the Security Council sought to pass a resolution targeting American representatives abstained from voting on the deliberately anti-Israel resolution. The refusal to defend Israel is a departure from longstanding bipartisan policy of the United States and, in fact, a departure from the standards of the Obama administration.  Just days later, this decision to abstain was aggravated by comments made by Secretary of State In a speech that sought to defend the Obama administration's diplomacy, the Secretary's one-sided lecture further criticized With so many grave and immediate foreign policy challenges concurrently facing the Obama administration and facing our country, the Secretary's decision to devote his final days at the State Department to criticism of Israel is difficult to understand.

1213,topic-id,1862,"Madam President, in 2010 the American people were promised a number of things, but among[[Page S88]]those things was affordable, accessible, and quality health care. They were promised that if they liked their health care plans, if they liked their insurance, they could keep those insurance policies. They were promised a system that could get more folks covered at lower costs.  Instead, unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act has failed us and has failed to keep its promises. Canceled policies, elimination of certain plans, difficulties in identifying new plans, massive premium increases, sky-high deductibles, and limited options for doctors have really become a new standard for many American families.  At the end of last year, I completed another round of 105 townhall meetings in our There are 105 counties in On occasion--it is pretty rare but on occasion someone will say: The Affordable Care Act was helpful to me and my family. My response to that is: I am glad, but surely we can come up with a proposal--a plan--that isn't so damaging to so many other people for the benefits that you claim you have acquired under the Affordable Care Surely, we can come up with a plan that doesn't increase premiums, increase deductibles, increase copayments, eliminate plans, reduce the choice of the physician you see, and reduce your ability to keep the health care plan that you like. Because I am opposed to the Affordable Care Act does not mean I am opposed to trying to make sure Americans have better options and more affordable care.  I have also visited all 127 hospitals in our I have had conversations with the chief financial officer, the CEO, the trustees, the doctors, the nurses, and almost without exception the conversation is about how bad debt expenses increase, the ability for their patients--people who are admitted to the hospital--to pay their bills is less, not more, and that is because they can't afford the copayments and deductibles.  Unfortunately, ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--has taken away the freedom to make health care decisions from Americans, from us as individuals, and given way too much authority to the Federal Kansans continue to ask me to help them get back to their former health care plans, to find a better way to do this, a plan that is more affordable with better coverage.  Over the last 6 years, I have advocated for a number of changes to our health care plan to help American families. Even before President Obama was President, we were talking about what we ought to do.  I had ideas of what we could do to improve the chances that people across Kansas and around the country would have a better opportunity to provide health care insurance for themselves and their family members. I am proud of some of the successes we have had in recent time.  I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a supporter of funding for NIH, or the National Institutes of This is research that is essential to saving and improving lives, growing our economy, and maintaining America's role as a global leader, but, most importantly, it saves lives and improves health care. In addition, it saves money--the cost of health care--if we can find the cure and treatment for cancer, for diabetes, for Alzheimer's. One of the ways we can help reduce the cost of health care and make it more affordable is to make certain that we make the necessary investments in finding those cures and treatments.  Last year, I supported, and this Senate and Congress passed, the 21st Century Cures This takes us in additional directions in the way of finding those cures for life-altering diseases and, in the process, helps us to save our families' dollars. We have also worked hard to try to maintain the funding for Federal programs and agencies that work with universities and medical schools to train and recruit medical professionals who then go on to serve particularly in medically underserved areas. It is very typical of your State and mine, Madam President, in which we are experiencing the constant shortage of the necessary professionals to provide the necessary health care.  While this is progress, with a new Congress, a new year, and a new administration, we now have a tremendous opportunity to provide real substantive reform to our health care system. I mentioned the conversations I have had in townhall meetings. In addition to the health care side of the Affordable Care Act and the problems it has created for affordable and accessible health care, we have also had the challenges on the economic side--the job creation side--that the Affordable Care Act has unfortunately caused--the conversation about whether or not to expand a business, whether or not to exceed the 50-employee threshold. Those aspects of the Affordable Care Act are very damaging and need to be addressed and cured as well.  As we as a Senate, we as a Congress, and we as a country look for a replacement strategy, for something different--significantly different than the Affordable Care Act--we ought to focus on the practical reforms that embrace increased flexibility and allow American men and women to decide what is right for them and their individual family health care needs.  As we take this matter up in Congress, I wish to again put forth some specific ideas I have offered over the years as a blueprint for reform that we should try to put in place.  First, we should maintain preexisting condition protections for those with continuous coverage. Individuals with debilitating diseases and chronic conditions who have purchased health care should be reassured that their coverage will not be stripped in any future health care changes to our system.  Second, we can increase coverage by enabling Americans to shop for plans from coast to coast, no matter what State they live in. This will lower the premiums by spurring greater competition in the insurance market.  Third, we should extend tax savings to those who purchase health care coverage, regardless of their employment. To assist low-income Americans, we can offer tax credits to help them obtain the private insurance of their choice. We also can expand access to care by supporting community health centers and other primary care access points.  Fourth, instead of limiting the choice of plans, let's give small businesses and organizations the ability to pool together in order to offer health insurance at lower premiums, similar to corporations and labor unions. We also need to make it possible for health insurance to travel with workers when they move from one job to another job throughout their careers.  Fifth, we ought to increase the incentives available to individuals to save now for their future and for long-term care needs by empowering them to utilize health savings accounts and other incentive plans. Doing so enables individuals to take ownership in their health, and that is important as well.  Sixth, we need not accept the idea that costs for currently available medical treatments will inevitably rise. Instead, let's continue to support those things that bring down the cost of health care by finding cures and treatments, as I mentioned, with the National Institutes of Advancing lifesaving medical research and spurring innovation can help us accomplish health care savings, reducing the financial burden for those with diseases and their family members who care for them.  Seventh, we need to address shortages in our medical workforce by promoting education and programs at our universities and our medical schools that train physicians, nurses, and other health care officials and encourage them to practice in underserved areas through scholarship and loan repayment programs. Kansas is an example, as is your State, Madam President, where those rural areas and, additionally, those core centers of our cities lack so often the necessary health care providers.  Eighth, in order to curb the preventable costs that often occur through unnecessary emergency room visits and untreated symptoms of disease, we should provide coverage to low-income Americans, despite their limited financial means, in a financially sustainable way that ends up saving money in the long run. For all of us, the best reduction in health care costs is wellness, fitness, diet, and nutrition. That also means early preventive care. It means early diagnosis, and we make certain that Americans have access to that diagnosis and that early treatment. Ensuring access to quality care with a focus on preventive health is an effective way to limit high-cost health visits that place burdens on hospitals,[[Page S89]]physicians, our economy, and our health care system as a whole.  Lastly, we can reform our medical liability system and reduce frivolous lawsuits that result in inflated premiums and the practice of defensive medicine, where doctors order every possible test out of fear of potential lawsuit. Doing so can save tens of billions of dollars each year and make health care more affordable for more people.  The bureaucracy that goes with the providing of health care needs to be simplified. I have often looked behind the desk when I go see my family physician and wonder what all the people who are working there are doing. So much of it is not about patient care but navigating the system by which your health care bill, at least in part, gets paid. There is all the variety of insurance forms. I know this in my life--the ability to understand that insurance document that arrives in the mail and sits on our kitchen table waiting for my wife or me to figure out what this means. I have seen this with my own parents when they were living--the amount of documents, paperwork, and forms and checks for $13.19 that arrived in my dad's mailbox and trying to figure out with my parents: What does that mean? Why am I getting this?  So much cost savings and so much anxiety and angst could be eliminated if we had a system that was much more uniform in its presentation, simplifying the way in which our health care bill gets paid by our insurance provider, by Medicare, by Medicaid, or out of our own pocket. I would defy most Americans to be able, unfortunately, to understand what is the stuff that comes in the mail and what it means to them.  As we move forward with trying to replace and improve access of Americans to health care--to affordable health care--I believe there are reforms that will provide us with a good blueprint for how to start helping Kansans and all Americans across the country who have suffered under the deficiencies and the costs and the damage that comes from  I look forward to working with my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--to find solutions to take advantage of this opportunity that we have. The American people--many American people, most American people--are hurting under this law, and they have spoken clearly numerous times. It is time for us to bring to them the changes that improve their lives by improving their health care, by improving their health, and by making sure that no American is worried about whether or not the necessary health care that they need or their family member needs is outside of their reach.

1175,topic-id,1365,"Mr.President, I rise today to once again open a small portion of the Arctic coastal plain, in my home State of Alaska, to oil and gas development. I am introducing the bill because, now more than ever, new production in northern Alaska is vital not only to my state's future, but also to our Nation's energy and economic security.  It has been known for more than nearly 4 decades that the 1.5 million acres of the Arctic coastal plain that lie inside the northern one-eleventh of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are the most prospective lands in North America for a major conventional oil and gas discovery. The U.Geological Survey continues to estimate that this part of the coastal plain--which represents just 3 percent of the coastal plain in all of northern Alaska--has a mean likelihood of containing 10.4 billion barrels of oil and 8.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, as well as a reasonable chance of economically producing 16 billion barrels of oil. Even the relatively recent major finds in North Dakota's Bakken field and the recent estimates of shale oil in Texas' Wolfcamp formation pale in comparison, as ANWR is likely to hold over three times more conventional oil than any other onshore energy deposit in North  In the 1990s, opponents dismissed ANWR's potential and argued that the nearby National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was forecast to contain almost as much oil. However, early this decade the U.Geological Survey significantly reduced its oil estimates in the 23 million acre reserve. Instead of containing somewhere between the 6.7 to 15 billion barrels as forecast in 2002, the USGS now forecasts a mean of 896 million barrels--a dramatic downward revision. While I still believe oil production must be allowed to proceed in NPRA and that development of satellite fields must be allowed to occur, the revised forecast means that opening a small area on shore to the east on the coastal plain, is now more vital than ever for America's economic and national security interests.  That is especially the case given that President Obama late last year closed almost all of Alaska's outer continental shelf oil and gas deposits to future exploration and development. That makes production of onshore deposits even more vital for Alaska's economic future, and for the Nation's long-term energy security.  America once received more than 10 percent of its daily domestic oil production from fields in You heard correctly, production already occurs in Arctic Alaska, and has for nearly 40 years. We have successfully balanced resource development with environmental protection. Alaskans have proven, over and over again, that those endeavors are not mutually exclusive.  Today, however, we face a tipping point. Alaska's North Slope production has declined for years and now accounts for just under 5 percent of the Nation's daily production. It is now forecast to decline further to levels next decade that will threaten the continued operation of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline A closure of TAPS would shut down all northern Alaska oil production. This would devastate Alaska's economy, drag global oil prices even higher, and deepen our energy dependence on unstable petrostates throughout the world, especially once oil shale production peaks in the Lower 48 States.[[Page S116]]  Anyone who takes the long view on energy policy recognizes that no matter what energy policy our Nation pursues, we will use substantial amounts of oil well into the future. The more of that oil we produce at home, the better off our economy, our trade deficit, our employment levels, and the world's environment will be. To help meet future demand both here in America and throughout the rest of the world, and to help avoid a tremendous price spike in the event of supply disruptions, we need to take steps today to ensure new production is brought online, as soon as possible.  ANWR development will provide huge benefits for the U.Let's examine this with some simple math. ANWR's mean estimate of over 10 billion barrels, at even today's $50 per barrel price, means that there is half a trillion dollars worth of oil locked up beneath this small area in northern Alaska--and even more when prices rebound. That is half a trillion taxable dollars, and it is difficult to calculate or even fathom the corporate and payoll taxes that this would generate for our treasury. But we do know that there are hundreds of billions of dollars in pure Federal royalties since my bill devotes 50 percent of the value to a Federal share, rather than the 10 percent which current law allows.  As our Nation grapples with a huge budget deficit, nearly $20 trillion in national debt, and a lack of capital to incentivize new energy development, it is folly for America to further delay new onshore oil development from The question is no longer, ``Should we drill in ANWR?'' Today, it has become, ``Can we afford not to?''  I understand that no matter what happens, some will remain opposed to development in this region. The outgoing administration has attempted to not only prohibit oil and gas development onshore in the coastal plain--proposing to forever lock the area up into formal wilderness--but also has proposed to impede oil and even natural gas development from vast portions of NPRA and from the offshore waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi This mindset ignores Alaska's economic realities, it ignores the Nation's looming energy challenges, and it ignores the fact that Arctic oil production can proceed without any significant environmental impact. Our development has coexisted productively with polar bears, and will not harm the Porcupine caribou herd or any other form of wildlife on the Arctic coast. The groups who oppose my legislation seem totally oblivious to strides made in directional, extended reach drilling, three- and four-dimensional seismic testing, and new pipeline leak detection technology, all of which permit Alaskan energy development to proceed safely without harm to wildlife or the environment.  For all these reasons, I am reintroducing legislation to open the coastal plain of ANWR to development. At the same time, I am again focusing and narrowing that development so that just 2,000 acres of the 1.5 million acre coastal plain can be physically disturbed by roads, pipelines, wells, buildings or other support facilities. At most, just one-tenth of 1 percent of the refuge's coastal plain would be impacted. For comparison's sake, 2,000 acres is roughly the size of National Airport--compared to an area roughly three times the size of the state of It is hardly a blip on the map.  Limiting development to such a small area is important. It will help guarantee--beyond any shadow of doubt--the preservation in a natural state of more than sufficient habitat for caribou, muskoxen, polar bear, and Arctic bird life. My legislation also includes stringent environmental standards.  The bill, named the Alaska Oil and Gas Production Act, AOGPA, which is being cosponsored by my colleague from Alaska, Senator Dan Sullivan, also includes guaranteed finding to mitigate any impacts in the region, and guarantees that the Federal Government will receive half of all revenues generated.  For decades, Alaskans, whom polls show overwhelmingly support ANWR development, have been asking permission to explore and develop oil in the coastal plain. Finally, technology has advanced so that it is possible to develop oil and gas from the coastal plain with little or no impact on the area and its wildlife.  At this time of unsustainable debt, and an unstable global environment, we need to pursue domestic development opportunities more than ever. My ANWR bill offers us a chance to produce more of our own energy, for the good of the American people, in an environmentally-friendly way. I hope this Congress, given the new administration that will soon take office, will have the common sense to allow America to help itself by developing ANWR's substantial resources. This is critical to my state and the Nation as a whole. And with this in mind, I will work to educate the members of this chamber about I will show why such development should occur, why it must occur, and how it can benefit our Nation at a time when we need the domestic jobs and energy security that ANWR will produce.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS114.txt,1694,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,5.0,January

1206,topic-id,1276,"Mr.President, what is happening on the floor right now is absolutely extraordinary. It is absolutely extraordinary that Republicans are using the budget process, the reconciliation process, in between the swearing in of the new Congress and the swearing in of a new President, to rip away from 20 million Americans health care insurance, to drive up rates for one-third of consumers in this country who have some form of preexisting condition--a sickness that without this law would make their rates go higher--and to throw the entire health care marketplace into chaos.  It is absolutely exceptional what is happening right now. No one in this body should normalize it. No one outside of this body should perceive this to be just politics as usual.  I was here when the Affordable Care Act passed. I was in the House of Since then, I have heard my Republican friends say over and over and over again that they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it. I can't tell you the hundreds of times I have heard that phrase, ``repeal it and replace it.''  President-Elect Trump talked about that throughout the campaign, and then 2 days after he won the election, on Thursday night, he went on national television to double down on the promise that there would be an immediate replacement. He said: There will not be 2 hours between the Affordable Care Act being repealed and it being replaced with something better.  That is the second part of the argument the Republicans have made. The Affordable Care Act, in their minds, was deficient, despite the fact that there are 20 million people who have insurance today who wouldn't have it otherwise and despite the fact that there are hundreds of millions of Americans across the country who don't have to worry about them and their loved ones having their insurance rates jacked up because they are sick, and despite the fact that seniors are paying thousands of dollars less in prescription drugs than they were.  The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect--it never was--but the enthusiasm of Republicans to take away from Americans their health insurance and to drive rates up for millions more is really unthinkable.  We heard over and over again that the priority was to repeal it and replace it. Now we are repealing the Affordable Care Act with no plan for what comes next. We are driving forward with a repeal vote with no plan for how we keep the health care system together, how we prevent it from falling into chaos, how we continue to insure the millions of Americans who rely on it.  There is a cruelty to this enthusiasm for immediate repeal that is a little bit hard to understand--it is really hard to understand.  I think about somebody like Jonathan He lives in my He lives in Meriden, He was born with cystic fibrosis. He is insured today through the Affordable Care Here is what he said:       For me, I was able to live a relatively normal life growing      up, wonderful family and friends, but health has always been      the most important thing in my life. I spend even in a good      health year probably one or two hospitalizations each year      that require IV antibiotics, I am on a whole suite of      medications, each day I take about 15 to 20 medications, some      of those are pills, some are breathing treatments, and then      there are the shots. Healthcare is the number one priority in      my life, it's more important than income, more important than      anything else, being able to maintain my health.  He is insured by the Affordable Care Act today, but he also receives the benefit of the insurance protections because Jonathan, without the Affordable Care Act, even if he had insurance, would lose it--probably a couple of months into the year--because of a practice prior to the Affordable Care Act of capping the amount of money you would be covered for in a given year or in a lifetime. Jonathan would have blown through that in a heartbeat.  It is not hyperbole when he says: ``Without the Affordable Care Act, I'd probably be dead within months.''  That is the reality for millions of people across this country. Without health insurance, they cannot survive. They can't afford their medication.  So this isn't just about politics, this isn't just about the words on the page, these are people's lives. This is about life or death, and the casualness of throwing out a law without any concept of what comes next--I have read so many quotes in the paper over the last few days of Republicans admitting they don't know yet what they are going to do in its place, but they still feel the need right now, in the lameduck session, to begin the process of repealing this law without any concept of what comes next.  Why do it now? Why not take one step back? Why not reach across the aisle to Democrats and say: Let's try to work to make this better. Let's try to answer the concerns the Republicans have, that President-Elect Trump has. Let's take some time to work through this, reform it in a bipartisan way. Instead, we are rushing forward with repeal, stealing health care for millions of Americans, plunging the health care system into chaos, with no guarantee that there is anything that is going to emerge in its place.  Senator Kaine and I have a very simple budget point of order. Senator Kaine has talked about it. It would prohibit the consideration of any legislation as part of budget reconciliation that would, 1, reduce the number of Americans who are enrolled in health insurance; 2, increase premiums or total out-of-pocket costs for those people with private insurance; or, 3, reduce the scope and scale of benefits that people have.  I have heard my Republican friends say: We are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and we are going to replace it with something better. We are not even committing you to replacing it with something better. We are just saying, if you are going to replace it, let's guarantee now that legislation is not going to take anybody's health care insurance away who has it now who wants it, it is not going to raise costs, and it is not going to reduce benefits.  I am going to be honest. The replacement isn't coming. It is not coming, and even if it comes, it can't meet those three tests. There is no way there is a replacement coming that is going to maintain the 20 million people who have insurance now, that is going to maintain cost controls and maintain benefits. It is not happening.  News flash to the American public: This law is being repealed under a budget reconciliation process that shuts out Democrats, and it is not going to be replaced by something that is equal in quality or better. At the very least, we can all put our names and our votes to a budget point of order that commits Republicans to the promise that they have made for 6 years, which is that if they repeal this, they will not put a piece of legislation before this Congress that doesn't guarantee that everybody keeps their health insurance, costs don't go up, and benefits don't come down.  I urge, when this comes up for a vote, a positive vote from my colleagues, and I urge my Republican friends to honor the promise they have made.  I thank Senator Kaine and others for joining me in offering it.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority whip.

1566,topic-id,2124,"Mr.President, once again, congratulations on your election. I haven't gotten a chance to talk with the Presiding Officer in detail about his path to the U.Senate, but I have had a chance to talk to a lot of my colleagues about how they got here, and I think we can all agree it is not often a real pleasant experience. You get your name dragged through the mud. You get called all sorts of names. You have to call lots of friends and strangers and ask them for money. It is no walk in the park to run for political office or to put your name out there and be the subject of both praise and a lot of ridicule.  It is not surprising the reason that people do this. The reason that the 100 of us have decided to run for office and to put ourselves out there in the public spotlight is because we deeply care about our neighbors, about the people who live in our We are doing this job, to a man and woman, because we want to make life better for people; in particular, people who have been just thrown big curveballs by life.  I grew up in a pretty economically secure house, but I understand a lot of kids don't have that opportunity, and I feel like both Republicans and Democrats are here because we want to lift those kids up. I have had a pretty healthy life, a few bumps and bruises along the way, but I feel like both Republicans and Democrats are here because we get that other people aren't as fortunate. They got sick. They got diagnosed with something terrible. Our role should be to try to help get them some cures or some treatments.  We are here not because we think it is fun to run elections, we are not here because we like the look of our name on the door, we are here because we care desperately about people. I think this is what Senator King was getting at in his remarks. All of the tabloids and the TV news shows, they spend 80 percent of their time focusing on politics, and we end up chasing our tail off in here because if the daily political rags and the cable news shows are talking about politics, then maybe we should be talking and thinking about politics as well, but that is not why we decided to do this. We decided to run for the Senate because we care about people.  Why we are here tonight is pretty simple. Ultimately, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, with no replacement, with no plan for what comes next, will hurt millions of real people in very real ways. In the end, I don't believe that my Republican colleagues want to cast a vote that will do that.  This tall guy right here is Josh He lives in He is from He is standing next to his bone marrow donor and her boyfriend. This is Josh's wife. Josh was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2012.  Here is what Josh says. He will tell you the unvarnished truth. Josh says: ``The ACA is entirely responsible for me still being alive.''  He relapsed after an additional diagnosis before he turned 26, and the only way he was able to get insurance was because of the Affordable Care Act, which allowed him to stay on his mother's insurance up until he turned 26. During the course of his treatments, he underwent stem cell transplants, which could be up to $200,000 each. Because of those transplants, he needed ongoing weekly treatments at a cost of $10,000 per treatment.  He recalled how he was getting his first stem cell transplant and he was in the hospital during the Supreme Court deliberations on the Affordable Care He said, ``I was in a hospital bed watching the TV, when the Supreme Court approved the ACA, and just the feeling I had in my body was a feeling that I had never experienced before because I knew that I was going to be taken care of.''  Josh is in remission. In a few more years of being cancer-free, the doctors tell him he might be out of the woods. He says, ``I'm more fearful for other people in my position. . . . Because there's no way I would have been able to afford any of those treatments'' if it wasn't for the Affordable Care  This little guy, his name is This is his mother Rylan was born with a congenital heart defect. One day he had to be rushed to Connecticut Children's Medical Center for emergency open-heart surgery to keep him alive. Isabelle says that she never really thought about health insurance. She knew she had it, but she didn't really think about it until Rylan went for that emergency surgery. She thought: Oh, no, is our insurance going to cover it? Will they cover all the treatments he needs going forward now that he will have had a preexisting condition? She found out that the Affordable Care Act protected her because it eliminated a common practice of insurance companies to cap the amount of coverage you get in any one given year or over the course of your lifetime.  Isabelle tells it plainly. She says:       Without the Affordable Care Act, we would have never been      able to afford the care for We would have had to make      awful decisions--decisions about whether we kept our house,      kept our car, whether we could still afford to work.  It was the Affordable Care Act that protected her and her family.  Finally, this is John is a hero in my book. John was born with cystic fibrosis. John tells the story about how health care is the most important thing to him in the world. It is more important than salary. It is more important than his job. It is more important than friends. He struggles every day to live. The only way he lives is that he is able to take medications that allow him to continue to breathe and that allow his lungs to continue to function amidst this crippling disease and diagnosis.  John is on the Affordable Care Act, and John will tell you, just as plainly as Josh and Isabelle, that without the Affordable Care Act, he would die--not 2 years from now, not 3 years from now. John would die within a matter of weeks because without his medications, he cannot live.  It is not hyperbole to suggest that the absence of the Affordable Care Act is a matter of life and death. John will tell you that without the Affordable Care Act, he doesn't have insurance. Without insurance, he cannot afford the medications to keep him alive. Without the medications to keep him alive, John disappears from this  These are real people. I care about them because I know them, and I have had the chance to meet John and Isabelle and But you have these people in your State as well. My Republican colleagues have just as many of them. Some of the biggest numbers of enrollment in the Affordable Care Act aren't in States represented by Democrats; they are in States represented by And this mythology that the Affordable Care Act hasn't worked or that it is in some death spiral is just political rhetoric. It is not true.  This is an AP fact check story from today, I believe. Here is the beginning of it. It says:       President-elect Donald Trump says that President Barack      Obama's health care law ``will fall of its own weight.''       House speaker Paul Ryan says the law is ``in what the      actuaries call a death spiral.''       And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that ``by      nearly any measure, ObamaCare has failed.''  The AP says:       The problem with all these claims: They are exaggerated, if      not downright false.  The Affordable Care Act has not failed for the 20 million Americans who have insurance now because of it. The Affordable Care Act has not failed for the millions more who are paying less because insurance companies can no longer discriminate against them if they have a preexisting condition. The Affordable Care Act has not failed for seniors all across this country who are on Medicare and are paying less for prescription drugs.  There is no doubt that the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. Medicare wasn't perfect when it was passed. We amended it 18 different times. The Affordable Care Act needs to be amended and perfected, as well, but if you really care about people instead of political headlines, then the prescription here is simple: Take a step back. Don't[[Page S177]]lurch the entire health care economy into chaos when you don't have to.  I am pretty sure that Donald Trump is going to be President for the next 2 years. I am pretty sure that Republicans are going to control the Senate and the House of Representatives for the next 24 months. You have time. You don't need to prove some point to the political talk show hosts and the conservative radio commentators. You can step back and rescue these real people from the fate that you are about to subject them to by--instead of engaging in a partisan repeal with no replacement for what comes next--reaching out across the aisle and working with Democrats to try to fix this law.  I have been here the last 6 years. I was part of the passage of this law when I was in the House of I have listened to my colleagues say, literally tens of thousands of times in Washington and across the country, that their priority was to repeal and replace this law. I watched on TV our President-elect say in response to a question about the process for health care repeal going forward:       No, we are going to do it simultaneously [repeal and      replace the law]. It'll be just fine. We are not going to      have, like, a two-day period and we are not going to have a      two-year period where there is nothing. It will be repealed      and replaced.  There will not be a 2-day period in between repeal and replace. And that is what I heard from my Republican colleagues: Put your vote where your mouth has been because the alternative is a death spiral.  The Associated Press calls the mistruths out and says: No, the Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral. But those same health care economists who are quoted in that story will tell you that if you repeal this bill without any replacement for what happens next, that is what creates the death spiral. Why? Because when you put a clock ticking on the life of the Affordable Care Act, then a couple of things happen. First, people who need some procedure done rush into those exchanges and they drive up the actuarial cost, and insurers just look at themselves and say: Why would you hang around for that? And they bolt. So the Affordable Care Act falls apart if you telegraph to people that you have only 1 year or 2 years left.  You don't have to do this. You don't have to visit that kind of harm on real people. I know that is not why Republicans ran for office. I know we have philosophical differences on how to get health care to people, about how to insure more people, but let us sit down and figure out a middle ground so we can save the lives of all these people who are relying on us.  What we are doing right now is extraordinary. This is absolutely extraordinary. We were sworn in less than a week ago. The new President has not even been inaugurated. There isn't even a conceptual plan for what will replace the Affordable Care Act, and we are rushing forward with repeal. There is an enthusiasm to this cruelty that is hard to understand.  I hope that some of the Republicans who just in the last 24 hours have called for a delay in this debate are heard by Republican leadership. I know that Democrats will continue to be on this floor to make this case. I guess I am still optimistic enough about what is still a pretty broken town that, in the end, my Republican friends aren't so cold-hearted, aren't so barbaric as to take away insurance from people like those we have been talking about here today when there is an alternative, when there is another way, when there is no political imperative to do this kind of damage to people right now.

1162,topic-id,747,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize an exceptional public servant, Beth Bell, who is retiring from the directorship of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, NCEZID, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  Bell began her career with the CDC in 1992, in my home State, as an epidemic intelligence service, EIS, officer assigned to the Washington State Department of Health, where she led a seminal investigation into coli infections. After completing her EIS training, she moved to CDC Atlanta to join the hepatitis branch in the division of viral and rickettsial diseases, later serving as chief of the epidemiology branch in the division of viral hepatitis. During her 13 years working on viral hepatitis, she led important efforts to better understand the epidemiology of hepatitis A in the United States, applying this knowledge to the development and implementation of hepatitis A vaccination policy. These extraordinary efforts contributed to reductions in national hepatitis A incidence of more than 95 percent. She also worked on implementation of global infant hepatitis A and B vaccination programs during the early days of the Global Alliance for Vaccines She later served as the acting deputy director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases during the H1N1 influenza pandemic before being appointed director of the newly formed Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, NCEZID, in 2010.  In that role, Bell has been at the forefront of the agency's critical and complex emergency response efforts. In 2014-2015, Bell was called upon to lead the center through the largest Ebola epidemic in history. After reaching a near breaking point where, according to CDC Director Tom Frieden, it was ``spiraling out of control'' in late 2014, the epidemic was contained through the aggressive use of proven outbreak-control measures such as patient isolation and contact tracing.  In 2016, Bell found herself leading the response to yet another pandemic as Zika exploded in South and Central America, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and The impact of Zika on women and children through microcephaly, a life-threatening condition in which children are born with unusually small heads, was heartbreaking and historically significant--never before has a mosquito-borne infection caused such devastating birth defects. CDC's early alert--under Bell's leadership--to people traveling to countries with Zika likely prevented an untold number of infections among women of child-bearing age; and, continuing through her very last day of Federal service, Bell was critical in CDC's support for U.territories, cities, and States--as well as other impacted countries.  In addition, Bell oversaw the Center's response to chikungunya spreading throughout the Americas in 2013-14, the second-largest outbreak of West Nile virus disease in the United States in 2012, and hundreds of outbreaks of foodborne disease. Her leadership of the Center during each of these outbreaks has been remarkable, and all Americans have benefited from her steady hand and commitment to service. Bell also held leadership roles during CDC responses to the 2001 anthrax attacks and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Her outstanding leadership, scientific judgment, and expertise have been critical to the success of the Center in these endeavors.  In 2012, she was called upon to lead the Center's response to the fungal meningitis outbreak associated with contaminated steroid products--America's largest healthcare related outbreak ever. The New York Times called it ``one of the most shocking outbreaks in the annals of American medicine.'' Following her testimony before the Senate HELP committee, Bell was lauded for CDC's prompt and decisive role in the response, which likely prevented many hundreds of infections and deaths among patients who would otherwise have received injections of fungus-contaminated medication.  She also directed two new cross-cutting infectious disease initiatives that have already shown benefits to the field of public health: the Advanced Molecular Detection, AMD, and the Antibiotic Resistance Solutions Initiatives, Together, these initiatives are helping scientists better understand how infections spread and transforming our national capacity to detect, respond, contain, and prevent drug-resistant infections. Because of Bell's leadership, our Nation will be better equipped to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, as well as a myriad of other public health threats.  Bell exemplifies steadfastness and courage in protecting the Nation's health. She has demonstrated an unwavering level of dedication and passion for public health at all levels, recognizing the important roles of State, local, county, tribal, and Federal partners.  Bell has been a true public servant. I ask that we honor Bell today for her invaluable leadership to the CDC and America's public health efforts.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS109.txt,1409,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,5.0,January
1520,topic-id,1308,"Mr.President, I come to the floor of the Senate tonight with my colleagues to share the stories of families in our home States whose lives are now healthier or have even been saved because of the Affordable Care Act, including those who depend on Medicare and Medicaid, people whose voices now more than ever need to be heard here in Washington,  But first, I am going to make clear how the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act will rip apart our health care system. And after what came to light late last week, I also come to the Senate floor tonight to stand with the millions of women, men, and families nationwide who are rightly outraged that this reckless and harmful effort also includes a plan to defund Planned  For 7 years now, congressional Republicans have made all kinds of empty promises about how undermining families' health care isn't going to hurt anyone; that if the Republican-controlled Congress privatizes Medicare, cuts Medicaid, defunds the Nation's largest provider of women's health care, and guts public health and prevention programs, somehow families are going to be magically better off.  Well, let me be clear. Ripping apart our healthcare system with no plan to replace it will create chaos. This is a view shared not just by the Senate Democrats who are here tonight but by independent experts. In fact, it is a view shared increasingly by State Republican leaders across the country, including some Senators and Congressmen.[[Page S141]]  Last Friday, just to cite one example, the Republican Governor of Arizona urged his party in Congress not to rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying: ``I don't want to see any Arizonan have the rug pulled out from underneath them in terms of changing this law.''  Mr.President, if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, it is women and kids and seniors and patients with serious illness and people with disabilities who will bear the burden. Premiums will skyrocket. Out-of-pocket prescription drug costs will rise, and overall health care costs will increase. It is a perfect storm to make America sick again and is absolutely the wrong direction for our families and our economy.  Mr.President, I have to say, I have never seen a start like this to a Congress, where the majority is jamming legislation through on a fast-tracked basis with no hearings for public debate or actual legislative text. As a former chairman of the Budget Committee, I have to say I have never seen such an abuse of the budget process.  What many of my Republican colleagues are doing right now is unprecedented, but it gets worse. As if all of their harmful plans weren't enough, House Republicans announced last week after meeting with Vice President-Elect Pence that they plan to defund Planned Parenthood in this budget. In other words, congressional Republicans are not only trying to undo a law that protects women from being charged more than men for their health care and ensures birth control is covered without a copay, they are also going after the Nation's largest provider of women's health care as well. They are doubling down on their shameful and tired obsession with undermining women's access to health care, and it will have devastating consequences for women's health and rights and economic security.  So I am here with a very clear message: not on my watch. I, along with my colleagues and women and men across the country, have fought this fight before in 2011, in 2013, in 2016, and we will fight it in 2017. We know what Planned Parenthood means to millions of patients--men and women--who have trusted it for over 100 years for cancer, STD screenings, for HIV tests, birth control, and so much more. We are not going to let extreme politics get in the way of their health care. So if Republicans think causing chaos in our health care system, heightening economic uncertainty, attacking women's health and rights, and burdening our seniors and their families with higher health care costs somehow makes our country ``greater,'' they are obviously not listening to millions of families who did not vote in November for higher premiums or a health care system thrown into chaos.  I have gone back to my home State of Washington, and I have heard from moms and dads and grandparents who are finally experiencing some stability and are able to cover their families with quality, affordable health insurance--many for the very first time. There was a mom from Bellingham, WA, who sent me a story about how the Affordable Care Act helped save her son's life when doctors found a life-threatening blood clot during a routine physical. She was not only able to afford the preventive check-up that found the clot because of her new coverage, but her son's treatment was then covered by the Affordable Care Act through the Medicaid expansion.  I heard from a small business owner from Spokane, WA, who told my office about his wife, a retired nurse of 62, and how she was able to get a better plan thanks to the Affordable Care He told us what this meant for his wife and his family. You bet he gets upset when he hears Republicans say the law hasn't worked for anyone or that they want to privatize Medicare by turning it into a voucher program.  Finally, I want to share the story of Kalon, who is a software engineer from Seattle, and his son Kalon reached out to my office right after the November election. Two years ago, his son Bryce was kayaking in West Virginia and he injured his back. The pain in Bryce's back didn't go away for months. What doctors first suspected as a stubborn muscle strain ended up to be a rare type of bone cancer called Ewing's sarcoma, a horrible illness. Thankfully, his family had health insurance.  Today Bryce is getting excellent treatment at Seattle Children's Hospital, where doctors have been able to ease some of his pain, and he is responding well now to chemotherapy. Bryce, who is now almost 18, will need care--expensive care--for many years to come, and Bryce's dad, Kalon, is greatly concerned that, if the Affordable Care Act goes away, the preexisting condition protection that we fought so hard for in this law will go away, and his son will not be able to afford health care or get the benefits or treatments he is going to need in the future.  Those are just three stories, but they represent many of the more than 600,000 people in my State who are part of the 30 million Americans across the country who are benefitting from this law today. Of course, there is more we need to do. I said it before. The work didn't end when the Affordable Care Act was passed--far from it. Democrats are ready. We have always been ready to work together to make health care more affordable and more successful and better for our families.  I hope Republicans reverse course right now and agree to work with us on improvements to the health care system. That is the path to take if they are truly serious about helping families. If they don't, and if they continue rushing to take away families' health care with no alternative plan, they will be fully responsible, and they certainly will be held accountable. The real impact will be on millions of families across our country, families like the ones I just talked about and those you are going to hear about throughout tonight--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents who do not want to see this law repealed and want us to work together to improve it instead.  I hope Republicans are listening. I urge them to make the right choice.  Thank you. I yield the floor.

541,topic-id,472,"Mr.Speaker, Ithank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.21, the Midnight Rules Relief  Thisirresponsible legislation would enable Congress to wipe out hundreds, or even thousands, of regulations enacted during the finalyear of the President's term in office, in one fell swoop, with little examination, no deliberation, and little regard to theirimpact on public health or safety.  Members from both sides of the aisle have expressed concern in recent years over rulesadopted during a Presidential transition period--typically, the last 60 to 90 days of the President's term. But this legislationdiffers greatly from previous legislation that I and others have introduced in the past to deal with this problem.  Forexample, the Midnight Rule Act, which I introduced in the 110th and 111th Congresses, would have merely delayed theimplementation of rules submitted to Congress within the final 90 days of a President's term, with appropriate exceptions forimminent threat to health and safety, enforcement of criminal laws, implementation of an international trade agreement, andnational security.  This proposal was a response to concerns with last-minute rulemaking under the George Bushadministration, which was roundly criticized at the time for allowing insufficient time for public comment, ignoring publiccomments, and otherwise departing from accepted rulemaking practices.  My bill would have given an incoming President 90 daysto determine if any rules issued should not go forward. This measure would have allowed legitimate regulatory reform to proceedon schedule while putting the power to review and overturn controversial new rules into the hands of the newly electedadministration.  The legislation before us today, however, goes much further and creates a process to simply erase the lastmonths of an outgoing administration's regulatory agenda.  Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can overturn aregulation issued by the executive branch through a disapproval resolution that must be signed by the This bill wouldallow Congress to package these disapproval resolutions together and eliminate dozens, hundreds, or even thousands, ofregulations all at once, with little debate over the merits of any individual rule.  Under the CRA, agencies would beprevented from proposing similar rules ever again, absent explicit congressional authorization. You would have a rule terminatedwith no debate because it is one of a thousand rules done away with in one resolution. You can't even look at it again.  TheRepublican majority has waged an all-out assault on the regulatory process, trying to add hurdle after hurdle on the ability toissue regulations that protect public health and safety. Not content to grind the gears of rulemaking to a halt, they now wantto eliminate wholesale those regulations that have gone through the exhaustive rulemaking process--aprocess that often takes many years to complete.  Even more concerning, this bill would apply to rules issued in the last 60legislative days of a President's[[Page H77]]term. Not calendar days, but legislative days.

997,topic-id,723,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would exempt from the bill any regulations that pertain to nuclear reactor safety. In other words, my amendment would allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the NRC to continue to issue rules under the current system, thereby making it easier to protect Americans from potential nuclear disaster.  The underlying legislation, the REINS Act, would grind the gears of rulemaking to a halt by requiring all major rules to be affirmatively approved in advance by A regulation would be blocked from being implemented if even one Chamber declines to pass an approval resolution. The goal of this legislation, quite simply, is to stop the regulatory process in its tracks, regardless of the impact on public health and safety.  One example that highlights the risks and dangers of this legislation is[[Page H142]]the subject of this amendment: Nuclear power.  The world watched in horror when an earthquake and resulting tsunami devastated the area around Fukushima, Japan, a few years ago. That disaster then caused its own disaster--the meltdown of three reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The meltdown led to the release of radioactive isotopes, the creation of a 20-kilometer exclusion zone around the power plant, and the displacement, consequently, of 156,000 people. Just last month, seaborne radiation from Fukushima was even detected on the West Coast of the United  The same year as the Fukushima meltdown, Virginia was struck by a relatively rare but strong earthquake, felt up and down the eastern seaboard. While the region was spared a similar disaster, the earthquake required a nuclear power plant near the epicenter to go offline as a precaution and served as a wake-up call that our nuclear reactors needed additional safety protocols.  For me, this concern hits close to home. A nuclear power plant, Indian Point, which has suffered numerous malfunctions in recent years, lies just less than 40 miles away from my New York City district, about 30 miles away from the city. Twenty million people live within a 50-mile radius around the plant, the same radius used by the NRC as the basis for the evacuation zone recommended after the Fukushima disaster.                              {time}  1645  Indian Point also sits near two earthquake fault lines and, according to the NRC, is the most likely nuclear power plant in the country to experience core damage because of an earthquake.  Because of the catastrophes that can result from disasters, be they natural or manmade at nuclear power plants, prevention of meltdowns is absolutely vital. Since Fukushima, the NRC has issued new rules designed to upgrade power plants to withstand severe events like earthquakes, and to have enough backup power so as to avoid a meltdown for a significant length of time.  The NRC must retain the ability to issue new regulations to safeguard the health and well-being of all However, this bill is intentionally designed so that new and important regulations, including those to prevent a nuclear power plant meltdown which could affect millions of American, will likely never be put in place, thwarted by either chamber of  Congress delegates authority to executive agencies because we do not have the expertise or time to craft all technical regulations ourselves. We should defer to the engineers and scientists at the NRC who determine, after careful study, that a particular regulation is critical to our safety and to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant. This bill, however, would all too easily allow Members of Congress to substitute their own judgment or, most likely, the wishes of a narrow group of special interests.  This week we began a new Later this month we will have a new administration, all controlled by Between this bill and the Midnight Rules bill we passed yesterday, they have chosen to make their first order of business the dismantling and destruction of the regulatory process, regardless of the impact on public health and safety. This gives us a good idea of the priorities we should expect to see in the next 2 years.  The least we can do is to try to ensure that the antiregulatory agenda of the Republicans does not have devastating consequences such as a nuclear meltdown.

The Acting Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman[[Page H143]]from California (Mr.McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Chairman, recent pipeline incidents have raised serious concerns about the condition of the Nation's pipelines that threaten the safety and health of American citizens. This amendment will ensure that any rule intended to guarantee the safety of natural gas or hazardous material pipelines is not considered a major rule under this bill and would, therefore, be easier to create.  Pipeline safety is a bipartisan issue. Congress has shown that issuing regulations related to pipelines is a priority, as evident with the enactment of the PIPES Act last year.  However, the bill before us today, H.26, contradicts this historic precedent and would have the effect of delaying or preventing any rule on pipeline safety from going forward. Pipeline accidents cause major property damage, serious injuries or deaths, and harms the environment.  There are approximately 2.9 million miles of pipeline in the United They travel through rural and urban areas, Republican and Democratic districts, coastlines, inland areas. Everyone is impacted. Quality control measures, new infrastructure, and oversight are paramount.  Unfortunately, we have seen the devastating impact of pipeline incidents throughout the country, including several accidents and spills in California in recent years, such as the spill in Santa Barbara that released more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil.  We have also seen how liquid spills can devastate the people and economies in places like Michigan, and the irreplaceable natural resources like the Yellowstone River in Montana, or the precious coastline of Santa Additionally, these explosions and spills cause shortages and price increases that impact Americans far from the site of the accident.  A Colonial Pipeline accident this past September in Alabama leaked roughly 8,000 barrels of gasoline and saw prices increase by up to 31 cents a gallon in metropolitan areas in the Southeastern  I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we want effective and efficient government. But, in reality, pipeline safety regulations are already subject to duplicative and time-consuming analyses, including a rigorous risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis required by the pipeline safety statute. These already duplicative review requirements are among the top reasons why the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration increasingly lags behind the congressional mandate to issue rules that protect Americans from dangerous pipeline incidents.  In fact, this was the subject of a great deal of discussion when the Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the pipeline safety reauthorization bill last year. I worked with Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone to address this issue, as both sides of the aisle agreed that the duplicative reviews currently required are already slowing down these critical safety laws to a degree that is frustrating and dangerous.  While we make progress in the PIPES Act, I believe we can and should do more. The last thing we need is one more layer of bureaucracy to further slow down implementation of these critical protections for public health, safety, and the environment. We should work together to prevent spills and work to minimize impacts when spills or other incidents do occur. This includes automatic shut-off valves, leak detection, and technologies to reduce clogging and rupture.  A vote for this amendment is a vote for the safety of the public and the environment. It is a vote to protect the land and water that are threatened by oil spills. It is a vote for industry that wants certainty and clarity and doesn't want to--or benefit from--wait years for rules to be finalized. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH124.txt,850,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,5.0,January

1907,topic-id,581,"Mr.President, on December 23, 2016, the world lost a true hero.  Piers Sellers was a scientist and an astronaut, having flown three times on the space shuttle. On his first mission, he flew aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis to the International Space Station, where he completed nearly 20 hours of space walks outfitting and assembling the orbiting outpost.  Several years later, following the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, Piers returned to space and to the International Space Station aboard Discovery, carrying out the second of two test flights NASA needed to test critical on-orbit inspection and repair procedures resulting from the Columbia accident investigation.  On his third and final mission, he once more flew aboard Atlantis to the On this mission, he served as the robotics officer, again playing a key role in assembling and outfitting the space station.  His career as an astronaut exploring the frontier of space is by itself sufficient to justify Piers' status as a national hero; yet his service as an astronaut and explorer is a small subset of the contributions Piers made to our country and to our entire civilization.  Piers was a renowned climate scientist, specializing in using computer modeling and space-based observations to understand and predict the dynamics of our changing planet. He was also a brilliant communicator, whether testifying at a Commerce Committee field hearing in Miami about the impending dangers of sea level rise or standing in front of NASA's ``hyperwall'' video system narrating stunning and informative visualizations of the massive data sets that embody the ``vital signs'' of planet Countless policymakers, industry leaders, and even other scientists owe much of their understanding of the complex interactions of Earth's systems and of the alarming and undeniable signs that our civilization's carbon emissions are warming the planet to  Yet Piers' most heroic deed may be the decision he made shortly after being diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. He simply decided to keep going to work. To those that knew Piers, this was no surprise. A three-time shuttle astronaut and very capable manager, scientist, and engineer, Piers no doubt had many lucrative offers for employment following his final shuttle flight in 2010. Instead he chose to remain a civil servant scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center because he felt that was where he could contribute most to the future of our home planet. A few years later, when Piers received the devastating news that he had not long to live, he chose to spend his remaining time continuing his work at NASA and communicating climate science to the public in the calm and charming manner that was uniquely his.  In a short video Piers recorded shortly before his death, despite his body having been ravaged by cancer and surely knowing that he had very little time left, he appeared as cheerful and hopeful as ever. In the video, he said[[Page S200]]``to reach a safer future, we will need the resources of everybody here. The scientists, the policy makers, and the industrialists, all working together towards a common goal. And that goal is a planet that can continue to support life, including all of us.''  These words are even more powerful knowing that they came from a man who contributed the most precious resource available to him--the small number of days he had remaining in his life--toward the common goal he speaks of.

1347,topic-id,302,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Denton, Texas (Mr.Burgess) for yielding me time to speak about my bill, H.309, the National Clinical Care Commission Act, a bipartisan bill that received unanimous support in the last Congress and was cosponsored by over half of my House colleagues.  It had this level of support because our Nation faces an epidemic. Diabetes or prediabetes affects over 100 million Nearly one in three of our neighbors is affected. This is in addition to all of the Americans whose diseases fall under complex metabolic, autoimmune, or insulin-resistant diseases.  When I first came to Congress in 2009, it was crystal clear that we had a big problem. The benefits of all the Federal research dollars going into these diseases were simply not making their way to patients. Researchers at the NIH, the CDC, the FDA, and even DOD weren't sharing diabetes research.  It was clear to me in 2009, and it is clear today in 2017, that we need a laser-like focus on improving patient care by pursuing a strong Federal focus on research.  My bill accomplishes that goal by creating a national clinical care commission comprised of doctors who specialize in diabetes care for patients. This commission will have 3 years to strengthen their partnership between Federal stakeholders and health professionals, who will bring hands-on clinical experience to improve care.  This is not a new, unending bureaucracy. After 3 years, this commission will sunset. In 3 years, it will be gone.  We have already made a huge investment of taxpayer dollars into research. It is time for us to leverage that investment and translate that into meaningful prevention and effective treatment options.  So today, I ask my colleagues to again help those who suffer from diabetes or other complex metabolic and autoimmune disorders by voting for H.309.

349,topic-id,368,"Mr.Speaker, today we are seeing just how far House Republicans are willing to go to repeal the Affordable Care The party that claims to be fiscally responsible is now looking to change the rules of the House so that it can be fiscally reckless in its dangerous assault on the Affordable Care  House Republicans know that repealing the ACA will increase direct spending and the deficit by $3 trillion, and this cynical rules proposal shows that Republicans want to hide the true costs of their repeal plans from the American people.  Now, repealing the ACA would take away health care from about 20 to 30 million people. It would increase healthcare costs for everyone else. Premium growth for Americans in employer-sponsored plans has slowed since the ACA became law.                              {time}  1545  If the ACA had not been enacted and average growth remained the same, job-based premiums would be a projected $3,600 higher today.  Repeal will also harm hospitals. The hospital industry has warned that repealing the ACA could cost hospitals $165 billion and trigger an ``unprecedented public health crisis.'' Since the ACA was enacted, uncompensated care costs have declined for hospitals by approximately 21 percent. These costs cripple hospitals and are passed on to others in the form of higher prices.  Mr.Speaker, repeal would also harm the 55 million seniors and people with disabilities enrolled in In addition to ensuring free preventive services for Medicare beneficiaries and closing the prescription drug doughnut hole, the ACA lengthened the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 11 years.  Reforms in the ACA helped slow the rate of healthcare cost growth in Medicare, which means Medicare seniors pay less today than they would have if the ACA weren't enacted. Medicare spending was $473 billion less from 2009 to 2014, compared with spending if pre-ACA cost growth trends had continued. Repeal would reverse these gains and shift costs to seniors who simply cannot afford it.  Mr.Speaker, Republicans say they are fiscally responsible and that government spending is out of control, but today they will vote to add $3 trillion to the deficit with their ACA repeal bill. Their assault is not logical. I urge all Members to vote against this GOP hypocrisy.  ",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgH7-3.txt,887,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,3.0,January

1051,topic-id,329,"Mr.Speaker, I remain committed to a two-state solution, where a Jewish state of Israel and a Palestinian state can co-exist in peace. The best path to ultimately achieving this peace is through direct, bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, not imposed solutions by international organizations. Instead of this Administration concluding its strong Israel record with the single largest pledge of military assistance in U.history, it chose to end on a perplexing note by choosing not to veto United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334.  The expansion of settlements in occupied territory has been long recognized on a bipartisan basis and in U.policy for decades as doing little to improve the confidence of Arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated. United Nations action does not help advance the cause of peace, nor does it bring about direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians so they might resolve their complicated differences and find a much needed, lasting two-state solution, which I have supported my entire career.  Any action, whether coming from the United Nations or the Congress, must provide a complete picture of the facts on the ground and full appreciation for the challenges confronting all sides. Like the one-sided resolution from the United Nations Security Council, 11 too ignores the reality of the conditions on the ground.

617,topic-id,3191,"Mr.President, the more things change, the more they seem to stay the same. Republicans won the White House.Republicans control the Republicans control the What will the first order of business be for the new Republicanmajority? To pass a budget that never balances, to pass a budget that will add $9.7 trillion of new debt over 10 years.  Is that really what we campaigned on? Is that really what the Republican Party represents?  Our first order of business will be a budget that never balances, a budget that adds $9.7 trillion to the debt, and theytell us: Oh, but it is not a budget. If you listen, they will say: No, no, it is a vehicle to repeal  Yet I have the title in front of me, which says a concurrent resolution for the budget of 2017. We have special rules whenyou pass the budget so that we may be able to repeal ObamaCare, and I am all for that. But why should we vote on a budget thatdoesn't represent our conservative view? Why would we vote on a budget that adds $9.7 trillion to the debt? Because we are in ahurry, we can't be bothered.  It is just numbers. I was told again and again: Swallow it. Take it. They are just numbers. Don't worry. It is not really abudget.  Yet the legislation says it is a budget. The numbers say we will add $9.7 trillion of new debt.  So I say: If they are only numbers, and if the numbers that are in the budget don't matter, why don't we put numbers in thatbalance? Why don't we put a vision into the budget that represents what Republicans say they are for?  Republicans say they are the conservative party. Are we? When George Bush was President for 8 years, the national debtwent from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. The debt doubled under a Republican President and a partially Republican Yetthe words were these: Well, he had Democrats to deal with, and if we could ever take all three branches of government, thingswould be different.  The Republicans took over the House in 2010. They still didn't control the[[Page S39]]Senate, but they said: If we only controlledthe Senate, we could be the conservative party again.  We have had an election. The conservative party--the supposedly conservative party--won. Republicans control the House, theSenate, and the Presidency, and the first item of business for the Republicans will be to pass a budget that never balances--abudget that will add $9.7 trillion to the debt over 10 years.  This sign could have been put up for Obama's first budget. Every Republican railed and said: $10 trillion--President Obamawill add $10 trillion. And he did. President Obama doubled the debt again.  It went from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. The national debt went from $5 trillion to $10 trillion under George Bush, andthen it doubled again under President It went from $10 trillion to nearly $20 trillion.  What are we looking at here? More debt, under a solidly unified Republican Congress and a Republican  So you might scratch your head and say: The more things change, the more they stay the same. Is it all smoke and mirrors? Isthere really a difference? Are Republicans different than Democrats? It is a pretty important question. We are in such a hurryto repeal I am all for it. As a physician, nobody thinks that ObamaCare has been worse for the country. Nobody morethan me thinks it is a terrible piece of legislation that has not helped the country and that has inflated our costs and nothelped. Yet do we have to add nearly $10 trillion of debt in order to get at it?  So as this moves forward, I will offer a replacement. I will offer my own budget. I will offer to strike and remove $10trillion worth of debt, and I will offer my own budget that balances within 5 years. How do we do it? We give the authority tomake the cuts where they should be, where they are most wasteful in government, and we offer this budget by simply freezingexpenditures. You don't have to cut any expenditures.  Every department of government could get what they got the last year. If you think some departments of government need moremoney, cut other departments of government. Frankly, there are some departments of government you could eliminate and you wouldnever know they were gone. If the Department of Commerce were gone, a few corporate executives would not be able to fly aroundon government jets. They could fly around on their own jets. You would never know the whole entire Department of Commerce wasgone.  You can cut spending. You can actually get to the balance by not cutting anything. So here is what happens. If you freezethe on-budget spending, within a little over 5 years, your budget balances.  I remember a time when there were the moderates who were for freezing spending, and the real conservatives were for cuttingspending. Now nobody is for cutting spending. When I bring it up that you can absolutely not balance the budget if you are notwilling to look at entitlements, do you know what I am told by many well-meaning Republicans? Don't write it down. Don't put iton paper because people will be upset with you if you explain that to save Social Security, to save Medicare, you will have toreform these entitlement programs. They say: Let's just talk about waste. Let's just talk about fraud and abuse. And I do, andwe should eliminate all of those. But guess what. If you eliminate all of the budgetary spending that we vote on--this is calledthe discretionary spending. This would be the military and all the rest of the nonmilitary. It is about $1 trillion, notincluding the entitlements--Social Security, Medicare, and If you did just the military and the nonmilitary and youreduced it 10 percent a year for 10 years, and you virtually wiped out all discretionary spending, you still don't balance thebudget.  So, really, you are not a conservative if you are not willing to look at all government spending. The budget cannot bebalanced and the budget will never balance unless we look at entitlements.  What does that mean? It means that because of demographics--we had big families 60 years ago, with three, four, five kids toa family. Now we have less than three kids to a family--probably two kids to a family. So you had all the baby boomers born rightafter World War II, and they are all retiring--60 million of them. So we have this huge population boom, and you don't have asmany workers. So the demographics aren't working. Then you add to that the fact that we are living longer.  When Social Security was started, the average life expectancy was 65. It worked pretty well as a pension plan because youdied. But now it is great. We are living on average to 80, and if you make 80, you may well make 90. What a greatthing--longevity. But it is not working. Social Security is not working. We spend more on recipients than we bring in with thetax.  Medicare is even worse. The average taxpayer pays about $100,000 over their lifetime in Medicare taxes. The averagerecipient takes out $350,000. How big a problem is this? Medicare is $35 trillion to $40 trillion in the whole.  It is inexcusable that we are not talking about how we fix It is inexcusable that we are not talking about how tofix Social If we don't fix them, there is going to be a cliff. Within about a decade, the cliff is so severe thateveryone on Social Security will suffer a 20-percent decline in their monthly check. It will happen all at once if we don't fixit. Can we fix it? Yes, we have to talk about it.  What we are doing today is kicking the can down the road. We have our focus on ObamaCare, but we are taking our focus offthe debt. As bad a problem as ObamaCare is, as much as it has disturbed, destroyed, and distorted the health care market, it maybe that the debt is a bigger problem.  So it is not a popular stand that I take today. I will be the only Republican to vote against the Republican budget. Thatwon't be popular. But I ran for office. I left my medical practice. I am away from my family. I spend long hours traveling herebecause I am concerned about the debt.  We borrow $1 million a minute. The debt threatens the very foundation of our country. Yet here we are. The Republican Partycontrols the House, the Senate, and the White House, and in their haste, they put forward a budget that is going to add thismuch debt.  This is what the debt has been doing. Here is 1980. We see the growth. It has become exponential--the growth of the debt.This should worry every But here is the Republican 10-year budget that we are getting ready to pass. It is virtually avertical line of accumulation of debt.  People will say: But how could we ever cut any spending? I will give you a couple of examples of where your governmentspends money and you tell me whether or not we ought to look long and hard at cutting spending.  There was a grant given for autism. I have a great deal of sympathy. I know children with autism. The grant was for$700,000. But do you know what they spent it on? They spent it on studying Neil Armstrong's statement. Remember Neil Armstrong?He landed on the moon and said: ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''  Well, your government, in its infinite wisdom, wanted to know: Did he say ``one small step for man'' or ``one small step fora man''? Your government spent $700,000 studying the preposition ``a.'' Did he say ``a man'' or just ``man''--$700,000. Moneythat should have been spent on autism was spent on something frivolous.  Is anybody going to fix it? Every year, all of the spending bills are globbed together in a 2,000-page bill--and not oneiota of reform.  My colleagues may remember that Senator Proxmire from the 1970s used to have something called the ``Golden Fleece Award.''Every one of those things he complained about in the 1970s happens now but tenfold greater. Nobody fixes it. We don't passindividual spending bills. We do continuing resolutions, which means we continue doing the same thing we have done over andover.  Again, $700,000 was spent studying Neil Armstrong's statement. Do you know what their conclusion was? We are not sure. Theyspent $700,000, and they are still not sure whether he said ``a man'' or ``one small step for man.''  We spent $500,000 studying whether or not, when you take a selfie, if you are smiling in the selfie, does it ultimately makeyou feel better? We spent $500,000.[[Page S40]]  So what do we do? Do we give these people less money? Teach them a lesson. Give them less money, and maybe they willconserve the money. Maybe they will eliminate waste if they have less money next year than they had this year--or what I amproposing: Freeze the spending. Is anybody proposing that? We say: They spend a half a million dollars on selfies; give themmore next year.  So the Republican budget will increase spending every year. It increases spending at about 5 percent a year. So spending goes up. They say it is the baseline, and they say we are cutting off the baseline. No, no. Thebaseline goes up 5 percent a year. Spending will increase over the 10-year period. The red line is spending.  Part of that is what the Republicans are proposing. They are going to stay on the spending curve. If we stay on the spendingcurve, they will continue to spend $700,000 studying Neil Armstrong's statement; they will continue to spend half a milliondollars on selfies. They spent another half a million dollars on a climate change game. They spent $45 million to build anatural gas station in Afghanistan--$45 million. The first problem: Nobody in Afghanistan has a car that runs on natural gas.They discovered this after they built the gas station. The gas station was 86 times cost overrun. The original estimate wasabout half a million for the gas station, but lo and behold, somehow it cost $45 million. If your government had 86 times costoverrun, would you give them more money or give them less money? I, frankly, think we should give them less money. If you givethem more money, they will not waste it less; they will waste it the same or worse. They should be given less money.  Mazar-e Sharif is a city in northern We built an $85 million embassy there and we signed a 10-year lease, andthen somebody looked at the place and decided that since there were tall buildings surrounding the entire entity, people wouldshoot down into the courtyard and kill our diplomats, and they said the building could never been occupied--after they spent 85billion, after they signed a 10-year lease. How will they get better? Were the people who made this decision fired? They areFederal employees, and you never fire Federal employees. Will they make wiser decisions because we give them less money? Wegive them more money.  You would be excused for being upset if you went and voted and said ``I am going to vote for the conservative party'' and ifyou went and voted and said ``I am going to vote for the party that is going to balance a budget.'' Wouldn't you be upset?Wouldn't you wonder which party that is?  This is the spending curve. We are going to add $9.7 trillion in 10 years, and yet they say: Oh, no, this isn't really abudget.  I have it in front of me, though. It is a budget.  There is no reason why Republicans couldn't have put forward a budget that doesn't add all the red ink. We are at $20trillion. We are going to nearly $30 trillion under the Republican plan. My goodness, what happened? Where is the conservativeparty? Where are the conservatives in Congress who would say enough is enough? Now they say: We just have to be done with this.Don't distract the little people. Don't let the people of the country know we are voting on a budget. We are going to call thisthe vehicle to repeal  Well, that is not what it is. It is a budget. And we have special rules for dealing with the budget that allow us to repealObamaCare, which I am all for, but this is a budget.  They say: Well, how can we get the votes? No Democrats will vote for this budget. This is a Republican blueprint. Not oneDemocrat will vote for this.  So this is what Republicans are for. This is the blueprint the Republican Party says they are for--$10 trillion worth of newdebt. I am not for it. That is not why I ran for office. That is not why I am here. That is not why I spend time away from myfamily and my medical practice. It is because debt is consuming our country. There is a time and a place to debate ObamaCare,and I am more than willing to debate that. But this is a budget. This is the vote on a budget.  They say: Oh, it is just a gimmick. It is just a game. The numbers don't mean anything.  Well, if the numbers don't mean anything, put honest numbers in there or put conservative numbers in there.  I, for one, will put forward a conservative opposition to the Republican majority's budget. I will put forward a budget thatfreezes spending and balances the budget over a 5-year period. Would there be some agencies that would get less money? Butit would force us to go through the government and pick and choose what is good spending and what is not good spending.  We have a waste report that we put out. If you look on our Facebook, you can find our waste report. I listed four or five ofthe most egregious. There are hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of things we shouldn't be spending money on. I will giveanother example.  We have sold $100 billion worth of weapons to Saudi They were wanting to spend money giving F-16s to Youpay for them and give them to them.  There is riddled throughout the Pentagon--look, the Pentagon has never been audited. You are surprised? The government hasnever been audited. The Federal Reserve is not audited. The Pentagon is not audited. So what is the Pentagon's response to beingaudited? The Pentagon says to us: We are too big to be audited. I don't know about you, but that makes me kind of angry, that apart of our government, even a necessary part such as national defense, says they are too big to be audited. Meanwhile, we have$85 million embassies built that will never be occupied and $45 million gas stations that will never be used.  I think it is time that we say enough is enough. Don't give government more money; give them less. The government hasn'tbeen a good steward of your money.  The question is often asked: Are the people who spend your money, are the people involved in government inherently stupid?It is kind of a debatable question. I think they are mostly well-intentioned. I don't think they are inherently stupid, but I dothink they don't get the right incentives. Because there is no profit motive in government, because there is no rationale ormotive to conserve, money is spent, and because of sheer laziness and ineptitude, we continue to pass the spending bills--glommedtogether, thousands of pages--without reform. But I won't be party to that. I won't vote for spending bills that are notindividualized and don't have reforms in them. I won't vote for budgets that never balance.  So while I may be a lonely voice on this issue, I will continue to bring up to the American people that it is important notto add more debt, that it is important to slow down the accumulation of debt. It is important that we have a $20 trillion debt,and I am not willing to add $10 trillion more in debt. So at the appropriate time, I will introduce an amendment that willstrike and replace this budget, and in its place I will put forward a conservative vision for the country--a vision of a balancedbudget that balances within 5 years.  Every Republican in the Congress who has been here for a while has voted for a balanced budget amendment. Interestingly, thebalanced budget amendment--which would be an amendment to the Constitution--has within it a provision that the budget wouldbalance within 5 years. And even when Republicans get around to saying ``Oh, we will have some gimmicks to balance in 10,'' 10is not what the amendment says. Why bother voting on an amendment if you are not serious about it?  Republicans are completely in charge. It is a Republican document; it is a document I disagree with; and at the appropriatetime, I will be introducing a replacement that will balance within 5 years and provide a conservative view for the country.

1507,topic-id,1599,"Mr.President, tonight we will vote on a conservative budget that balances within about 5 years and saves the country from trillions of dollars of new debt.  This budget that will be presented as an alternative also allows us to repeal ObamaCare at the same time. We have taken the identical language from the underlying budget, put it into the replacement budget, but we have done something different. Instead of allowing spending to continue to grow unabated, instead of allowing spending to grow at such a rate that we will add $9.7 trillion to the debt, we do something novel--something that I consider to be the conservative vision for our country. We actually freeze spending. We just say: no more spending. Interestingly, the budget will balance. The country's budget would actually balance, and we wouldn't add $9.7 trillion if we simply freeze spending. I think there is something in my version of the budget for both Republicans and Democrats because mine calls for a freeze in spending but would allow the different Appropriations subcommittees to decide where the spending would be cut.  So, for example, if you decided that we needed more military spending but you thought that maybe we could spend less on corporate welfare, you might cut out the Department of You might not know it once we did it. You might not know that the Department of Commerce really could be eliminated and you really wouldn't notice that it was gone.  We look at the budget and we look at the spending every year, and we recount all of these terrible wasteful episodes of spending. Yet they never get fixed. Why? Because we continue to give government more money. The current budget that we will vote on will increase spending at about 5 percent a year.  You will hear from people this ``Washingtonese''--this language that says: Well, we are just holding to the baseline. All this is the baseline. Son, just vote for the baseline. Jump on the team and vote for the baseline. The problem is that the baseline is not flat. The baseline is inclined, and that increase in spending every year is what is bankrupting the country. Spending is going up 5 percent a year. That is what the baseline is. So when people say that we are going to cut trillions of dollars or this is a frugal budget, they are talking about cutting spending from the proposed increases in spending.  To illustrate that, the budget I am offering isn't even a cut of any kind. It is a freeze. Has anybody in America ever had their income frozen? Has anybody in America ever had to take a cut? Why shouldn't government? Why shouldn't we force government to look at their finances and say: You know what, this spending is good, and this is not so good.  I will give you an example. We spent $700,000 last year studying Neil Armstrong's statement on the moon. Neil Armstrong landed on the moon and said: ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'' Your government, in its infinite wisdom, spent $700,000 to study that to determine whether Neil Armstrong said ``one small step for a man'' or ``one small step for man.'' After spending $700,000, your government concluded that they still don't know.  They spent $500,000 studying selfies. If you take a selfie of yourself and you smile, will you feel better later? They spent $2 million studying whether or not if you are standing in a food line at a buffet and the guy in front of you sneezes on the food, are you more or less likely to eat the food.  You can't make this stuff up. Yet the budget that we are being offered does nothing to fix any of that. It just puts a stamp down and says: We are going to keep doing things the same way we have always done them. Well, my friends I think we should do things differently.  I think a $20 trillion debt is alarming. I think it is the 1 problem we face as a country, and someone ought to do something about it. So I didn't have much luck saying: You know what, guys, we should produce a balanced budget.  So what we got is $9.7 trillion, and I can't support that. So I offer an alternative for people who believe that debt is a problem. They can vote for my alternative, and it still maintains the exact same language that the underlying budget has for repealing You can do both. Why should it be an either/or? Why should it be that, well, we have to vote for a crummy budget, but that is the only way we can get to Why don't we vote for a budget that balances? I thought that was what we were for.  I remember a time when Republicans talked about not only freezing spending, but some actually said we should reduce the size and scope of government. That is what Ronald Reagan said. Yet government grows inexorably. Over and over, year after year, government grows. We had Republicans in charge about 10 years ago. Remember? George Bush was We controlled, I think, both branches for at least one period of time, and yet the debt doubled under George Bush's administration from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Under President Obama, it has gone from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Now you have Republicans saying: Put us in charge. Put us in charge of the You did, in 2010. Put us in charge of the You did, in 2017. Put us in charge of all three branches, and we will make a conservative vision for the country. We will balance budgets. We will reduce spending. Yet this is an all-Republican Congress where only Republicans will vote on the budget today, and yet we will be voting on a budget that will add $9.7 trillion.  I am told by some: This really isn't a budget; we are going to call it the vehicle to repeal  That is not what it is called. It is sitting right here. It is called the concurrent resolution on the budget for 2017--because, whoops, we didn't get to it last year, but we are getting to it this year.[[Page S137]]  This is the budget. It does have numbers in it, and I think the numbers in the budget are of significance. I think, when we look at the numbers, we should make them mean something. But people say to me: Well, numbers don't mean anything. Just vote for it so we can repeal We have to repeal So just vote for the numbers, no matter what they are.  I guess my response is this: If the numbers don't mean anything, why don't we put good numbers in there? If the budget is inconsequential and means absolutely nothing and only Republicans are going to vote for it, why don't we put numbers in it that lead to balance, because then we can go home to the people who voted for us and said they wanted us to balance the budget and wanted us to restrain ourselves and we can say we did what you told us to do. Instead, I have to go home and tell people that the Republicans introduced a budget that allows $9.7 trillion. I am told that we are going to do a better job, and 3 or 4 months from now we will do it again. I fear that in 3 or 4 months, when we come back, they will say: Well, you already voted for it once. Why don't you vote for it again? It is the same thing you voted for last time, and it is just a baseline. Well, the baseline is not flat. The baseline is increasing at 5 percent a year, and that is a problem.  We have to look at spending across the board. All of the spending has to be looked at. The great thing about what I offered as an alternative is that, whether you are a liberal or conservative, it doesn't define exactly where you have to have the cuts come from. It says what the overall number will be, and it will keep us from increasing spending. What you could do to get to a freeze is you could cut or eliminate some parts of the government, like maybe the $700,000 we spent studying Neil Armstrong's statement, which could be eliminated completely, and maybe the $30 billion we spend on corporate welfare in the Department of Maybe that can be eliminated and not one poor person would go hungry. Maybe a couple of rich CEOs will have to fly in their own jet instead of flying in a taxpayer jet when they are flying around the world. You could eliminate the Department of Commerce and you could keep spending for other items. If you think the military is bloated, you can actually cut money in the military and spend it on other items in the budget.  The bottom line is, if you vote for this amendment, you will be voting for fiscal conservatism that says: Enough is enough. We have a $20 trillion debt. We are borrowing $1 million a minute, and enough is enough. If you are a fiscal conservative, if you are worried about the debt of the country, I hope you will support my amendment, which replaces the underlying budget with a Federal on-budget spending freeze and actually leads the budget into balance in the near future.

Let us thank our men and women in uniform.  In this Chamber, we stand at the very heart of the American experiment. Every time each of us steps onto the floor, we carry with us the hopes and the hurts of those who have sent us here.  We surely have distinct political identities as Republicans and Democrats, but above all, we are all Here, we have the responsibility and the power to lift the lives and the hopes of the American people.  Our first responsibility is to secure the Nation, embodied in the oath we take to support and defend. We must be strong and smart in defending our land, defeating terrorists, and advancing our vital interests in a world of promise and peril. America's actions must always be equal to America's values, honoring our Constitution and respecting our men and women in uniform.  Another responsibility is to further secure our economy and truly secure opportunity for hardworking families. We in this Congress must focus on job creation and growing paychecks every day for everyone and everywhere in our country. From the rural heartlands, the cities, and the suburbs, we must ensure that those who do their part have the opportunity to buy a home, address the aspirations of their children, and retire with dignity.  Our responsibility is also to secure our democracy. Our Founders pledged their sacred honor to create a democracy; a government of the many, not a government of the money. Now our sacred trust is to keep that covenant. We cannot permit our democracy to be suborned by the checkbooks of the powerful or to be subverted by the dark operations of a foreign regime.  All of us cherish our ideals. We do have our differences, and they are real,[[Page H5]]but I hope that we will each be humble enough to accept the good faith of others. I hope, too, that we will find wisdom from the It says to minister to the needs of God's creation, humanity, and nature is an act of worship. To ignore those needs is to dishonor the God who made us.  In that spirit, in order to meet the needs of the American people, House Democrats pledge to seek common ground wherever we can to forge a bipartisan path forward on job-creating infrastructure, make taxes and foreign trade fair to American workers, help Americans balance work and family life, and to drain the swamp of Big Money from our campaigns.  All of these provisions President-elect Trump has pledged, and we will seek common ground, but we will stand our ground wherever in good conscience we must. If there is an attempt to destroy the guarantee of Medicare, harm Medicaid, Social Security, or the Affordable Care Act, Democrats will stand our ground.  If there is an assault on clean air and clean water, civil rights, women's rights, or LGBT rights, if DREAMers and their immigrant families face the nightmare of deportation, Democrats will stand our ground. If there is an attempt to silence our voices for commonsense gun violence prevention, with Gabby Giffords here in the Chamber as our witness, Democrats will stand our ground.

371,topic-id,2031,"Mr.Speaker, I join our colleague Mr.Lewis in praising the gentlewoman's leadership as ranking member, formerly chair, of the Committee on  It is an honor to serve in this Every day we step foot on the floor is an exciting moment because we have been sent here by our constituents to represent, as I said earlier, their hopes and their hurts. To serve with John Lewis is something beyond a privilege. To call him colleague is something that is an honor for all of us. To call him friend is a joy in our lives.  I thank Mr.Lewis for his leadership on so many issues, but for speaking out so consistently on this public health issue of gun violence in our country, we could not be better served. When, in fact, the sit-in on the floor occurred under his leadership and with his inspiration, the leadership on the Republican side said it is a publicity stunt, and he replied: That is what they said the march on the Selma bridge was, a publicity stunt. It is not a publicity stunt. It is about conveying truth to[[Page H22]]the American people. And that is exactly what the Republican leadership does not want the American people to hear: the truth about obstacles to legislation coming to the floor that would reduce gun violence in our country.  So here we are with this rule that has come to the floor that is outrageous in so many ways. Some ways are very esoteric and may mean nothing on first glance to the American people, but let me tell you a few things as to why you, as a person in our country, should be interested in what is happening on the floor today.  You would expect that, after an election that was so hard fought and so focused on the economic security and stability of America's families, the first order of business would have been to say how can we find a bipartisan path to greater economic growth that creates jobs--good-paying jobs--increases salaries, and contributes to the financial stability of America's working families, giving them the confidence that they will be able to buy a home, again address the aspirations of their children, whether that is at college or other training for the workforce, and also to retire with dignity.  Instead, we come to the floor with, first, a proposal that was so outrageous that the Republicans even had to back off of it. Even the President-elect, Donald Trump, criticized the first actions of the Republicans in the House, so they backed off of that for the moment. For the moment they backed off their attempt to harm the way we deal with ethics violations in the We should be draining the swamp. They are backing off.  I am here because we are talking about, again, a big public health issue: gun violence in our country. When Members of Congress spoke and the response from the public was so great, Republicans decided that, in this rule today, they would do something so outrageous. It is a violation of freedom of speech on the House floor. It is an insult to the intelligence of the American people that they should not be able to hear this. It violates the Constitution by saying the Sergeant at Arms can take money out of your salary if he doesn't like your behavior on the floor. It is absolutely ridiculous.  But our distinguished colleague from Georgia (Mr.Lewis) has spoken, as have others spoken to that point. I want to just go to another point, and it is a health issue as well, and that is what every family in America should be concerned about about what is happening in this rules package today.  I recently heard over the weekend from my friend that a grandchild of that family was diagnosed with leukemia--3 years old, diagnosed with leukemia. What does that mean and what does this rule mean to that child's life? Well, this rule is a setup to overturn the Affordable Care What the Affordable Care Act is doing for that child is to say you cannot be discriminated against because you have a preexisting medical condition, which that child will have for life. Insurance companies cannot have limits on your annual or lifetime limits on what kind of benefits you can receive--you are 3 years old, a whole lifetime of benefits. Up until you are 26 years old, you can be on your parents' policy. That would be eliminated as well. The issues go on and on and on that would affect that child.  If that child's grandparent is on Medicare, that family is affected, too, because, in this legislation, there is a provision that would harm Medicare by changing from mandatory to discretionary.                              {time}  1615  Inside baseball, I know. But when you realize that the Republican budget has a provision in it to take away the guarantee of Medicare and say to seniors, you are on your own, you have a voucher, you are on your own, now this family is being assaulted at the earliest years--3 years old. Medicare, in the meantime, for grandparents.  In between, it is important to note the following about the Affordable Care While we talk a great deal and with great pride about the fact that 20 million Americans have received health benefits now, have health insurance now because of the Affordable Care Act, we are very proud of that. It is a wonderful thing, but it is only a part of the picture.  Seventy-five percent of the American people get their health insurance through the workplace. One hundred percent of them have increased benefits because of the Affordable Care One hundred percent of them have a rate of growth of the cost of health care greatly diminished--the lowest rate of increase in over 50 years that they have measured these rates of growth.  So if it is a question of access, if it is a question of quality of care, if it is a question of cost, the Affordable Care Act has been a magnificent success.  Can we do better?  We always like to see implementation and how we can do better, and we thought we could work in a bipartisan way to do that. But the fact is that either the Republicans do not understand what this means in the lives of America's families or do not care about what it means in that regard, that they just want to repeal.  They say repeal and replace. Repeal and replace has one thing going for it--alliteration. Beyond that, it has nothing going for it, because they would never even be able to get the votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care It is just not possible. That is why they don't have a replacement.  Do you want to know why they don't have a replacement?  They don't have the votes for a replacement.  Then they say repeal and delay.  Delay? For how long?  Delay is probably one of the most cowardice actions they could take because it says: We don't know, but we know that it would be harmful to our politics if people lose their benefits or their costs go up, so we will just delay the impact of our irresponsible action of repealing.  So we have before us the makings of this bombshell of a rule that undermines the health and economic security of America's working families in so many respects. You certainly will be hearing more from us about every aspect of it, whether it is lifetime limits. Oh, we are going to keep no preexisting conditions. You are? At what cost and to whom? We would like to see that proposal. So far we haven't. So for many reasons that are, as I say, too inside baseball to go into.  Think about your own life, you out there who said: Keep your government hands off of my They want to put their hands not only on your Medicare, but to squeeze the guarantee right out of it, the lifeblood of what Medicare is, a guarantee.  They want to block grant Do you understand that if you have a senior in your family who is in need of long-term health care, whether it is because of one physical disability or another and some related to dementia and Alzheimer's, at least 50 percent of the benefits of Medicaid go to long-term health care?  So families in America who want them to overturn the Affordable Care Act and all that that means for Medicare and Medicaid and their budget to boot, you are going to have Mom and Dad, as Richard Neal says, living in your house. You are going to be taking care of them right then and there. That may be a welcome sense of community to you or it may not. It may deprive you of opportunity that you want to provide for your children because of an ideological view of Republicans that we should not have Medicaid and Medicare, which are pillars of economic security in our families.  The very idea that in this bill they want to take mandatory money and turn it into discretionary money, subjecting it to the will of the Congress in terms of appropriations, says that they have their eye on Social Security as well. So be very, very vigilant, be very, very aware. I don't want you to be very, very scared, but there is reason to be if the Republicans work their will based on the blueprint that they have both in this bill, this rules package they are bringing to the floor, as well as what they have in their budget.  Even their nominee for President, Donald Trump, has disassociated himself--in the campaign anyway--from what they want to do to Medicare and Social Security and the rest. We will see how that holds up as we go forward. But you can be sure that the Democrats will have a big, bright, relentless spotlight on what is happening here because of what it means to you out there and your families, whether it is a child who is sick, a worker who gets benefits in the workplace which now[[Page H23]]will be diminished, or a senior citizen who relies on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  There is a lot at stake. There is an ideological difference between Democrats and Republicans on these issues. I would hope that these issues would go away and that the public would weigh in in such a significant way that the Republicans would back off, as they backed off this morning when they chickened out on their very bad proposal relating to ethics.  In order for the American people to weigh in, they have to know, which takes us back to what Mr.Lewis was talking about--they have to know. If it is the determination of this body that the Sergeant at Arms can effectively silence the voice of Members on the floor deducting a penalty from their paycheck, which is totally unconstitutional--but I guess that doesn't matter to the devotees of the Constitution that what they are doing is unconstitutional--then how will the public know?  There is a method to this madness. It is not just about the sit-in on guns. As Mr.Cohen mentioned, it is about what other ways they will deprive us of communicating with the American people about what is at stake for them, America's working families, by actions taken on this floor.  I urge my colleagues, of course, to vote ``no,'' a thousand times ``no'' on this legislation, but also to continue the fight that will unfold if it becomes the new rules of the  It is a very unfortunate day. We should be starting with a big jobs package for America's working families, not threatening their financial stability by undermining what they have paid into, systems that they have paid into, now being subjected to the whims of an ideological majority.  Again, I urge a ``no'' vote. I thank, again, our colleague, Mr.Lewis, for his extraordinary leadership over time and up to the minute today, and I look forward to following his lead as we go forward.

During a time when many of this country's citizens suffered through institutionalized practices of segregation, Pontiac was not immune. African-American residents were relegated to the southern side of the city, as they were restricted from obtaining housing on the northern side. Mr.Price was instrumental in the push for open housing ordinances, which would create opportunities for all residents.  As the National Democratic County Officials' president, Mr.Price spoke at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, DNC, which was held at Madison Square Garden in New York He expounded upon the government's role in safeguarding the rights and protections that are due to all citizens. In addition to his DNC address, he also served as a moderator for a panel on public sector employment programs.  As State representative from 1994 to 2000, Mr.Price diligently served the 43rd district of He was the minority vice chair of the appropriations committee. He also was vice chair of the following subcommittees: higher education, family, independence agency, and supplementals.  Improving the lives of youth in the community was of the utmost importance to Mr.When he led the celebration of Pontiac's 150th birthday, Mr.Price commemorated the celebration by creating the sesquicentennial motto: ``To honor the past, recognize the present and build the future.'' Building that future included encouraging and providing youth with opportunities to grow within the community. As a county commissioner, Mr.Price secured summer jobs for Pontiac youth and minorities in Oakland After his service as a county commissioner, he continued to dedicate himself to youth development. In 2012, he participated in Oakland Community College's Symposium on Good Governance, Leadership & Community Engagement, where he discussed his experiences in leadership.  Mr.Price was known for his gregarious personality and could answer practically any question regarding the city of Pontiac's history. Even in his retirement, Mr.Price continued to be actively engaged in the community. He most recently served as a member of the master plan steering committee from 2013 to 2014 and was part of the group that helped prepare the 2014 Pontiac Master Plan In 2015, he joined the Oakland County sheriff's efforts to ease tensions between Pontiac residents and the Oakland County Sheriff's He, along with 25 other community leaders, formed the sheriff's relations team, which helped open lines of communication in the community.  Mr.Price is survived by his wife of 40 years, Carolyn, his children, grandchildren, and many relatives and friends.  I cannot express enough the impact Mr.Hubert Price, Jr., had on the city of Pontiac and the State of He was truly a treasure to our community and was influential locally and nationally.

1899,topic-id,750,"Mr.President, today I rise to express my strong opposition to partisan attempts to engage in a fast-track process to take health insurance away from hundreds of thousands of individuals in my State and millions across our country. In Michigan alone, 887,000 people are in jeopardy of losing their health coverage if Republicans have their way and repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. Important protections for people with preexisting conditions will disappear. Not only will they lose them but so will their spouses and children.  We will be repealing reforms that have benefitted seniors and saved more than 5 million beneficiaries an average of over $1,000 in drug costs in 2015. Repealing the Affordable Care Act will significantly increase drug costs for those seniors and threaten long-term solvency for Republicans are rushing a process that increases Medicare costs for seniors and weakens the program for future generations. Our Nation's seniors have worked hard their entire lives, and they deserve our best efforts to ensure they can depend on Medicare to help them enjoy a dignified and secure retirement.  Over 1 million seniors are enrolled in Medicare in Michigan, and they deserve a health care program that will cover the costs of prescription drugs and other health care services they need. Since 1965, Medicare has done a tremendous job of giving seniors the care they need, and we should be working to strengthen this successful program, not putting it at risk.  Let's be clear. Reforms in the ACA extend the solvency of Medicare by over a decade. Let me say that again. It extends the solvency of Medicare for over a decade.  Given these challenges, we have to ask: Why are we rushing to dismantle these reforms?  We are rushing a process that will ultimately hurt the Medicare Program, our Nation's seniors, and so many others.  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that we can simply keep or quickly reinstate the popular parts of this law, such as preventing discrimination based on preexisting conditions, allowing children to stay on their parents' coverage until they are 26, and helping seniors afford their prescriptions. I would pose this simple question to any of my colleagues advocating for repeal: What comes next? Show us your plan. Just show us your plan.  Former Governor Cuomo of New York famously said: ``You can campaign in poetry, but govern in prose.'' We are now facing a majority that campaigned on a bumper sticker and is trying to govern with an Enacting a repeal of the ACA that takes effect at some undetermined point in the future will create chaos in our insurance markets. Health care reform is not a stand-alone program that can be removed overnight without creating widespread ramifications for our economy.  Yesterday, I attended the North American International Auto Show in As a Michigander, I am always thinking about cars. Let me suggest an analogy. Many Republicans in Congress talk about the ACA like it is some sort of after-market addition on a car--a flashy rear spoiler, perhaps, or new rims that can just be unbolted and removed. Well, the ACA is actually like the antilock brakes that keep a driver from getting into an accident in the first place and the airbags that deploy to protect everyone inside when the worst happens.  I agree that our health care system needs a tuneup, but we cannot start ripping out safety features without a plan to help keep us safe on the road. We need to fix the Affordable Care We need to do more for small business owners who want to do right by their employees and provide them with quality, affordable health care coverage.  I have offered and supported several proposals to fix the Affordable Care Act, including measures to help our Nation's small businesses. I am ready to work with my colleagues across the aisle to improve this law. However, repealing the ACA without showing the American people their plan for replacement is quite simply irresponsible.  I understand Americans want to see positive changes to the Affordable Care Act, and I agree with them. We should be working together to enact bipartisan improvements through regular order, not fast-tracking repeal. The fact is that most Americans do not want to have this law repealed entirely. In the New York Times, a woman named Patricia Meadows from Macomb County, MI, who voted for President-Elect Trump, stated that she[[Page S198]]hoped that President-Elect Trump would not repeal the Affordable Care ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgS187-2.txt,2113,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,10.0,January

In comprehensive immigration reform, we not only paid for that border security, not only paid for that $40 billion and required people who were here illegally to pay fines and register and get right with the law, it actually would reduce the budget deficit by over $200 billion over 10 years.  So what we have is one-quarter of the wall and deficit spending with Donald With Democrats, four times the wall and reduce the deficit by $200 billion.  Mr.Speaker, the choice is obvious.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH248.txt,1910,COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES--JOINT SESSION OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE HELD,2017.0,10.0,January
1640,topic-id,2230,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the customary 30 minutes.  We will get to the content of the bills in a moment, but there is a procedural issue here that disenfranchises millions of American citizens in this process.  We are in the 115th Congress since the founding of this country. We were just sworn in last week to begin that. There are 56 new Members who just started serving last week that have never served in this body before, and there were 56 people that served in the last session who are no longer with us. What we are doing here is we are taking bills that those former Representatives worked on and new Representatives have not worked on and advancing them to the floor without going through committee, without going through the regular order.  So, for example, you have two bills, H.5 and H.79. We will talk about them in a moment. These are Committee on Financial Services bills. They should have gone to that committee, and members of that committee, Democratic and Republican, would have had the chance to amend those bills in that committee and mark it up before it comes to the floor. That is the normal process. Both parties are now constituting those committees; we are putting people on them.  I heard you, Mr.Speaker, read just before we began this debate how a number of Members were officially appointed to those committees. That is what we do in our first week or two.  Fifty-six new Members should have a say on these bills. They will get a vote on the floor on these bills, but they were completely excluded from the committee process that wrote these bills. That is wrong, Mr.Speaker, to not allow 56 new Members of this body to be the lawmakers that the people of their districts elected them to do. In fact, it disenfranchises the tens of millions of people collectively that those 56 Members represent. And I hope that, for future legislation, we can move through regular order and allow the new Members, as well as those who are returning, to be part of the lawmaking process.  With regards to these bills, we have largely seen these bills in prior sessions that people who are no longer in this body worked on.  The HALOS Act, I was proud to support last session and I am proud to support again. It addresses a potentially real problem. There is guidance from the SEC that--in our Rules Committee meeting yesterday I questioned the subcommittee chair--largely also addresses those concerns, but it is better to do it in statute and it is better to do it in the broader language that is included in the bill, which is why many Democrats--I hope a majority--support the HALOS  The United States is the leader in innovation in the global economy, and this is a small piece of that. What we are talking about here are demo days where entrepreneurs can pitch their idea. I, personally, have been able to attend a number of those, and it is a question of who can be in the room when that occurs.  Should it only be millionaires who are allowed in that room? Or can it be the next great generation of entrepreneurs? Can it be students? Can it be aspiring entrepreneurs? Can it be community members who want to learn what it means to pitch and how to do it and how ideas are spread, or maybe they are looking for a job?  It doesn't change who can invest in those startup companies. They still have to be qualified investors. By the way, I hope we have the opportunity to work with Republicans on the definition of ``qualified investor'' because I think it is unfair to restrict investment opportunities to multimillionaires. We need to allow educated and qualified investors of all levels.  Just because somebody is rich doesn't mean that they are a good investor, and just because somebody has not yet earned a lot of money doesn't mean that they can't be trusted to invest $10,000 or $50,000 of their own money.  We made progress in the original JOBS Act with the result of crowdfunded investing, but that is only a small piece--almost an insignificant piece. Private placements are the much larger piece of capital formation for venture-stage startups in our country. If there is a way we can have an alternative to the net worth test that allows individuals to, perhaps, take a qualitative test of their knowledge and, therefore, qualify as an investor, they ought to be able to do that, too.  This bill does not do any of that. That is a controversial area. It is one that it will take Democrats and Republicans working together on to help fund tomorrow's great companies and allow opportunity for all people, not just millionaires and billionaires.  What this bill does is it continues to restrict the actual investors to the millionaires. Okay? But it allows other people in the room at least. That is a start. It allows an MBA student who him- or herself wants to, perhaps, come up with their own company to hear 10 or 20 companies pitch so they can assemble their own deck; somebody who might have a great amount of value to give as a mentor who themselves is a veteran of a number of companies. Maybe they are not quite worth a couple of million dollars. Maybe they are worth only--only, right?--$500,000. Maybe they were a reasonably successful person worth $500,000, but they have a lot of knowledge to give.  Without the HALOS Act, it would be unclear whether that person would even be allowed in that room. So we want to make sure that mentors, up and coming, young entrepreneurs, and, frankly, up-and-coming entrepreneurs of all ages have access to the knowledge and the learning that can occur in these pitch events.  Congress has a role in making sure we have laws in place that really help build an environment that promotes innovation. When we passed the JOBS Act in 2012 that allowed for crowdfunding, Congress took a step forward. We have room to go there, room to go with private placements.  The HALOS Act is a small step, but it is a good one and a noncontroversial one. It creates a clear path for startups to participate in demo days, sponsored by government entities, nonprofits, angel investment groups, et cetera, and[[Page H252]]a clear safe harbor from the SEC with regard to the definition of general solicitation to make it clear that business experts and others can be in the room, while maintaining that only existing accredited investors can actually participate in offerings under Regulation D for the purchases or sale of securities that are mentioned in those demonstrations.  Currently, sponsors of demo days are relying on the 12-year-old, no-action letter by the SEC to make sure that they don't face the consequences of failing to comply. The guidelines outlined by the SEC's no-action letter are actually incorporated into the HALOS So, in many ways, this clarifies and puts in statute something that has been at the whim of the SEC for too long.  The gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Collins) and others will join me in talking about the importance of angel investors for early stage capital to create jobs, to allow tomorrow's great entrepreneur who might not have any resources of their own today to raise the resources they need to hire people and succeed.  The Center for Venture Research estimates that U.angel investors invested $24.6 billion in about 71,000 small businesses in every area, every congressional district of our country. Many of those were startups in the early stages of building a company.  Tomorrow's company that employs 10,000 or even 50,000 people is today's garage startup trying to figure out how to get $50,000 or raise $100,000 to make their payroll or buy their inventory.  Angel investors focus their investment on local startups and much more so than, for instance, national venture capital firms that tend to be clustered at the coast. It is an important way we can continue to grow the economy in every ZIP code in this country, across the heartland and the middle of the country, not just the coasts where the venture capital firms themselves are situated.  The Colorado-based digital home design firm, Havenly, started by two sisters, utilized demo days as networking opportunities to perfect their pitch to investors, a very common path. After participating in a 500-startup demo day, the pair received nearly $13 million in investment capital from qualified investors. Now Havenly is a thriving business, employs hundreds of interior designers across the country, and I am proud to say it has a staff of 40 people in their Colorado headquarters. Havenly is a perfect example of how demo days provide opportunities to startups that create real jobs for real people in our country.  The HALOS Act simply gives the same opportunities to other startups that thousands of others have had when getting off the ground.  I believe the HALOS Act is the appropriate approach to regulatory relief. I appreciate the bipartisan nature of the legislation. It is targeted to provide clarity around a specific potential problem and certainty around what these events can entail.  Now, there is another bill under this rule as well. It is a bad bill. It is not a strong bipartisan bill. It is called H.79. Since we began the 115th Congress here, the Republicans are promoting a deregulation agenda. Often this agenda results in this body, Congress, potentially being buried in having to do inordinate amounts of work to review the executive branch of government.  Now, we all believe in oversight of the executive branch. Believe me, Mr.Speaker, you are going to hear many Democrats speaking up about how important oversight of the executive branch is, particularly for the incoming administration.  We are not the executive branch. Congress delegates authority to agencies, under the laws we write, to fill in gaps and decide how best to implement the law. If we disagree, we can always change or amend the authorizing statute to make more clear the intent of this body.  However, these bills being brought to the floor by the Republicans would either require Congress to spell out exactly what ways to implement a policy in a changing world or give the authority of how to interpret and implement law to the judicial system, neither of which are wise or expedient choices regardless of who occupies the  While I certainly will have more sympathy with this approach with President Trump in the White House than President Obama in the White House, I still believe this is the wrong way to go about the separation of powers under our  This bill sets out 60 new analytical requirements that agency actions must meet before they can be implemented. In other words, any attempt by agencies to protect the public from toxic substances, make sure our planes and trains are meeting safety regulations, or make sure our food is toxin free would be subject to 60 new bureaucratic hurdles, effectively creating more and more red tape to tie the bureaucracy up rather than make their work quicker and more efficient, which is what Democrats seek to do.  This bill would bury the agency rulemaking process under a blizzard of bureaucratic hurdles and documentation requirements, literally burying the executive and administrative branch of government in red tape and paperwork. This bill would hold the regulatory process hostage to the whims of the very corporations and bureaucrats whose rulemaking it is designed to address.  The process that the bills call for have been roundly discredited by so many experts on regulatory policy from the left and the right and consumer advocates as well. The administrative law and regulatory practices section of the American Bar Association stated that these burdens would reduce transparency, reduce public input, threaten public safety, and, most importantly, not result in any better rules.  This bill is nothing other than a recycled effort that 56 Members of this body have not had a chance to participate in writing through the committee process to slow down the government and get in the way of agency rulemakings that are critical for protecting public health, safety, and our environment.  We are simply failing our constituents that we are elected to serve by spending time on legislation that would deliberately sabotage our own ability for our government to function efficiently. This is a bill that would make government less efficient. That is not what I hear when I am back home from my constituents--Democrat, Republican, I don't hear: Go to Washington to make government less efficient. My constituents want government to be more efficient.  Finally, this bill is being considered under a structured rule limiting the amendment process. There were over 30 amendments filed. Yet, we are only considering 16 amendments under this very overly restrictive rule. This is particularly onerous because, again, there was no opportunity for the 56 new Members through the committee process to amend this bill.  There was a new Member that appeared before the Rules Committee yesterday. Unfortunately, he was not even allowed to advance his amendment to the floor under this rule.  Another example is an amendment offered by a new Member, ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH249-6.txt,1910,COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES--JOINT SESSION OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE HELD,2017.0,10.0,January

Mr.Speaker, so, in summary, when we defeat the previous question, we will then bring forward our bill to establish an independent report on foreign interference in this most recent 2016 election, something that the American people deserve to see, that we need to see.

1220,topic-id,3585,"Mr.President, I enjoyed listening to the comments of my colleague from Utah about the Affordable Care Act, and I wanted to expand on that a little if I could. I know we are having a discussion right now about whether to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and we are focused a lot on what the timeframe might be and what the replacement might be, which is appropriate, but we also have to remind ourselves as to how we got here.  We got here because the Affordable Care Act has not met its promises and has let down the people of Ohio and people around the country. Millions of these families have already had a tough time experiencing really a middle-class squeeze of flat wages, even declining wages, on average, over the last decade or so, and now higher costs. That squeeze is accelerated by the cost of health care which has gone up dramatically.  In my own State of Ohio, the Ohio Department of Insurance has reported a 91-percent increase in the individual market in Ohio in the last 6 years, an 80-percent increase for small businesses that are purchasing Affordable Care Act-compliant plans. This is since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Think about that. There has been almost a doubling of health care premium costs. Who can afford that? People certainly can't afford that as their wages are flat or even declining.  According to the Kaiser Family Health Foundation, average family premiums since the Affordable Care Act was put into place have increased by more than $4,700. Recall that one of the promises of the Affordable Care Act was that costs would go down, on average, $2,500 per family. Exactly the opposite has happened. In fact, there has been an almost doubling, with a $4,700 increase. I don't think families got that kind of pay increase to be able to afford that. They certainly haven't in  So this is a huge problem. To make matters worse, we think these cost increases are continuing to escalate in our State and around the country. In Ohio, premiums grew this year in 2017--on average, 13 percent higher than in 2016. So there have been double-digit increases in 1 year. With two plans in particular, premiums went up by 39 percent in So for some families it was much worse than that. We have had good leadership in Ohio with Governor Kasich and Mary Taylor, who is also the insurance commissioner in our State, and because of that we have done a better job of trying to control these costs, but in many parts of the country, the situation is getting even worse.  Nationally, premiums are increasing by 25 percent just this year. In Arizona, they are doubling. In Tennessee, they are rising 63 percent. In Pennsylvania, right next door to Ohio, they are rising 32 percent. I can go on and on. I am sure North Dakota has had similar problems, as the Presiding Officer can tell us about. Some people might be able to afford these higher premiums, but I think we just can't afford it.  I heard Senator Hatch talk about having to make a choice between paying your rent or being able to pay your premium. That is what I hear in Ohio as I talk to people who are struggling and are now being hit with these huge expenses. Unless we take action, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  The Congressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan group in Congress, and also the Joint Committee on Taxation projected that unless we do something to change the status quo, premiums will continue to skyrocket. They say they will grow by at least 5 percent per year over the next decade. By the way, that is far faster than they assume wages are going to grow so the squeeze will continue.  The law was advertised as something that would ``bend the cost curve,'' meaning we would begin to see a reduction in the costs of health care, but health care costs have gone up, not down, and on top of that, American people had to pay hundreds of billions of dollars every year in taxes for this new law. There are 19 tax increases in the Affordable Care Some of these, like the Cadillac tax, are very unpopular, even among Democrats and So we are hoping we can deal[[Page S93]]with that with any kind of repeal effort immediately.  Another goal of this law, we were supposed to be increasing access to health care. Let's talk about that for a second. We heard different things on the floor about that. About 6 million people lost health insurance they liked as a direct result of this law going into effect. About 6 million Americans were told their coverage is no longer adequate because it didn't meet the mandates so they will lose their coverage. President Obama told the American people, I am told, 37 different times that if they liked their doctor, they could keep their doctor. Of course, that turned out not to be true. When you lose your health care plan and lose your doctor, you don't feel like those promises have been kept.  The outside fact checker called PolitiFact rated that as the Lie of the Year for 2013. That is the outside group that looks at what we elected officials say is going to happen and then compares it to what actually happens. By the way, it still is not true. One in five ObamaCare customers were forced to find a new insurance company for this year.  So the Congressional Budget Office that I mentioned and the Joint Committee on Taxation, these nonpartisan groups, now project that 27 million Americans are still uninsured today. Under the status quo, if we don't take action, they say that will be the case for the next decade. So this notion that everybody is going to get covered just hasn't happened. By the way, that is about 1 in 10 people in our workforce, even after hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars have been spent on the Affordable Care Act, including these 19 new tax increases.  A lot of people have told me: Rob, I have health insurance, but I really don't because my deductible is so high. So, forgetting the premiums for a second, to pay for health care, just the annual deductible has gone out of sight. There are some plans where a deductible for a family might be $8, $9, $10,000 a year. That is not really health care because you end up paying all that money out of pocket. The average deductible for a midlevel plan for ObamaCare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, went up to $2,500 the year before last, 2015, to more than $3,000 last year, an increase of about 25 percent in just 1 year. You see that in increases in deductibles and copays, not just in the premiums.  National insurers have lost billions of dollars on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, and a lot of them pulled their plans from the This is a real problem because if you don't have competition or choice out there, you will not get the costs down. I see in my own State of Ohio we lost one-third of the companies on the exchanges just this year. We have gone from 17 companies offering insurance on the exchanges in 2016, last year, to this year having just 11--so 17 companies going down to 11 companies. We now have 20 of our counties--there are 88 counties in Ohio--20 of our counties have only 1 insurer. This is also true nationally. About one-third of the counties around the United States only have one insurer. Again, this leads to higher costs, less choice, less competition. Quality also goes down because you don't have competition for the beneficiaries. It also affects the issue of premiums going up, deductibles going up, copays going up, and the middle-class squeezed.  So the President's health care law certainly failed at its own goals that were laid out in the promises that were made. It was supposed to create jobs, too, which is a different issue. What is the economic effect of this? Having more people covered is a good thing. We all want that. But what is the economic impact on the way the Affordable Care Act was put into place? We are looking at the weakest recovery in the history of our country from a recession still. Unfortunately, we haven't seen the strong economic growth we hoped for and had anticipated after a deep recession. Some of the reason for that, in my view, is health care. Health care costs went up dramatically. People are paying a lot more for health care, not being able to get ahead, small businesses having higher and higher costs.  If you look at the latest jobs report, it is interesting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that 5.7 million Americans now are stuck in part-time work who want full-time work. These are people who are looking for a full-time job but only have a part-time job. Why is that? The economy is not working as it should. It is not generating enough growth to create job opportunities full-time, but it is also because of these mandates under the Affordable Care I can tell you, economists may differ on the impact of this, but go talk to people about it.  I was in Chillicothe, OH, and someone came up to me and asked: Can you help me; because my employer is saying I can only work 28 hours a week. I figured out what it was about. She was a fast-food employee. I asked her: What did they say? And she said it was because of health care. What does that mean? It means that under ObamaCare, if you work under 30 hours a week, you are not covered by the mandates and the new costs, so some employers are going to say we are keeping you under 30 hours a week. That has led to more part-time work.  In this particular case, the woman said: I have to find another part-time job and I have kids at home and this is tough. And I said: Well, the answer to this, in part, is to change the health care law; that is, to take out some of the mandates and requirements and make it more pro-growth and pro-job rather than the current situation.  There are tens of thousands of new pages of regulations in this new law. It forces small businesses--and I am a small business person. I can tell you that I have burned a lot of time and effort to try to figure it out. You can go to consultants and pay them a bunch of money, and they will tell you they are not sure what it means either. This is one of the big issues that doesn't get talked about much with the Affordable Care Act; that it is really hard for businesses to figure out what they are supposed to do, particularly small businesses that don't have that kind of expertise inhouse. Those costs could go toward having more employees, they could go into reinvesting in business, plants and equipment, but they are going into trying to figure this thing out.  I don't doubt the good intentions of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who support this legislation. We all want to see more coverage and see health care costs go down, but that is not what is happening.  Before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the CBO estimated that 26 million Americans would be enrolled in a plan in 2016. That is what they estimated. The Congressional Budget Office said 26 million would be enrolled in a plan in 2016. The actual number was 12.7 million, less than half. So, again, it hasn't met its own promises and projections.  The co-ops are another failure. There was a debate on the floor just before I got elected about should there be a public option so everybody would have an option to get into an exchange. We said let's put together these co-ops. They will be nonprofit. They will work great. We will set up co-ops around the country. There were 23 co-ops set up, including 1 in We now see that 15 of the 23 co-ops have gone insolvent.  I will tell you that last spring, when 22,000 Ohioans lost their health care because the co-op went belly up, it was tough because they had to scramble and find a new health care plan quickly. More than 860,000 Americans--people who were encouraged by this law to sign up for these co-op plans--had to scramble to find new coverage because of a failed co-op. It is tough on these families.  It is also tough on the taxpayer. We did an investigation of this under the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and we looked at what was happening to these families and we also looked at what was happening to the taxpayer. At that time, when only about half of the co-ops had gone under, rather than two-thirds, $1.2 billion of taxpayer money had already been spent on these co-ops. That money isn't coming back to the Treasury, meaning this is money that will probably never be repaid. Again, part of the problem with our deficit is that ObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act is so expensive, and the co-ops in particular just wasted money. Among the surviving co-ops, 3 have not yet enrolled 25,000 members. In other words, they are not enrolling enough members even if they are surviving. So the nonpartisan Government Accountability[[Page S94]]Office, GAO, issued a report in March which confirmed the results of our investigation, and it indicates that this money, the $1.2 billion, has now increased substantially because more of the co-ops have gone under.  Many of those 22,000 Ohio families who were in the co-op had already paid deductibles in the plans they thought they could count on. Think about it. They paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in health care costs to get up to their deductible, and then all of a sudden they found out that they had to go to a new plan and they had to start all over again. So it is adding insult to injury. They lost their plan and they had to scramble to find one and then they found out they have all these out-of-pocket expenses again because although they met their deductible under the old plan, they have to start again in the new plan. This is not the way it ought to be. It is just not fair. These families did nothing wrong. All they did was what they were told to do, to sign up for these co-ops.  I think these are just symptoms of the problem. The diagnosis is clear. The Affordable Care Act is a bad law, bad economics, and bad health care policy. It hasn't worked. I think it is difficult to make the other argument. The President's health care law hasn't worked, not because it didn't have good intentions but because it tried to achieve those good intentions by forcing millions of people to buy a product they didn't want after losing a product they did want, including a $2 billion taxpayer-funded Web site that didn't work. If you recall, they had problems with the Affordable Care Act Web site and unfortunately potentially exposed a lot of personal information of many of these individuals to hackers.  As I talked about, even those who have insurance often have limited access to providers because the deductible is so high that they can't afford their health care.  With higher costs and fewer choices, the American people, by and large, are dissatisfied with the plan, the Affordable Care Act, just as they were when it was enacted. A CBS poll last month has shown that more people disapprove of the law then approve of it. A Gallup poll in November found that 8 in 10 Americans want the law repealed or significantly changed--8 in 10 Why? Because they have seen it.  By the way, most Americans were not in the exchanges, but they still felt it. Think about this. When a company is involved in the exchanges and losing money, and many of these companies are losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year, what they are doing is they are cost-shifting onto private plans, onto employer-based plans, and raising the costs for other This is part of the reason health care costs have gone up generally, not just in the exchanges but overall.  I have certainly seen this firsthand in Constituents have been contacting me for the last 6 years to tell me how this health care law has affected them. There is a father of five who wrote to me after the cost of the family's insurance doubled. Another man saw his $100 deductible soar to $4,000 while his premiums hit $1,000 a month.  I still remember the letter I received from Dean from He lost his job in 2009 as so many other Americans did during the recession. Because he lost his job, he had to go on the individual market to buy health insurance. He picked out a plan that worked for him and his family. He liked it and he bought it. Once the President's health care law went into effect, that plan was discontinued because it didn't meet the mandates and requirements of the new law. He found himself high and dry. He, too, had to buy another plan that was twice as expensive, and it cost him more than half of his pension--because that is his income. It is his pension. So not only did he lose his job, but then he was saddled with a plan he couldn't afford and a much more expensive cost of living. He didn't do anything wrong, but because of a failed, mistaken approach that Congress took to health care reform, he has now had to struggle to make ends meet.  Susan from Batavia also wrote to me. She is a single mom. She lost the plan she liked because of the President's health care plan. She wrote and said: I stay in shape. I watch my diet. I exercise regularly. I do all the right things. I had a high-deductible, low-cost plan, but under the President's new health care law, I had to change my plan.  Her coverage, by the way, was for double the price of the premium. A single mom; tough to afford it.  Another, Susan from Columbus, OH, wrote to me and told me that she works for a small business of 12 employees. When the health care law went into effect, their rates went up nearly 30 percent in 1 year. Small businesses and new businesses cannot afford that. I cannot tell you how many small businesses I have been to where I asked them: What have your premiums done over the last several years, and they tell me: Double digit, Double digit. If we get an increase in the low double digit, that is a good thing. Again, there is no place for that to come from except for wages and benefits and cutting back on employees--in some cases, again, not expanding a plan that they otherwise would have because of this health care law.  It doesn't have to be this way. We can enact real health care reform that uses the market forces that help to increase competition, that requires insurance companies to compete for our business, that allows people to get the plan they want, looking all around the country for what works best for them. This burdensome health care law is standing in the way of real reforms right now. It is hurting families in Ohio and across the country.  The health care market was far from perfect before this law so I am not arguing that the status quo is acceptable. I think we have to do things not just to repeal ObamaCare but to replace the Affordable Care Act with reforms that make better sense. We had issues before, but it has gone to worse, not better. It accelerated the problems.  I hope that over the next couple of months, as we talk about this, we will be able to come up with a replacement plan that makes sense. Republicans and Democrats alike need to come to the table on this because, again, I have listed today all the reasons the current law is not working. The status quo is not acceptable. I think it is very hard to argue that it is. That means all of us have a responsibility to say: How do we fix this? How do we come together, Republicans and Democrats alike--not on a partisan basis as was done last time--to figure out a way to do it together? We need to come together to make sure the people we represent have the chance to get the health care they want for them and their families, that fits them, where they can have costs that are affordable, where they can have quality health care that is good for them and their families, where it can be patient-centered, and we can give people the affordable care they deserve.  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,924,OBAMACARE,2017.0,5.0,January
445,topic-id,614,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to share thestory of Mary and her son, two of my constituents from the Lakeview community of Mary wrote to me on her son's behalf,expressing their deep appreciation for the Affordable Care Act and what the law has meant for their family.  In 2001, Mary'sson was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease called Addison's disease. It occurs when your body produces insufficientamounts of certain hormones produced by your adrenal glands. When left untreated, Addison's disease can be life-threatening.  At the time of his diagnosis, Mary's son was fully insured through his employer. Then, in 2011, Mary's son left his employerto pursue the American Dream of entrepreneurship and start a small business on his own. Leaving his employer to bravely chasethe American Dream meant leaving behind his insurance coverage, too. He did not anticipate being denied coverage due to apreexisting condition.[[Page H57]]  Up to this point, because of treatment covered by his insurance plan, he had been able to workto provide for himself and to live independently. As he got his new business off the ground, he went uninsured and, as a result,encountered several crises with his health. He avoided going to the doctor due to high costs and eventually ended up in theemergency room. As we all know, preventable emergency visits are a major contributor to the overall high healthcare costs thatharm the entire system.  Thanks to the President and Congress passing the Affordable Care Act, Mary's son was finally able toobtain affordable care when the health insurance marketplace first opened in October 2013.  Mary wrote me to share her son'sstory. He is one of tens of millions of Americans who have directly benefited from the ACA's improvements to coverage, consumerprotections, costs, and quality. Today, Mary is fearful of what the repeal of ACA will mean for her son.  Unfortunately,despite having 7 years to produce an alternative, the majority has failed to offer a true replacement. And what about the partsof the ACA that share bipartisan popularity?  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the President-elect insistthey will craft a plan that maintains popular parts of the law, while rejecting the less popular components. Of course, thatsounds great, but there is one real problem: they have offered absolutely no way to pay for any of it.  In reality, repealand replace is more simply repeal and go back to before--tearing down a much-needed house before a new one is built, back to atime when 47 million Americans--nearly 18 percent of the population--were uninsured. Mary's son and countless others like himcannot afford to go back in time. Repealing ACA will leave 20 million Americans, including her son, without affordable healthinsurance, effectively disrupting their care and potentially putting their lives at risk.  To remind us all of the highstakes riding on the ACA repeal, Mary wrote, saying: ``As a former Republican and now an Independent voter, I am speaking frommy heart. The 2016 election result has me truly frightened for the health of my son and for my husband and me.''  Repealingthe Affordable Care Act will create a chaotic situation that will put real lives in danger. We all share in the responsibilityto protect the health care of all Empty rhetoric of repealing the ACA is dangerous, but when transformed into reallegislative action, it can be catastrophic for the constituents that elected us to serve and represent them in this body.  Onbehalf of Mary's son and other Americans in districts across the country, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle toabandon their efforts to strip health care from those who need it and, instead, work with us to make our country a healthierplace for all.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH56-3.txt,1967,OBAMACARE,2017.0,4.0,January

1748,topic-id,867,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am very pleased to bring two important bills to the floor today that strengthen the government's ability to effectively leverage cutting-edge cyber technologies. Last year, the House passed both of these provisions as part of Majority Leader McCarthy's Innovation Initiative, and I am excited that we are able to bring them to the floor here so early in the 115th  Mr.Speaker, over the past 2 years, my colleagues and I have been working diligently with technology innovators and tech startups to find solutions that will spur innovation and break down the bureaucratic barriers that prevent the government from effectively leveraging the private sector's emerging technologies.  H.239, the Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017, addresses this problem by requiring the science and technology directorate, or S&T, to more effectively coordinate with industry and academia to support the research and development of cybersecurity technologies.  H.239 does so because it requires S&T to support the full life cycle of cyber research and development projects and identify mature technologies to address cybersecurity gaps. In doing so, S&T will be required to target federally funded cybersecurity research that demonstrates a high probability of successful transition to the commercial market within 2 years.  This bill will also extend the use of other transactional authority, or OTA, until the year 2021, a move that will improve DHS's ability to engage with tech startups that are developing these cutting-edge technologies. H.239 also includes additional accountability requirements to ensure that there is proper oversight of the authority.  Mr.Speaker, our digital borders are constantly being barraged by cybercriminals, by nation-states, and by terrorists seeking to exploit and harm innocent Almost daily, we read news stories on how these hackers are intruding into our networks and doing so with increased sophistication. One thing is for certain, we have seen that cyber intrusions and their impact on victims quickly morph and increase both in frequency and in their severity.  In 2017, these hackers will unfortunately continue to pose a great threat to the U.homeland and to our critical infrastructure. The Federal Government, therefore, needs to keep pace with these evolving threats by more actively working with the private sector to find effective solutions.  DHS's Directorate of Science and Technology is the primary research and development arm of the The directorate manages basic and applied research and development, including cybersecurity R&D, for the Department's operational components and for our first responders.  Ensuring there are mechanisms in place, like S&T's cybersecurity R&D programs and the OTA, to support the dynamic nature of cybersecurity research and development is essential for addressing homeland security capability gaps.  Thank you again, Mr.Speaker, for calling up this important bill today. I believe it will have an incredibly positive impact on encouraging technology innovation across the Nation to address our vital homeland security needs.

Mr.Speaker, again, I am pleased that the House is today considering H.240, the Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2017.  H.240 encourages engagement between the Department of Homeland Security and technology innovators, including startups. This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to proactively engage with innovative and emerging technology developers and firms to address our vital Homeland Security needs.  Additionally, H.240 provides the Secretary with the authority to identify geographic areas in the United States where high concentrations of these innovative and emerging technology developers and firms exist and to establish personnel and office space in these areas to more effectively collaborate with these technology hubs. The Federal Government certainly needs to do a better job working with the private sector, and H.240 will help to address that.  Mr.Speaker, this bill also requires the Secretary to develop and to implement a targeted strategy to proactively engage innovative and emerging technology developers and firms.                              {time}  1630  Under this bill, the Secretary must use the strategic plan to address existing barriers to leveraging innovative and emerging technologies, and the small businesses and startup ventures that create those technologies, and to incorporate them into the Department's acquisition process.  For example, in order to keep pace, the Department of Homeland Security has established an office in Silicon Valley to encourage engagement and communication with the innovative technology developers in that area. Although it is a vital technology hub, Silicon Valley certainly is not the only technology hub in the United The Department should not be limited to a single geographic area from which to identify these emerging and innovative technologies.  Mr.Speaker, all Americans are learning that cybersecurity is national security. The impacts of cyber intrusions are being felt everywhere, from boardroom tables to kitchen tables. We have seen them undermine consumer confidence and damage a company's hard-earned reputation in just a couple of seconds. Cybersecurity is a complex and serious issue that our Nation will have to address for decades to come. So it only makes sense for us to require the Department to consider strategically just how it will engage these technology developers to strengthen the Department's ability to access innovative and emerging technologies to better combat evolving cyber threats.  I am happy to support this measure today because I believe it will move us forward, further addressing our homeland security needs by supporting technology innovation.

The uninsured rate is at its lowest point in recent history. Since the implementation of the ACA in my State of Rhode Island, the uninsured rate has fallen from 12 percent to under 4.5 percent.

We cannot go back to a system that allows private insurers to deny coverage for preexisting conditions or charge more to those who need insurance the most. In fact, the Republican plan for repealing the ACA means that nearly half a million Rhode Islanders with preexisting conditions, about half the State's population, will be denied coverage or will be charged more. Again, as Senator Murray described so eloquently in the case of a young man who needs years of expensive treatment, if preexisting conditions are once again possible and if that young man is dropped from his parents' plan at 21, both of those factors will probably deny him the coverage that he enjoys today, and that is not what we want to do. I hope that is not what we want to do.  In my State, there are over 106,000 Rhode Islanders with diabetes, over 112,000 with asthma, and nearly 63,000 cancer survivors who will be forced to pay more for coverage. These are huge numbers in my State--roughly 1 million people in population. They have these conditions, and insurance companies said in the past: We won't cover[[Page S142]]you, or, by the way, you will be spending 2, 3, 5, 10 times as much for the coverage we extend to someone else.  We have also been able to improve coverage through the ACA for those who are getting their care through their employer. Before the ACA, insurance plans, including employer-sponsored health coverage, could impose annual or lifetime limits on coverage, meaning that coverage could end when it was most needed. You could have a job, and you could have insurance at a job, but if you have a serious condition, when you reach that limit, that is it--no more responsibility by the company. That is exactly the time you need the help because you have already either exhausted some of your own resources or you are in a position where you have been sick for so long that your ability to go back into the workplace is practically nonexistent. The ACA prohibits these limits, along with ensuring free preventive care and coverage of dependents up to age 26, ensuring real coverage for nearly 600,000 workers in Rhode Island with employer coverage.  There is a perception out there that the ACA doesn't apply to employer coverage and that it has no effect--that if it is repealed, it is fine because I get my health insurance from my employer. That is not the case. The impact will be there, and it could leave many people devastated.  Additionally, the ACA strengthened the rate review processes to help control premiums. Prior to the ACA, double-digit increases were always the norm. When I served in the House and in my first years in the Senate, invariably, when trade associations came to visit me, the first or second issue on the list was this: Our insurance coverage just went up 20 percent. We can't afford it anymore. We are dropping coverage or telling our workers: Do you want a raise, or do you want coverage? You can't get both.  Well, we have to do more to keep premiums under control and bring down costs, but there has been an improvement under the ACA in my State and in many other In 2 of the last 3 years, premiums actually went down from the previous year in Rhode During open enrollment for 2017, Rhode Islanders saw decreases of as much as 5 percent in their premiums. In fact, due to the ACA, consumers in Rhode Island have saved nearly $220 million since 2012, according to the State resource.  This program has done something that we were feverishly trying to do, which was to somehow bring costs under control and reduce them if we could but certainly eliminate the double-digit growth, when every year every employer group was coming in and saying: We can't afford this. We want to cover our workers, but we can't. We are giving them that choice, or we will have to sadly say we can't give you insurance anymore. Repealing the ACA would end all of these consumer protections and put insurance companies back in charge.  One other thing that it has done is that we actually required that a significant amount of the premium be used for health care, not overhead. We actually built into the law that, if you are going to charge a premium, it better go to help people get health care, not just to boost your profits, dividends, or anything else. That is another factor that has helped positively this rate and premium structure.  Then, of course, there is a huge economic impact of ACA repeal. For years I have heard my Republican colleagues very sincerely and adamantly declare that the ACA is a job killer, that it was going to destroy millions of jobs. That was one of the refrains that echoed throughout this Chamber as we were debating the ACA for months and years afterwards. But what has happened? We have had an unprecedented 75 consecutive months of job growth--something we haven't seen since 1939. Repealing the ACA would wreak havoc on this progress. Premiums for everyone, not just those in the individual market, will skyrocket. Large businesses will see their health care costs go up, which means workers will forgo pay increases as their employers struggle to simply maintain health care coverage or they will drop the coverage entirely.  We have come a long way since the economic downturn in 2008, and we have much more work to do to keep things moving in the right direction, but one of the worst things we can do for the economy is to repeal the  Rhode Island stands to lose over $7 billion in Federal funding over the next 10 years with repeal. Again, that is a staggering number in my State--$7 billion. That would be devastating for the State because they would have to step up as best they could, and frankly, they don't have the kind of resources to replace that loss. It would have an effect on hospitals and other health care providers. Hospitals in Rhode Island stand to lose nearly $2 billion in funding on top of the added expenses of emergency room care for the newly uninsured. We remember the old model of health care. The old model was that, if you didn't have insurance, you went to the emergency room. Those emergency rooms were crowded with people. They were much more expensive to treat because they were there without any previous experience with the physicians and without health records, in many cases. They had to do diagnostic tests that were not available and that are now available at the health care facilities because they have insurance. All of that would come undone. It will be a huge impact on the economy.  One of the largest employers in the State of Rhode Island is the hospital system. I don't think we are alone. If you go out into the rural parts of the United States, in many cases, the biggest employer in many counties is the health care system, the hospital system. When they can no longer make their books balance, they are going to have to start closing down operations, laying people off. That is what is going to happen. This is not farfetched. We have seen it before. We have seen struggling hospitals struggling under emergency room uncompensated care. We have seen all these things happen before. Repealing the ACA would lead to a combination of all these factors--skyrocketing premiums and the loss of Federal funding in health care for States, which would have a ripple effect throughout the country.  If Rhode Island or any other State has to step in and partially make up for the loss of Medicaid funds or any other aspect of this program, where are they taking it from? Where are they taking it from? Education, infrastructure, public safety. They will suffer. Ultimately, it is the jobs--the jobs of the people in my State and the jobs of people across the  So there are things we can do to strengthen the bill. Senator Murray was very clear about attempts we have made. She has been one of the great leaders in this effort to make improvements. We have been working on and improving Medicare since 1965, and we still have some work to do, but that was a different program. That was a program that was a bipartisan program, one that was embraced and developed and supported. In fact, one of the ironies today is some of the staunchest supporters and protectors of Medicare are Republicans, as well as Democrats, but that was a program that took several decades to work through, and we are still working through issues with respect to We are prepared to do that with the Affordable Care Act in a principled, thoughtful, practical, pragmatic way, not to score political points, but to make it a system that is more affordable, more effective, and that gives more American families a chance. Frankly, you don't have much of a chance for a good education, a good job, or a secure retirement when your health is in jeopardy and your finances are equally in jeopardy.  At this point, the Republicans have offered no plan to replace the ACA, and it is a tough task. I served on the HELP Committee as we were drafting this, and we spent over a year on this law. We spent countless moments reaching out to our colleagues on the Republican side asking: Can we make this better? What improvements can we make? We had numerous folks in the mix. It is tough work. To suggest that we can just repeal this and something will magically appear, I don't think that is particularly logical, obvious, or will happen.  Roughly, 7 years have gone by since the passage of this bill, where the Republicans have had a chance to prepare a detailed plan to replace aspects of the ACA or replace it. I don't think that plan is out there. It is certainly not being communicated.  We have to ensure--and Senator Murray was very effective in making this point--that we can improve ACA,[[Page S143]]not demolish it, that, if we get into a legislative process, we produce a better outcome for the American people, not an outcome of denial of health care and financial uncertainty and perhaps even financial ruin.  So we have to get to work. I think we are prepared to do this but in the context of something pragmatic and productive for the benefit of the American people.  Let me switch gears, just for a moment, and talk about Medicare and Medicaid because, when people talk about Medicare and Medicaid, they usually don't make an association with the They think that is something else. I can recall being in a public discussion in August of 2009, when we were discussing ACA before it became law, and something came up that was very critical about the program because they didn't want publicly funded insurance in any way, shape, or form, and I asked: Where do you get your health care?  Well, I have a private provider.  Again, I asked: Where do you get your health care?  I am on  Medicare is, as I recall, a single-payer national system of health care, a funded entitlement by the government, with some copayments by participants.  Medicare and Medicaid are effective in a significant way. We made historic improvements to these programs, enhancing benefits. Indeed, we added 9 years of solvency to the Medicare trust fund. One of the great issues that reverberates throughout this Chamber is we have to control entitlements. We have to prepare for the future. We have to make sure these social programs like Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and others are solvent. We added years of solvency to the program in the If it is repealed, subtract 9 years of solvency from the Medicare trust fund. Tell seniors and people in their fifties who are getting ready to enjoy the benefits: Just take 9 years off your expected benefits, or at least a portion of the benefits.  The ACA made a number of other improvements. They closed and are closing the doughnut hole for prescriptions, they eliminated cost sharing for cancer screenings, for example, for Medicare recipients. Over 15,000 Rhode Islanders saved $14 million on drugs in 2015. That is an average of $912 per Medicare beneficiary because of what we did with respect to the doughnut hole. In the same year, over 92,000 Rhode Islanders--huge numbers in my State--took advantage of free preventive services, representing over 76 percent of the beneficiaries. Seventy-six percent of the Medicare beneficiaries in my State took advantage of free services. Otherwise, they would have paid out of their pocket, and, frankly, many seniors don't have the resources to do that. Repealing the ACA means these benefits go away, and it shortens the trust fund by about a decade.  Repeal would also mean cutting $270 million in Federal funds to help pay for health coverage for low-income adults, children, seniors, and people with disabilities through The ACA expanded eligibility and streamlined enrollment and made it easier for the most vulnerable to access quality health care coverage. As a result, approximately 70,000 Rhode Islanders were able to access coverage for the first time through Medicaid--their previous source of health care: most times, the emergency room, if they could get there.  I want to point out a couple of things about Medicaid has become a program for our senior citizens that happens to also help struggling Seniors make up a small percentage of the Medicaid population but account for approximately half of Medicaid spending nationwide. Nearly 60 percent of nursing home residents are covered by Think about that. Sixty percent of all nursing home residents need The next time you hear someone casually suggest drastic cuts and changes to Medicaid, think about that. Those cuts will work their way back to nursing homes throughout your Those families of those seniors are not all people who have been poor and on the margins all of their lives; they are our neighbors, and they will feel it.  In Rhode Island, over 30,000 seniors access health care coverage through My colleagues across the aisle want to make drastic cuts to Make no mistake, cuts to Medicaid mean cuts to nursing home services for seniors and a return to pre-Medicaid times when the elderly had few options. In the 1950s and 1960s, before Medicare and Medicaid, your grandmother or grandfather was in your living room in a hospital bed being taken care of by typically your mother. That is the way you grew up back in the 1950s and 1960s in most middle-income neighborhoods. That was at least my experience. If you want to go back, that is what would happen, in some respects, if we repeal this law.  If Republicans want to come and work with us, we are ready--more than ready--but we can't stand by and allow them to do the damage they propose: to take away coverage from 20 million Americans and cut benefits to seniors. That is not the right direction for America and for our country.  With that, I yield the floor.

1917,topic-id,847,"Mr.President, I am reintroducing the Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act with Senator This legislation would end special tax exemptions for huge CEO bonuses by closing a glaring loophole that allows publicly traded corporations to deduct the cost of multimillion-dollar bonuses from their corporate tax bills. If executives perform, companies may compensate them however they wish, but U.taxpayers shouldn't have to subsidize these massive bonuses.  Under current tax law, when a publicly traded corporation calculates its taxable income, it is generally permitted to deduct the cost of compensation from its revenues, with limits up to $1 million for some of the firm's most senior executives. However, a loophole relating to performance-based compensation has allowed many public corporations to avoid such limits and freely deduct excessive executive compensation. To illustrate how this loophole works, if a CEO receives $1 million in cash compensation and $14 million in performance-based compensation in a given year, the public corporation's taxable income would decline by $15 million. With the current corporate tax rate at 35 percent, the corporation in this case would receive a tax giveway of $5.25 million.  The Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act puts an[[Page S207]]end to that giveaway and limits public corporations to a single $1 million per employee deduction as was originally intended. Using the same example above, a profitable public corporation could deduct $1 million of the CEO's $15 million compensation package but could not claim a deduction on the remaining $14 million. So instead of claiming $5.25 million in Federal subsidies for the CEO's pay, this public corporation will be contributing $4.9 million toward improving our roads, our schools, and our military--costs that middle-class families are already underwriting.  Indeed, over a 10-year window, the Joint Committee on Taxation, in their most recent assessment, estimated that closing this loophole would save U.taxpayers over $50 billion.  Specifically, our legislation first applies section 162(m) of the Tax Code to all employees of publicly traded corporations so that all compensation is subject to a deductibility cap of $1 million. Publicly traded corporations would still be permitted to pay their executives as much as they desire, but compensation above and beyond $1 million would no longer be subsidized by other hard-working taxpayers through our Tax  Second, our bill removes the exemption for performance-based compensation, which currently permits compensation deductions above and beyond $1 million when executives have met performance benchmarks set by the corporation's board of directors. As a result, publicly traded corporations would still be able to incentivize their executives, but all such incentives would be subject to a corporate deductibility cap of $1 million.  Finally, our legislation makes a technical correction to ensure that all publicly traded corporations that are required to provide quarterly and annual reports to their investors under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations are subject to section 162(m). Currently, this section of the Tax Code only covers some publicly traded corporations who are required to provide these periodic reports to their shareholders. Discouraging extravagant compensation packages shouldn't turn on whether a publicly traded corporation falls into one SEC reporting requirement or another, and our bill closes this technical loophole.  Even our President-elect has acknowledged the problem of excessive CEO pay. When asked about this issue on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' on September 13, 2015, then-Presidential Candidate Trump said, ``Well, it does bug me. It's very hard if you have a free enterprise system to do anything about that. The boards of companies are supposed to do it. But I know companies very well. And the CEO puts in all his friends. And so you will take a company like, I could say Macy's or many other companies, where they put in their friends as head of the company, and they get whatever they want, because the friends love sitting on the board. So that's a system that we have. And it's a shame and it's disgraceful. And, sometimes, the boards rule. But I would say it's probably less than 10 percent. And you see these guys making these enormous amounts of money. It's a total and complete joke.''  Our legislation tackles this issue head on by ending the public subsidy of excessive CEO compensation, derailing the lavish tax breaks that exclusively benefit public corporations. This is simply a matter of fairness, ensuring that corporations--and not hard-working taxpayers who face their own challenges in this economy--are paying for the multimillion-dollar bonuses they have decided to dole out to their  We need to prioritize tax breaks that grow our economy and strengthen the middle class. This bill would eliminate some of the inequity in the Tax Again, companies are free to pay their executives as much as they want, but the American taxpayer shouldn't help foot the bill for a CEO's multimillion-dollar bonus.  I thank Public Citizen, Americans for Financial Reform, the AFL-CIO, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and MIT professor Simon Johnson for their support. I also want to thank Senator Blumenthal for working with me on this issue, and I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgS206.txt,1982,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,10.0,January

They are the faces of those who paid the ultimate price serving and protecting us this past year so that our families and our children can live safe and enjoy our freedom. As you can see, freedom isn't free.  You may not know or recognize these faces, but you know the faces of others who have served or that are serving today. They are the faces of our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, and friends. Some were ambushed and executed. Some lost their lives responding to a call to save a life, someone who called for help.  Tacoma police officer Jake Gutierrez, from my home State of Washington, is one of the faces behind me. He lost his life in the line of duty just last month while trying to protect a woman from domestic violence.  Jake was supposed to have exchanged wedding vows with his fiancee in just a few weeks. Instead, she and his three daughters and granddaughter attended his funeral and tried to picture a life without  Tragically, again last month, a time meant for celebration was filled with another Washington family's sorrow. Veteran officer Mike McClaughry from the Mount Vernon Police Department was shot in the head while responding to a call for help. Today his children, wife, friends, and family sit by his hospital bed and his life now hangs in the balance in the hands of God and his doctors.  This feeling of loss is one that I am also familiar with. In 1982, my partner and best friend, Sergeant Sam Hicks, was shot to death attempting to arrest a murder suspect. He left behind his wife and five sons. That was over 30 years ago, but the loss of a loved one is a pain that cannot be forgotten, cannot be erased.  This national day of appreciation is not only a day to reflect and appreciate the service of those who have served, but those that are serving today. They are driving, walking, patrolling your neighborhoods, keeping us safe. They are ready to put their lives on the line, yes, but every day they do so much more for us that goes unnoticed:  The officer that took the stolen bike report on Christmas Day and the next day delivered a new bicycle to that little boy's home;  How about the officer who anonymously buys groceries for a needy family;  The officer who counseled a little girl who was being bullied because of the clothes she wore and then bought her a new set of clothes;  How about the officer who went to a call where he had to cradle a 2-month-old baby in his arms, giving CPR to his little, fragile blue face, hoping for the best news, fearing the worst--and getting the worst--and then headed off to his next call;  The officer that held the hand of a dying man after a motorcycle accident and then sharing his last words with his family;  The officer who was spit on, ridiculed, and insulted by a man threatening to kill the officer and his wife and then minutes later saving that same man from taking his own life with a butcher knife.  These men and women are coaches, volunteers, and mentors, helping people find jobs, feeding the homeless, helping them find homes, and sometimes even taking them into their own homes. These are real people. They are your neighbors, they are your friends, and they are us. This is not a job for them. It is a calling. They serve because they want to help. They want to make a difference. They serve with the heart of a servant.  On this day, let us take a moment to appreciate all members of the law enforcement community across this Nation and their families by putting a blue light in your window or on your front porch. This is not just a sign of appreciation for law enforcement across this country, but a sign, a small symbol of unity for us all. We need that now in our Nation more than anything. Help us remember that we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

I rise today to support this rule and to express my strong disapproval of President Obama and his administration's refusal to veto the anti-Israel resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council on December 23, 2016.  Since its establishment, Israel has worked tirelessly to forge peace with its neighbors. They have sought neither violence nor conflict. In fact, the territories discussed in the misguided U.resolution were areas Israel gained in self-defense during the 1967 Six-Day These areas include the Old City, with the Temple Mount and Western Wall, areas that, thousands of years ago, were the origin of the Israeli culture, heritage, and religion.  Israel did not seek to take this land. Rather, when threatened by their Arab neighbors in 1967, they were forced to act in self-defense and repel these attacks. Since that time, Israel has successfully reached peaceful agreements with many of the Arab countries who, at that time, sought to wipe them off the map.  Israel is the only thriving democracy in the Middle East who practices and protects human rights regardless of ethnicity, gender, religion, or citizenship. Additionally, the State of Israel has been committed to implementing initiatives to promote economic growth in the region, including creating opportunities for Palestinians and others. Israel is a shining example of taking care of those who are around them, even as they face constant threat of violence and terrorist attacks.  I have been appalled over what has taken place under the direction of President Obama and Secretary Kerry and others within the administration. In response, I also introduced a resolution condemning these intolerable actions. By failing to direct the United States to veto the one-sided, anti-Israel U.Security Council resolution, the President turned his back on Israel and, as a result, turned his back on  The anti-Israel resolution adopted by the U.Security Council threatens peace and stability in the Middle It will most likely incentivize further violence and radical boycotts.  While President Obama and Secretary Kerry's long list of foreign policy failures has been well-documented over the years, none to date have been this deliberate and calculated. That is why I have come to the floor to support Chairman Royce's bipartisan resolution.  As Republicans and Democrats alike have expressed their contempt for the President's lack of action, I look forward to working with my colleagues and President-elect Trump in correcting President Obama's anti-Israeli tactics as we work to form a stronger bond with Israel and as we work to promote peace in the Middle  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.Welch).

943,topic-id,377,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.26, the REINS This bill is the beginning of making America great again. That is because it puts Americans back in charge of the laws being imposed upon them.  How does the legislation do that?  Under our Constitution, we have three branches. The executive branch is supposed to enforce the law. The judicial branch is supposed to resolve disputes arising under the law. The legislature--this House and the Senate, the branch directly elected by the people--is supposed to make the law.  Over the last decades, we have seen more and more of the lawmaking in this country migrate to the unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch. Those bureaucrats churn out regulation after regulation that have the full force and effect of law. The problem with this setup is that the people of this country are supposed to consent to laws being imposed upon them. They do that through their elected representatives in In short, this legislation goes to the heart of what self-rule is all about.  Let me be clear: this legislation does not end regulation. It is the beginning of accountability for regulation. If there is a good regulation that a Member believes makes sense and does not unduly burden jobs and wages, that Member may vote to approve the regulation. If the people that Member represents disagree, they get to hold him or her accountable at the ballot box.  My colleagues across the aisle should not fear taking responsibility for the laws and regulations coming out of Washington, D.Over the last 7 years, Washington regulations have hurt many working families. We have seen coal miners and power plant workers lose good jobs. We have seen small, Main Street community banks and credit unions forced into mergers. We have seen farmers worried about puddles on their farms. We have seen people lose their health insurance and their doctors, and we have seen the Little Sisters of the Poor have their religious freedom threatened--all without the consent of the people.  It is time for the people, Mr.Chairman, to put the American people back in charge and not the unelected bureaucrats. Let's take the power away from Let's restore self-rule. Let's pass this bill.

1398,topic-id,214,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the late Nat Hentoff, a man who constantly defied expectations. He died this weekend on January 7.  Nat defined himself as a ``Jewish, atheist, civil libertarian, left-wing pro-lifer.'' A writer for the Village Voice and brilliant jazz critic, he joined forces with constituents across political, ideological, and religious spectrums if he believed he shared common ground with them.  He was not afraid to alienate his fellow liberals by agreeing with pro-life heretics, as he once jokingly called them, nor was he afraid to speak to crowds of Christian pro-lifers, even when many of them said being atheist and pro-life were mutually exclusive.  Rather than worry about their judgment, he cared too much about fairness and equality to remain silent. He was more concerned with expressing what he believed to be true: that the unborn have great potential and that, with their own unique genetic code, they are human persons with as much a right to life as any of us.  I commend Nat Hentoff for his courage and intellectual integrity. It is not easy in our culture to swim upstream. It takes a certain spirit, grit, and determination. These are characteristics Nat Hentoff possessed in abundance.  May he rest in peace and may his family be consoled.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgH219-3.txt,2158,MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT OF 2017,2017.0,9.0,January

612,topic-id,1822,"Mike Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming, is a friend of mine. He comes from a beautiful rural State--Icome from a beautiful rural State--That is probably the end of our commonality. We look at the world very differently,and I hope that in the course of this debate, the American people will see the very profound differences we have not only onhealth care, not only on tax policy, not only on the deficit, but on many other important issues.  What we are looking at right now is a budget process whose ultimate goal is to remove health insurance from tens of millionsof Let's be clear. Today, the United States of America is the only major country on Earth that--I live 50 miles awayfrom the Canadian border. Many of us have visited We are the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. It is something I passionately believe in. I believe that health care for all is a human right. Ihad hoped we would work together to figure out what is a complicated issue as to how we can move forward to guarantee healthcare to all people in a cost-effective way, but that is not what we are debating today.  Let's be very clear. The Republican plan--their budget plan--lays the groundwork for ending the Affordable Care Act, whichwill remove tens of millions of Americans from the health insurance they get. There is nothing wrong with change. We can alwaysimprove.  I hope that during the course of this debate, my Republican friends who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act will comedown and tell us what their plan is, how, in fact, they are going to provide quality, cost-effective health care to allWell, you know what. They all voted against the Affordable Care Senator Enzi is right--we did not get oneRepublican to vote for it. They have had 8 years to think about how they are going to come up with a new plan, and I would hopebut I do not expect one Republican to come to the floor and say: Oh yeah, we are going to throw 20, 30 million people out oftheir health insurance. This is our new plan. This is how we are going to provide health care to those people.  They have no ideas. Their theme is to repeal and then delay. Someday they are going to come up with a new plan. You don'tdestroy a house without having another house in which people can live. You don't throw 30 million people off of health carewithout having a plan to provide health care to those people.  Under the Republican proposal--something many Republicans have been talking about for years--they want to end Medicare as itpresently exists, a program that is life-and-death for millions of seniors. They want to voucherize Medicare, give people acheck, and then let them go to the private insurance market and get the best deal they can.  Imagine that you are an 85-year-old senior citizen who has been diagnosed with cancer and you get your check for whatever itmay be. We don't know what it will be--$7,000, $8,000, $9,000.[[Page S34]]You go to the insurance company and you say: I have $9,000. Iam 85. I have been diagnosed with cancer. I want you to take care of me. Give me an insurance program that will take care of mymedical needs, my hospital needs.  The insurance agent will laugh in your face because $9,000 or $8,000 will last you, at most, for 1 week.  That is their plan.  I have been all over the country, and right now the American people are outraged at the high cost of prescription drugs inthis country--let's be clear--because of the power of the pharmaceutical industry and their lobbying and their campaigncontributions--a power that exists, by the way, not only influencing Republicans but too many Democrats as well. We pay thehighest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In fact, one out of six Americans who goes to a doctor to get a prescriptionfor an illness cannot even afford to fill the prescription. Yet, under the Republican proposal, if you eliminate the AffordableCare Act, the doughnut hole fix, which now helps seniors pay for their prescription drugs, will be eliminated and prescriptiondrugs for seniors could rise by as much as 50 percent.  By the way, at a time when we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on Earth, when the veryrich are getting richer while the middle class shrinks, the Republican proposal not only throws 20 to 30 million people off ofhealth insurance, not only raises the price of prescription drugs for seniors, not only moves forward to privatize Medicare,but, shock of all shocks, our Republican colleagues want to give massive tax breaks to the top 2 percent.  Among many other negative impacts that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act will have will be one that will impact heavilyrural States, such as Wyoming, Vermont, and other rural States around this country; that is, as a result of the repeal of theAffordable Care Act, rural hospitals could be forced to close their doors--not getting the funding they need--leaving millions ofAmericans with nowhere to turn for critical medical care.  I look forward to this debate. Nobody here thinks the Affordable Care Act is perfect. Nobody believes that at all. The goalis how we repair it, how we improve it, how we expand health care to more Americans, how we end what has been the case fordecades in this country--that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world per capita for health care. Maybe we shouldunderstand that we are the only major country in the world that allows private insurance companies to profit off of people'sillness.  The proposal being brought forth by the Republicans is not only poorly thought out, it really is not popular. It is not whatthe American people want. Go to your hometowns and ask people--at a time when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as muchwealth as the bottom 90 percent, when the top 1 percent is earning 52 percent of all new income, go out and ask yourconstituents whether we should give huge tax breaks to the top 2 percent, and they don't think that is a good idea.  According to a poll released this month by POLITICO and Morning Consult, 80 percent of the American people think the FederalGovernment should be spending more money on Only 10 percent think we should be spending less. Seventy-one percent ofthe American people think we should be spending more on  So 84 percent of the American people think the Federal Government should be spending more on Social In otherwords, the proposal we are seeing from the Republicans today is way, way out of touch from where the American people are.  There is another issue out there that I find extremely interesting. Senator Enzi mentioned--and, of course, he isright--that within a couple of weeks we are going to have a new Donald Trump will be inaugurated as President, and itis interesting that we listened to what Donald Trump said during the campaign. The Democrats heard what he had to say during thecampaign, what he campaigned on, and more importantly, Republicans, listened and heard what their leader had to say about theseissues. This is what Donald Trump said, and he didn't say it once in the middle of the night. He didn't say it in an interview.This was a central part of his campaign. This is what he asked millions of elderly people and working-class people to vote forhim on. These are the principles that Donald Trump ran and won the Presidency on. On May 7, 2015, Donald Trump tweeted: ``I wasthe first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to social security, Medicare and Medicaid.'' On April8, 2015, Mr.Trump said: ``Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security.'' That is not Bernie Sanderstalking; that is Donald Trump talking.       They want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it      onMedicaid and we can't do it. It is not fair to the people      that have been paying in for years.  That is not Bernie Sanders--Donald Trump, our soon-to-be  On March 29, 2016, Mr.Trump said:       You know, Paul [Ryan]--  Paul Ryan is the Republican Speaker of the House--     wants to knock out SocialSecurity, knock it down, way down.      He wants to knock Medicare way down and frankly . . . you're      going to lose the election ifyou're going to do that. I am      not going to cut it, and I am not going to raise ages and I      am not going to do all of the thingsthey want to do, but they      want to really cut it and they want to cut it very      substantially, the Republicans, and I am going todo that.''  What Mr.Trump said was exactly right. Here are the ``they.'' This is the day. They want to cut Social They wantto cut They want to cut Mr.Trump was right, and millions of people voted for him on the belief that hewould keep his word.  Well, it seems to me that Mr.Trump right now has to do one of two things. 1, if all that he was talking about wascampaign rhetoric, then what he is obliged to do now is to tell the American people: I was lying. Yes, I said that I would notsupport cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but I was lying. It was a campaign ruse. I just said what came to mymind to get votes. I have no intention of keeping my word. If that is what he believes, if that is what the case was, let himcome forward and say that. But if that is not what the case is, if he was sincere, then I would hope that tomorrow or maybetoday he could send out a tweet and tell his Republican colleagues to stop wasting their time and all of our time and for Mr.Trump to tell the American people that he will veto any proposal that cuts Medicare, that cuts Medicaid, and that cuts What we are talking about right now--let us be clear: no debate. That is exactly what this goal is. That is what thisbudget proposal is. It is to move toward the voucherization and privatization of Medicare, to make massive cuts in Medicaid andthrow millions of people off health insurance.  So there is a lot of responsibility on Mr.Trump's shoulders, but I would hope that he could save us a whole lot of time bytelling the American people that he was sincere in what he said during the campaign, that he was not lying.

616,topic-id,581,"I want to thank my colleague for her very thoughtful presentation talking about the implications of simplyrepealing  The assumption that many of my colleagues seem to start from is that before ObamaCare, the health care system was great inAmerica, that everybody had health care in a cost-effective way and then ObamaCare came along and all of these problems arose.  What the Senator from Michigan just told us--and I want people to remember it--8 years ago, if you were diagnosed with cancerand you walked into an insurance company, they would say: Why would we give you insurance? We will lose money on you. Yourcancer may recur.  You are a woman and you want maternity coverage? What do you think is going on? Why should we do that?  You are a family with a kid who is 21 years of age and you want his insurance on your policy? Well, you couldn't have it.  I think what the Senator from Michigan pointed out is not that anyone thinks the Affordable Care Act is perfect--nobodythinks it doesn't need improvement. But to simply throw out all of the benefits, for 30 million people to be thrown off ofhealth insurance--during the budget hearings a couple of years ago that Senator Enzi chaired, I asked a question of mycolleagues when this idea came up, and I would ask it again to my good friend from What are the studies you have seenin terms of the number of people who will die when they lose their health insurance? How many thousands of people will diebecause they no longer have health insurance and they cannot go to the doctor and the hospital? The studies I have seen suggestthat many thousands of people will die. That is common sense. If you throw 30 million people off of health insurance, they aregoing to die. How do you go forward providing a death penalty to thousands of people without having any solution to it?  Further, I would add to the excellent points made by the Senator from Senator Enzi and the Senator from Texasbefore him talked about the impact of health care problems in rural areas. I come from a rural area. Michigan has large parts ofthe State that are rural. The Senators from rural areas on the Republican side have said they want to make sure theirconstituents in rural areas can see a doctor. That is certainly a modest proposal. Of course they should be able to see adoctor.  If that is the case, my Republican friends should understand what the Federation of American Hospitals and the AmericanHospital Association said about repealing the Affordable Care These are major hospital organizations. According to a veryrecent report, what they said is that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act will mean a reduction in payments to rural hospitalsof over $165 billion over a 10-year period. According to the hospital associations, rural hospitals will suffer an additionalloss of $289 billion from their inflation updates.  This is a report from the Federation of American Hospitals and the American Hospital Association, major health careinstitutions in They said in their report: ``This reversal of health coverage would represent an unprecedented publichealth crisis.'' Furthermore, they said: ``The magnitude of reductions would threaten hospitals' ability to serve patients.''  So when we talk about the needs of rural Americans, I would hope my colleagues listen to what the Federation of AmericanHospitals and the American Hospital Association have to say.

1510,topic-id,240,"Mr.President, I begin by thanking Senator He has shown a lot of courage for standing and exposing the hypocrisy of the Republican budget resolution.  Year after year, we have heard from our Republican colleagues that the United States is going broke, that we have huge deficits, that we have a $19 trillion national debt, that we have to cut Social Security, we have to cut Medicare, we have to cut Medicaid, we have to cut funding for education, we have to deal with the deficit.  As Senator Paul has indicated, if the Republican budget resolution passes, the Federal deficit would more than double over the next decade, going from $571 billion this year to over $1.3 trillion 10 years from now.  I hope all of the deficit hawks on the Republican side hear what Senator Paul has to say and support him.  I will not support him because I understand that the cuts that he is proposing are devastating to working families, to the elderly, to the children, to the sick, and to the poor. They would mean massive cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, Federal aid to education, and a variety of programs people desperately need, so I will oppose the amendment.  All of my Republican friends who talk about the deficit year after year, here is a vote you should cast.  Thank you.  The PRESIDING The time of the Senator has expired.  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS126.txt,1010,THE,2017.0,9.0,January
1880,topic-id,3544,"Mr.President, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I want to take this opportunity to make several points in opposition to the Republican side-by-side amendment and in support of the amendment that I have offered.  Like many Republican proposals, if you read the Republican amendment, it sounds good on the surface, but if you probe half an inch into it, you recognize what an incredible disaster it will be for working families of this country--nice words, but devastating impacts. So I want to talk about that.  2, I want to talk about what it will mean if, in fact, the Republicans[[Page S188]]are successful in doing what they want to do, which is repealing the Affordable Care Act--something which I, and I think virtually every Democrat, will do our best to oppose--and what it will mean to the American people if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without any alternative to replace it.  What that, in fact, will mean is throwing 30 million people off of their health insurance. Thirty million people will lose their health insurance. I have not seen any Republican studies as to how many of those people will die, but certainly many thousands of them will die because if you are sick and you don't have any money and you don't have any health insurance, you cannot get to a doctor or you cannot get to a hospital. In fact, there have been some studies suggesting that thousands of people will die, and certainly many others will become much sicker than they should be. That is what happens when you simply throw 30 million people off of health insurance and you have no alternative plan.  Nobody in the Senate thinks the Affordable Care Act is perfect, least of all me. I think it needs significant changes. Let's work together to change it. But you cannot just repeal it without any alternative.  Not only will a repeal throw 30 million people off of health insurance, it will devastate millions and millions of low- and moderate-income families by making major cuts to Medicaid, and that includes many middle-class families who use Medicaid to support payments for their parents who are in nursing homes.  If you repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, you are going to significantly increase the cost of prescription drugs for senior citizens, many of whom have a hard time right now paying for their medicine. And while you have thrown millions off of health insurance, while you make devastating cuts to Medicaid, while the repeal of the Affordable Care Act will raise the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, a repeal would do something else, which is not terribly surprising coming from It would provide $346 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent. Millions lose their health care, the costs of prescription drugs go up, middle-class families will not be able to afford nursing home care for their parents, but, importantly, from the Republican perspective, $346 billion in tax breaks will go to the top 2 percent.  Now, this is a set of priorities which I, frankly, believe the American people do not support.  Also this afternoon I want to touch on another issue that is actually even more important than the previous two, and that is, to my mind, in a Democratic society, a candidate for President--in this case Mr.Trump--cannot simply say one thing over and over again, cannot go out to the American people and make campaign promises, but the day after the election, forget about what those promises were about.  Now, here is the purpose of the Republican amendment. This is what is in front of all of us right now.       Purpose: To strengthen Social Security and Medicare without      raiding it to pay for new Government programs, like      ObamaCare, that have failed Americans by increasing premiums      and reducing affordable health care options, to reform      Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the      disabled, and to return regulation of insurance to State      governments.  That is the exact quote of the purpose of the Republican amendment that we will be voting on in a few moments. It sounds pretty good. But let us translate it into English, and let us be very clear about what these words actually mean and why this amendment should be opposed by every Member of the U. The Republicans say in their purpose that they want to ``strengthen Social Security and Medicare.'' Well, count me in. That is exactly what I want to do. But how do they propose to go about doing that? They are going to strengthen Social Security and Medicare by making devastating cuts to Social Security and That is a strange way to strengthen a program.  As we speak right now, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security--the committee that has jurisdiction over Social Security--has introduced legislation which will make devastating cuts to Social That is a very unusual way to strengthen that program.  My Republican friends will tell us that the only way we can ``strengthen Social Security'' is, in fact, to cut Social Now, talk about fake news; talk about Orwellian language. We are strengthening Social Security by cutting Social To all those seniors and disabled veterans who are out there and who are trying to get by on $13,000, $14,000, $15,000 a year in Social Security benefits, my Republican colleagues are going to ``strengthen'' Social Security and they are going to do it by cutting your benefits. That is a very strange way to strengthen Social  It seems to me that if we are serious about really strengthening Social Security, what that means in plain English--not Orwellian language--is, 1, if you want to strengthen it, we have to extend the life of Social Social Security now can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American for 17 years. That is It means we are not in a crisis, but it is not good enough. I want to see Social Security be solvent for another 50 or 60 years. That is strengthening Social  When we talk about strengthening Social Security, that means increasing benefits, not cutting benefits. The truth is that seniors in this country cannot make it on $13,000 or $14,000 a year in Social Security benefits; we need to increase and expand their benefits.  Thirdly, if we are serious about strengthening Social Security, we need to end the absurdity of seniors who this year got a COLA of three-tenths of 1 percent, and in recent years have gotten COLAs of zero percent because the formula that determines COLAs for people on Social Security is totally inadequate and an incorrect formula, not really measuring the cost-of-living expenditures of senior citizens.  That is what we have to do to strengthen Social  How do we do that? I have legislation that will do just that. But do my colleagues know what? Despite all of the talk of my Republican colleagues wanting to strengthen Social Security, we have zero Republican cosponsors on that idea.  The way we do it--a concept supported by many of the major senior organizations in this country--would eliminate the earnings cap on all taxable income above $250,000. Right now, if you make $1 million a year, $10 million a year, you contribute the same amount into the Social Security trust fund as somebody who makes about $118,000. That is wrong. That is unfair. Lifting that cap, starting at $250,000 and above, would impact only the top 1.5 percent. If we do that, we can extend the life of Social Security for well over 50 years and we could expand benefits for people living on less than $16,000 a year by more than $1,300 a year. That is how we strengthen Social But I have not heard one Republican in this body speak in support of that proposal.  Now, Republicans say they want to strengthen Medicare without raiding it to pay for new government programs like That is what they state in their purpose. So let me be absolutely clear. That is a totally false statement. It is not true. The so-called raid was an effort to save some $700 billion over a 10-year period by making Medicare more efficient and more cost effective.  My Republican friends talk every day about the need to bring increased efficiencies into government programs. They are right. We need to do that. And that is precisely what the Obama administration did. My Republican friends will not get up here and tell us that there was one nickel of Medicare benefits cut as a result of the creation of the Affordable Care There was not one nickel of benefits cut. They know it. I know it. They will not say otherwise.  So the $700 billion was in savings, doing the right thing--not cutting a nickel of benefits from I hope my Republican colleagues will not continue to try to spread this mistruth.  The Republican amendment that we are going to be voting on talks about reforming Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the disabled. It sounds good. What are they talking about in real English? What they want to do is ``reform'' Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the disabled. What does that[[Page S189]]mean? It means not only do they not want to see Medicaid expanded, as over 30 States have done, what they want to do, and what this language is really about, is to throw millions of people off of We are the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. Some 28 million Americans today have no health insurance. They want to throw millions more off health insurance.  So if you are an ``able-bodied'' adult making the Federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour--which, by the way, they don't want to raise. Vermont has raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour. I don't know what it is in Wyoming--$7.25. But if you are in a State where minimum wage is still $7.25 and you are able-bodied, do the arithmetic. If you have a couple of kids, health insurance will cost you $10,000, $15,000 a year. How do you afford that when you are making $8, $9, $10 an hour? You don't afford it. That is able-bodied.  The last I heard, it is not criminal activity to be working and making $8, $9, $10 an hour. Unfortunately, that is what millions of people do. They cannot afford health insurance. What many of us have tried to do is expand Medicaid so that they will get health insurance, but what the Republican proposal and their language is about is the denying health insurance for the so-called able-bodied. Let's get rid of the word ``able-bodied.'' Let's talk about working people at starvation wages who cannot afford health insurance. That is what that language means in  The Republican's proposal we will be voting on also talks about ``returning regulation of insurance to State governments.'' It sounds good. What does that mean in the real world? That means you could be denied coverage for a preexisting condition.  I just met a woman last night dying of breast cancer. That is her reality, but she was able to get health insurance, despite having a very severe situation, because we abolished the insurance companies' ability to say no to her and to millions of other people who have preexisting conditions.  When you want to return regulation of insurance to State governments, that is precisely what they can do--the law is gone. The insurance companies can say: You have cancer; we are not going to cover you because you are going to cost us too much money, and we can't make any money from you. Insurance companies could refuse to cover needed things like maternity care, prescription drugs, or high-cost diseases like HIV and many others. That is what they mean when they talk about returning regulation of insurance to State governments, doing away with all of the patient protection we have passed here in Washington that is widely supported by the American people. Go out to Wyoming, go to Vermont, go to Oregon, go to any State and ask the people if we should repeal preexisting conditions so insurance companies can discriminate against people with illness, and they will tell you overwhelmingly no.  So the Republican proposal, which sounds nice, is in fact a devastating amendment that would very negatively impact many millions of people. I hope every Member of the Senate will reject that Republican amendment and in fact vote for an amendment I will be offering which addresses two very important issues:  1, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, at a time when a tiny sliver of our population--the people on top--are getting phenomenally wealthy, phenomenally richer, we have an explosion of billionaires in recent years while the middle class continues to shrink. At a time when we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care as a right to all of our people, it would be absolutely unacceptable to take away health insurance from 30 million Americans, unacceptable to privatize Medicare, unacceptable to slash Medicaid, unacceptable to increase the costs of prescription drugs for seniors, unacceptable to defund Planned Parenthood--a high-quality health care organization providing health care to over 2 million Americans, many of whom are low income women. So a vote for the Sanders amendment rejects all of those very bad ideas.  If we throw 30 million people off health insurance and if we do not have a plan to replace it, I would hope my Republican colleagues would have the decency to tell us how many of those 30 million people will die. If we are going to be considering this legislation and throwing 30 million people off who can no longer get to a doctor, can no longer get to the hospital because they don't have the money, how many of them will die? Tell us. Tell us so we can hold that in consideration as we look at this proposal.  For years, it is no secret Republican leaders like Paul Ryan and Congressman Tom Price have wanted to end Medicare as we know it. That is what they have told us. It is not what I am saying. It is not a great secret.  What does that mean? What does it mean if we end Medicare as we know it and if we turn it into a voucher program, handing a 65-year-old senior who has been diagnosed with cancer an $8,000 check and telling them to go out to a private insurance company and buy insurance on their own. That is what privatizing Medicare is about. It is a voucher program. Here is a check. You go out to the private insurance companies. You do your best.  If you are an 80-year-old suffering with cancer and you have a check for whatever it may be--$8,000, $9,000 a year--and you go to an insurance company and you say: What do I get for my $8,000 check, they will laugh at you. They will laugh at you because they understand the cost of your care--your hospital care, your prescription drugs--will go well beyond 8,000 in the first week, let alone year. You will get nothing. That is what the Republican idea is in terms of privatizing  Let me get to the last point I want to make, and that gets well beyond the Affordable Care Act and well beyond Medicaid, Medicare, and Social It gets to the essence of what our political system is supposed to be about, and that is, if we run for office--and every person in the Senate has run for office. If you run for President, you cannot say over and over again that you are going to do this, and the day after the election decide you are not going to do it. That is why so many people in this country are disgusted with the political process. They see people saying: Hey, vote for me. I am going to do A, B, and C, and the day after the election you do the very opposite, D, E, and  When he ran for President, Donald Trump ran a very unconventional campaign. That is for sure. He said: I am not a typical That is what he said. He said: If I am elected President, I, Donald Trump, am not going to cut Social Security, I am not going to cut Medicare, and I am not going to cut He didn't say that once. He wasn't caught in an ambush interview. That was the heart and soul of his campaign. That is what he said to the elderly and to working-class Americans, and many voted for him precisely because he said he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and  On May 7, 2015, Mr.Trump tweeted: ``I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.''  April 18, 2015, Trump said:       Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social      They want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it      on Medicaid, and we can't do it. And it's not fair to the      people that have been paying in for years. Now, all of a      sudden they want to cut it.  August 10, 2015, Trump said:       I will save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without      cuts.  Without cuts.       We have to do it. People have been paying in for years and      now many of these candidates want to cut it.  March 29, 2016, Trump said:       You know, Paul [Ryan]--  Paul Ryan is, as we all know, the Speaker of the House--     wants to knock out Social Security, knock it way down. . . .      . He wants to knock Medicare way down.  Two things. You will lose the election if you are going to do that. I am not going to cut it, and I am not going to raise ages, and I am not going to do all the things that they want to do. Welcome to ``they.'' That is what the Republicans are trying to do.  Back to the quote:       But they want to really cut it, and they want to cut it      very substantially--the Republicans--and I am not going to do      that.  That is where we are today. Republicans have a proposal which will make[[Page S190]]devastating cuts to Social Security over in the House, and here by repealing the Affordable Care Act, they are going to cut Medicare and  In December of 2011, Trump wrote:       Now, I know there are some Republicans who would be just      fine with allowing Social Security and Medicare to wither and      die on the vine. The way they see it, Social Security and      Medicaid are wasteful entitlement programs. But people who      think this way need to rethink their position. It's not      unreasonable for people who paid in to a system for decades      to expect to get their money's worth. That's not an      entitlement. That's honoring a deal. We as a society must      also make an ironclad commitment to providing a safety net      for those who can't make one for themselves.  On May 21, 2015, Trump tweeted:       I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know      where to get the money from. Nobody else does.  On and on and on. These are just some of the quotes. This is not like a statement in the middle of the night. This is what he campaigned on.  What this amendment is about and says to my Democratic colleagues and says to my Republican colleagues is, do we hold and support the process in which a candidate runs for office and over and over and over again tells working families and the elderly he will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid--do we hold him to his word or do we just say: Hey, that is just campaign rhetoric. He lied. That is That is politics in It doesn't matter what he said. This is the reality. We are going to cut Social Security, Medicare, and  So this amendment tells us that if we go forward with what the Republicans want to do, it will be devastating to the American people, but perhaps, more importantly, what this amendment says is that in a democratic society, we must have faith with the American people. You cannot run a campaign, make promises, and the day after forget about everything you said.  I would hope very much that my Republican colleagues will join all of us on this side in supporting what democracy is supposed to be about. We have differences of opinions. Mr.Enzi and I disagree on a lot of things, but I have never suggested that Mr.Enzi--when he campaigns, I believe he says what he believes. People vote for him or they vote against him. It is called democracy. Now you have a situation where a candidate for President goes to the working class and says: I will not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Let us tell Mr.Trump: Let us keep faith with the American people. We heard what you said, and we are going to hold you to your word. Let us support the Sanders amendment.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1071,topic-id,1195,"Mr.Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about a bill that Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and I have that we will be offering tomorrow. I think it is an important bill from the standpoint of advancing and perpetuating this American notion called freedom. It is a bill that had 130 sponsors in the last I am joined on the bill by Tom Emmer and Mr.Poe and Mr.Amash as original cosponsors as we drop the bill tomorrow. It is quite simply entitled the Freedom to Travel to Cuba bill. It does what the name suggests, to lift the current restrictions in encumbering Americans' ability to travel to  Why is that important?  I think it is important for a number of different reasons, first of which is tied to the basic, fundamental notion of American liberty. American liberty is built of many different things. The Supreme Court has actually determined that as real as what you choose to wear, what you choose to eat, or what you choose to read is this basic, fundamental right to travel.  In the American system, we can travel as we see fit. I can go here, I can go there. I am going to visit my grandmother in Des Moines, my cousin in We choose without government control and without government edict where we come and where we go. It is a far cry from what we saw in the former Soviet Union where you had to have your papers to determine where you could travel.  I have a map of the globe here. Did you know that you or I could travel to any country on this globe except one? You or I could travel to North You or I could travel to You or I could travel to You or I could travel to It may not work out well for you, it may not be the best of trips, but you or I could travel without government prohibition to any spot on this globe except one, and that one is  That may have made sense in 1960. For security reasons in the time of the cold war, it may have made sense to have that prohibition in place. But the question is: Does it make sense today? I don't think it does for a whole variety of reasons.  One, this is about the basic, fundamental American right of travel as we see fit, not as government sees fit.  Two, this is about the American liberty and this fragile notion of, if we don't protect it, government tends to grow. Jefferson talked about this theme a long time ago. He talked about the normal course of things for government to gain ground and for government to yield. So if we don't push back--and this is what the REINS Act was all about--if we don't push back about the government edict or laws that have outgrown their usefulness, what we are doing is we are allowing government to encroach on this fragile notion of liberty.  Fundamental to the notion of common sense is, if you tried something for 50 years and it has not worked, may we not try something different? I was here in the 1990s. I signed onto Helms-But it didn't work, and so we asked: Why not try something different?  What Ronald Reagan proposed at the time of the Iron Curtain was for Americans, kids with backpacks, to travel on the other side of that curtain. That personal diplomacy, that one-on-one diplomacy, would be key in bringing down that wall. That was the notion of engagement.  So I think this is about saying American policy has been the excuse that the Castros have used for 50 years. We have almost the longest-serving dictatorship in the history of globe there with the Castro brothers. What was oftentimes the case is they would blame the blockade, the embargo, Americans' inability to travel, whatever was going wrong with the country rather than simply addressing the real issue. The problem was communism and the way that it encumbers people and their hopes and their dreams. We gave them an excuse. So this is about pulling back the excuse and trying something different. It is about pushing back on a regulation that has not served its purpose.  Three, this is about engaging because that is part and parcel to American liberty. You know, I don't like some of the things that are going on in I don't like some of the things that are going on in I don't like some of the things that are going on in You can pick your country. But what we have chosen, as an American policy, is this notion of engagement, that we ultimately are going to be able to solve more by engaging with other countries. Again, that is why Ronald Reagan embraced it with countries of the former Soviet Union in helping to bring down that wall. So this is about[[Page H176]]perpetuating the notion of engagement and government regulation.  We have just passed the REINS Act, which is all about saying if something isn't making sense, let's peel it back. Let's not have the fourth branch of government going out and perpetuating all kinds of regulations without them going through Yet, with regard to travel to Cuba, you have to sign an affidavit as to why you are going there. You have to keep receipts for up to 5 years proving where you did or didn't spend money. If you fill out a form wrong, you can be subject to a $250,000 fine. Is that kind of regulation consistent with free travel that we all should enjoy as Americans?  Finally, I think that this bill is about bringing about change to My interest is not primarily about My interest is about American liberty and the need to perpetuate American liberty.  But one of the offshoots, one of the benefits is about bringing change to Even the worst detractor of the bill, we are all about the same thing, which is bringing more freedom to that country and the 11 million people that make up that country.  I think that allowing Americans to go there and to tell folks about what you are hearing from your state-run radio station or television station is not the truth, here is what is really going on. It is part and parcel to bringing about a change in It is part and parcel to eliminating the excuses that have been used by the communist regime there. It is continuing the theme of engagement that we have employed for more than 100 years. And most all, it is part and parcel to maintain this fragile notion of American liberty which always needs to be protected.                              {time}  2030  If something has encroached upon American liberty, it is not about a tangible result in the here and the now. It needs to be pushed back. So, fundamentally, this bill is about those five different things. It is for that reason I would ask that viewers talk to their House or Senate Member and ask them to sign on to this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH175-3.txt,91,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued",2017.0,5.0,January

1528,topic-id,1253,"Mr.President, I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut for his leadership on this and so many other issues on behalf of the people of his home  Before I get into prevention as a policy issue, I just want to reiterate a process point.  Here we are in the world's greatest deliberative body--the world's greatest deliberative body--and there really are so many talented individuals who come from county counsels, who come from State assemblies, who come from State senates, who come from the U.House, and find themselves in the U.Senate, the world's greatest deliberative body. And here we are debating one of the biggest public policy issues over the last decade, arguably over the last generation. Here we are.  I am thinking about my early days in the Hawaii legislature and what we would do. If we wanted to move a bill along but we weren't sure exactly what to do, we would flaw the effective date because we knew the language didn't work yet, but we wanted to take it to conference committee. We didn't want it to be enacted into law, but we wanted it to move through the process. So what we would do is we would flaw the effective date. We would say ``Effective year 2100,'' so that even if it were accidentally enacted into law, it wouldn't have the force of law.  Yet once in a while, a staffer or a member would make a clerical error and actually enact something with a delayed effective date into law, and they were humiliated. This was a mistake. This was a clerical error, and this showed that it was amateur hour. This showed that somebody didn't know what they were doing. This showed that somebody wasn't a very serious legislator.  Yet here we are in the Nation's legislature, here we are in the world's greatest deliberative body, and we are doing that on purpose. We are doing that right away. We are doing this with the Affordable Care Act after 7 years of blasting this law because they know they can't repeal the parts that are popular. So what they are going to do is eviscerate the revenue attached to the bill and leave themselves, as one of my colleagues said, in a ``box canyon'' so the only thing they can do is shovel money to insurance companies--borrowed money--to maintain the benefit because they don't want to deal with the political ramifications of what they had done to their constituents on preexisting conditions, on coverage for people up to the age of 26, on prevention.  This is the most unserious effort I have seen in this legislative body. This is absolutely unserious. And whatever your political persuasion is, you should ask every Member of the Senate to stand up and be counted and say what they want to do about health care in the United  The answer can no longer be because it is an article of faith that because the Affordable Care Act has ``Obama'' in its name--it is ObamaCare--it must be bad, and it must be repealed root and branch. That is no longer acceptable.  This President is only President for another 10 days, and we have an obligation to our constituents to say what we are going to do about this law. We all know that we should get a regular check-up from our doctor, eat fruits and vegetables, and exercise as much as possible, as difficult as it is for all of us at times. Why do we do this? Any doctor will tell you that it is better to stay healthy and prevent disease than to get sick. It is not just common sense. It is not only less painful for people, but it is less costly to prevent illness than to treat it.  The same is true for public health. If we can prevent drunk driving or the spread of diseases such as Zika, we could save lives and save the public money. That is why Senator Cassidy and I introduced the Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act last Our bill, on a bipartisan basis, recognized, basically, that we should be able to respond quickly to public health threats before they spread and harm more Americans and cost more money.  That is what the ACA does through its Prevention and Public Health The fund serves a very important dual purpose, investing Federal dollars in effective programs that prevent disease and also it saves money.  It is a simple concept. We should stop diseases from developing or spreading before they start. This sounds like common sense to almost everybody, but here is the problem. In the partisan battle around the ACA, even a really good idea within the Affordable Care Act must be bad because it is part of This is insane.  This is the Prevention and Public Health Fund that provides money to the Centers for Disease The CDC did an incredible job with the U.Public Health Service, with the U.military in addressing the Ebola crisis. The CDC did an incredible job, again, with the National Institutes of Health and others in addressing the potential Zika crisis, which looks to have abated. The CDC does incredibly important work in tobacco prevention and cessation, and this Prevention and Public Health Fund has gotten 1.8 million individual smokers to call and try to quit smoking. That is hundreds of thousands of lives saved, not just in blue or purple States but all across the country. This Prevention and Public Health Fund helps our elderly to avoid falls. It helps our elderly to avoid falls. I know there are people of goodwill on both sides of the aisle. I know that we are all responsive to our senior citizens in our individual communities, and I know that this is a smart and humane use of public health money. If we can prevent an elderly citizen from falling in their own home or falling on the way to a bus stop or to church or to a family member's home, that is money well spent, not just morally but fiscally.  This is my great regret when it comes to the Affordable Care Act and the debate that is happening. The only time I hear a serious-minded, good-faith debate between a Republican and a Democrat in the Senate when it comes to the Affordable Care Act is in private, because if you look at this side of the Chamber, there is only one Member of the Republican caucus who is here. We are not having the world's greatest deliberative body deliberate over the Affordable Care We have an empty Chamber, full of Republicans who are absolutely bound and determined to walk off this cliff and take 22 million Americans with them.  Public health prevention works. Public health prevention is fiscally prudent, and it is the humane thing to do. That is just one of the many attributes[[Page S151]]of the Affordable Care Act that ought to be preserved.  If there is to be a good faith conversation about how to improve upon the Affordable Care Act, we are all ears. I can guarantee you that there are 48 of us who want to have that conversation, but do not put the whole country into this box canyon. Excuse me for mixing my metaphors. Do not take the whole country off this cliff because it is going to be very, very difficult for us to make good policy after that.

1567,topic-id,2150,"Mr.President, I want to thank the junior Senator from Connecticut for his leadership on Since we arrived in the Senate together, he has been stalwart, not just on the many benefits of ACA but specifically on mental health and the benefits and the destigmatization of mental health care in the context of  It wasn't so long ago that people wouldn't step up and say: I need help. I need mental health care. But now I think it is broadly accepted on both sides of the aisle, partly because of Chris Murphy's leadership, that mental health is health and that just as if you tweak your shoulder or need something with your lungs or have a crick in your neck, if you have some mental health issues, you need to get them taken care of.  The plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no replacement reminds me of a car I used to have. It was an OK car. I remember I bought it in 2006. It was a 2005, but it was new--one of those in the back of the lot. I got it for $2,500 less than It was a station wagon. It was ugly. It was purple, and I just sort of rode it into the ground. I kept driving it. I didn't take great care of it. I have gotten better about taking care of my cars. At the time I just rode it and rode it. The AC busted, and I didn't fix it. There was a fender bender, and I didn't fix that. The car was It needed some TLC, but it got me around. What if I had taken this car to Jiffy Lube in Honolulu just to get a little tuneup and left it, and then I came back an hour later and it had been dismantled? That is what the Republicans are doing with the Affordable Care Instead of fixing what is wrong and keeping what is working, they are going to destroy the American health care system.  I try very hard not to be too apocryphal with my language. I try very hard not to be too nasty and too partisan on this floor, but this is factual. They are going to destroy the American health care system. That is what repeal and replace is all about. They are going to remove a law from the books and come up with something terrific in a few months or a few years, but they are also going to keep the stuff you like.  Here is the first thing that everybody across the country needs to know about this process. It is not on the level. There is no way around it. This is just not on the level. Anybody who has spent any time thinking about health care policy knows that covering people with preexisting conditions like cancer, mental illness, and diabetes is a popular thing to do. It is the right thing to do. People also know that the only way to do that is to create a risk pool that includes healthy people. If you are going to insure folks, you can't just be paying out for the expensive cases; you also have to be bringing in revenue and not paying out, so you need young people in the risk pool. You need professionals in the risk pool. You need nonsick people in the risk pool. That is how this all works. Everybody understands that.  Everybody who is working on this in good faith understands that you need to create a risk pool in order to cover more people. So they know that if they eliminate the individual mandate, they eliminate the benefit, but they are stuck with a promise they made to repeal this law totally, root and branch--not to improve upon the law.  Just remember that it was an article of faith that we couldn't make even the most modest improvements to this law at any point in the last 6 or 7 years; that if you did so, you ran afoul of Republican orthodoxy. It is not that they wanted to fix the law. It is that they had told everybody it was so bad--partly because it was ObamaCare--that there was nothing good in it; there was nothing worth preserving about the Affordable Care  Now they are into repeal and replace. They are stuck with the promise they made to repeal this law totally, and they know people are about to be very, very angry because President Obama is the President only for another 10 days, and people are not going to accept the premise that we are going to rip health care out from under you, but don't you hate health care because it is called ObamaCare? That is an argument that may have worked 3, 4, or 5 years ago, but with a new President-elect and a new Congress, we have an obligation to have a better strategy than that.  Republicans do not have a replacement plan. If they had one, they would be adopting it shortly. It has been 7 years. It has been 7 years, and we haven't seen any legislative language--none. They have no plan at all for American health care other than to cause immediate harm and to try to blame it on the law that they are repealing.  There are only a few ways this could end up. I will give you a couple of them. First there could be the equivalent of a health care cliff, which is similar to what we have done with our fiscal situation where they have to periodically shovel money at the problem[[Page S178]]and bail out the insurance companies. What will happen is they are basically eviscerating the revenue that provides the subsidies for individuals, but they are going to realize: Hey, these subsidies are quite popular, but we just eliminated the revenue. We don't want to increase taxes so let's borrow money and keep shoveling money at the insurance companies or they may make minor reforms in the ACA and call it a replacement. That would be great. I do not see that they are on this path right now or they are really going to repeal the law and take health care coverage away from millions of This is completely irresponsible.  So what happens when they repeal ACA? Twenty-two million people will have their health care coverage ripped away from them, more than 22 million men, women, and children. For those of you who still have coverage, I want you to know that this impacts you too. If you have a preexisting condition as common as diabetes or high blood pressure or mental health issues or cancer or Crohn's disease or Lupus or in a lot of instances pregnancy is a preexisting condition, you are not going to be able to keep your coverage.  If you are a woman, you are likely going to lose access to preventive health care services like birth control. If you live in a rural area--everybody in rural America should understand this.  There is this thought that there are rural States and nonrural Every State is both a rural State and a nonrural I know the Presiding Officer has an urban area and plenty of rural areas. I have one of the densest cities in the United States, and then I have far-flung, very small towns that are old plantations. Everybody in the Senate represents rural America in some form or fashion.  If you live in a rural area, chances are that your local hospital will lose millions of dollars in funding, which will force many rural hospitals to turn away patients and close their doors. This is not an exaggeration. I encourage every Republican Member of the Senate, Member of the House, citizen out there to ask their health care leaders in rural hospitals what is about to happen. They are in a panic.  Let's be totally clear about what this means. You lose rural hospital money and you lose rural hospitals. For a lot of small towns, from Hawaii to the Dakotas, to the Carolinas, and everywhere in between, the rural hospital is the economic center of the community. It is often by far the largest employer. I want you to understand, if a rural community loses its rural hospital, a lot of the working-age folks leave. They move to a more urban area.  What happens is, the elderly citizens also have to leave because if you need access to emergency services but you are nowhere near any of that care, you are going to have to go too. So there is not a single thing we can do in the Congress that would harm rural communities quicker than what is being done this week by the  I want to be really clear about how much harm is about to be done to rural communities, not just rural health care providers, not just nurses and doctors and technicians and admins and janitors and everybody who works at those rural hospitals.  That is important because in a lot of instances, that is the economic driver of a small town. It is also about, people start to make choices with their own life and with their own planning, especially as they get older, and they think to themselves: How do I stay close to health care? If that rural hospital goes away, that rural town goes away.  We have seen it in That is why we fight for Molokai Community That is why we fight for Lanai Community That is why we fight for Waianae Coast Comprehensive Treatment That is why everybody fights so hard for their community rural hospitals--because it is the center of a community, not just economically, but without it, you basically have no community.  All of this will cause the entire insurance market to unravel, raising costs for everyone. This means families are going to pay more for prescription drugs, pay more on their premiums, and pay more for out-of-pocket costs.  So if the Republicans are still unfazed by the health impacts of the repeal I just outlined, and have been outlining for the last 4 or 5 hours, over the last 3 or 4 days, there is another reason to be extremely cautious about what is about to happen. As we know, the vehicle for this is a budget resolution, right? They are trying to characterize this as, no, it is not a budget resolution.  The only reason they are doing it as a budget vehicle is so they can do reconciliation. What does that mean? That means they only need 51 votes, where otherwise they would need 60 votes, but this is a budget. If it were not a budget, they would not be subject to the 51-vote threshold. This is the Federal budget. This Federal budget increases the deficit by trillions of dollars.  This Federal budget increases the deficit by trillions of dollars--not trillions of dollars at a flat line with the previous Federal budget, this is trillions of dollars more than last year's Federal budget.  So if you are a fiscal hawk, gosh, you must be swallowing hard over the next couple of days. This must be a bitter pill to swallow because on the one hand, boy, do you hate On the other hand, boy, do you hate running up the national deficit--not the debt, deficit--by trillions of dollars. This is insane. This deficit--what we are doing to the debt and deficit in the next 2 or 3 days makes everything that we have done in the last 3 or 4 years pale in comparison.  If you are a fiscal hawk, I cannot see how you get to yes on this. You cannot vote to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars and then still call yourself a fiscal hawk. So we have a choice in front of us. Do we build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act or do we strip millions of Americans of their health care coverage, leave those with preexisting conditions out in the cold, and raise the national debt?  We know ACA has its flaws. No one ever said it was perfect. Let us be clear. Every major piece of legislation, every signature piece of legislation that this body has ever passed has been flawed in some way. What do we do when we are a functioning world's greatest deliberative body? We iterate it. We work on a bipartisan basis to fix it. That is what we should do.  The benefits of ACA are undeniable. That is what we should be debating, improvements to the ACA, not an implosion. So let's keep our eye on the ball and remember what our common goal is: giving every American the opportunity to get quality, affordable health care they deserve.  I yield the floor.

1677,topic-id,331,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups or the HALOS  I was proud to have introduced this bill with Representative Chabot during the 113th Congress and have been pleased to see this commonsense legislation continue to gain bipartisan support. I want to thank Representatives Chabot and Sinema for continuing to advocate for this important legislation.  Small businesses and startup companies are tremendous assets and sources of economic growth for our country. Economists have shown that when the economy is healthy, startups and young, fast-growing firms are the fundamental drivers of job creation. But to succeed, innovative entrepreneurs with ideas need access to capital. These investments give new companies the resources to take their idea from concept to startup to success.  Congress should support this process and pass legislation that makes it easier for accredited investors to find creative, aspiring entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, certain legislation has had the unintended consequence of often making it more difficult for entrepreneurs and inventors to meet investors and access critical investment capital.  The JOBS Act of 2012 has placed additional restrictions on individuals who want to invest in startups. This has adversely affected programs where young companies demonstrate their products and meet potential investors and mentors, and the legislation has curtailed startups' access to individual or angel investors and angel groups.  During my more than two decades of business experience, I saw firsthand how angel investors often provide more than just funding for young companies. They offer wisdom, advice, and guidance as small businesses seek to grow. The HALOS Act would reopen the path for innovative individuals and young companies to more easily connect with angel investors, while still maintaining important investor protections.  This bill will help small businesses better access the resources they need to thrive and ultimately create jobs, ensuring the United States remains the best place in the world to start and grow a new business.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

435,topic-id,3189,"Mr.President, first, I want to thank my friend the majority leader. As this is the first time offering opening remarks with the Republican leader, I will speak a little longer than he did today. After all, it is my first speech.  I want to start by extending my sincerest wish to him that we be able to work together to get things done for the American people. The Republican leader is my friend. He is also a great believer and defender of the Senate and the important role it must play in our national life and around the world. I look forward to working with him to[[Page S8]]preserve that legacy. Coming from the swearing-in ceremony, as we just did, I thank the people of my home State of New York for entrusting me with the most sacred obligation to represent them, to be their voice in the United States It has been the honor of my life to serve them, to use what ability I have been given on their behalf, to endeavor to make their lives and the lives of their fellow Americans better, safer, more prosperous, and more free.  I could never have done this job I love if not for my family, my wife Iris and two beautiful daughters, Jessica and Allison, my parents, age 93 and 88, Abe and Selma, who came down from New York for this occasion, and my new son-in-law They support me. They keep me going through the good times and the bad and, maybe most importantly, they tell me when I am wrong. They are my rock and the light of my life.  I would also like to acknowledge, in this my first speech as Democratic leader, that I am honored and humbled by my caucus for the trust they placed in me to lead them in this new We are like a second family. We watch each other's backs, we seek unity, and like a family, while we at times may have disagreements, we always move forward together. We are a big, diverse group from all walks of life and political perspectives, from all corners of this great country, but at the end of the day, we are family. To have earned their trust and support means the world, and I will try every day to deserve it.  To my staff, another second family of mine, thank you. Most of them are working, I guess. They are not here anymore. There are so many hard-working, dedicated, and brilliant men and women who over the years have put their shoulders to the wheel to help New York, this country, and me. There are too many to name. I wish I could name them all, but I must mention two, Mike Lynch and Martin Brennan, who have been with me since the 1998 campaign, the twin pillars of my office. Whatever success I have had in my campaigns, it can be traced back to them. So I thank them and all of my staff, past and present, from the bottom of my heart.  Finally, although he is no longer a Member of this esteemed body, I salute the outgoing leader, my predecessor, mentor, and friend for life, Harry Thank you.  Now is a time to look forward. We Democrats lost the election. It is a result many of us did not expect. It was a result none of us hoped for. When you lose an election like this, you can't flinch, you can't blink. You have to look it right in the eye, analyze it, learn from it and, most importantly, make corrections and move forward. It is easy to blame the results and elections on outside forces, and it is true that any one of them or a few in combination could have been responsible for the outcome of an election which the Democrat candidate won by nearly 3 million votes but lost by slim margins in a few States that decided the electoral college.  It is easy to look back and place blame, but now is the time to look forward. I believe the Democrats must take a hard look at what we can do better. It is clear that many Americans felt the economy was rigged against them and that their government wasn't looking out for them. It was too beholden to Big Money and special interests. Democrats did not do enough to show American workers we are the party that has their backs, that our positions are much more in line with their needs than the Republican positions, and so, as we look to this new Congress and a new Presidency, Senate Democrats will once again recommit ourselves to a set of principles that has always been at the core of our party, what my beloved friend and mentor Senator Ted Kennedy called economic justice. It is what our party has stood for since the days of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson through FDR, whose enduring New Deal is now almost a century old. It has been reaffirmed and deepened by passionate advocates like Susan Anthony, Cesar Chavez, and Martin Luther King, Jr., a commitment to the common man, to economic fairness for the American worker, to opportunity and prosperity for the American middle class and those trying to get there.  What is needed from we Democrats is a bigger, bolder, sharper-edged economic program that addresses how those struggling to stay in the middle class can stay there and those struggling to make it into the middle class can get there more easily and deals directly with the unfairness so many see and experience in our economic system. That is a mission that unites our caucus, from my friend from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, to my friend from Vermont, Senator Sanders, and one that appeals to the blue-collar worker in West Virginia and Michigan just as deeply as the college student from Los Angeles who is struggling with student debt. It appeals to the factory worker in the heartland just as much as to the immigrant family in New York City and the single mom in Cleveland trying to make ends meet on minimum wage.  There are a great many things we Democrats would like to do in the Senate to help these people, to ease the burden on the middle class and those struggling to make it--creating more jobs by investing in infrastructure and education, science and medicine, making college more affordable, increasing the minimum wage, changing our trade laws and so much more.  We will be making proposals we hope our Republican colleagues will join us on. As the year wears on, and it becomes clear that Democratic proposals are what the American people want and need, I hope many will. But we are not in the majority. Therefore, we cannot delude anyone that this Congress will start tomorrow taking up priorities of the Democratic minority. But we can raise our voices to present an alternative way forward, and we can rally the American people to support this program.  As Republicans return majorities to both Houses of Congress and we prepare for a Republican in the White House, the Democratic minority in the Senate has a very important task ahead of it.  There are those who suggest our baseline posture should be to work with the President-elect and have him pass his whole agenda, but it is not our job to be a rubberstamp. It is our job to do what is best for the American people, the middle class, and those struggling to get there. For instance, if the President-elect proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure and trade and closing the carried interest loophole, we will work in good faith to perfect and potentially enact it, but when he doesn't, we will resist. What we will always do is hold the President-elect and his Republican colleagues in Congress accountable--accountable to the working people to whom the President-elect promised so much; accountable to the people of all colors, creeds and sexual orientations in this country for whom he is President; accountable to the millions of Americans who voted for him even though many of the Republican policies he now, postelection, seems to be embracing are inimical to their interests; and perhaps most importantly, accountable to the law.  The Senate has a rich, bipartisan tradition of being a constitutional check on Presidents of both parties. Many in this body have long observed that in America we are a nation of laws, not men. That sacred constitutional duty of holding the President accountable to the law must continue, and Democrats will make sure of it. Sometimes it will mean pointing out where rhetoric and reality diverge, and sometimes it will mean resisting the President and Republicans in Congress when they propose legislation that we believe will hurt the American people. This will be an accountable Congress, and we will be a caucus that makes sure the President-elect keeps his commitment to truly make America great again in its finest sense and tradition.  We know what makes America great, a fundamental optimism, a belief that the future will bring every child more opportunity than their parents, a conviction that this American dream can be shared by all of us, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation. We will hold President-Elect Trump accountable to the values that truly make America great, but we will fight him tooth and nail when he appeals to the baser instincts that diminish America and its greatness, instincts that have too often plagued this country and too often plagued his campaign, and we will have benchmarks throughout the campaign. The President-elect said he could push GDP[[Page S9]]growth to 5 percent or 6 percent. He complained that the real unemployment rate was too high and he would bring it down. We will hold him accountable to that. What does he think he can achieve in a year or two or four? What policies does he propose to achieve those goals? He promised to be much tougher on China, even though many Republicans for years have resisted legislation in Congress to do that. We will hold him accountable for it and demand he keep his promise. He promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, but tapped an avowed critic of Medicare, a man who has spent his career advocating for its demise as his Secretary of Health and Human We demand that he keep his promise not to cut Social Security or He says he wants to build a strong America and earn respect around the world but seems to be marching in lockstep with the bullying, despicable autocrat who has caused a great deal of trouble around the globe and here in America, Vladimir We will hold him accountable to that.  We will hold the President accountable if he doesn't nominate a mainstream Supreme Court President Obama nominated a mainstream candidate in Merrick President-Elect Trump should do the same. The President-elect said a great many things about rebuilding our infrastructure. Democrats welcome that discussion, but how is he going to do it? We have thousands of bridges and tunnels and highways and schools, waste water systems, airports in need of repair, not only in our big cities but in rural and suburban communities throughout A program of tax credits isn't going to get the job done no matter how large. We need significant direct spending. How does the President-elect plan to get that done? The President-elect has said there are several parts of the Affordable Care Act he favors. We will hold him accountable to that. The ACA extended affordable health care to 30 million We ask the President-elect, if you repeal the ACA, what are you going to do to protect these 30 million people? How are you going to ensure that a kid right out of college can stay on his parent's or her parent's plan, that the mother with a child who has a preexisting condition can get health care for her child, that women everywhere are not charged more for their care simply because they are a woman? It is not acceptable to repeal the law, throw our health care system into chaos, and then leave the hard work for another day.  Mr.President-elect, what is your plan to make sure all Americans can get affordable health care? We will hold the President-elect accountable for actually creating jobs and raising incomes, growing our economy and lowering our trade deficit, for protecting voting rights and civil rights, for safeguarding our clean air and clean water, for maintaining our commitment to our Nation's veterans and troops and their families, for giving that worker in Michigan, that college student in L.A., that single mother in Cleveland a real opportunity and a ladder up. What could be fairer? After all, his biggest and most consistent pledge was that he would, ``Make America Great,'' make the lives of Americans better. We, the Democrats of this Senate, will hold him accountable to that, and we will resist him if he breaks that promise. While we respect the Office of the Presidency, we will not hesitate for a moment to call out the person occupying that office if he demeans women or Muslims or Latinos or our friends in the LGBT community, and if allies or aides to the President demean a group of Americans, we will not hesitate for a moment to demand that our new President condemn these comments, not sidestep them, not simply distance himself from them, condemn them, pointedly and roundly, as Presidents of both parties--every President of both parties--have done throughout the decades. We will hold President-Elect Trump accountable to the finest instincts of what America has always stood for, e pluribus unum.  The bottom line is, the President-elect ran as a change agent. He ran against the establishments of both parties. He promised to change the way America operates, to oppose elites, drain the swamp, pay attention to working families, but, my friends, since the election, he seems to have forgotten that.  Looking at the Cabinet, which is stacked with billionaires, corporate executives, titans of Wall Street, and those deeply embedded in Washington's corridor of power, it seems that many of his campaign themes are quickly being abandoned.  He said he was going to unrig the system. So far, it still looks rigged. Too many of his Cabinet picks support the same hard-right doctrinaire positions that many in the Republican Party have held for years, policies that the American people have repeatedly rejected. If President-Elect Trump lets the hard-right Members of Congress and his Cabinet run the show, if he attempts to adopt their timeworn policies which benefit the elite, the special interests, and corporate America, not the working man and woman, his Presidency will not succeed--maybe not in the first 90 days but certainly in the first 2 years. Unfortunately, that seems to be the path he is following throughout the transition.  So Mr.President-Elect, if there is one part of my speech that I hope you listen to and take to heart it is this one. I mean it with the best of intentions. If you abandon change and simply embrace the shopworn, hard-right, pro-corporate, pro-elite policies diametrically opposed to the many campaign themes that helped you win working class votes and get you elected, your Presidency will not succeed.  We Democrats will hold you accountable to the working people of America, not to the conservative ideologues in Washington who seem to have great number in your We will hold your feet to the fire every time you abandon your pledge and work instead as an ally of the hard right.  The issues facing this country are many. We have a lot of work to do--creating jobs, raising incomes, making college and health care affordable, rebuilding our infrastructure, making trade laws work for the American worker, keeping Americans safe from threats of violence and terrorism, taking care of our vets. Each one takes serious thought and action. These issues are too important for mere words.  Our challenge is too entrenched for mere tweeting. Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter We have real challenges, and we have real needs to get things done. Many Americans are afraid, Mr.President-Elect, that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies, for you, Twitter suffices.  There is nothing wrong with using Twitter to speak to the American people. It is a good use of modern media. But these issues are complex and command both careful consideration and action. We cannot tweet them away. For instance, a tweet bragging about the 800 jobs that were saved at the Carrier plant does not solve the underlying problem. While it is good the 800 jobs were saved, even at Carrier, 1,300 jobs are still leaving. Hundreds more jobs are leaving from the nearby Rexnord plant down the road; they are going overseas.  Most importantly, thousands more jobs each month leave our shores from every part of Tweeting about 800 jobs you saved is not a remanufacturing policy. That is not an economic policy. We are going to hold the President-elect accountable for a real policy to stop jobs from leaving this country, not just one half of one plant, not just one tweet, even if Republicans in Congress oppose it.  Similarly, tweeting ``very smart'' to Vladimir Putin for ignoring American sanctions is not foreign policy. America does not conduct foreign policy by tweet, least of all by flattering Putin after our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia interfered in our election.  Conducting foreign policy by tweet while spurning vital intelligence briefings that lay out the real emerging threats around the world should alarm Democrats and Republicans alike. It is utterly amazing that our Republican colleagues who have spent years lambasting President Obama for not being tough enough on Putin are now, with a few rare exceptions, utterly silent on this and so many other issues.  The President-elect must be held accountable on both sides of the aisle. On January 20, we will not be on reality TV; we will be in reality. We Democrats will make sure government works[[Page S10]]for every American in reality, not just on TV and on  So to those who wonder what the Democratic minority will do in the 115th Congress, the answer is simple: We will fight for our principles, we will fight for our values, and we shall fulfill our solemn constitutional duty to hold the other branches of government accountable.  To the extent that the President-elect and the Republican majority pursue policies that help America and are consistent with our values, we stand ready and willing to work with them. But if they propose policies that will hurt America, deny health care, cut their benefits, unleash irresponsible Wall Street risk-taking at the expense of consumers, their efforts will crash and break apart like waves upon the rocks of the Senate minority. That is our challenge. That is our charge. We rise to meet it.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Barrasso).

Iintended to be, but our President stayed longer and then I was meeting with the Vice President-elect. I apologize for that.  I also wish to recognize the distinguished majority leader and reiterate what I said yesterday: I sincerely hope, just as Iheard he hopes, that we can find common ground in the While we at all times inevitably disagree on the right way forwardfor our country, I know he is a patriot who cares deeply about this institution. That matters a lot to me. I learned thatthrough a meeting set up by my friend from We had a dinner, and I walked away convinced that Leader McConnellcares a lot about making the institution function. That matters, and that can maybe help us through some of the rougher times.We know it has grand principles, grand practices, and a grand tradition in our national life, something we both want topreserve.  Yesterday, in my opening remarks as a Senate leader, I did remind our Republican majority and the President-elect that therewould indeed be places where we can work together, and I named a few of them, but let me be perfectly clear, kicking millions ofAmericans off their health care and throwing the entire health care system into chaos is not one of them.  I am deeply troubled that the Republican majority and seemingly the President-elect are plotting, as one of their firstcampaigns in the new Congress, a full-scale assault on the American health care system, not just the Affordable Care Act butMedicare and Medicaid as well because they are inextricably bound. Those are the pillars that support the American health caresystem, but as its first order of legislative business, the Republican majority has decided to put forward a budget resolutionto repeal health care reform. Although he promised not to cut Medicare in the campaign, the President-elect has nominated a manwho spent his career strategizing health care's demise, and he chose him to be Secretary of I don't think that is somethinga vast majority of Americans or even Republicans believe in.  It is too clear that President-Elect Trump and the Republican Congress are intent on making America sick again. Republicansseem determined to create chaos, not affordable care, for the American people.  Today, I would like to focus on the budget resolution on the Affordable Care I understand why the majority thinks theyhave to do it. Over the past 8 years, they promised every group--conservative group and audience in the country, they wouldrepeal the law, ``root and branch.''  For a long time, it has been only a conservative fever dream. Republicans knew they could make extreme promises aboutreplacing it with something better without ever having to consider the consequences or even come up with a reasonable plan toreplace it because they knew the Democrats or President Obama would ultimately block their attempts to roll back the law.  Now things are different. The consequences of repealing the Affordable Care Act are real. I sincerely urge my colleagues todeeply consider the consequences. It is no longer just a game or a political line to say ``repeal'' because now you have toreplace. So far, it has been 5 years of repeal, repeal, repeal; not one replace plan has garnered[[Page S31]]a lot of support even onthe Republican side of the aisle, let alone in  What will it mean for average Americans if you repeal the law without any viable replacement? Not just the 30 million whomight lose coverage right away--that is a staggering number, many of them in very red and poor States and rural areas. What willhappen to the overall marketplace if you rip away all the safeguards of the ACA and have put nothing in its place?  It doesn't matter if you repeal and delay, as some of my friends on the other side of the aisle call it, for 1 year or 2years--however long. Folks will lose a lot of benefits, and the insurance marketplace could fall apart long before repeal goesinto place. As insurers raise their prices because they have to with repeal, costs to the average American who has employerinsurance will go up as well. My colleagues will own that, just as we owned everything that happened previous to this election.  Let me tell you, if Republicans pull the plug on health reform, on Medicaid, and privatize Medicare, it could mean absolutechaos, not affordable care. It would likely increase prescription drug costs, premiums, and out-of-pocket costs to Americanfamilies--not, as I said, just for the families that got coverage on the exchanges but for all American families, even if you getinsurance through your employer. I repeat that to Everyone who has employer-based insurance and is not part of the ACAshould worry about this repeal with no replace because their costs will go up, sure as we are here together. It would putinsurance companies back in charge. It would allow them to discriminate against individuals with preexisting conditions.  We all know of people. Parents--their kid has cancer. They would look for an insurance company. Oh, no, your son has cancer,your daughter has cancer, you can't get it. What are our colleagues going to do about that one? No answers yet. I doubt theyhave good ones. It would cause premiums to skyrocket. It would unravel the insurance market.  I would ask my colleagues before they jump into this repeal to talk to their local rural hospitals. In my State, ruralhospitals are a mainstay of our rural economy. They are the largest employer in many of our towns and villages. Remember, NewYork has New York City, but we are the third largest rural State in the Nation, only behind Pennsylvania and North Inthose areas, merely repealing the ACA and not doing anything else is going to hurt those hospitals dramatically. In fact, today,in 11 State capitals, rural hospitals--many of them in red States--protested a repeal of the  It could also exacerbate--I don't want to forget--the opioid epidemic by ripping away coverage from 1.6 million newly insuredindividuals struggling with substance abuse disorders. We worked so hard in the Cures Act to cover people. Far more would beundone by this act of repeal in terms of fighting opioid abuse.  For all my deficit-hawk friends, your proposal causes a trillion-dollar hole in the budget--at least a trillion. My colleaguefrom Washington thinks it might be even higher, and I rarely doubt her. What are you going to do, deficit hawks, once you repealand that hole in the budget becomes enormous?  This is not conjecture. My Republican colleagues would be wise to remember how the American health care system operatedbefore health care reform. Health care costs were growing at a much faster rate than they are today, eating into workers'paychecks and dissuading them from taking risks and changing jobs lest they lose a good coverage plan. A debilitating illnesscould wipe out a lifetime of hard-earned savings because there was no cap on health care costs. Women were charged more than menfor the same health coverage. It was outrageous. We will go back to those days with repeal.  Many couldn't get insurance if they had a preexisting condition. Some insurance companies would simply delete you from theirrolls if you got sick. You want to go back to those ``good old days''?  Today, because of health care reform, those things are no longer true. Health care costs are rising much more slowly thanbefore, and the uninsured rate is the lowest it has ever been. I don't think any American would want to go back to the healthcare world of yesteryear where insurance companies wrote the rules and costs spiraled up unchecked, but Republicans seem all tooeager to dial back the clock and make America sick again.  Democrats are united in our opposition to cutting Medicare, to cutting Medicaid, and to repealing health care reform, and wewill hold the Republican majority and the President-elect accountable for the consequences of repealing health care reform.

While much of the information relating to Russia's interference in our election can be pulled together by the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, the legislative actions that[[Page S107]]will be required to respond fully to Russia's interference need to be a wide-ranging endeavor that can only be done by a select committee.

1195,topic-id,872,"Mr.President, I have another subject I wish to talk about, and maybe this one will be a little more constructive right now in terms of my Republican leader's response because he and I yesterday had a constructive meeting on the matter of processing the President-elect's nominations to the We are still working out several details, but on this issue I want to express my appreciation for the majority leader's willingness to have a dialogue and work in good faith toward a process both sides of the aisle can live with.  Our caucus thinks it is absolutely essential that the Senate has a chance to appropriately vet the nominees, and the American people deserve to hear their views and qualifications in public hearings, especially for the most powerful Cabinet positions. We all know Cabinet officials have enormous power and influence over the lives of everyday They run massive government agencies that do the actual work of implementing our laws, keeping our Nation safe from terrorism, protecting the environment and civil rights, promoting clean energy and affordable housing--on and on. Every facet of public life is governed by a very powerful Cabinet official.  It is only right that we in the Senate--and by extension the American people--get to thoroughly vet their baseline acceptability for these jobs. That means getting their financial records to make sure they don't come into public office with standing conflicts of interest, and if potential conflicts of interest are found, making sure they have a plan to divest the assets in question, making sure the FBI has had the time to complete a full background check. It means making sure the independent ethics officers of each agency can sign off on them.  All of these benchmarks are standard protocol. All were done by about this time 8 years ago by the Obama administration. They are not onerous requirements. They are necessary requirements to prevent conflicts of interest.  I remind my colleagues again, every Obama Cabinet nominee had an ethics agreement in before their hearing. Every Obama Cabinet nominee underwent a full FBI background check before the Senate considered their nomination. For such positions of influence in our government, it is the responsibility of the Senate to guarantee that we have all the information we need on each nominee and in a timely fashion.  Truth be told, the slate of nominations selected by President-Elect Trump has made this process--standard for nominees of Presidents of both parties--immensely difficult. There are several nominees who have enormous wealth and own stock of enormous value. We have a CEO of one of the largest oil companies in the world, a billionaire financial services executive financier--oh, and another billionaire financial services executive.  Leaving aside for a moment what that says about the President-elect's priorities for his incoming administration, these nominees have potential conflict of interest challenges of epic proportions. At the very least--at the very least--they owe the American people the standard paperwork, and in fact we believe many of these nominees, given their financial holdings, should go one step further and provide their tax returns.  The minority only has ethics agreements in for four of the nominees so far. We only have financial disclosure forms from four of the nominees so far. We only have tax returns for four of the nominees so far. None of our committees has been notified that any nominees' FBI background check has been fully completed. Briefings have started, but they are far from complete.  As I said earlier, I hope the majority leader and I can work out an arrangement that works for both of our caucuses to process these nominees in a fair but thorough fashion. It certainly shouldn't be the case, as seems to be planned now, that six hearings--several on very important nominees--all occur on the same day and on the same day as a potential vote-arama. That is mostly unprecedented in the modern era of Cabinet considerations, happening only once in history. That is not the standard, but right now that is the case on January 11.  There are Members who sit on multiple committees. One of our Members chairs one of the committees, Judiciary, but has been very active on the Intelligence Committee--both nominees in a single day. That is unfair, not only to her, with her great knowledge, but to the American people. Each member deserves plenty of time to question each nominee, and if questions remain, they should be brought back for a second day of hearings.  After all, they are going to hold incredibly powerful positions for potentially the next 4 years. To spend an extra day or two on each nominee, if it takes a few weeks, several weeks, to get through them all in order to carefully consider their nominations, that is certainly worth it to the American people and, I would argue, to the new administration.  I have made these points to the majority leader, and I must say he has respectfully listened. I am hopeful we can find an agreement that alleviates the crunch and gives Senators and committees the opportunity to process these nominations with the proper care and oversight, with all of the proper paperwork in place, thoughtfully and thoroughly.

1245,topic-id,304,"Mr.President, first, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague the Republican leader. I understand the Republican leader's discomfort. There is a cry from his side to repeal, but it has been 6 years and they have no plan to replace. Repeal without replace leaves 20 million Americans who have had health care in the lurch; leaves college students who are 21 to 26 and have been on their parents' plan in the lurch; leaves women who are now getting equal health care treatment to men in the lurch; and leaves those who have families who have preexisting conditions, and now can get insurance but without ObamaCare couldn't, in the lurch.  I understand the Republican leader's discomfort. Replace is not available because they can't come up with a plan. I appreciate his request to work with us. He has two choices. Our Republican colleagues have two choices: Either, once they repeal, come up with a replacement plan, and we will give it a look--they haven't been able to do it for 6 years; they are squirming right now because they don't have one; they are leaving so many Americans who need health care in the lurch--or don't repeal and come talk to us about how to make some improvements. We are willing to do that.  I will note that yesterday the vote to repeal without replace was totally partisan. My colleagues decried that the vote originally for ACA was partisan. This is equally partisan, and it is going to create huge trouble for our colleagues. Again, I will say to my Republican colleagues, your job is not to name call but to come up with a replacement plan that helps the people who need help--people who are now helped by the ACA but who will be left in the lurch once it is repealed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75.txt,1036,REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,5.0,January
1487,topic-id,1161,"Mr.President, last week, I expressed my sincere hope that the majority leader and I could come to some agreement on the process of nominations. He has negotiated in good faith, and we have made some progress. I sincerely appreciate his willingness to work with us so far. I do want to clarify why Democrats are doing this.  Yesterday, my friend the majority leader went on television and suggested that we were raising concerns about the nominations out of pique or anger. He chalked up these ``little procedural complaints'' to ``sour grapes,'' and he suggested that Democrats ``grow up.''  We are not doing this for sport. Democrats feel very strongly that pushing for a thorough and thoughtful vetting process is the right thing to do. Here is why. The Democratic minority was and is concerned about the hearing schedule, which is so jammed right now that several high-importance hearings will fall on the same day, depriving Senators and the American people a chance to properly participate in the vetting process of these nominees.  Our caucus was and is concerned about the timely completion of the standard paperwork and ethics clearance for nominees before proceeding full steam ahead with confirmation hearings and votes. Bear in mind, President-Elect Trump's nominees pose particularly difficult ethics and conflict-of-interest challenges. Many of them come from enormous wealth. Many have vast holdings in stocks, and very few have experience in government so they have not been appropriately vetted for something like a Cabinet post before.  What had been standard practice for the vast majority of nominees--the completion of a preliminary ethics review before their nomination--was skipped over for the vast majority of President-Elect Trump's nominees. In fact, the independent Office of Government Ethics went so far as to send a letter warning that ``their [the Republicans] schedule has created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews.''  The OGE office is nonpartisan. It has never been political so this has nothing to do with politics. ``I am not aware,'' wrote the Director, Walter Schaub, ``of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.''  The very same majority leader, my friend Senator McConnell, who suggested that Democrats were raising concerns out of pique or resentment, in fact, raised the same concerns in 2009 when he was minority leader. In fact, then-Minority Leader McConnell sent then-Majority Leader Reid a letter laying out his prerequisites for time agreements on the floor for President Obama's nominees. They are almost exactly what Democrats requested.  I don't bring this up to play gotcha. I am doing it to show that our requests are eminently reasonable and, in fact,[[Page S126]]have been shared by leaders of both parties. I am going to read the letter because it is amazing how it mirrors our requests. It was sent to Harry Reid from Mitch McConnell in 2009, just as President Obama became       Dear Harry:       The Senate has the Constitutional duty to provide its      Advice and Consent on Presidential nominations, a duty which      we take seriously. In consultation with our Ranking Members,      we reaffirm our commitment to conduct the appropriate review      of these nominations, consistent with the long standing and      best practices of committees, regardless of which political      party is in the majority. These best practices serve the      Senate well, and we will insist on their fair and consistent      application.       Therefore, prior to considering any time agreements on the      floor on any nominee, we expect the following standards will      be met:       1. The FBI background check is complete and submitted to      the committee in time for review and prior to a hearing being      noticed.       2. The Office of Government Ethics letter is complete and      submitted in time for review and prior to a committee      hearing.       3. Financial disclosure statements (and tax returns for      applicable committees) are complete and submitted to the      committee for review prior to a hearing being noticed.       4. All committee questionnaires are complete and have been      returned to the committee. A reasonable opportunity for      follow-up questions has been afforded committee members, and      nominees have answered, with sufficient time for review prior      to a committee vote.       5. The nominee is willing to have committee staff      interviews, where that has been the practice.       6. The nominee has had a hearing.       7. The nominee agrees to courtesy visits with members when      requested.       8. The nominee has committed to cooperate with the Ranking      Member on requests for information and transparency.       There will be additional requirements, honoring the      traditions of the Senate, for judicial nominees. These common      sense standards and long standing practices will ensure that      the Senate has had the opportunity to fairly review a      nominee's record and to make an informed decision prior to a      vote.

1488,topic-id,494,"Mr.President, I plan to return the exact same letter to my friend, the majority leader, with the same requests. In 2009, the then-minority leader called these benchmarks ``common sense standards'' and ``long standing practices.''  I agree with him. These standards do not indicate a lack of maturity. They show an abundance of common sense, just as his letter said. I remind the majority that several, if not most, of the nominees have actually failed to meet the qualifications laid out by this letter given the hearing schedule.  The majority leader is fond of mentioning that many Obama nominees passed quickly in 2009 and he asks that we do the same, but there is a big difference between 2009 and today. President Obama's nominees met all the standards laid out in then-Minority Leader McConnell's letter. President-Elect Trump's nominees have not.  In 2009, every Obama Cabinet nominee had an ethics agreement in before their hearing. Every Obama Cabinet nominee underwent a full FBI background check before the Senate considered their nomination. President-Elect Trump's nominees are way behind that mark.  I only ask, respectfully, that the Republican majority follow the same set of standards they had in 2009 when the shoe was on the other foot, especially because these nominees raise particular concerns. The standards we have laid out as leaders of both parties address conflict of interest and security concerns.  Of course, those are prime concerns, but there is another concern as well. These nominees have, even collectively, very little experience or record in government. Many of them have taken positions quite different from the President-elect. They need to be thoroughly vetted, not just before the U.Senate but before the American people. If, for instance, Representative Price is for the privatization of Social Security, but President-Elect Trump said he is not, what position is nominee Price going to take? Jamming all these hearings into 1 or 2 days, making members run from committee to committee makes no sense. After all, these nominees are going to hold incredibly powerful positions for potentially the next 4 years. To spend an extra day or two on each nominee, even if it takes a few weeks to get through them all in order to carefully consider their nominations, is well worth it. It is only fair that they are given a thorough and thoughtful vetting and they abide by the ``long standing'' ethics practices that were established--and laid out quite clearly by the majority leader himself--to ensure Cabinet officials were in good standing to work on behalf of the American people.

1565,topic-id,1161,"Mr.President, first, let me thank my good friend from Maine for his usual eloquent remarks.  I thank my colleague from Connecticut, who is one of our great speakers and mainstays, who has let me sneak in ahead of him. So I will be brief.  My Democratic colleagues are holding the floor tonight to demonstrate our solidarity and our commitment to defending the Affordable Care It is not just defending some abstract law. It is not about protecting President Obama's legacy or Democrats' legacy. It is about people. It is about the American people and their access to affordable health care. It is about defending a health care system that has been made fairer, more generous, more accessible, and more affordable for the American family. It is about men and women and children whose stories we have heard tonight from Member after Member, one part of the country to the other, and their lives have been changed. In many cases, their lives have been saved by health care reform.  That is why Democrats have held the floor tonight. Though the hours have waned on, we will fight this repeal with every fiber of our being. We will not go gently into that good night.  The history of health care reform has been cast and recast by both parties, but there is a truth to be told amidst a lot of fiction. Here is a truth. Before the Affordable Care Act, our health care system was a mess. Health care costs were growing at a rate much faster than they are today, eating into workers' paychecks, dissuading them from taking risks and changing jobs lest they lose good coverage. A debilitating illness could wipe away a lifetime of hard-earned savings because insurers could put limits on how much treatment they would cover. Women were charged more for the same health care coverage. Many couldn't get insurance if they had a preexisting condition. Some insurance companies would simply delete you from the rolls if you got sick; in short, premiums spiraling up, spotty coverage, discriminatory practices, a marketplace out of balance. I remember the days before health care reform, before Everyone was complaining about the system. This idea that everything was hunky-dory and then ACA came in is fiction.  I was involved. We knew health care reform would be difficult. It is a $3 trillion industry with complicated rules and procedures. The politics were arduous. For that reason, health care reform had bedeviled Congresses and Presidents for decades. We knew in 2009 that we had a rare opportunity and that it was too important to let politics or lobbyists or special interests or fear stand in the way.  In the past, Democrats were able to make progress on smaller slices of the overall pie. The CHIP program, my dear friend who is no longer here, Senator Jay Rockefeller, championed it. Getting generic prescription drugs on the market, I was involved in that, along with the Senator from Never, never was a Congress able to pass a comprehensive package of reforms to the health care system until the ACA--the greatest leap forward in American health care, certainly since the passage of Medicare and  You can measure the results. The law has helped bend the health care costs curve down, insured more Americans than any time in our Nation's history since we started measuring the uninsured rate, all while providing higher quality health care.  Is the act perfect? No, no one ever said it was. I have listened to my friend the majority leader and our Republican colleagues on the floor these past few weeks. They used quotes from President Obama saying the law could use improvements as proof that it is failing.  That doesn't hold up. Go look at the full quotes. No one ever said the law would be perfect. We all know it could use some fixes. I, for one, am for a public option--we nearly had it in 2009--to increase competition in marketplaces where there is still too little. But scrap the whole thing and go back, back to a chaotic marketplace, inconsistent coverage, skyrocketing premiums? No way. Back to 40 million uninsured Americans, back to discriminating against women and Americans with preexisting conditions? No way.  Democrats don't want to make America sick again. We don't want to repeal the largest expansion of Affordable Health Care since Medicare and Medicaid and leave chaos in its wake--chaos instead of affordable care. That is what the Republican plan would do, sure as I am here tonight.  This evening, as colleague after colleague has come to the floor to describe how the ACA is helping their constituents, helping nurses, helping rural hospitals, helping students, helping seniors, I hope my Republican friends may have listened to them. The American people certainly are. They have been watching this debate. We have been talking to them on the phones, and they will carefully consider the consequences of repealing this law, and I hope our Republican colleagues will--particularly without a viable comprehensive replacement.  With the close of this long night, I make a simple plea to my Republican colleagues: Turn back. It is not too late. You are already hearing the grumblings from Members on the left side of your caucus and the right side of your caucus.  Well, they are starting to say, now that you have some power here, you are in the majority, maybe we shouldn't repeal without replace, even though for 6 years you have been unable to come up with a replacement.  The Republican Senators from Maine, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, former Senator Rick Santorum, even the President-elect says that maybe we should replace and figure out how to replace before we repeal, but with this vote, it would just repeal it.  My simple advice to my Republican colleagues is turn back. The health care of Americans hang in the balance. Affordable care for every American hangs in the balance. If Republicans repeal the ACA without a detailed comprehensive plan to replace it, not a mere framework, not a set of principles, not a bunch of small-ball policies cobbled together, they will create utter chaos, not affordable care.  It is not too late. Work with us If you tell us tomorrow you are giving up on repeal, we will work with you to improve it. We know there[[Page S176]]needs to be some improvements, but don't scrap the law, leaving all those in the lurch and then come to us and say: Now let's fix it.  You better have a replacement. Something you haven't been able to do for 6 years. It is not too late. Work with us Democrats on improving the law. Work with us on making it better. Don't scrap it and make America sick again. Turn back before it is too late. It will damage your party. It will hurt millions of Americans, far more importantly, and hurt our great country.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1864,topic-id,1324,"Mr.President, as hearings for the President-elect's nominees get underway starting today, I want to reiterate that a fair and thorough vetting process is a top priority, not only for my caucus but for the American people.  Chief to achieving that is a fair hearing schedule and process. First, it means hearings that are sufficiently spaced out so Members who sit on multiple committees can actually attend all the hearings. It means only holding hearings after the full committee paperwork--OGE review, FBI background check, and a full divestment plan--has been received and Senators have adequate time to review the information. That means, if there are Senators with remaining questions that weren't covered in a first hearing, they can have the nominee come back for a second day.  Our caucus and much of America was alarmed and disappointed by the announcements of the hearing schedule this week, which did not meet these basic courtesies and best practices that have always been extended in the past. However, I am happy to say that after negotiating with my friend the majority leader and his respective committee chairs, we have been able to make some progress on a fair hearing process.  I appreciate the majority leader's openness and efforts to accommodate our caucus in the last few days. Originally there were six hearings scheduled for this Wednesday, all especially important Cabinet posts: State, Attorney General, Education, Transportation, Homeland Security, That was largely unprecedented. We have looked back in history and can only find one instance where there were that many hearings of important Cabinet members on one day like that.  After negotiations with the majority leader, we have moved things around so[[Page S183]]that there are now only three hearings scheduled for Wednesday: Secretary of State, Transportation, and the second day of the AG hearings. All of these nominees have their paperwork in. The nominee for Secretary of Education, who does not yet have a signed ethics agreement and whose paperwork is not close to complete, was moved. That hearing will take place next week, pending her paperwork being submitted with time for Senators to review.  It is still a busy week. It is a little too busy for my personal taste, but it is a good first step. I hope we can continue to negotiate in good faith, to sort out the schedule in a way that is acceptable to both of our caucuses.  I also want to make clear that this progress does not mean our caucus is any less intent on having the President-elect's nominees complete the standard ethics forms, questionnaires, and FBI background checks required of every nominee. To have all this information come in after the hearing is sort of like ``Alice in Wonderland''--it makes no sense and has things upside down. I am still concerned, for example, that we don't have a completed FBI background check for the nominee for Secretary of His hearing starts tomorrow. And today there are reports in the media that under Rex Tillerson's leadership, Exxon conducted business with Iran, potentially in violation of U.sanctions law. There are serious questions that need to be answered.  In this particular case, Mr.Tillerson should release all his tax returns and promise to answer any questions on the Iran dealings that members ask. This is too serious a subject to have questions ducked. It demands a completely open airing of all relevant information. Did Mr.Tillerson go around our Iran sanctions simply to line Exxon's pockets? That would be a very bad thing. The American people ought to know about it before the Senate has to vote to confirm. For Rex Tillerson to answer the questions, and particularly questions about Exxon setting up a separate subsidiary to get around our Iran sanctions, is what the Founding Fathers wanted us to do when they enumerated in the advise and consent process.  This is not a partisan game. We are not doing this for sport. These aren't obscure procedural complaints. This is standard process. As I reminded my friend the majority leader yesterday, this is the same exact process my counterpart demanded in 2009 when the shoe was on the other foot. Just as then-Minority Leader McConnell laid out in his 2009 letter to then-Majority Leader Reid, Democrats expect each nominee to have all the prerequisites, with time to review, before we move forward with the hearings. President Obama's nominees completed all of their paperwork in 2009 before the hearings. We expect nothing less from President-Elect Trump's nominees. Particularly, we expect the paperwork to be all in with time to review. Having the paperwork in at 7 a.m. and holding a hearing at 10 a.m. is unacceptable. We expect there will be adequate time for followup questions on a second day of hearings if Senators are unable to finish their questions.  Today my colleague the majority leader said: Well, most of the Cabinet nominees were in already when this letter came out. But the letter doesn't specify who. It includes Cabinet members, and there were future Cabinet members who would come forward. It is a good standard. We are all for it. We are asking our friends on the other side of the aisle to stick with it. What was good for them in 2009 is good for the country in 2017.  We are insistent on the process because it is the right thing to do; it is the American thing to do. We don't hide nominees and rush them through. They have huge power. If the President-elect and our Republican colleagues are as proud of the nominees as they state, then they should be happy to have them answer a lot of questions in a hearing that is not rushed. It is how we will ensure that Cabinet officials, who are imbued with an immense power in our government, are ethically and substantively qualified for these positions.  If there is any group of Cabinet nominees that cries out for this process, it is this group of nominees. This proposed Cabinet is unlike any other. It is wealthier than any other. It has complex webs of corporate connections--so many of the nominees--that pose huge potential conflict of interest problems. Frankly, it is the most hard-right Cabinet in its ideology. It is quite different from the way President-Elect Trump campaigned. The potential conflicts of interest for multimillionaires such as Rex Tillerson or Betsy DeVos or Steve Mnuchin are enormous.  As I said, the nominees have views far to the right of what the President campaigned on. The most glaring example is Representative His whole career has been focused on ending Medicare as we know it. My colleague the majority leader said the American people want us to move forward and give President-Elect Trump his nominees. If they knew that one of the nominees had been dedicated to basically getting rid of Medicare, would they want us to vote for him? I will bet not. It sure explains why they want to rush these nominees through.  They don't want all of these things brought to light, but that is the wrong thing to do. We are going to fight to get to the right thing to do. The American people have a right to know if they voted for a President who might be going back on one of his key campaign promises. They deserve nothing less than open and deliberate hearings going forward. Will Representative Price stick with what President-Elect Trump said--no cuts to Medicare, Medicaid--or will he pursue his lifelong dream of privatizing and limiting them? We shall see, but we need answers at hearings before we vote. The American people are entitled to it.  Once again, I thank the majority leader for dealing in good faith and trying to address our concerns. I hope for the sake of the national interests that our two parties can come together on an agreement for the remainder of the process, as we have for the process so far.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgS182-3.txt,1036,REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,January
1867,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, last night the Senate Democrats held the floor late into the night to demonstrate our solidarity and commitment to defending ACA, to defending the tens of millions of Americans who have been afforded the opportunity to access care for the first time and the tens of millions more whose coverage is fairer, more generous, and more affordable because of the law.  More than 35 Members participated on the floor or on Facebook Live, Snapchat, or I thank each and every one of the Members on my side--the vast majority of our caucus--for participating. Many of them discussed the threat the Republican plan to make America sick again poses to the health care of 300 million Beyond that, the Republican budget resolution calls for a massive increase in the Federal debt.  Yesterday Shaun Donovan, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, released a letter explaining that this budget resolution would allow publicly held debt to increase by $9.5 trillion, from $14.2 trillion in 2016 to $23.7 trillion in 2026.  Our colleagues have talked about being deficit hawks. Democrats bring up ideas. They say: Can't do it; it increases the deficit. Well, is that going to apply to this, which increases the deficit by massive amounts? The deficit would exceed $1.3 trillion in 2026. That is almost as high as the $1.4 trillion at the depths of that recession and financial crisis President Obama had to meet. Are my colleagues now going to do a 180-degree reversal and say that now a debt increase of such dramatic numbers is OK? I hope not. It wouldn't be right. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be consistent.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of Director Donovan's letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.     John Yarmuth,     Ranking Member, House Budget Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Richard Neal,     Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Congressman Yarmuth and Congressman Neal: I am writing      in response to[[Page S184]]     your letter requesting OMB's analysis of the Republican      budget resolution and its impact on the budget outlook.       On January 3, 2017, Republicans in the Senate Budget      Committee introduced an FY 2017 budget resolution. Based on      the numbers provided in the resolution, the Republican budget      includes virtually no deficit reduction and would allow debt      held by the public to increase by roughly $9.5 trillion, from      $14.2 trillion in 2016 to $23.7 trillion in 2026. After a      sustained period of historically fast deficit reduction under      the President's leadership, the Republican budget would allow      for a relatively steady increase in annual deficits, with the      annual on-budget deficit increasing to over $1 trillion by      2026.       Assuming that Republicans will not make cuts to off-budget      programs like Social Security, unified annual deficits will      be even larger: growing to over $1 trillion by 2022 and      reaching more than $1.3 trillion by 2026.       Comparisons of debt and deficit totals over time are best      viewed as a share of the economy. Based on the Congressional      Budget Office's most recent economic projections, it is clear      that the Republican budget would fail the key fiscal test of      stabilizing debt as a share of the economy.

1868,topic-id,142,"Mr.President, many of my Republican colleagues like to claim they care about the deficit. During President Obama's administration, there was an obsession over deficit and debt reduction--and, by the way, no praise for the President for reducing the deficit by a dramatic amount. Now many of those same Members who chastised President Obama for much smaller deficits than proposed in their budget are supporting this budget resolution.  I wish to say to my colleagues, you can't claim to be a fiscal hawk and support a budget that piles on trillions in additional debt. That is not being fiscally conservative; it is being fiscally hypocritical in the extreme. So far, my friend Senator Paul of Kentucky has made this point forcefully. My question is, Will other Republicans stand with him and stand up against this fiscal hypocrisy?

Resolved       This section provides that the Rules of the 114th Congress      are the Rules of the 115th Congress, except for the      amendments contained in section 2 of the resolution and      orders contained in sections 3, 4, and 5.     Section 2. Changes to the Standing       Subsection (a) authorizes the Sergeant-at-Arms to      impose a fine against a Member, Delegate, or the Resident      Commissioner for the use of an electronic device for      photography, audio or visual recording, or broadcasting on      the House floor in contravention of clause 5 of rule XVII and      any applicable Speaker's announced policy on electronic      devices. A fine for a first offense will be $500 and $2,500      for subsequent offenses. Any subsequent offense will be      assessed at the higher amount, regardless of whether it is      connected to any other offense by time or proximity.       The subsection provides that any Member, Delegate, or      Resident Commissioner that has been assessed a fine may      appeal the fine in writing to the Committee on Ethics not      later than 30 calendar days or five legislative days,      whichever is later, after notification. Upon receipt of an      appeal, the Committee on Ethics is provided 30 calendar days      or five legislative days, whichever is later, to either      dismiss the fine or allow it to proceed. Upon a determination      regarding the appeal or if no appeal has been filed at the      expiration of the period, the chair of the Committee on      Ethics shall promptly notify the Member, Delegate, or the      Resident Commissioner, the Speaker and the Chief      Administrative The Speaker is required to promptly      lay such notification before the       The Sergeant-at-Arms, Committee on Ethics, and Chief      Administrative Officer are authorized to establish policies      and procedures to implement this subsection. Upon      notification from the chair of the Committee on Ethics, the      Chief Administrative Officer shall deduct the amount of any      fine from the net salary of the Member, Delegate, or Resident            The subsection also modifies rule XVII to clarify conduct      considered disorderly or disruptive during legislative      proceedings to ensure that a Member may be referred to the      Committee on Ethics for behavior impeding in the rights of      another Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner to      participate in floor proceedings, including blocking access      to legislative instruments such as microphones and blocking      access the well of the       Authorization and Oversight Subsection (b) amends      the current oversight plan requirements. The subsection      requires each standing committee (except the Committees on      Appropriations, Ethics, and Rules) to adopt an authorization      and oversight plan, which must be submitted to the Committees      on Oversight and Government Reform, House Administration, and      Appropriations no later than February 15 of the first session      of The plan must include a list of unauthorized      programs and agencies within their jurisdiction that have      received funding in the prior fiscal year, or in the case of      a permanent authorization, has not received a comprehensive      review by the committee in the prior three The      subsection requires committees to describe each program or      agency that is intended to be authorized in the current      Congress or next Congress, and a description of oversight to      support reauthorization in the current The      subsection also requires recommendations, if any, for moving      such programs or agencies from mandatory to discretionary      funding.       The subsection also provides that committees may make      recommendations to consolidate or terminate duplicative      programs or agencies, or those that are inconsistent with the      appropriate role of the Federal government. Committees may      make recommendations for changes to existing law to address      Federal rules, regulations, statutes, and court decisions      related to these programs that are inconsistent with      Congress' Article I authorities. The subsection requires the      Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, after      consultation with the Speaker, Majority Leader, and the      Minority Leader, report the oversight and authorization plans      to the House by March 31 of the first session of       Amendments to Appropriation Subsection (c) codifies      the standing order from the 112th, 113th, and 114th      Congresses prohibiting an amendment to a general      appropriation bill proposing a net increase in budget      authority in the bill.       Duplication of Federal Subsection (d) codifies      the standing order from the 113th and 114th Congresses that      requires committee reports to include a statement on whether      any provision of the measure establishes or reauthorizes a      program of the Federal government known to be duplicative of      another Federal program. The subsection also eliminates      unnecessary language regarding the authorization of a      committee chair to request that the Government Accountability      Office perform a duplication analysis of any bill or joint      resolution referred to that committee, and makes technical      changes.       Recognition of Subsection (e) eliminates from the      rules outdated references to physical mobility. This is a      clarification to address the needs of Members who are      physically unable to stand.       Convening Outside the Hall of the Subsection (f)      conforms the standing rules with current practice regarding      convening outside the Hall of the       Temporary Presiding Authority Subsection (g)      clarifies that the authority of a Speaker pro tempore      appointed under clause 8(b)(3)(A) of rule I takes priority      over the Clerk's authority to preserve order and decorum      pending the election of a new       Continuing Litigation Subsection (h)      authorizes the House, the Speaker, a committee or chair of a      committee to carry forward litigation from the previous      Congress as the successor in interest in any continuing      litigation matter in which the House, the Speaker, the      committee or chair of a committee, respectively, was      previously authorized to be involved. This subsection      automatically continues previously authorized litigation      authority and fully empowers the successor in interest to      take all steps necessary to carry such litigation forward      during the new Congress, thereby eliminating the need for a      separate resolution authorizing the continuation of such      litigation as in the past.       Clarifying Staff Access to the House Subsection (i)      conforms the standing rules to the current practice that      staff accompanying Members on the floor are not required to      remain at the desk.       Member Subsection (j) adds language to the      definition of ``Records of the House'' to clarify the      ownership of congressional office records of a Member,      Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, and to codify the      longstanding custom and practice of the House under which      such records have been recognized to be the personal property      of the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, in keeping      with the common law. Prior rules of the House drew a      distinction between the records of House committees and      officers, on the one hand, and congressional office records      of Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner, on the      other. The latter do not belong to the House, because the      Rule expressly defined House ``records'' to exclude them.      See, e.g., Rule VII.6, Rules of the U.House of      Representatives, 114th (2015); Rule XXXVI, Rules of the      U.House of Representatives, 105th (1997). This      subsection adds language confirming that congressional office      records are the personal property of the Member, Delegate, or      Resident Commissioner who creates, generates, or receives      them, in accordance with longstanding House custom and prior      pronouncements. See, e.g., 307, 110th      (2008) (``[B]y custom [congressional papers of Members,      Delegates, and Resident Commissioners] are considered the      personal property of the Member who receives and creates      them, and it is therefore the Member who is responsible to      decide on their ultimate disposition . . . .'');      99-994, 99th (1986), at 5 (``[I]t is relatively clear      that Members' papers have been regarded as their personal      property . . . .'').       Response to Subsection (k) clarifies and      streamlines procedures governing notification of, and      response to, properly served judicial subpoenas and judicial      orders directing appearance as a witness relating to the      official functions of the House or compelling the production      or disclosure of any document relating to the official      functions of the       The subsection continues the practice of granting authority      to respond to subpoenas without the necessity of a House      vote, and streamlines the notification process to eliminate      inefficiencies. The recipient of a properly served judicial      subpoena or order compelling testimony or production of      documents relating to the official functions of the House      must promptly notify the Speaker in writing of the receipt of      that judicial order or subpoena and must determine whether      the subpoena or order is a proper exercise of the      jurisdiction of the court and is consistent with the rights      and privileges of the In keeping with current      practice, the notification to the Speaker must either[[Page H13]]     set forth those determinations (if they have already been      made at the time of the notification) or state that the      recipient intends to make those determinations. The prior      rule's additional reference to determining whether the      subpoena or order ``is material and relevant'' has been      omitted as redundant and superfluous, because it is subsumed      within the requirement to determine whether the subpoena or      order is consistent with the privileges and rights of the      House; it would not be consistent with the privileges and      rights of the House for a Member, Delegate, Resident      Commissioner, officer, or employee to be compelled to respond      to a judicial subpoena or order seeking information that is      not material and relevant to the underlying cause.      Accordingly, no substantive change is made by the deletion of      the ``is material and relevant'' determination.       The subsection omits the obsolete requirements for the      Clerk of the House to provide a copy of rule VIII to the      court and for recipients of judicial subpoenas or orders to      submit ``certified'' copies of documents when production of      documents in response to a properly served judicial subpoena      or order has been determined to be appropriate. References to      administrative subpoenas relating to the official functions      of the House have also been deleted, because the rule should      not be interpreted to suggest that compliance with such      subpoenas may be mandatory. The subsection deletes the truism      that notifications received when the House is adjourned will      be laid before the House upon its reconvening.       Requirements for Subsection (1) codifies the      exceptions carried in previous rules packages to clause 5(d)      of rule X to allow the Committee on Appropriations up to      thirteen subcommittees, the Committees on Armed Services,      Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Government Reform up to      seven subcommittees, and the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure up to six subcommittees.       Committee Subsection (m) provides the Committee      on Homeland Security with authority to close hearings for an      additional 5 consecutive days when considering sensitive      matters that require an executive session.       Referrals to the Court of Subsection (n) conforms      the standing rules with the current practice that measures      making a referral to the Court of Claims are referred to the      private calendar.       Contents of Committee Reports Showing Changes to Existing      Subsection (o) modifies language adopted in the 114th      Congress to address an unintended consequence that required a      committee report or accompanying document to portray      duplicative prints. This subsection continues to require that      a Ramseyer print show the entire text of each section of      statute that is proposed to be repealed and a comparative      print of each amendment to the entire text of a section of      statute the bill or joint resolution proposes to make. The      subsection also clarifies existing practice that appropriate      typographical devices be used for both repealed text and      comparative prints.       Authority to Postpone Record Votes on Certain      Subsection (p) adds motions to recommit and motions to concur      to the list of postponable questions under clause 8 of rule            Conforming Guidelines for Five-Minute Subsection      (q) clarifies that the Speaker's ability to reduce the time      for a vote pursuant to clause 9(b) or 9(c) of rule XX is      subject to the same guidelines as the reduction of the time      for a vote pursuant to clause 8(c)(2) of rule       Electronic Subsection (r) modifies and      codifies a standing order from the 112th, 113th, and 114th      Congresses by designating the electronic document repository      operated by the Clerk of the House for the purposes of      electronic availability rules.       Comparative Prints for Bills or Joint Resolution Considered      on Subsection (s) provides that by December 31, 2017,      each bill, joint resolution, or amendment in the nature of a      substitute shall have an easily searchable electronic      comparative print that shows how the proposed legislation      will change current law, showing by appropriate typographical      devices the omissions and insertions proposed. The subsection      also seeks to enhance transparency on changes made to a      measure after it has been reported by a committee.       Appointments of Subsection (t) allows Delegates and      the Resident Commissioner to serve as chair of the Committee      of the     Section 3. Separate       Holman Subsection (a) provides a new standing order      for the first session of the 115th Congress based on the      ``Holman Rule,'' most of which was removed from the standing      rules in 1983. This standing order functions as an exception      to clause 2 of rule XXI to allow provisions changing law in      certain limited circumstances. Under this order, a provision      in a general appropriation bill or an amendment thereto may      contain legislation to retrench expenditures by (1) reducing      amounts of money in the bill, (2) reducing the number or      salaries of Federal employees, or (3) reducing the      compensation of any person paid by the To qualify      for treatment under this order, an amendment must be offered      after the reading of the bill and must comply with all      applicable rules of the House, such as the germaneness rule.      The purpose of this provision is to see if the reinstatement      of the Holman rule will provide Members with additional tools      to reduce spending during consideration of the regular      general appropriation bills.       Staff Deposition Subsection (b) carries forward      and modifies provisions from the 114th Congress to provide      the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and each      standing committee of the 115th Congress (except for the      Committees on Rules and House Administration) the authority      to order the taking of a deposition by a member or committee      counsel of such committee. The authority provided under this      subsection extends for the entirety of the 115th      Depositions taken under this authority are subject to      regulations issued by the chair of the Committee on Rules and      printed in the Congressional       The subsection modifies the member attendance requirement,      which applies unless (1) the witness waives the requirement      or (2) the committee authorizes the taking of a specified      deposition without the presence of a member during a      specified period and the deposition occurs on a day that the      House is not in session. The latter authority enables a      committee to authorize the taking of one or more such      depositions of one or more specified witnesses at any point      over the course of a specified period of days, such as a      district work period.       Independent Payment Advisory Subsection (c) carries      forward a provision from the 113th and 114th Congresses that      turns off a provision contained in the Affordable Care Act,      which limits the ability of the House to determine the method      of consideration for a recommendation from the Independent      Payment Advisory Board or to repeal the provision in its      entirety.       Providing for Transparency with Respect to Memorials      Submitted Pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the      United Subsection (d) carries forward and modifies      provisions from the 114th Congress that clarify the      procedures of the House regarding the receipt of Article V      memorials from the States by directing the Clerk to make each      memorial, designated by the chair of the Committee on the      Judiciary, electronically available, organized by State of      origin and year of receipt, and indicate whether the memorial      was designated as an application or recession.       In carrying out this subsection, it is expected that the      chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will be solely      charged with determining whether a memorial purports to be an      application of the legislature of a state calling for a      constitutional convention or recession of prior applications.      The Clerk's role will be entirely administrative. The chair      of the Committee on the Judiciary will only designate      memorials from state legislatures (and not petitions from      individuals or other parties), as it is only state      legislatures that are contemplated under Article V of the            In submitting each memorial to the Clerk, the chair of the      Committee on the Judiciary will include a transmission letter      that indicates it has been designated under this subsection      of House Resolution 5. The Clerk will make publicly available      the memorial and the transmission letter from the chair.      Ancillary documentation from the state or other parties is      not expected to be publicized.       The chair of the Committee on the Judiciary is also      permitted to designate memorials from Congresses prior to the      114th Congress to be made publicly available under the same      procedure.       Spending Reduction Amendments in Appropriations      Subsection (e) modifies and carries forward the prohibition      from the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses against      consideration of a general appropriation bill that does not      include a ``spending reduction account.'' The subsection      updates the definition of a spending reduction account to      state a recitation of the amount by which an applicable      allocation of new budget authority under section 302(b)      (Appropriations subcommittee allocations) of the      Congressional Budget Act of 1974 exceeds the amount of new      budget authority proposed by the bill, or if no such      allocation is in effect, $0.       Point of Order Against Motion to Rise and      Subsection (f) carries forward from the 113th and 114th      Congresses the requirement that prevents the Committee of the      Whole from rising to report a bill to the House that exceeds      an applicable allocation of new budget authority under      section 302(b) as estimated by the Committee on the Budget      and continues a point of order.       Limitation on Advance Subsection (g)      provides limits against a fiscal year 2017 general      appropriation bill or measure continuing appropriations from      making advanced appropriations in fiscal year 2018. The      subsection provides a limited number of standard exceptions      which provide advanced appropriations only for fiscal year      2018.       Point of Order Against Increasing Direct      Subsection (h) establishes a point of order against      consideration of a bill or joint resolution reported by a      committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) or an      amendment thereto, or a conference report thereon, which has      the net effect of increasing direct spending in excess of $5      billion for any of the four consecutive ten fiscal year      periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10      fiscal years after the current fiscal year. The subsection      also provides exemptions for measures repealing or reforming      the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health      Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010,      and measures where the chair of the[[Page H14]]     Committee on the Budget made an adjustment to the allocation      levels or limits contained in the most recently adopted      budget resolution.       Disclosure of Directed Rule Subsection (i) carries      forward and modifies the requirement that committee reports      on bills or joint resolutions include a list of directed rule      makings required by the measure or a statement that the      measure contains no directed rule makings. The subsection      carries forward the definition of ``directed rule making'' to      include those rule makings specifically directed to be      completed by a provision in the legislation, but does not      include a grant of discretionary rule making authority. The      prior standing order only required an estimate of the number      of direct rule makings.       Exercise Facilities for Former Subsection (j)      continues the prohibition on access to any exercise facility      that is made available exclusively to Members, former      Members, officers, and former officers of the House and      their spouses to any former Member, former officer, or      spouse who is a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying      Disclosure Act of 1995.       Numbering of Subsection (k) reserves the first 10      numbers for bills (H.1 through H.10) for assignment by      the Speaker and the second 10 numbers (H.11 through H.     20) for assignment by the Minority       Inclusion of U.Code Citations for Proposed Repeals and      Subsection (1) continues to add, to the maximum      extent practicable, a requirement for parallel citations for      amendatory instructions to Public Laws and Statutes at Large      that are not classified in the U.      Broadening Availability of Legislative Documents in      Machine-Readable Subsection (m) continues to      instruct the appropriate officers and committees to continue      to advance government transparency by taking further steps to      publish documents of the House in machine-readable formats.       Congressional Member Organization Transparency      Subsection (n) carries forward the provisions from the 114th      Congress to allow participating Members to enter into      agreements with eligible Congressional Member Organizations      for the purpose of payment of salaries and expenses. The      Committee on House Administration is required to promulgate      regulations, consistent with current law, to carry out this      subsection.       Social Security Subsection (o) carries forward      from the 114th Congress a point of order against legislation      that would reduce the actuarial balance of the Federal Old-     Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, but provides an      exemption to the point of order if a measure improves the      overall financial health of the combined Social Security      Trust This subsection would protect the Old-Age and      Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund from diversion of its      funds to finance a broken Disability Insurance system.       Subsection (p) waives clause 5(d) of rule X      to allow the Committee on Agriculture up to six      subcommittees, which is consistent with authorities in the      114th       Treatment of Conveyances of Federal Subsection (q)      provides that any provision in a bill, joint resolution,      amendment, or conference report requiring or authorizing a      conveyance of federal land to a State, local government, or      tribal entity, shall not be considered as providing new      budget authority, decreasing revenues, increasing mandatory      spending, or increasing outlays.     Section 4. Committees, Commissions, and House       House Democracy Subsection (a) reauthorizes      the House Democracy Assistance Commission, now known as the      House Democracy       Tom Lantos Human Rights Subsection (b)      reauthorizes the Tom Lantos Human Rights       Office of Congressional Subsection (c) reauthorizes      the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) and clarifies that      term limits do not apply to members of the The      subsection reaffirms that a person subject to a review by the      Office of Congressional Ethics has a right to be represented      by counsel, and establishes that invoking such right is not      to be held as a presumption of guilt. The subsection modifies      the language to require consultation prior to the appointment      of members rather than concurrence. The subsection also      prohibits the Office of Congressional Ethics from taking      action that would deny a person any rights or protections      provided under the Constitution of the United States of          Section 5. Additional Orders of       Reading of the Subsection (a) allows the      Speaker to recognize Members for the reading of the      Constitution on any legislative day through January 13, 2017.       Consideration of Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017.      Subsection (b) provides for the consideration of the Midnight      Rules Relief Act of 2017 under a closed rule.

301,topic-id,1226,"Mr.Speaker, today is an exciting day, a brand new 115th Here in the House of Representatives, we have new Members of Congress who are bringing their families, coming to Washington with a sense of exuberance, but mostly with what I believe is respect for the American people who sent them here, respect for the people who elected each of us with the thoughts and ideas from our districts back home, all the way to the election of the President-elect of the United States of America, Donald  So we do this every 2 years. We reorganize the House of We start anew. We start fresh. We start with the best ideas that are brought forth, and we try and bring the teams together. That is what Republicans have done. That is what Democrats are doing. We gather together and add up literally the amount of teams and who is on each side, and that is how we determine who is elected the Speaker of the It is from the majority party. In this case, today we elected the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.Ryan), a great young leader for not just our party, but for our country.  So today what we do is we show up and we exercise our constitutional rights, our duties, our views, the ideas that we have, the ideas that we were sent here to exercise, and the ideas of our majorities, of the bodies, of the groups that we represent.  So today those men and women who gather together with their ideas and plans, they are going to help project and move our country forward over the next 2 years. I think that what we are saying today is important. That is, we are trying to change the direction that this country has been going for at least 2 years, and some could argue for 8 years. We are going to change that direction because the American people have given Republicans an opportunity to lead in the United States House of Representatives, in the United States Senate, and in the Presidency of the United  I believe that we are looking at those elected officials, including the newly elected President, at the next generation, people who will take our places soon, people who we need to leave a better America for, people who are counting on us to, yes, as the saying goes, Make America Great Again, but, more importantly, to live up to the challenges of our job, the challenges that the American people have said we expect you to go to Washington and make tough decisions, not easy decisions, but to do things that are in our best interest rather than in the best interest of a government.  Well, that is what this experiment is about. This experiment takes place every 4 years with the election of a Presidency and perhaps every 2 years with a new  Mr.Speaker, during the first 7 years of the Obama administration, they had an opportunity, the House, to send to the President, to forge a path that they felt would be best for the American people, perhaps based upon a calling or the things that they heard. What happened is that Federal regulations added up to an average of 81 new major regulations per year for a total of 556 regulations, at least 220 of which contained new burdens on individuals and businesses with an annual cost of $108 billion.  We see things differently. That is why you are going to see not only in the rules package, but by the way that we do business here in the House of Representatives, that we look at regulations differently; that we work based upon the law, the intent of the law, not the intent of a regulator who would, as I would suggest, see things perhaps differently than others would see them.  So while it sounds like these are staggering numbers and they do a lot of damage on our country, it is not too late to change that. It is not too late to reevaluate the way things have been done and the way that things should be done.  So we have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do not just about rules and regulations but about the day-to-day business, the progression of GDP, and the growth of jobs and job creation in this country.  For the first time in a long time, we will have a President-elect--yes, Donald Trump--who will, I believe, work with the United States Congress forthrightly and find the avenues of consensus between the House of Representatives and between the United States Senate to push this body.  I met with Mr.Trump earlier in the year when he was just a candidate for the Presidency, and he told me point blank: It is not so much that I am opposed to what you guys are doing in Congress; it is more to I think you ought to be forced into making more tough decisions.  He said: I think Congress gets away from doing the tough things. They do[[Page H15]]the easy lift rather than the things that will be better for the American people, because proud people sent us up here.  That is the standard that, I believe, we should adopt to have and be prepared for in these next 2 years: tough, straightforward, honest work that is meaningful, that can move our country forward, that will propel a generation to believe not only in a great day's pay and a hard day's work, but, more importantly, leading to something that will make our country stronger and yet stronger the next day with a heartbeat from a Nation and a people who deeply believe that America's greatest days are in our future and they are willing to give that to the next generation. That is why we are here.  We have a lot of new Members who bring ideas, Mr.They come here to Washington full and brimming with ideas about things that they would like to see happen. Well, what we are going to do is we are going to make sure that we are ready to do business with them, that we are open and prepared for them.  So you will see that this package carries forward many of the rules from the previous Congress and builds on House Republicans' efforts to streamline House processes, increase transparency, and improve accountability. Specifically, it preserves the important reforms that were made in three previous It also adds perfecting amendments in order to help us further advance and share our ideas and goals of transparency.  We think this is important. We think the ideas that are contained within this package will help propel not only us in better decisionmaking, but the American people will buy into what we are doing.  Fairness is important for all of us. As chairman of the Rules Committee, it is my hope that I will continue to be open, that the Rules Committee will be open to hearing from every single We will welcome them. They will know that they are in the right place to not only share their ideas, but one where they can receive feedback on those ideas and help participate in what we do.

The gentleman and I both know what caused this action was a deep, deep feeling that many Members on your side had about a particular issue. It resulted in what could be seen as--and I saw it as--a protest. Look, we are used to that in this body, people being upset. We are not used to people violating the rule, and it already was a rule that you cannot use, for recording purposes, those devices. We did not make this up. That was already a rule. So it became an advent of a protest.  We are simply trying to say--and I am not trying to get you to change your viewpoints at all--but I think it would be wise, and I believe we will not always be in the majority. I believe some day there will be a chance where the Democrats will be in the majority.

Any rule that has been promulgated in this body is not done on a partisan basis because, see, my majority has people who disagree with necessarily some in our party, too. We did not try and stop anybody from voicing what they would voice, but a rule of decorum has been placed upon that.

I rise in support of the work that the Rules Committee did for the right reason and I will yield the right results.  The American people spoke on November 8, and they asked for change, a change from business as usual. Mr.Speaker, that does mean you can look at geopolitical facts and draw a conclusion as opposed to geopolitical facts and ignore things that happen in the world, and that is exactly what we are doing here today.  The American people no longer want unelected bureaucrats promulgating rules. They no longer want Washington to be so important in their lives. They want and need to be able to have an opportunity to make their own decisions and to work well within the law. They have spoken; and they want what I believe the Republican House, the Republican Senate, and a Republican President will bring to the country. It is called accountability.  The REINS Act, sponsored by Mr.Collins today, addresses many of the issues that I just discussed. The legislation requires that a joint resolution must be approved and must be passed by both Chambers of Congress and signed by the President before any major new rule or regulation is promulgated by the executive branch before it can take place. These are rules written by the Congress, rules then associated and determined by the executive, but with the intent of Congress to make sure that the American people are not further harmed.  Now, Mr.Speaker, we have just heard an opportunity to discuss what was--this discussion that we are having about Israel and the administration. The bottom line is that the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Ed Royce, came before the committee yesterday and said he really did not take issue with what they were doing. He would not support it because it did not address the problem that occurred when the Obama administration, for political purposes, hung the people of Israel and the State of Israel out for the world to condemn and take[[Page H117]]advantage of. It bypassed years and years of American foreign policy. It stunned not only Members of Congress, but it also stunned people who recognize that Israel is in a fight for their life.  Mr.Speaker, we did not, based upon the determination of the Rules Committee, make in order the bill that they had asked for. They can bring it to the floor today, and we are not going to make it available because it does not even discuss the basic facts. That is, the President of the United States unilaterally allowed the State of Israel, who is a dear friend of the United States, to be hung out in the political and the economic world and the world of foreign affairs to be tarnished and taken advantage of.  Mr.Speaker, we are here to say that we were appalled by what our government did and we are going to stand up and call it for what it is. America should always be a trusted friend to Israel, and we are doing exactly that here today.  Mr.Speaker, I predict an overwhelming vote that will take place today to enunciate what we believe is correct and also what was wrong.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

1522,topic-id,1846,"Mr.President, I am here to join so many of my colleagues to oppose efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Outright repeal without a replacement plan will hurt hundreds of thousands of people in New Hampshire as well as millions across this country. The estimate is anywhere from 20 million to 30 million people who will lose their health insurance coverage.  There are all kinds of reasons why this is a bad idea. Many of those have been addressed by my colleagues very eloquently. I wish to speak about a couple of those reasons.  The first is one Senator Durbin alluded to earlier; that is, what repeal of this law will mean for the heroin and opioid epidemic that is facing New Hampshire and so many States across this country. Repeal will dramatically worsen that epidemic because it will deny treatment for people who are abusing substances, and it will also deny them access to mental health services. That will mean a surge in overdose deaths, and it will reverse so much of the progress we are beginning to make.  I understand that sweeping health care reform is not easy. We all know the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. It needs work. The way to address it is not to repeal it, it is to work together to make it better. Rather than rush to destroy the Affordable Care Act with no replacement in sight, we should be working together, on a bipartisan basis, to make commonsense improvements to the law. It can be done. I know, because Tim Scott and I worked together to pass the PACE Act last year to make it easier for us to control health care insurance increases and to allow States to make the determination about group size for health insurance plans.  One of the things I am hopeful about is that President-Elect Trump, in the course of many visits to New Hampshire over the last year, again and again pledged to take robust action to combat the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across Yet, by repealing the Affordable Care Act, President-Elect Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress will make the opioid crisis so much worse. This would be a broken promise to communities all across this country that are struggling with addiction.  The Affordable Care Act has given millions of Americans access to treatment and recovery and saved countless lives, and repealing it would deny treatment to people suffering from substance use disorders. It will cost lives. It will take a terrible toll on communities across  In New Hampshire alone, health care reform has helped over 100,000 people gain access to health care coverage--people like Keith from Rindge, Keith was one of the thousands of Granite Staters able to access quality, affordable health insurance through our State's Medicaid expansion program.  Keith told my office that the Medicaid expansion literally saved his life. Keith was suffering from several health issues when he went to see his doctor after he signed up for the New Hampshire Health Protection Plan, which is what we call our expansion of He told us that had he not had insurance, doctors likely would not have caught his kidney cancer early like they did, but because he had that health insurance, Keith was able to afford and quickly access treatment for[[Page S144]]his cancer. He is thankfully now cancer-free, and he credits having insurance through Medicaid expansion with saving his life.  As I said, New Hampshire is in the midst of a heroin and opioid epidemic. We have talked about the grim statistics frequently in the last year as we have come to the floor. In 2014, we lost 47,000 Americans due to heroin and opioid overdoses. In New Hampshire, when all of the analysis is in for 2016, we are expecting to have lost almost 500 people due to overdose deaths. As Senator Durbin pointed out, we have one of the highest percentages of overdose deaths in the country.  It doesn't have to be that way because addiction is an illness. It is an illness that doesn't have a cure, but we have made progress in treating it. The Affordable Care Act ensures that substance misuse services are covered by insurance. As a direct result of the Affordable Care Act, many of those suffering finally have access to counseling and therapy like medication-assisted treatment.  In addition to covering substance misuse counseling, the Affordable Care Act is also built on mental health parity provisions that require group health plans and insurers offering coverage of mental health services to provide comparable coverage to what they provide for other medical care when it comes to substance misuse.  The Affordable Care Act extended these parity goals by requiring mental health services to be covered as essential health benefits, and it also helped expand access to these services by insuring more patients.  We worked very hard, in a bipartisan way, over the last year in this Chamber to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and to pass the 21st Century Cures Act that provided $1 billion to address heroin and opioid problems in this country. Both of those bills provide significant benefits to people who are suffering from substance misuse. If we repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to undo all of the progress we have made through these supplemental pieces of law because it would reverse the treatment access so many people in New Hampshire and across this country have. Why would we deliberately take away access to this lifesaving treatment from so many people who are struggling to overcome addiction?  Repealing the Affordable Care Act will affect people like Ashley Hurteau of Dover, who said her access to health care as a new Medicaid enrollee was critical to her addiction recovery. She told our newspaper, the Union Leader: ``I am living proof that, by giving individuals suffering with substance use disorders access to health insurance, we, as a society, are giving people like me the chance to be who we really are again.''  I had the opportunity last Friday to visit a program called Hope on Haven Hill in Rochester, It provides help for women with substance misuse issues who are pregnant or who have just delivered babies. It works because these young women are enrolled in our Medicaid expansion program. Without that, they would lose any opportunity for treatment for their substance misuse. When I visited them, they talked about what it was like to be in a place where it was like a home, where people wanted to help them so that they could provide a better life for themselves and their children.  Without access to lifesaving addiction treatment, many people like Ashley and like those young women at Hope on Haven Hill would succumb to their addiction. Again, what is so frustrating about this situation is that it is completely preventable. It is not only the right thing to do, but it is the economic thing to do because the cost of failing to provide treatment for people who have substance misuse disorders is to make sure that they cannot become profitable, taxpaying members of our society.  One other benefit of the Affordable Care Act that, as Senator Murray said, is so critical to 50 percent of our population is access to health care for women. Before the Affordable Care Act, women paid more for health insurance, and contraceptives were something that made insurance cost more. Particularly for women who don't have the economic means, the Affordable Care Act has, for the first time, made contraceptives available to women without cost-sharing requirements like copays, deductibles, and coinsurance. Study after study has shown that access to contraceptives is one of the greatest indicators of success for women. When women are able to plan their pregnancies, they are more likely to graduate from high school, to enroll in college, to have stable and higher paying jobs, and to make sure that their health outcomes are better for themselves, their children, and their families.  It is especially frustrating that last week our Republican colleagues in the House leadership announced that they are going to use the budget processes not only to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the help that it provides to women for contraceptive coverage, but they are also going to use this vehicle to defund Planned This is not only irresponsible, it is dangerous.  Just this morning, Senator Hassan and I visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in Exeter, We talked with women who have benefited from the vital services this center provides to thousands of Granite They talked about how 94 percent of the services provided in New Hampshire Planned Parenthood clinics are related to prevention. This is what one of the volunteers said in talking about the women with whom she had met who had come to Planned Parenthood clinics: What they tell me is that Planned Parenthood saved me.  For so many women who have economic challenges, for low-income women who need access to services in New Hampshire and across the country, they don't have any other place where they can get services if we close down Planned Parenthood clinics. Two counties in New Hampshire don't have community health centers and a place where women can readily go. So defunding Planned Parenthood, closing the doors to Planned Parenthood health centers--in New Hampshire and across this country--would put millions of women in a situation where they have nowhere to go to access basic health care services. This will cost women and their families access to preventive care, and, ultimately, it is going to cost the lives of women.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act is going to actively worsen health outcomes. It will provide less access to care for our most vulnerable populations. It will increase unplanned pregnancies. It will mean that people who have preexisting conditions will not be able to access health insurance in the future. The list goes on and on. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act will not only throw millions of people off their health care, but it will also impact the coverage of millions of others because millions of Americans will see their premiums rise. They will see reinstatement of lifetime limits. They will see reinstatement of expensive cost-sharing requirements, higher deductibles, a reinstatement by health insurance companies of coverage denials, or sky-high premiums because of preexisting conditions. Why would we go back to those exclusionary and detrimental practices? Why would we go back to a time when we had over 20 million fewer people in this country who had access to health insurance?  Now is the time for us to come together. Instead of scrapping this law, we should be working together to improve it, to make it work for all  Make no mistake, repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan, stripping away health insurance for tens of thousands of Granite Staters and over 20 million Americans is not only counterintuitive but it is dangerous.

323,topic-id,1009,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume; and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions) for yielding me the customary time, and I want to wish everybody a happy new year. I hope, circumstances notwithstanding, that we can have one.  I want to follow on what the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Hoyer) was talking about. I have been pretty concerned here since the day we did what was a protest regarding some of the actions we are looking at. Last night, in what I thought was a moment of pique, the majority decided that they would put into the rules package a gutting of the Office of Congressional Ethics, which was totally unconstitutional in the fact that they were not going to get rid of it, but they took everything it had from them and forbade them having on their committee a person who could talk to the press and forbade them talking to people.  Mr.Speaker, that is a gag order. That is against the constitutional right that we have. It was only an hour ago that all of us raised our right hand and swore that we were going to uphold the Constitution, and now, not an hour later, we are struggling to defy it. This is not new for me. I have been very concerned about this since we were here in June and had our protest.  Now, it is our job, and we all said we were going to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. But we may have enemies right here in the room, which is troubling to me, because of what happened last night. I appreciate that cooler heads prevailed and that part was taken out because there was such a hue and cry of: ``What the heck do they think they are doing now?'' So this whole change did not last even 24 hours. In conjunction with that, I need to go back to what happened here on the House floor.  We tried for years to try to do the simplest kinds of things on gun control measures: background checks, closing loopholes, coming up with absolutely nothing. We live in a country now where doctors are forbidden from asking patients if there are guns in the home. Doctors can ask if there are drugs in the home or any other thing that may cause great harm, but they are not allowed, by law, to ask if there are guns in the home. We have gone so far in the gun culture here that 335 million Americans own over 320 million guns, and that is life now in the United  So what we were trying to do, what we thought made the most eminent sense--and I would almost guarantee that not a single American man, woman, or child would object to it--we said, if you were on the terrorist list and you can't fly on an airplane, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun. We called it no fly, no buy. There is such eminent sense in it. But because we are shut out--and I know there is a lot of openness talk going on today, but in the Rules Committee there is none. We didn't have an open rule all year, over this whole last term. We don't get amendments. We don't get to talk. We were desperate to try to do something about the carnage in this country.  Because it was overwhelming to us, we decided something had to be done about letting terrorists who couldn't get on airplanes have guns. So we gathered our people. I think it was totally spontaneous. There was no great plan to do it, no vote to get here. So we sat here and talked peacefully. The microphones were all turned off and C-SPAN was shut out. They couldn't hear what was going on. Because of the times we live in, some of our enterprising Members, they took their iPhones and streamed what was going on on the floor. Then Facebook took it up, and then C-SPAN got it from their stream and the whole country saw what was going on here. It was basically for the first time.  Now, one of the things in the Constitution that we all revere today is the right of peaceful assembly. There were no threats, no action, no violence, no anything. We just said, if we have no bill, we will have no break. Everybody understood exactly what we were trying to do.

375,topic-id,1568,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I include in the Record a description of the many troubling Republican rules changes in 5.       5, the House rules package for the 115th Congress,      contains a number of troubling provisions. Most concerning is      that instead of taking action to address the gun violence      epidemic, Republicans have responded to the Democratic sit-in      of last June by instituting an offensive and possibly      unconstitutional gag rule to punish Members who violate the      rules on decorum. 5 authorizes the Sergeant-at-Arms      to fine Members for the use of photographic and audio or      visual recording devices on the floor. Fines are set at $500      for a first offense and $2,500 for each subsequent offense      and the Chief Administrative Officer is instructed to deduct      such fines from the Member's salary. The resolution also      makes ``disorderly or disruptive conduct'' in the Chamber an      offense for which Members and staff can be referred to the      Ethics There are serious constitutional questions      concerning whether fines can be deducted from Members' pay,      and whether the House can delegate the responsibility of      punishing Members to House officers, but most importantly      this change has the potential to have a chilling effect that      would silence the Minority party and the millions of      constituent they represent.       5 will also dramatically expand the Republican      Majority's investigative powers, giving nearly every      committee the ability to haul private citizens to Washington      to be deposed by Republican staffers. After spending six      years demonstrating their eagerness to spend taxpayer money      on wasteful, politically-motivated witch hunts, Republicans      are giving themselves additional tools to do more of the      same. The rules package gives every committee (except Rules      and House Administration) the ability to force private      citizens to travel to Washington, DC and be subjected to      unlimited hours of interrogation by Republican staff.      Republicans have expanded committees' investigative powers      over the last six years, but even last Congress gave staff      deposition authority to only five standing committees. In      this rules package, for the first time ever, Republicans are      removing entirely any requirement that Members be present      during such depositions (unless the House is in session),      making it much more likely that depositions will be lengthy      and numerous. Freely handing out the power to compel any      American to appear, sit in a room, and answer staff's      invasive questions on the record is truly unprecedented,      unwarranted, and offensive. Note that due to the Majority's      use of this authority to intimidate potential witnesses      during the 114th Congress, the ranking members of the      relevant committees requested that this authority not be      extended at the end of the first session.       Democrats are also troubled that 5's expansion of      staff deposition authority and delegation of Member      punishment to a House officer represent a disturbing trend of      giving to staff powers that ought to be, and have      traditionally been, exercised by       This rules package also includes a worrisome requirement      that each standing committee (except for Appropriations,      Ethics, and Rules) include in its oversight plans      recommendations for moving programs from mandatory to      discretionary funding. This would begin the process of      dismantling the guaranteed funding mechanisms for vital      safety net programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and      Medicaid and expose these programs to the uncertainties of      the annual appropriations process--something the Majority has      been trying to accomplish for years.       With 5's reinstatement of the so-called ``Holman      Rule,'' Republicans are unfairly targeting Federal employees.      The Holman Rule, which was largely removed from the standing      rules in 1983, permits provisions in and amendments to      general appropriations bills that reduce the number of      Federal employees, or reduce the salary of any Federal      employee. Since 1983, such provisions and amendments have      been out of order, as they constitute ``legislating on an      appropriations bill.'' Reinstating this rule represents yet      another effort by the Republican Majority to scapegoat      Federal employees, make cuts to the Federal workforce, and      politicize the civil service system that was established to      professionalize agencies and offices. Moreover, in light of      the President-Elect's transition team asking agencies to      ``name names'' of Federal employees who have implemented      policies with which Republicans disagree, perhaps most      worrisome is the potential use of the Holman Rule to      persecute career employees for doing their jobs during the      Obama       5 also intentionally hides the cost of repealing      the Affordable Care Act (ACA), by preemptively waiving the      Majority's own long-term direct spending point of order for      any ACA repeal legislation. The rules package extends a point      of order against considering legislation that would increase      direct spending by $5 billion or more in any of the four 10-     year periods following the decade after passage of the      legislation. Repealing the ACA will result in increased      direct spending and would very likely violate this long-term      spending point of order, so 5 includes a carve-out      exempting ACA repeal legislation from the point of order      entirely. On top of that, 5 permits the Budget Chair      to apply this waiver to any other legislation she wishes.       Similar to the provision waiving the budgetary point of      order against legislation repealing the ACA, an amendment to      5 was adopted late last night that continues the      Republican practice of disregarding fiscal responsibility by      requiring the House to ignore the fiscal effects of the sale      or transfer of Federal land to a State, local government, or      tribal entity. While this rule was included to simplify the      process for authorizing the transfer of land, and would also      apply to instances when direct spending decreases, it is      irresponsible to authorize such a sale or transfer without      knowing its total cost.[[Page H24]]       Democrats also find 5's change to the rules to make      it easier for the Majority to continue its wasteful,      taxpayer-funded lawsuits in future Congresses very      unfortunate. The rules package takes the unprecedented step      of providing blanket authority for the House, Speaker, or a      committee chair to carry forward any litigation from the      previous Previous rules packages listed specific      matters to be carried over, ensuring a level of transparency      and review that will be absent following this rules change      This change will ultimately permit the Majority to more      easily shield its abuse of the legal process from public      scrutiny.       5 also includes several rules changes that, while      not necessarily problematic on their face, have the potential      to be abused by the First, 5 allows the      Majority to postpone votes on the motion to recommit by      adding such motions, as well as motions to concur, to the      list of questions that can be postponed for up to two      legislative days under clause 8 of rule This same      authority already exists for many other questions and is      typically used for time management. Although this may be      useful in coordinating the timing of floor votes with      Members' schedules, it could be used by the Majority to      postpone votes on Democratic priorities if they are concerned      about losing a vote.       Second, the rules package explicitly states that records      ``created, generated, or received'' by Members' personal      offices are the personal property of the individual Members      and, unlike Committee materials, are not records of the      While this is a codification of a longstanding policy,      the rule change could be exploited by the Majority to store      materials in Member offices in order to circumvent      requirements that they share House records with the      This was a concern in the 114th Congress, for example, in      relation to the Republicans' Planned Parenthood      investigation. Moreover, this change could lend legitimacy to      a defeated Member's decision to refuse to hand over      constituent casework files to his or her successor, which      appears to have happened last year.       Democrats will monitor the Majority's implementation of      these new rules to ensure they are used to assist in the      effective operation of the House and not to prevent Members      of the Minority Party from representing and serving their      constituents.       Finally, Democrats were very concerned with the Republican      Conference's adoption of an amendment to the Rules package      late last night that would have stripped the Office of      Congressional Ethics (OCR) of its independence by placing it      under the authority of the Ethics Committee, thereby      eliminating its role as an effective Congressional watchdog.      It would have effectively gutted the OCE by prohibiting it      from investigating anonymous complaints, prohibiting it from      having a press secretary or from talking to the press at any      time, requiring OCE to refer criminal complaints directly to      the Ethics Committee, and allowing the Ethics Committee to      stop any OCE investigation at any time.       The OCE was created in 2008 to investigate allegations      against Members of Congress, following years of scandal that      tarnished this institution. It was intentionally set up as an      independent body to ensure that it was able to conduct proper      investigations free from political influences and favoritism.      Disciplinary actions against Members have increased      substantially since the OCE's creation, because there is now      finally an office not run by Members of Congress      investigating allegations against Independent      Inspector General offices ensure accountability in the      Executive Branch and the House should be held to the same      standard. This is why the top ethics lawyers to both      Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama have strongly      condemned the Republican effort to gut the       In attempting to implement this rules change, Republicans      showed their true colors. While we are pleased that the      public outcry and negative attention from the media forced      Republicans to backtrack this morning and leave the OCE      intact, it is disturbing that Republicans' first instinct was      to weaken rather than strengthen the House's ethics rules.

614,topic-id,2590,"Mr.President, first let me comment on what my friend, the distinguished Senator from Texas, said. If my cargoes into a ditch, the first thing I don't do is dismantle the car. That doesn't help me get anywhere in terms oftransportation.  First of all, let me speak on process before talking about the substance of what we are really talking about and how itaffects people. We have a bill in front of us that creates a process for the majority to be able to unravel and repealessentially our whole health care system. You pull a thread and it goes through not only employer-based care, patientprotections, people who have insurance, Medicare, All of it begins to unravel. Interestingly, also in this bill, inthe text it adds $1 trillion to the deficit--$1 trillion to the deficit in the bill that our colleagues just voted to proceed topass.  We need to be very clear on this: If colleagues want to work with us to fix problems and improve health care, we can startthis afternoon. It is almost 3:30. By 4 o'clock we could put together a group of people. I am sure our distinguished Democraticleader on the Budget Committee would be happy to sit down and work together on ways to make health care reform better and makehealth care more affordable and make it more available to people. If that is what we want to do, count us in, but that is notwhat we are talking about here. We are talking about this crazy idea that no one in their real life would do.  It is like deciding you want a new house, so you tear down the old house. That is the easy part. Then your family ishomeless. Then you say: Well, gosh, you know, maybe I better have a plan to get a new house for my family and figure out a wayto pay for it, to be able to afford it.  Nobody would do that. Nobody would start by saying: We are going to rip apart the entire health care system and createchaos. We are going to undermine We are going to undermine We are going to take away patient protections foreverybody who has insurance through their employer, and then we will figure out later what we are going to do to replace it, ifanything.  I know there is a division on the Republican side. Certainly Members in the House don't think it should even be replaced atall.  It is interesting. We are talking about one-sixth of the economy that would be destabilized. There is no question that ifyou do a repeal and insurance companies don't know what is coming--I have talked to hospitals, and they don't know what iscoming--behavior will begin to change. Rates will begin to go up. Different decisions will be made because, as businesses, theywill not know how to plan. Their investors will not know how to plan.  There is no question about it. When you repeal without creating certainty in the marketplace, you begin a process thatresults in chaos.  We have an interesting example, one that I have been involved with for a lot of years, where we wanted to change just onepiece of the health care system, the reimbursement system for doctors.  I was in the House when they passed Medicare changes. We put in place a new policy. We were going to write a new policy toreimburse physicians for quality instead of quantity. It makes sense. It took 18 years to get agreement. We got agreement lastyear. It doesn't even take effect for 4 years.  Everybody here knows about this thing called the doc fix. It is an inside term--or SGR, which is even more insider. The truthis, we were trying to change just one thing and could not get agreement to do it for 18 years.  Anyone who thinks that there is going to be a repeal without an ACA extender going on has not looked at past processes.  What is most important, though, is what this means to real people. This[[Page S37]]really is about a plan of ripping apart thehealth care system. There is nothing in its place immediately so we don't even know what will be coming. This is going to makeAmerica sick again.  We are talking about a process and a plan that for real people is not a political game. It is not smoke and mirrors. Itshouldn't be about politics. It is about the moms and dads who go to bed at night and say: Please, God, don't let the kids getsick. Now, many of them--close to 30 million counting everybody with new coverage--don't have to say that. They can say adifferent kind of prayer because they can go see the doctor.  We know that when you unravel that system with nothing responsible in its place, we are talking about making America sickagain. We want affordable care, not chaos. This plan goes from affordable care to chaos. We talk about some parts of what wepassed in health reform, but there are a lot of things we don't emphasize that I think are important to recognize in thisdebate.  First of all, what we pass in terms of changes in quality care affects every single American with health insurance. A lot of people in my State are fortunate to have employer-based insurance. We have a lot of folks at thecollective bargaining table fighting every year to make sure they keep their insurance--150 million people across the country.All of them have benefited from the patient protections we put into health reform. When we take those away, then immediately theinsurance companies will be back in charge. If you get sick, you can get dropped. Right now they can't do that. If you are sickor if your child is sick, right now you can't be blocked from buying insurance. We call it a preexisting condition. But beforehealth reform, insurance companies were doing that every single day--a child with juvenile diabetes, someone with cancer orAlzheimer's disease.  I think about a very good friend of mine who just found out her grandson has leukemia. He is 2 years old. He is goingthrough treatment. We pray he is going to be able to get through it successfully. He is going to have a preexisting conditionfor the rest of his life. With this repeal, there is no guarantee he will ever be able to get insurance. On top of that, if hehas to have treatments that go on for some period of time, caps will be reinstituted on the amount of care you can get, theamount of treatment per year, dollar amount, or amount of visits you can get, and there is no guarantee that this little boywill be able to get the treatment he needs so that he can live a healthy, successful life going forward.  In talking with pediatric cancer doctors a couple of weeks ago, it was so amazing and gratifying to me to hear them talkabout children whose lives have been extended, whose quality of life has been extended because of the fact that they are able tofully treat these children and insurance companies can't put caps on how much they will pay or how many treatments. Now there isa whole other range of protections for everybody.  One of the fights I was proud to lead in the Finance Committee when we passed the ACA was to make sure that the basicinsurance package every company has to provide has to include maternity care. That seems like a no-brainer. People were shockedthat it didn't. Before we passed health reform, 70 percent of the insurance companies--the policies you buy in the private marketdidn't include maternity care. In fact, women were viewed as having a preexisting condition because they might get pregnant,might have a baby. That is not true anymore. Women are not rated differently than men, and maternity care is now availableregardless of the kind of insurance you have. That is a pretty good deal. Right now I have a son and a daughter with growingfamilies, and I can tell you that is a very big deal in my family.  There is a whole range of things. We all know about young people who are able to stay on their parents' insurance. They getout of college and they are wrestling with a huge debt, and one thing they don't have to worry about is whether they can stay ontheir parents' insurance until they can find a job. That goes away with repeal.  Something I care deeply about is mental health. We have all worked together on opioids and substance abuse treatment.Because of what we did in health care reform, insurance companies cannot discriminate if it is mental health or substance abusetreatment rather than physical health treatment. Prior to what we passed, they could charge much higher copays, higher premiums,but not anymore. So the whole body--above the neck as well as below the neck--is now being treated equally with our insurancereforms.  So there are a multitude of things--preventive health services with no copays, such as cancer screenings for mammograms andcontraception. I was talking to someone who said she thought it was so wonderful that her drugstore wasn't charging her forcopays anymore on her contraception. I said: Well, you know, that is actually the law. That was changed when we passed theAffordable Care  So there is a whole range of things that relate to reviewing premium increases, if you get removed from your insurance, youhave the right to appeal. There is a whole range of things. So that is under the first step. Everybody will feel it wheninsurance companies are back in charge and, through this vote and the subsequent actions, patient protections are repealed foreverybody.  Secondly, this includes cuts in Medicare and Through what we did in health reform, we closed the gap on the highcosts of prescription drugs. We called it the doughnut hole. That was in the process of being closed. If you have a lot ofmedicines and a lot of costs, you suddenly get to a point where there is a gap in coverage and you have to pay the full cost.That goes away and the doughnut hole comes back.  What we did added 12 years of solvency to the Medicare trust fund to keep it strong longer. That goes away. Wellness visitsfor seniors--every year they are able to go in and get a physical without a copay--that goes away. So Medicare is undermined.Then, unfortunately, when you add the incoming nominee as Secretary of Health and Human Services and couple that with theproposals that the Speaker has had and others that I am sure we are going to see to turn Medicare into a voucher--you go into theprivate market. Here is your voucher. Good luck. That is part of what the new regime is promoting, which only adds to this.  Eighty percent of Medicaid spending is seniors in nursing homes. And we know that the majority of those who--many who havegotten care, in addition to the exchanges, have been folks who have been working hard every single day in minimum wage jobs andwho couldn't afford or find insurance before. Now they are covered if their State or their Governor is willing to do that. Wehave a whole bunch of folks who are working hard every day at minimum wage who at least know they have access to health care anda doctor.  Interestingly, this helps our hospitals, whether they are rural hospitals upstate or up north in Michigan or whether theyare our great urban hospitals, safety net hospitals in Detroit and other areas, instead of people walking into the emergencyroom and not having insurance and having the cost put on everybody who does. Because of the Medicaid expansion, when a workingperson comes in with Medicaid, they are able to pay for their own care rather than having everybody else with insurance carrythe brunt of that, which is the way it was prior to that.  So there are Medicare and Medicaid cuts.  Next, we do know that altogether, counting Medicaid and people using the new exchanges, we have about 30 million people whowill be kicked off of their insurance, folks who, like anybody else, want to have health insurance for their families. Can wedesign that in a better way? I would love to work with you on that. I am not going to kick them off first. I don't want to say:We are going to rip your insurance away. We are going to rip the small businesses I have talked to--rip their insurance away. Andthen, by the way, don't worry, further down the road we will figure out something else. We don't know what it is, we don't knowwhat it will cost, but trust me.  I wouldn't be trusting that would happen if I were counting on that for my insurance.[[Page S38]]  The fourth item is that there is no question that costs will go up by destabilizing the marketplace. We know the cost ofprescription drugs will go up as a result of taking away the extra help for prescription drugs. There is no question that costsare going to go up for everybody else who has insurance.  When we look at this, I don't know how anybody looking at this outside of a political lens or a rigid ideological lens couldsay this makes any sense. It doesn't make any sense.  We have a President-elect who is coming in who said that he would not do anything to hurt Medicare or Medicaid or Yet the first thing on the floor definitely undermines Medicare and We have a President-elect who said hewants to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Yet, by undermining Medicare prescription drug coverage, those prices aregoing to go up. People who have the most medical needs and need the most medicine are going to see their costs go up.  What would be better would be if the new incoming HHS Secretary would be given the ability to negotiate through Medicare forprescription drugs--something we have all fought for, for a long time. Let's allow drug reimportation. Our leader on thebudget--and I have as well--put seniors on buses in the past to demonstrate the differences in cost across the bridge betweenWindsor and Detroit, the cost of the same drug, with the very same safety provisions. That would bring down costs. Taking awayMedicare coverage and increasing the gap in coverage is exactly the wrong thing to be doing if, in fact, the incoming Presidentreally means it when he says he wants to bring down drug prices.  So there are a number of things we care deeply about on health care. As someone who has worked on this for years--in fact, itwas health care and health policy that first got me into politics, leading an effort to save a nursing home in my community. Icare deeply about this. I am one of the folks way down deep in the weeds on this. But we don't improve a health system byripping it out by its roots, by undermining the whole system without figuring out what comes next. That only happens if youreally don't care what comes next because if you care, that is not a responsible position.  So, Mr.President, and my colleagues, I feel very strongly that with everything we know that has been made available tostrengthen quality, to give people back their own decisionmaking instead of the insurance companies on basics like providingcare for themselves and their families, the strengthening of Medicare and Medicaid, the coverage that has been made available,we know there is a way to work together to make things better, and this is not it.

1559,topic-id,2971,"Mr.President, first I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Pennsylvania who serves with great distinction with me on the Agriculture I love that he is speaking about our farmers. In a few minutes, I am going to talk about Sonya, who is a blueberry farmer and small business owner from We know there are so many small business owners and farmers who finally have been able to find affordable health care because of what was passed in the health care reform act.  I want to thank Senator Casey for being such a strong advocate for those dairy farmers. We have a few dairy farmers in Michigan, as well, and we appreciate very much his advocacy.  I want to take a step back and look broadly for a moment at what is really happening here and why we are so concerned and why we have spent all of this evening and are going on into the night to talk on behalf of the people we represent on the impact of what repealing the Affordable Care Act without having a replacement that is as good or better in place at the time would really mean for people.  Republicans get sick. Democrats get sick. Independents get sick. People who don't vote get sick. This is not a partisan issue. This is about one of the most basic human needs, most basic things that we care about for our families. People go to bed at night and say: Please God, don't let the kids get sick. Make sure Mom is OK, Dad is  Because of the Affordable Care Act, because of the increases in access to affordable health care that we were able to pass a number of years ago, fewer people are having to worry. There are still people worrying, and there are still issues. There are still costs, and there are still things to do. I am anxious to get about the business--all Democrats are anxious to get about the business of making sure that health care is more affordable and doing more to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. I am also concerned about small businesses. There are things that we can do together, that we should be doing on a bipartisan basis, but we shouldn't be repealing health care and unraveling the entire system and creating chaos in the entire system instead of focusing on how we make health care better for families.  The bottom line of what is being proposed--and what this budget resolution is really all about--is going to make America sick again. That is the bottom line. We are going to create a situation where more Americans will be sick and not be able to see a doctor, not be able to find affordable insurance, or not be able to have the protections that they currently have under what we like to call the Patient's Bill of Rights--the patient protections for everybody. Seventy-five percent of Americans get their health insurance through their employer, and every one of them--all of us--have benefited from changes in health care that have taken total control out of the hands of insurance companies and given us more assurances that if we get sick, we are not going to get dropped. If we have an illness or our child has juvenile diabetes or cancer or Alzheimer's or leukemia or high blood pressure or if you are a woman of child-bearing age, which is viewed as a preexisting condition so you have higher rates--all of those things were changed in the interest of the American people.  Basically, when we look at it, there are four different areas where health care reform has made a difference in people's lives and what we are fighting for tonight. We are fighting for these things. We are fighting to have them not taken away and to have the system not ripped up and not create a situation where we cause incredible harm by what Republican colleagues are talking about doing.  The first general category is putting insurance companies back in charge by repealing the patient protections. That is what is being talked about: keeping young people, your son or your daughter, on your insurance until age 26. They graduate from college; they probably already have mounds of debt. Letting them get started in the workplace and stay on your insurance has made an incredible difference for hundreds of thousands of young people across the country. That is gone.  Guaranteed access to essential health benefits. I did fight very hard so that we had a benefit package that includes simple things, important things for women, like maternity care. Prior to health care reform, about 70 percent of the insurance policies that were available in the private market--if a woman were to go out and try to find insurance, about 70 percent didn't provide basic maternity care. Now all the policies have to provide maternity care. Policies have to include mental health and addiction services like physical health, so we are saying that if you have an illness above the neck, it ought to be treated the same as an illness below the neck. These are patient protections for all of us.  In health care today, you can't have your services capped. I have seen and spoken with so many doctors who treat cancer in children and adults. Families talk about the fact that in the past there would be a financial cap or a number of visits or a number of treatments as a limit, and if you were done with your treatment and your doctor didn't feel that you received enough treatments, too bad. Your yearly cap is up or the lifetime cap is up. Right now, that is gone. But with the repeal, those caps come back.  Preventive services with no copay. We want folks getting a wellness visit, getting a mammogram, being able to get contraceptive coverage, being able to get preventive cancer screenings. Doing that without a copay has made a tremendous difference in people being able to get the preventive care they need.  There are so many other things that have been put in place for everyone who has insurance. All of that gets ripped away with repeal, and there is no excuse for that. There is no way we are going to allow that to happen without continuing to fight as hard as we can. It is outrageous.  The second thing is cutting Medicare and All of the health care system is tied together. When we made changes in Medicare, we lengthened the solvency of the trust fund--12 more years of solvency in the trust fund, 12 more years of making sure it is solid, financially viable. That goes away.  My colleagues have talked about prescription drugs and the fact that we have closed this gap in coverage. If you have high bills related to the cost of medicine, right now you are covered. When you get to a certain point and there is a complete gap in coverage and you are not covered anymore, and then you are covered again--folks call that the doughnut hole. We are closing that so there is no gap in coverage.  With repeal, the doughnut hole comes back. Coverage is lost. Costs for medicine go up. Preventive services under Medicare are ripped away if we see a repeal. And there is not a replacement that is put in place that is equal[[Page S168]]to or better than what we currently have.  We have so many people who are working for minimum wage, working really hard at minimum wage jobs, who never had the opportunity to have health insurance before, and now they do. That is gone if the whole system is ripped up. Most of Medicaid goes for seniors in nursing homes, long-term care. If you look at the nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has proposed completely rewriting, ripping up Medicare as we know it, as well as health reform and the Affordable Care Act--if you put all that together with this repeal and somebody who wants dramatic changes--I believe it is $1 trillion in cuts proposed by the current chairman of the Budget Committee or the gentleman who now is being proposed for Secretary of Health and Human Services--Medicare and Medicaid are seriously threatened by all that is talked about right now.  We are talking about, in total, kicking 30 million Americans off their insurance. In Michigan, all together, counting Medicaid and those who are purchasing through the new insurance pools, it is over 2 million people. One out of five people in Michigan and their families will lose their access to a doctor and medical care.  What does all of this mean? It means costs are going to go up both for coverage and prescription drugs. And for Republican colleagues who say: Well, we are going to repeal it now, but not really because we are going to say it is repealed and then we are going to wait 2 or 3 years--first of all, Republicans have had 6 years of talking about repeal. It has been over 50 times in the House of You would think within that time they would have been able to come up with a plan, not a bunch of ideas but a plan to show that, in fact, these things aren't going to happen; that they are not going to unravel the health care system; that they have something bigger, better, greater, but that is not what we are hearing. We are hearing: Well, we don't have it yet; we don't know if we are going to have it. We will try to figure it out somehow, and we will wait 2 or 3 years.  What happens in the insurance market when insurance companies don't have predictability? Rates go up. What happens when hospitals--and I have already been told this in Michigan--don't know what is coming? You pull back. You pull back on investments. You pull back on what you are doing in terms of coverage because you don't know what is coming.  This makes no sense whatsoever. I understand politics. I understand slogans. I understand all the rhetoric that has been said for years about repealing health care reform, but this is the most irresponsible thing I have ever seen in my life if there is a repeal with no replacement immediately that at least equals what people have today--the protections, the coverage, the strengthening of Medicare, the lowering of prescription drug prices under Medicare, the help for people who work hard every day on minimum wage and are finding access to a regular doctor instead of using the emergency room, which, by the way, raises health care costs.  The truth is, we all are here because we care deeply about this. If our colleagues want to stop this craziness of running the cow off the cliff and decide that maybe we are going to work on just fixing it together, we are ready, willing, and able to do that. We know, as with any major change in form, that after they work a while, you have to figure things out and you have to fix problems. We are more than willing; we want to do that. We have been offering to do that and suggesting that for the last several years. But this approach is outrageous and completely irresponsible, and, in fact, it will make America sick again.  Let me conclude by just sharing a couple of stories from constituents in I have heard from a lot of people, particularly small business owners, people who have the freedom now to be able to leave their job where they were working only because of the insurance. That has happened to my own family and friends, where folks are in a job that does not work for them but at least they have insurance.  The Affordable Care Act has given the flexibility for someone to step away, to be able to start their own business or their own farm, like Sonia who is a blueberry farmer in She has written me, indicating they are extremely fearful that they are going to lose their insurance under the new administration because of what Republicans are talking about.  She says:       A number of years back in 2000 I quit my traditional job      and my husband, who had been laid off, and I bought my step-     dad's blueberry farm. He had passed away in 1995, and we took      care of my mom who had inherited the farm, and lived with us      for a year and a half until her death. We are full-time      farmers, small farmers, about 15 acres of blueberries. We      also have a small garden center, Sweet Summer Gardens, which      is open from May to September, and a small bead store, the      Enchanted It is open year round.  She says:       We are hard-working people who love the life that we have      carved out for ourselves, but there some drawbacks to being      self-employed and small business owners. In 2012, I tore the      meniscus in my right knee. I did nothing to take care of it      because I did not have insurance. But then in April of 2015,      3 years after the injury, I finally got to the point where I      could no longer take the pain. Luckily, we had signed up for      insurance through the Affordable Care I was able to have      the severe tear repaired.  Then she goes on to talk about how a little later there was a cancer scare, and she had to go in for ultrasounds and lab work and an outpatient D& Because she was able to do that, she was fortunately able to find out it was not cancer, thank goodness. Again, because of the Affordable Care Act and her insurance, she was able to get the services she needed. She goes on to talk about a number of different health challenges for them, including the following:       Finally we have coverage for preventive care. My husband      had a physical, the first time since high school, and we      found out that there was an issue that needed to be      addressed. He was referred to an orthopedic surgeon,      discovered he had severe arthritis. It was causing constant      pain. Again, we were able to have insurance coverage. Because      of the Affordable Care Act, he was able to have this      repaired.  She says:       We are hard-working people. We have never asked for help.      But we are extremely concerned because we could not afford      our insurance right now without the tax credits--the subsidy.  She says:       This morning, watching the news, we were met with a story      that the Republicans are all ready to repeal They      said that while they couldn't take away the insurance, they      could take away the subsidies. This would put insurance out      of our range and we would no longer be able to afford it. My      husband Larry said to me, ``they couldn't just throw us out      to the dogs, could they?''  She says:       My reply was, ``anything is possible.''       I know the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. I know that      not everyone has taken advantage of it, but there has to be a      way to fix it without hurting the millions of people who have      been helped by it.  In fact, Sonia, there is a way to fix it without hurting you and your husband, full-time farmers and small business owners. I have a number of other stories. I am going to pause because I have other colleagues who I know want to speak who care deeply about this as well. I will share those at a later point.  Let me just say, what we are talking about is not a game. It is not. This is about real people with real lives who are encountering situations that could happen to any of us. Too many people are not in a situation, without Medicare or Medicaid coverage or access to health care through the exchanges, to be able to see the doctor and get the care they need. That has changed in the last number of years.  There is more to do. We can work together to make it even better, but the idea that people are not being helped today, that small business owners and farmers and families are not getting medical care today because of what was done is just not true. It is just not true. The reality is, we are in a better spot with more to do. Pulling the thread and unraveling the entire system and creating chaos in the entire system makes no sense.  So we as Democrats are going to do whatever we can. We know that ultimately the votes are there. If the Republicans in the House and the Senate and the new President want to completely dismantle the health care system, unravel the health care system, weaken Medicare, and weaken Medicaid, you can do it. You have the votes to do it.[[Page S169]]  People right now who get care, the millions of people, the over 2 million people in Michigan alone who have been directly helped by the Affordable Care Act, they know that. They will know when that is no longer available to them. It will hurt many, many people. We hope colleagues will take a second look and decide to work with us in a way to move forward on health care that will allow people to get the care they need at an affordable price for themselves and their families.  I know that is what we all want for our families. We should be doing everything humanly possible to make sure people have the affordable care they need and the protections they need to get care when they need it.  I yield the floor.

1876,topic-id,1895,"Mr.President, let me first say to the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee that we look forward to seeing the replacement as well because that is really the key right now. People across the country are saying: Wait a minute. You are going to unravel a system. You are going to repeal and take away the health care that I have and the patient protections that I have, and we don't even know if it will be better.  Why in the world would that be done if the new system wasn't going to be better than the old system?  Right now we don't see anything. We see 6 years of repeals coming from the House and Senate and no plans. We still don't see a plan, and we have no idea. More importantly, there are millions of people with insurance who are either getting patient protections or affordable care they couldn't get before or have Medicare strengthened or Medicaid support, and no one knows what will happen next. Doctors, nurses, health care providers--no one knows what is going to happen next. I think it is the most irresponsible approach to addressing one of the basic needs for all of our families that we could ever have. So we know that in the end, when you pull the thread, essentially, you unravel the whole system. That, minimally, creates instability in the entire economy. There is no plan being held up that would improve health care, which we are all for. I am all for making the health care system more affordable for families, strengthening health care. Let's do it. Unravelling and creating chaos in the health care system--no. It makes absolutely no sense, and we know that it is just going to make America sick again.  I want to share a couple of stories. First, we hear from Mary of Dundee, who owns a small business and has a 20-year-old daughter with a preexisting condition. For her, coverage--but, also, what we call the Patients' Bill of Rights--is absolutely critical. That is part of the Affordable Care Act that affects everybody with insurance. Seventy-five percent of Americans get their insurance through their employer. In the past, they could get dropped if they got sick, if they had diabetes or had a child with juvenile diabetes or had a heart condition or high blood pressure. Women who were of childbearing years could be viewed as having a preexisting condition. In the past, insurance companies had total control to decide who got coverage, when they got dropped, what would happen when you got sick and needed medical care. That changed with a Patients' Bill of Rights in the Affordable Care There are a whole range of protections to make sure the insurance you pay for every month actually provides the medical care when you need it for you and your family.  Let's start with Mary's story. She wanted to express her concern about repealing the Affordable Care Act, and I appreciate very much the fact that she shared her story with me. She says:       My family and I have purchased our coverage through the      [ACA] marketplace for 2015, 2016, and 2017. This opportunity      has allowed us to become self-employed. . . .  They could open their own business. They weren't tied to their job because of the need of health insurance. They now have opened their own small business in Dundee,       Prior to the ACA, I was working to provide coverage--  How many times have we heard that? I have heard that even in my own extended family--     then I lost my full time status and as a part-time employee,      the hours I worked barely covered my portion of my employer      provided healthcare.       By enrolling for coverage through the marketplace, I was      able to pick the coverage needed for our family at an      affordable price . . . not knowing what the future held      becoming self employed. We have three daughters. Our oldest      has life threatening allergies and asthma. I did not need to      worry that we would be denied coverage due to preexisting      conditions.       As Congress proceeds to dismantle the ACA, I am concerned      for my oldest daughter who is in her sophomore year at the      University of Michigan-She is 20 years old. . . .      Will she continue to have coverage through our insurance      until she is 26 as the ACA provides? If not, what kind of      coverage will she be able to afford due to her preexisting      conditions? Why put more obstacles in the way of our young      adults?  That is a really good question, It makes no sense to do that.  She goes on to say:       The ACA, we're sure, has faults . . . and like everything,      could be improved, but to scrap it and not use it at least as      a ``seed'' to grow and improve is beyond my understanding. To      suggest that there is nothing to keep is absurd and 20-30      million Americans enrolled . . . agree with us.  I agree with you as well, Thank you for sharing your story.  The coverage in the Affordable Care Act and the strengthening of Medicare and Medicaid are critical, as are the patient protections--the Patient Bill of Rights that affects people who buy insurance now, who finally got control[[Page S187]]back from insurance companies that made every single decision. Being able to know that, if, in fact, you get sick or your child has a serious health condition, they won't be denied care for the rest of their lives, and also being able to have them on your insurance as they start off in life--there are so many protections. The caps on treatments and the number of treatments and services provided have been eliminated. The Patients' Bill of Rights is absolutely critical.  I want to take just a moment to speak about another piece of this, which relates to the Patients' Bill of Rights as it relates to women. In the past, the majority of plans--about 70 percent of the insurance plans in the private sector that a woman might try to choose and purchase--wouldn't cover basic maternity care. I couldn't believe it when I first heard that. Wait a minute. It wouldn't cover basic maternity care? Now every plan has to cover basic maternity care. It makes sense. No longer is just being a woman a preexisting condition. That is part of the Patients' Bill of  The capacity to now get preventive care, a mammogram, cancer screenings, and other types of preventive care is done without a copay. So we want people to go and get that checkup and, if there is a problem, to be able to tackle it early. That is most important because it is better for the person, but it also means there will be less cost to the health care system if you can catch something early. So the Patients' Bill of Rights is really critical to that.  There is something else that is also in here that is appalling to me and goes directly to the question of women's health care, and that is the fact that this bill repeals Planned Parenthood services and, basically, guts health care for women across Michigan and women across the country. For 75 percent of the women who use a Planned Parenthood clinic in Michigan, their visit will be the only health care they get all year.  We have rural counties in northern Michigan where the only health care clinics doing preventive care--cancer screenings, basic services, OB/GYN visits--are the Planned Parenthood clinics. So many women across Michigan will see their access to health care denied if this passes and Planned Parenthood loses its funding. There were 71,000 patients, the majority of them women, in Michigan in 2014, who received care--breast exams, Pap smears, prenatal visits. Again, tying this all together, we want to cover maternity care, but we also want healthy moms and healthy babies, and that means prenatal care. We have communities in these small towns, as well as in the big cities. But it affects small towns and rural communities around Michigan, where women are going to be denied services, and it is the only clinic that is there.  I want to share a story from Laurie in Jonesville about the Affordable Care Act and her particular situation. She said:       I have had type I diabetes for 54 years and when I needed      to retire early at the age of 62 because of complications      related to diabetes, I looked at the ACA for health      insurance. . . . I couldn't afford       I was able to buy health insurance at what I consider an      affordable price with a small copay for my medications, the      most expensive one being insulin at a retail price of $296 a      month. As you know, my preexisting conditions of type I      diabetes, heart disease and a visual impairment, both      complications of diabetes, would have been uninsurable      without the I would have been uninsurable.  That is without the Patients' Bill of Rights, which says she has a right to be able to purchase health insurance.       In June of 2016 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, luckily      diagnosed at Stage 1 in a routine mammogram. Without the ACA      I wouldn't have been able to afford the mammogram or the      subsequent treatment without depleting our life savings. I      quickly reached my maximum out of pocket cost and while some      people would complain about having to pay that, not me! My      total bill so far is over $150,000. . . .  That is for her cancer treatment.  There is the combination here of repealing Planned Parenthood funding for health clinics that allow someone like Laurie to go in and get a mammogram rather than waiting until she has a level of breast cancer that cannot be effectively treated or might otherwise cause loss of life. She was able to catch this early because she was able to get a screening--a mammogram--the kind of treatment that women in small towns all over Michigan have the capacity to do now because of the reasonable copays for care and partly because there is no copay for that mammogram but also because they have a clinic available in their community where they can get the care. All of this fits together--the access to preventive care for women, the health care clinics that are available around Michigan and around the country, and the Patients' Bill of Rights, which says you have a right to care. This is not just about the insurance company basing every decision on the fact that they want to make more money rather than cover you. You have a right to make sure that when you get sick, you don't get dropped, and, if you have breast cancer or diabetes, you have a right to have access to affordable health care.  So I would hope that our colleagues would join together, stop this craziness of trying to repeal health reform and protections for every single American, and, instead, sit down together and look at how we can make it better.  Our Republican colleagues will find willing partners in making the system more affordable and better, but we will continue to be the strongest possible opponents of ripping the system apart and creating chaos for American families.

Professor Hayes teaches writing at the University of Alaska Southeast and is the author of two extraordinary award-winning memoirs, the ``Blonde Indian,'' and the ``Tao of Raven.'' Her books chart her unique experiences of growing up in Juneau as a Tlingit at a time when Alaska Natives were denied basic rights and ``No Native'' signs were common on storefronts.  Her career as a writer and a teacher began in her fifties. Living the principle that learning should be a lifetime passion, she graduated from the University of Alaska Southeast--magna cum laude, I might add--when she was 55 years old. In between, she moved to California, where she struggled to find purpose, and, as she put it, she was determined to go back home to Alaska or die facing north.  Thankfully, for us, she made it back home. In the ``Tao of Raven,'' she weaves in the story of Raven and the box of light. Professor Hayes writes about the importance of giving back to the community. ``Although Raven could well have decided to keep light and luster and blinding brilliance for only his own pleasure,'' she writes, ``he knew that to keep riches to oneself guarantees their decline.''

27,topic-id,660,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act of 2017.  This bill requires VA to keep a permanent copy of an admonishment or reprimand in a VA employee's personnel file. Currently, an informal admonishment remains on a VA employee's record for 2 years, while a more serious written reprimand stays in the file for more than 3 years.  Maintaining a comprehensive record of VA employees' personnel files will allow VA managers to track their employees' improvement, or lack thereof, related to the specific problem addressed in the original complaint. This approach will increase transparency, allow VA managers to address problematic performance, and give VA employees a chance to improve.  Although I support this bill, I want to address concerns raised by the American Federation of Government Employees and include this letter in the Congressional         American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                                  January 3, 2017.     Re H.27, Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation      of Government Employees (AFGE), which represents nearly      700,000 federal employees, including 230,000 non-management      employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), I      strongly urge you to oppose H.27, the Ensuring VA      Employees Accountability The bill is scheduled for floor      consideration this week under suspension of the rules.       This bill would deprive every VA employee, including non-     managerial employees, of the chance to clear his or her name      after receiving an unjustified reprimand from a manager who      is acting out of incompetence, bias, anti-veteran animus or      whistleblower retaliation.       H.27 would not increase accountability for VA      mismanagement. However, it would deprive the 115,000 veterans      in the VA workforce of the record expungement rights they had      as military personnel. It would also deprive veterans in the      VA workforce, and all VA employees, of second chances after      they receive reprimands or admonishments early in their      careers. If this bill is enacted, VA employees will no longer      have any rights to expunge their personnel files even if the      reprimands or admonishments were placed in their files      decades ago.       In addition, this bill would have an adverse impact on      agency operations and the VA's ability to recruit and retain      a strong workforce. It would divert precious VA resources      away from caring for veterans through an increase in wasteful      litigation because the bill eliminates the use of an      extremely efficient tool for settling personnel matters      through Clear Record Settlement Agreements (CRAs).       CRAs give VA managers the flexibility to resolve routine      personnel disputes efficiently and quickly without protracted      litigation or destruction of the VA careers of front line      employees, including large numbers of service-connected      disabled veterans who provide medical care, clean operating      rooms, process benefit claims, police VA facilities, and set      cemetery headstones. The Merit Systems Protection Board      (MSPB) stated in its 2013 report, Clear Record Settlement      Agreements and the Law, that 95% of agency representatives      resolved disputes using negotiated settlement agreements      (NSAs) and 89% of these agreements involved       Congress has received a great deal of testimony in recent      years from brave whistleblowers and their labor      representatives regarding the widespread management abuse of      reprimands to punish employees and destroy their VA careers.      Similarly, Congress has provided steadfast support to active      duty personnel making the often-difficult transition to      civilian employment, including VA support in the form of      vocational rehabilitation, compensated work therapy, PTSD      treatment, and programs to address homelessness and substance      abuse.       H.27 is at best ambiguous about the fate of veterans who      leave VA employment for deployment and then seek to return to      the VA workforce. Would reprimands that were placed in their      personnel files prior to deployment still be visible to all      potential VA employers reviewing the returning veteran's      application?       In closing, AFGE urges lawmakers to reject this      counterproductive assault on VA front line employees who are,      too often, unfairly reprimanded by hostile, unsupportive and      incompetent managers and human resources personnel.[[Page H31]]       Thank you for considering our views on this bill.

28,topic-id,252,"Mr.Speaker, I share these concerns and intend to work with my colleagues across the aisle and in the Senate to ensure that if this bill passes into law, the change will not adversely impact whistleblowers, the thousands of veterans employed by the VA, and the VA employees who work hard every day to support the needs of our Nation's veterans.  Whistleblowers and employees who face unlawful retaliation from managers should have the opportunity to clear their names before any proposed admonishments or reprimands are made permanent in their records. I also want to clarify that this bill should not be used to eliminate the VA's ability to enter into clear record settlement agreements with employees or get in the way of resolving personnel matters in an efficient manner.  In our efforts to enhance personnel policies at the VA, it is important that we remember that one-third of VA employees are veterans themselves, and many more have immediate family members who are veterans. Many of these employees are also hardworking doctors and nurses who want to provide quality care for their patients. These Federal civil servants want to do a good job in order to provide veterans the best possible service, and this bill should not be used by managers to intimidate or retaliate against these employees.  This bill simply requires VA to maintain a complete record of a VA employee's personnel file, a practice intended to increase transparency and ultimately improve outcomes for veterans.

I rise today in support of the Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety This bill will require the VA to implement a standard identification system for biological implants that is consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's unique device identification system. This system will allow for the tracking of implants from donor to recipients. This bill will also require VA to procure biological implants only from vendors using the system and only through competitive procurement processes.  The GAO has testified that the Veterans Health Administration is one of the largest purchasers of surgical implants, which include biological implants such as skin and bone grafts, and nonbiological implants such as cardiac pacemakers and artificial joints. The GAO has raised valid concerns regarding VA medical centers complying with VHA requirements for documenting surgical implants purchased from the open market and VHA's ability to identify veterans who received an implant that is being recalled by the manufacturer or the Food and Drug  Patient safety is our number one concern. We all want to ensure that VA policies are fully followed in this regard. The legislation will continue to protect veterans while they receive the best care available.

I don't want to ruin his reputation by saying that we absolutely embrace him because that would make his side of the aisle, I think, a little worried, but the fact is we believe that Chairman Roe is someone that we can work with and who has a genuine, sincere concern for veterans. He is a veteran himself. He is a medical doctor. As we try to gain the trust of veterans and gain the trust of Americans in VA health care and the veterans department, we are very much looking forward to working with him.

1872,topic-id,996,"Mr.President, last week the Senate began consideration of the ObamaCare repeal resolution, which is the first step in the process of repealing the law. It is time for repeal.  Seven years ago, ObamaCare was sold to the American people with a lot of promises. The law was going to reduce premiums for families. It was going to fix problems with our health care system without hurting anyone who was happy with their health coverage. If you like your health plan, you will be able to keep it, people all across this country were told over and over again. If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor--also a promise and claim that was made over and over again. As everyone knows, every one of these promises was broken. Premiums for families have continued to rise. Millions of Americans lost health care plans that they liked. Americans regularly discovered that they couldn't keep their doctors and that choice of replacement was often limited.  These broken promises were just the tip of the iceberg. The law hasn't just failed to live up to its promises, it is actively collapsing, and the status quo is unsustainable. Premiums on the exchanges are soaring. Deductibles regularly run into the thousands of dollars. For 2017, the average deductible for a bronze-level ObamaCare plan is rising from $5,731 to $6,092. With deductibles like that, it is no wonder that some Americans can't afford to actually use their ObamaCare insurance.  I receive a lot of mail from constituents in my State struggling to pay for their health care. One constituent contacted me to say: ``My ObamaCare premium went up from $1,080 per month to $1,775 per month,'' a 64-percent increase, $21,300 a year for health insurance. Let me just repeat that, a 64-percent increase in premiums, $21,300 a year for health insurance. That is like paying another mortgage. That is a lot more than many people pay for their mortgage, and of course that is before any deductibles or other out-of-pocket costs are considered.  Another constituent wrote to tell me, ``Today I received a new premium notice from my ObamaCare insurance. My policy rate for myself, my wife and my teenage son has increased by 357 percent.''  The problems on the exchanges aren't limited to soaring costs, unfortunately. Insurers are pulling out of the exchanges right and left. Health care choices are rapidly dwindling. Narrow provider networks are the order of the day. One-third of American counties have just one choice of health insurer on their exchange.  This is not the health care reform the American people were looking for.[[Page S185]]So it is no surprise that a recent Gallup poll found that 80 percent of Americans want major changes to ObamaCare or want the law entirely repealed and replaced or that 74 percent of American voters ranked health care as a very important voting issue for them in the 2016 elections. ObamaCare has not fixed our Nation's health care problems. It has made them worse. The American people deserve better.  Last week, the Senate started considering the ObamaCare repeal resolution, and we are continuing that process this week. This resolution will provide us with the tools we need to repeal the law, and then committees will get to work on the actual repeal bills. Then we will work step-by-step to replace ObamaCare with real health care reform that focuses on personalized, patient-centered care.  One massive problem with ObamaCare is the fact that it puts Washington in charge of health care decisions that should be made at a much lower level. The ObamaCare reform the Republicans pass will focus on fixing this. We are going to move control from Washington and give it back to States and the individuals. Health care issues don't have one size-fits-all solutions. It is time to stop acting like they do.  States should have the power to innovate and embrace health care solutions that work for the individuals and the employers of their Individuals should be able to make health care decisions in consultation with their doctors, not with Washington, Another thing we are going to focus on is breaking down the ObamaCare barriers that have artificially restricted choice.  As I said earlier, ObamaCare has defaulted to a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to health care, and that means that many Americans have found themselves paying for health care they don't need or want. We need much more flexibility in insurance plans. A thriving health care system would offer a wide variety of choices that would allow Americans to pick a plan tailored to their needs, that would be a competitive system that gives people in this country more choices, and inevitably what happens in those circumstances, that pushes the cost down.  We also need to give Americans the tools to better manage their health care and control costs. Of course, any reform plan has to make sure small businesses have the tools they need to provide the employees with affordable health coverage. ObamaCare has placed huge burdens on small businesses that have made it difficult for them to thrive and even to survive. It is time to lift these burdens and free up these businesses to grow and create jobs.  Our health care system wasn't perfect before We all acknowledge that, but ObamaCare was not the answer. Instead of fixing the problems in our health care system, it just made things worse. Republicans are ready to implement the kind of health care reform the American people are looking for: more affordable, more personal, more flexible health care coverage that meets their needs and is less bureaucratic.  The American people are ready for health care reform that actually works, and that is exactly what Republicans are going to give them starting right now.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1792,topic-id,1187,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Garamendi for bringing us together in this Special Order format to talk about some key critical components that address American families significantly. Representative Garamendi and Representative Marcy Kaptur, who both do their homework, are a great addition to the House because they challenge us with facts, not fiction. They care deeply and passionately about improving and enhancing the quality of life. So to stand with both on this issue is a good feeling for me.  Just a couple of observations: I think it is okay for government to have a heart. We speak to the heart and soul of working families across this country by understanding that health care is not a privilege; it is a right.  So let's begin with that fundamental basic observation, a right. What we have seen with this right is that over 30 million Americans have been added to the rolls of the insured over the course of the Affordable Care  Now, Representative Kaptur did a great job of speaking to history of[[Page H293]]Medicare, of Social Security, and of the Affordable Care Act, as did Representative I remember being at the 75th anniversary celebration of Social Security, and people were talking about the discrediting going on before Social Security was enacted into law. There were those who demonized it before it became law. There were those who have fought it ever since. They don't want that right for working families.  I would suggest that Social Security, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act are rock solid elements of a foundation upon which to grow quality of life and longevity. It is a basic fundamental additive that, when brought to our working families across this country, we are providing a service and we are addressing them with dignity. That is what this is about.  The demonization of the Affordable Care Act is interesting. Because if you look at polling, you will find that people say that ObamaCare is destroying the Well, what about the Affordable Care Act? That is working. My friends, it is the same issue, it is the same concept, and it is the same program.  So what we have tried to do is discredit a program that took on a major challenge, took on major industries, and needed to provide a balance and an actuarial outcome that is providing a go-forward and accomplish what you have enacted as a mission. The actuarial science has got to be precise.  So for those who want to repeal, they are talking about, in cases, pulling a brick out of the foundation and having it get wobbly, and it is going to crash the marketplace. We are going to have all of these people who have been enrolled or have been forever enrolled in health care impacted by rising costs and disruptive outcomes that will put them at risk.  So like the Social Security Program before the ACA, like Medicare before the ACA, as you floated these boats, as you went forward with time, you learned where you needed to tweak, and you adjusted, by amendment format, to make the program stronger. That is what we have been asking for in a partnership here in the House and with the Let's work on those areas that may need improvement, but do not repeal because repeal without replacement is a disaster. It is a disaster waiting to happen.  We have provided hope for working families across this country. We have had the testimony presented to us, anecdotal evidence, that this is working, that for the first time families have enjoyed a connection to a system, a standardized approach. What was the program?  People say: Well, I don't want to pay for someone else's health care. You have been paying for it before the It was called the emergency room. It wasn't standardized because whoever you got at that emergency room in whatever location, as you traveled looking for assistance, didn't provide a steady flow. It was a wasteful outcome for taxpayers and an insufficient outcome, a cruel outcome for those consumers who were impacted by being underinsured or uninsured.  So let's set the record straight. We have had a program up and running for 8 years now. The Republicans have chastised this program saying it needs to be repealed. We have taken over 65 votes, or 65 votes, I believe, to repeal, but there has never been a replacement plan. So what kind of gimmick is this to pull away a program that is working for tens of millions of families added to the rolls but not replace? That is disaster waiting to happen.  So we challenge our colleagues here in the House and in the Senate down the hall to be academic about this, to be compassionate about it, to be passionate in our resolve, and to make a difference by putting together the improvements that we require and not repealing.  Now, we look at the Affordable Care Act and what it means to our health care. But if you repeal, you will wreak damage on the budget. You will destroy our economy. You will have a huge workforce displacement, and you will slash care for America's working families. Is this the outcome that we want?  Remember, we were the last industrialized nation to come to the table and provide guaranteed health care for our families. That is not something of which we are proud. That was destructive. That was insensitive. It was not effective. It was a waste of tax dollars the way we did it.  So now we go forward with a program that allows us to now take a look at the history, albeit brief, on the Affordable Care Act, but understanding where we need to fine tune. We do that, and the challenge is there for all of us: take the cost out of the system for a stronger future and provide at least the same level of quality, if not enhanced quality, as we go forward. That should unite us in a common cause, cutting the cost of the program and enhancing the quality of services provided. What a great mission for all of us to embark upon.  So let's not play politics with the health care for tens of millions of people who are new to the system and for all of us who have been covered routinely by the system. We can do better than that.  Let the lessons of Social Security and Medicare, which, as my colleagues indicated earlier, address the American public with dignity, improvement, enhancement, and hope, the best commodity we can deliver as a government to her people.  So I thank Representative Garamendi for the opportunity for us to speak to these issues. Frankness is required right now. The lack of theater would be an improvement. No theater on this. Let's settle for facts, not fiction, and working together to bring about what is a sound resolve that allows us to provide stability and success for the American public. That, I don't think, is too much to ask.  So I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) for bringing us together.

1794,topic-id,955,"Thank you, Representative  As you talk about public sentiment about Social Security, the Affordable Care Act, and hearing the evidence you have provided from your constituent within your district, it becomes very apparent where the American public is.  When polled recently, only 20 percent of the American public is in support of efforts to repeal without replacement--20 percent. So the great, great majority understands what is going on here.  We have also seen during the recent campaign season, which probably went a year and a half to 2 years long, a lot of talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, undoing the act. That happened in the same timeframe as 11.5 million people were added to the rolls for 2017. So there is an appeal here that is drawing the American public toward the coverage provided by So the sentiment here is to get things done and provide, again, the stability.  I am also a cosponsor of legislation entitled Strengthening Social Security Act that would improve how we calculate the benefits for Social We are not advancing reducing those benefits or raising the retirement age to 69 or whatever level; we are talking about enhancing benefits. When you talk to seniors, they will say we either have got nothing or we got just a bit of an increase that was taken away with the other hand for some other purpose.  So, yes, we need to revisit just how we give that green light to a COLA adjustment, and we need to calculate that approval with items that are truly essential for the senior citizens, not big screen televisions or certain items that are adding to a luxurious note, but one that speaks to their basic core needs to live day to day. So the Strengthening Social Security Act does just that. It takes into account all of the essentials in that calculus that will determine whether or not a COLA adjustment is given that given year. So that is important.  I also believe it is time for us to look at that cap that we have created, that we have placed on contributions to Social You know, some people by February 12 or 14, whatever date it is, are done paying. They are done contributing by that point in the year. Well, the standards of $118,000, or $127,000 coming this year, are just capturing most of those revenues. The hardship is placed on the working, middle-income community, those looking to ascend the middle class. There could be a far greater contribution from other income strata that we ought to look at to provide stability.  A point needs to be made that Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act are all intertwined. There were strengtheners that were provided for these programs. There was a partnership of revenue stream that was calculated and assumed that again provides for the quality of response to the consuming public, and especially those in senior years.  I have a large percentage of senior citizens in the makeup of my constituency. It is important to recognize that many who are on Medicare end up getting Medicaid assistance because of situations that are called upon where they are perhaps placed in nursing homes, adult homes, or the like. So we have to be cognizant here of the public sentiment, where is their thinking, and we know exactly what they want. They want stability for these programs. They want strengthening of the programs. They want to make certain that all of these efforts that have lasted for decades, or were introduced as late as 2010, will continue so they have a future that is that more secure, that more certain.  So tonight we talk and implore our colleagues to please help improve the Affordable Care Let's not repeal, and certainly do not repeal without a replacement plan. That is a disaster that will really cause havoc in the marketplace. It is one that doesn't prove to be actuarially sound. Also, let's make certain that we don't have these efforts again to voucherize Medicare, to privatize Social These are programs that have provided stability.[[Page H295]]  When I came into the House in 2009, it was at the lowest point of the recession which President Obama was handed upon his entering into the There were 700,000, 800,000, 900,000 jobs lost a month in the deepest, darkest moment of the recession. What did we see? We saw individuals who took their lifetime's worth of savings and entrusted them to a marketplace, and they lost everything for which they had ever worked, and others realized they didn't lose a single cent of Social Therein lies a tremendous bit of testimony as to the meritorious achievements of a Social Security system, one that provided that safety net for all families, one that made certain there was some sort of continuous flow, a backup, a reinforcement, as you went into retirement years.  We are reminded of Medicare and what the results were for retirees, how long they were expected to live and what their quality of life was like. It was tremendously, favorably turned around with the benefits of  So with an impassioned plea, I encourage this House, the Senate, to do the right thing: stand for the American public and allow them to be addressed with dignity with these programs that have proven themselves. And where there is a need to further assist, as there has been time and time and time again with Social Security, as there has been time and time again with Medicare, let's provide that same approach to the Affordable Care  I thank the gentleman from California for bringing us together and being able to share our thoughts and advocacy to do the right thing.

Some of the most cherished efforts of the Affordable Care Act are about preexisting conditions. Being a woman, being a pregnant woman, or being a woman or a man fighting cancer made it very difficult for people to get that insurance, and lifetime caps. You know, people being rolled into surgery, wheeled into surgery, and being told that they were discontinuing their plan.  So these are elements of the Affordable Care Act that could be at risk if we start playing around with the actuarial balance that has been achieved.

When we talk about regulatory reform, it is sometimes hard to understand the impact regulations have on our economy. That is for the simple reason that someone who goes in for a job interview never sits there and is told by the employer: I would love to offer you the job, but I can't because of the crushing regulatory burden coming out of And that is because the crushing burden of regulations causes the job not to be created in the first place; and, hence, there is no interview for the job.

640,topic-id,557,"Mr.President, today I wish to continue what has become a tradition. At the beginning of the 112th Congress, Itook to the Senate floor and called for this body to adopt its rules with a simple majority vote and to amend them so theyactually allowed the body to function as our Founders intended.  I did the same at the beginning of the 112th, 113th, and 114th Today, at the start of the 115th Congress, Iagain call for reform. This is something I have done as a member of the majority and the minority. Senator Merkley hasworked closely with me on this issue and spoke briefly yesterday about our efforts.  But we did not start this tradition. It dates back decades. My predecessor, Clinton Anderson, was a leading proponent ofwhat has become known as the ``constitutional option'' in the 1950s and 1960s. Vice President Walter Mondale--then a Senator fromMinnesota--carried on the tradition in the 1970s. When Senator Merkley and I first joined the Senate, Senator Tom Harkinworked closely with us to help us carry on the tradition.  The proposals we have offered to change the rules at the start of a new Congress have never been radical. They were changeswe were willing to live with whether we were in the majority or minority. We have offered the same proposals as Members of themajority and minority. We believe the Senate is broken, and even the minority party should want to fix it.  Congress had made some progress in recent years, but unfortunately, it took unprecedented Republican obstruction to bring itabout. Republicans blocked nominees to all sorts of positions submitted by President Obama, so we took action to change therules to break through the gridlock. It was unfortunate that Republicans precipitated that situation, but the result was for thebest.  New rules allow for a lower cloture threshold for all nominees except those to the Supreme Court now, and the new RepublicanPresident can take advantage of them, just as President Obama was able to do for the final years of his term.  But no one would argue that Congress or the nomination process has been fixed. Further debate and reform is needed on manyaspects of Senate function.  We believe the Senate should openly debate and consider its rules at the start of each Congress, to consider changes thatcan provide commonsense reforms. This ongoing process is the ideal way to restore the best traditions of the Senate and allow itto conduct the business that the American people expect.  We have one goal whether we are in the majority or in the minority: to give the American people the government they expectand deserve--a government that works.  This is not just about rules.

They want a government that is fair, that is reasonable, and that works.  I hope that all my colleagues--and especially the new Senators--give serious consideration to reform.  We do not need to win every legislative or nomination vote. But we need to have a real debate and an open process to ensurewe are actually the greatest deliberative body in the world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS46-3.txt,1567,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,4.0,January
1524,topic-id,1642,"Mr.President, I rise, along with Senator Warren and my other colleagues this evening, to oppose this action by President-Elect Trump and congressional Republicans to take health care away from tens of thousands of New Mexicans.[[Page S146]]  Let me be clear. What President-Elect Trump and Republicans are doing now will throw health care into chaos. It is reckless. It will hurt thousands of New Mexicans and millions of The worst part is, the Republicans have no plan to replace care they will take away.  The Affordable Care Act is not a perfect law. I have always said we should work to improve it. It has helped thousands of people in my home State of New Before we passed the Affordable Care Act, New Mexico had a high rate of people without health insurance. It was one of the highest in our region and in the country. Since 2010, that number has gone down 44 percent--pretty incredible.  Countless people have written me, called my office, and stopped me on the street to tell me how relieved they are to have health care. Others tell me we can't afford to go back to having insurance companies in charge, we can't go back to caps on coverage, back to allowing corporations to deny care because of a preexisting condition, and back to lifetime limits.  Tonight I want to share what just a few of my constituents have told me.  ``Save my daughter.'' That was the heartbreaking plea that came to me from one of my constituents, Kevin from Kevin's 33-year-old daughter Amber has multiple sclerosis. It is a tough disease, as we all know.  To treat her MS, Amber must follow an exact and rigorous drug regimen, coupled with regular visits to her neurologist and annual The retail cost of her drugs is $60,000 per year. Her doctor visits and MRIs would run into the thousands of dollars.  Amber works. In fact, she has a good-paying job, but her employer does not provide health insurance. Amber purchases health insurance through the individual open market without Affordable Care Act subsidies. Amber is able to work because she gets the medical care she needs through insurance. Kevin fears his daughter will lose the right to health insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. The ACA makes it illegal for an insurance company to deny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition such as  The Affordable Care Act provides assurance that Amber will get the coverage she needs to remain healthy, to lead a normal life, to work, to contribute to society, and to stay off public assistance, and to survive. This one provision protects an estimated 861,000 New Mexicans and an estimated 134 million It is a safe bet that all of us here know at least one person like It isn't surprising that the vast majority of Americans--close to 70 percent--want to keep this protection.  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates more than one-quarter of all adults under age 65 have health problems and that could make them uninsurable without the Affordable Care If President-Elect Trump and the Republicans get their way, all of this will be at risk. Kevin is also scared because the cost of treating Amber's disease is so high. Without the ACA, any insurance company could cut off her health coverage if her medical expenses exceeded the company's lifetime limit. This provision protects an estimated 550,000 New Mexicans and an estimated 105 million  People who need medical care the most, people with serious medical problems, have some of the highest medical costs. If President-Elect Trump and Republicans have their way, care for people like Amber would be wiped away. I am the father of a daughter, and I am angry this father has to worry about whether his daughter will get the medical care she needs to live a healthy and productive life.  Let me tell you about Pam and They are a husband and wife from They own a small business. They signed up for an insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act as soon as they could because premiums before the ACA were too expensive and Pam had a preexisting condition. Using their new preventive care, they found out that Mike had an aggressive form of cancer. Thankfully, doctors caught the cancer at an early stage. Mike was treated at the New Mexico Cancer Center and is now cured. Pam says there is no question that the ACA saved her husband's life.  Because of the ACA, private health plans must cover a range of free preventive services--everything from cancer screening to flu shots. Over 730,000 New Mexicans now benefit. Discovering a disease early saves lives and reduces health care costs, but preventive care is expensive if you are uninsured or poor.  An overwhelming majority of Americans--83 percent, in fact--support making preventive health care free. What would President-Elect Trump and Republicans do to make sure Pam and Mike and millions of others can keep getting cancer screenings? They have no plan. They talk but no plan.  Next, I want to tell you about Karen from Albuquerque, the mother of two college-aged children. Karen's son graduates next May and turns 23. She is worried he will not get health insurance for an entry-level job. Her concern is well-founded since young adults have the lowest rate of access to employer-based insurance. Young adults do get sick, and one in six has a chronic illness such as cancer, diabetes, or asthma. Karen wants her son to have medical care if he needs it.  Today, the ACA allows him to stay on her insurance policy until he turns 26. This is one of the ACA's most popular provisions. The vast majority of Americans--85 percent--want young adults to be able to get insurance, but President-Elect Trump and congressional Republicans would leave an estimated 15,000 New Mexicans, like Karen's kids, and an estimated 2.3 million Americans without coverage because they have no plan to replace the Affordable Care  New Mexico is not a wealthy A lot of working people qualify for New Mexico wisely adopted the Medicaid expansion under the ACA, allowing 82,000 more people to get health care. Before the ACA, the only place many New Mexicans could get health care was in the emergency room. Now many are scared that President-Elect Trump and Republicans will take their health care away.  Take Amy, her husband, and her four boys--ages 13 to 19. Amy and her husband own a family business in Sante Before the ACA, they went without health insurance because they couldn't afford it. They just hoped nothing catastrophic happened to them. As soon as she could, Amy applied for health insurance under the Medicaid expansion. It covers her, her husband, her oldest son. Amy says she is grateful that because of the ACA, medical bills will not ``drain us financially.''  There are 8.4 million people across this country like Like Amy, many are low-income workers. They have jobs but no health insurance. They couldn't afford health insurance before the ACA, and they will not be able to afford it if President-Elect Trump and congressional Republicans have their way and repeal it with no plan to replace it.  These hard-working Americans deserve good medical care. Americans agree. Eighty percent favor the Medicaid expansion for low-income, uninsured adults.  Finally, we have 19 pueblos--Indian pueblos--and 4 tribes in New Native Americans make up more than one-tenth of our population. As vice chair of this body's Indian Affairs Committee, I represent all of Indian Native Americans are eligible to receive care through the Indian Health Service, but it is severely underfunded.  Long delays are common. As a result, many tribal members rely heavily on Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA health exchanges. More than 132,000 tribal members are enrolled in Medicaid in New Mexico alone. The All Pueblo Council of Governors, which represents all 19 pueblos, tells me, without the ACA, more tribal members will go back to the days of long delays, many will see their coverage cut.  This is also the subject of an amendment I will be offering. Indian Health Services' hospitals are heavily dependent on third-party collections for clinical services. In fact, current Federal funding covers less than half of their operational costs. Fortunately, increases in revenue from the Medicaid expansion have offset those annual costs. But without that revenue, necessary services may no longer be available throughout Indian country. This is unconscionable. My amendment would protect the Indian Health Service from any cuts in Federal funding if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.  There are tens of thousands of stories in New Mexico like those of Kevin,[[Page S147]]Pam, Mike, Karen, and Over 360,000 New Mexicans have gained health care since the Affordable Care Act was passed, and over 21 million Americans have health insurance because of I have heard from New Mexicans who are terrified because there is no plan to replace the Affordable Care Act's protections, benefits, and rights.  Republicans have called to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act for years. They have had years to figure out how to replace it, and they have not. They have no plan. Repeal and replace is not a sound public policy. It is only a sound bite.  Health care is a basic human right. Providing adequate medical care for everyone should be our guiding principle for health care policy. What is the guiding principle of repeal and replace? Act now; figure it out later.

1687,topic-id,558,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  When we think of a startup business, the early days of Apple or Google usually come to mind. Their stories are familiar--hardworking entrepreneurs who beat the odds. Like these companies, most successful startups have several common ingredients: a new product or service, a willingness to take risks, and leadership that can navigate the complexities of today's economy. And successful firms also have a way of securing capital to both get off the ground and to grow.  This last ingredient can present serious obstacles as startups face unique financing challenges. Many do not have positive cash flow, putting traditional bank loans out of reach. While some of these firms participate in incubator or accelerator programs that provide a small amount of seed capital, they must find new sources of funding when their initial capital runs out.  One avenue for securing additional capital is by participating in demo days or pitch days. At these events, entrepreneurs have an opportunity to showcase their companies and innovations to potential investors.  Today's bill will alter SEC rules to exempt the use of general solicitation for presentations made at demo days. In other words, demo day organizers will not have to comply with the usual procedures verifying that the investors they are attracting to the event are accredited.  Despite the well-intended goal of expanding the use of demo days to better meet startups' capital needs, it is easy to see how unscrupulous actors could exploit this exemption to deceive ordinary people that were drawn to the event by a public advertisement. My amendment makes improvements to ensure attendees at demo days have an opportunity to be informed about the nature of these presentations and the risks of investing in startups.                              {time}  1500  Typically, demo days are limited to select groups of potential investors. Let's be clear, these are not science fairs, but they are sophisticated business presentations designed to raise capital for the entrepreneurs and their startups.  However, the underlying bill allows colleges and universities and nonprofits to host these events and advertise them to the public. It is easy to see how some attendees might not know the true nature of the presentation.  My amendment will address this by requiring event sponsors to provide an SEC-created disclosure outlining the nature of the event and investment risks. By creating a uniform disclosure, the SEC can take the burden off the sponsors and issuers on what to disclose.  This amendment would also clarify that attendance at a demo day alone does not constitute a preexisting relationship and does not allow a stock issuer to sidestep their obligation to verify that an investor is accredited. Without this clarification, it is possible that issuers could defraud less-sophisticated retail investors.[[Page H265]]  Demo days are a great way for our Nation's entrepreneurs to raise capital, but they should be making presentations to the right investors, those that understand the risks of investing in risky startup businesses, not just anyone who saw an advertisement.  My amendment would both expand the ability of small businesses to raise capital by tapping into demo days while ensuring that the right kind of investors, those accredited and fully informed, are participating in the small business capital markets.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH259-2.txt,1184,RULES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,10.0,January

But today is a new day--a day when this Congress begins to dismantle this fourth branch of government anddrain the swamp in  Through the entirety of this President's administration, Republicans have fought against out-of-control growth of Federal bureaucracy and rules and regulations that have suffocated the American economy. The last time Ichecked, the President's job was to enforce existing laws and work with the elected Members of Congress whose responsibility itis to pass laws as the people's representatives. Instead, I believe he has undermined not only our Constitution but also theAmerican people through this executive power grab.

Mr.Speaker, Irise today in support of the Taxpayers Right-To-Know  This bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort to provide moreinformation about Federal programs and their activities online. The American people deserve to know what their government doeswith their hard-earned dollars. The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act will make it easier to evaluate Federal Government spending byrequiring Federal agencies to identify their programs, provide basic information like what their programs do, how they perform,and how much they cost. Agencies must do a better job of managing their programs and identifying areas where taxpayer dollarsare wasted.  The Government Accountability Office is tasked with reporting on duplication and continues to find new areas ofduplication across the government. In 6 years, GAO has identified 250 areas and 637 corrective actions in those areas to reducefragmentation, overlap, or duplication or address other opportunities for financial benefits. While only 41 percent ofrecommended corrective actions have been taken, GAO estimates this progress will result in approximately $125 billion infinancial benefits and savings over 15 years.  While GAO's work has been invaluable, their ability to look comprehensively atthe Federal Government is inherently limited because of the poor reporting by agencies about their activity. Quite simply, Mr.Speaker, without better data, billions more will be lost.  Current law, specifically the Government Performance and ResultsModernization Act, requires agencies to report all their programs, their funding, and their performance information to theOffice of Management and However, OMB's current inventory is incomplete and provides inconsistent information. Thismakes it more difficult and time consuming to identify areas of waste and inefficiency.

1372,topic-id,489,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for this important piece of legislation, H.304, the Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications  This is a bipartisan bill. It was introduced by two of our colleagues from North Carolina, Representatives Hudson and It previously passed the House by voice vote, no objection, back in November; but, unfortunately, it was not taken up by the Senate before the last Congress adjourned, meaning we have to be here today to restart this process.  This, along with three other Energy and Commerce bills that we are considering today, shows that the Energy and Commerce Committee is picking right up where we left off, in a bipartisan way, to produce quality legislation that will improve the public health.  Now, H.304 is really an important bill because it enables our Nation's emergency medical services professionals to continue to provide quality emergency care by recognizing the unique nature of their practice.  Specifically, as you may have heard, the bill clarifies that paramedics and other EMS professionals can administer certain pain and antiseizure medications in emergency situations pursuant to standing or verbal orders. In other words, the doctor has said to the EMS person, you can do these things in emergencies.  Now, think about this. You are in a car wreck. The EMT shows up in the ambulance. They can't communicate with anybody because they are down in a valley or somewhere where they don't have communication. Without this legislation, it is uncertain now, because of this ruling out of the administration, whether or not they can give you antiseizure medication or pain relief medication until they can get in contact. This is not what any of us wants, so this legislation fixes that.  During this process, when this decision was made a while back, I heard from Paul Rostykus, an emergency physician in Jackson County, He said that this is really critical to saving lives and reducing suffering, particularly in our remote and rural areas where these emergency technicians, EMTs, may struggle to call in emergencies and it can take much longer for patients to reach the nearest doctor.  I just implore you to talk to anybody that is running around the ambulances, and they will tell you this is really, really important for patients.  I had an ambulance driver tell me--an EMT tell me it is important for them because sometimes in an accident, somebody is injured and they are kind of out of control and have a seizure. Now, I am not a doctor. We actually have one here who can tell us[[Page H208]]more.

1523,topic-id,1455,"Mr.President, for 8 years Republicans have complained about health care in They have blamed everything in the world on President They have hung out on the sidelines, name-calling, making doomsday predictions, and cheering every stumble that they could blame on someone else. They spent a lot of energy rooting against families who needed help paying for health insurance or who wanted coverage but were frozen out because of preexisting conditions. They jeered and carried on. But what they didn't do--ever--was lift a finger to try to improve health care[[Page S145]]in But they are in charge now. They get to call the shots.  So what is the first thing on the Republican agenda now that they are in control? Is it working to help improve health care in America, working to bring down premiums and deductibles, making fixes to expand the network of doctors and the number of plans that people can choose from--any of those? No, the very first thing on the Republican agenda in the 115th Congress is to shatter health care in The first thing is to rip health insurance out of the hands of millions of Americans who need it. The first thing is to massively raise the cost of health insurance for everyone who has it. The first thing is to create chaos for hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies, and send their costs spiraling out of control. The first thing is to abandon the people they were elected to represent. The first thing is to repeal and run away.  Republicans have been rushing around Capitol Hill for the past couple of weeks, huddling in meetings and trying to come up with a plan to replace the Affordable Care They are shocked--shocked--to discover that guaranteeing Americans access to health care is a complex business, and they don't have any good ideas.  Now, after 8 years of complaining, they are trying to convince each other that it will all be OK if they just repeal health care access, with nothing to replace it. They are trying to reassure each other that they know what they are doing.  Get real. They don't have a clue what to do next. For 8 years they have had no plan, and they don't have a plan now.  Let's be very clear about what is going on here. Republicans want to tear apart our Nation's health care system--a health care system that protects kids with cancer, protects women getting mammograms, protects independent contractors, protects new moms, protects college kids, protects grandparents, protects disease survivors, and protects so many of America's families. They want to tear it apart, and they don't have the first clue what to do with it afterwards. Repeal and run, that's the Republican plan.  In Massachusetts, we know how important health reform is because we have been working on it now for years--long before the Affordable Care Act was even a spark on the horizon in  My Republican colleagues could learn a lot from our work in In Massachusetts, the belief that everyone should have access to affordable health insurance coverage is a shared value that Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, hospitals, insurers, doctors, consumers, and advocates have all worked to implement over the past decade. It is not just the lip service we are hearing right now here in It is real commitment, and, because of it, in Massachusetts we got real results.  Just because we are all behind this effort together in Massachusetts doesn't mean that health care reform has been a cake walk. Finding ways to cover more people and bring down costs, all while improving the quality of care, is a tough job. You have to be in it for the long haul. That is why, in Massachusetts, we didn't just pass one health care law in 2006 and then just run away. We came back a couple of years later with additional legislation to make fixes and adjustments. We formed commissions to study how things were working and to make recommendations for more changes. We passed amendments. We revised our regulations where they needed to be changed to support implementation. We worked to make coverage more affordable. We set standards to make sure insurance is a good value. We invested in prevention programs to keep people healthy in the first place. We got more coverage for more people, and we lowered health care costs.  We kept working month after month, year after year because we knew what it meant for a family to have the peace of mind that comes with affordable, high-quality health insurance coverage. We kept working because we knew it was the right thing to do. We kept working because we knew that is what Massachusetts residents expected us to do. Once we started something, we had to see it through. When it got tough, we worked harder. We didn't repeal and run.  When the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, Massachusetts went all in. We expanded our Medicaid program. We used Federal funds to cover people who still lacked insurance even after our State reforms. We set up a State health insurance exchange, the Health Connector, and we combined Federal and State dollars to make sure that insurance was truly affordable.  Just 2 months ago, we signed an ambitious new Medicaid agreement with the Federal Government that will allow us to set up innovative partnerships among health providers, insurers, and community organizations so we can better serve Medicaid patients in our  We have a great deal to be proud of in More than 97 percent of our citizens are insured. People have coverage. They have good coverage--coverage they can afford. This wasn't something we got done overnight, but it is something we worked at, and it is something we can achieve in every State if we are willing to do the work.  Democrats and nonpartisan government officials have worked for years here in Washington to try to make this health system work, and we have made real progress. Now Republicans in Congress are ready to throw away these years and years of progress. They are ready to threaten the collapse of our insurance markets. They are ready to threaten the health and the safety of millions of Americans simply to make a political point. They are ready to repeal and run.  In Massachusetts, right now, families are watching this debate, and they are worried about what happens to them. Kids with diabetes and moms with cancer are worried. Hospitals and insurers are watching, too, and they are worried--worried about an irresponsible Republican Party that is more interested in political stunts than in helping Americans get access to health care.  I don't blame them for being worried because this isn't a game. There is no magic replacement plan that will suddenly make everything all better. In Massachusetts, we can't just snap back to our old health insurance system if Republicans decide to rip up the Affordable Care Other States across the country are also facing the terrifying prospect that they will be left high and dry as a result of the Republicans' reckless actions.  Every Senator here has ideas about how to improve health care in America, but no Democratic Senator will vote to destroy it today based on the vague assurance that maybe at some point Republicans might think up some kind of replacement plan later on. The Republicans' strategy is repeal and run. Repeal and run. That is not governing. That is not leadership. It is one of the most reckless and irresponsible things that has ever been proposed in this I know some Republican Senators agree with that. I know they are worried about whether this is the right move forward, given all that hangs in the balance. I hope their consciences get the better of them and they scuttle this plan before it is too late. I hope they remember that every single Senator who votes to destroy health care in America will be responsible for the disastrous consequences that come next.  If Republicans actually want to improve health care in America, let's talk about how to do that. That is what we were sent here to do. That is what voters--conservative and liberal, Republican and Democratic--expect us to do. If Republicans want to destroy health care in America, I will fight them every step of the way. The stakes are too high for the millions of Americans whose futures are about to be sacrificed so one party can make a political point.  Let's stay and do the work that needs to be done to make sure every American gets access to high-quality, affordable health care. Repeal and run is for cowards.  Mr.President, I yield.

917,topic-id,350,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I want to say to Mr.Ross, my friend, I agree with just about every single thing you say about the great State of Israel, but I disagree with you about this resolution. Let me explain why.  Israel is a Jewish democratic state. It has been our strong ally. We have supported it through thick and thin, most recently with a $38 billion appropriation for their security over the next 10 years. I supported that. But this question that we face fundamentally comes down to whether we are going to support a two-state solution or move toward a one-state solution.  The bottom line here is that settlement activity, every settlement that is made--600,000 settlers living in the West Bank and Jerusalem--makes it ever-more difficult to achieve that two-state solution.  President Obama, in his abstention on that veto, was acknowledging what has been the policy of this country. Ronald Reagan was opposed to settlements. You know, you get a family that settles anywhere, but in the West Bank, they put down roots. They are good people. They have a belief that the West Bank belongs Biblically to That is their view. Many politicians, including Netanyahu, appear to be embracing that. That is not the international position. It is not the unified position in Many folks in Israel think the settlements are a threat to the possibility of achieving the secure borders and the security of Israel and the maintenance of it as a democratic Jewish state.  Mr.Speaker, there is another issue. With 600,000 settlers, with 4.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and also living in the State of Israel and 6.5 million Jewish members of the State of Israel, the demographics, long term, are going to reach a tipping point where there could be more Arab voters than there are Jewish voters, and then the State of Israel will have to make the decision Jewish or democratic. I want the State of Israel to continue to be that Jewish and democratic state that it is, and that is why I oppose this resolution.

1043,topic-id,385,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time, and I thank our chair of the committee and our ranking member.  I am here to stand with The question of the best way to do that is one of legitimate debate. It is a debate that we are having here in the It is a debate that the folks in Israel are having there. There is no question that the resolution before us is not the one that everyone would have written, or the one that was before the U.was the one everyone would have written. There is no question that there is fault on the side of the Palestinians with respect to coming to the table for peace.  But here is the question that is starting to really make an impact on the possibility of achieving the two-state solution that both sides by and large believe is essential, and that is something that is within the control of the Israeli Government: Will it continue to intensify the support for settlements in the West Bank? If it does, as it has been, there are 600,000 settlers now between the West Bank and east If it continues to do that, it makes as a practical matter it virtually impossible the land-for-peace swap that we know is essential to get to a two-state solution. That is the practical challenge that we have.  We are all friends of All of us here believe in a Jewish state and a democratic state.  The second issue of major concern that is discussed in Israel as well as here is the fact that demographics are going to catch up and cause a real crisis in Israel to maintain that Jewish identity and that democratic tradition. There are 4.5 million Arabs who live between the West Bank and in Israel proper. There are 6.5 million Jewish citizens. If there is not some resolution, at some point a decision has to be made to maintain the Jewish character at the expense of democratic ideals or compromise democratic ideals in order to maintain that Jewish identity.  The Israeli State has a proud, strong tradition of being democratic, of being reliable, of standing up for civil and human rights. Many there, and some of us here, believe settlements are an impediment to that tradition.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH146.txt,1879,IMPACT OF CABINET NOMINATIONS,2017.0,5.0,January

624,topic-id,1835,"Mr.President, I want to comment and say a few words about the use of the budget reconciliation process tofacilitate an effort to repeal but not replace ObamaCare, the Affordable Care I serve on the Budget During thecourse of multiple hearings during the previous year before the election, we heard the most adamant stories from the Republicanside about how dire our Nation's debt situation was, how dire our Nation's deficit was.  Member after Member on the Republican side spoke as if the end of the Republic was at hand. Yet the policies from the Bushadministration that kept driving that debt and that deficit they protect. They blamed President Obama for the effect of Bushpolicies that took place during President Obama's years, while defending those Bush policies the President had actually tried tocorrect. In many respects, their concern about the budget was a little ironic since they were defending the Bush policies thatcreated this debt and deficit explosion in the first place.  Nevertheless, be that as it may, you had this phalanx of Republican Senators in a state of very high animation about ourdebt and deficit. You would think that in this Congress, with control both over the House and the Senate and a RepublicanPresident-elect looming, they might use the budget reconciliation process to do something about the debt and the deficit.  After all, there was a lot of big talk last year, and here is the budget reconciliation process. As we see, it is not beingused to do anything about the debt or the deficit, it is being used to open an effort to repeal but not replace Theproblem is, when you do that, you do some pretty bad things to the debt and to the deficit.  Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, Medicare officials projected out-year costs for Medicare in 10-year increments. After the experience of the Affordable Care Act, they went back and they redid those projections,and they dropped the cost of Medicare dramatically. Those outyear costs, dramatically reduced, are an important, valuable steptoward lower debt, balanced budgets, and less of a national annual deficit. Repealing ObamaCare will undo that.  It was pretty clear from Budget Committee hearings that that reduction in anticipated Medicare costs in the outyears wasrelated to the work that had been done in the Affordable Care Act as well as the changes in experience that we are seeing. Thatis one budget buster which shows that this reconciliation effort is going in the wrong direction.  In Rhode Island, I watched this issue pretty closely because I want Rhode Island to be a leader in delivery system reform. Iwant ours to be one of the most efficient health care systems in the country, and I worked very hard over many years to put thepieces in place in Rhode Island to help make that come to pass. So I talked to people like Kurose, who runs one of ourlargest primary care practices, and Puerini, who runs another very big Rhode Island primary care practice, and I saw thatboth of them had taken advantage of the Affordable Care Act to make themselves accountable care organizations, ACOs, and theyhave used the powers and they have used the shared savings under those programs to change the way they deliver medicine.  What they show is that their price, their annual cost of service per patient, is actually going down. They are deliveringcare more efficiently and they are getting to illnesses earlier. They are not just churning the wheel of bill and pay, bill andpay, bill and pay; they are actually managing their patients' health. We hit this wonderful sweet spot where the patients arehealthier and the patients are way happier because they are getting better service, and the cost per patient in these practicesis coming down. So if that is taken away, we reverse that effect. It is plausible to think that those costs will start goingback up again. Why would we want to undo a method that has helped local practices improve the quality of care, reduce the costof care, and serve their patients better? The ACO program is part of the Affordable Care  The last thing is that around here, we try to defend One of the achievements of the Affordable Care Act was thatit extended the solvency of Medicare out to 2028. Undo this bill and there will be a direct hit on Medicare's solvency. It willcome roaring back.  So when you put what the Republican Senators on the Budget Committee said with such vehemence and alarm about the debt andthe deficit beside the use to which they have put the reconciliation process, which was designed to be used to reduce the debtand the deficit, and you look at how[[Page S44]]that actually plays out through the health care system--increasing the costs of whatwould have been accountable care organizations, if that gets undone; lifting back up, presumably, Medicare costs that in theoutyears were reduced because of this; and shrinking the time that Medicare stands as solvent--if that is not a hit on Medicare,I don't know what is.  The other piece in this process that bears on this is that during the period that these very dramatic concerns were beingexpressed about the debt and the deficit, the same party that was enunciating those concerns and those threats to our Americansociety and solvency was defending all of the loopholes in the Tax We tried and tried to find a loophole that ourRepublican friends would be willing to let go of, and we couldn't find a single one that I recall. Even President Trump isinterested in trying to get rid of the carried interest loophole that lets hedge fund billionaires pay lower tax rates thanbrick masons, but could we get an agreement on that from our colleagues on the other side? They wouldn't touch it.  I hope that as we go forward, we can find a way to bring tax expenditures lined up with appropriated expenditures under thepurview of the committee, but so far we have been unable to do that despite repeated bipartisan testimony that a tax expenditureis just the same as an appropriated expenditure in so far as it affects the debt and deficit--no difference--bipartisan testimony,clear on the record. The difference is that behind a great many of these lucrative tax loopholes that are baked into the TaxCode and that survive year after year after year is a special interest, whether it is somebody trying to depreciate theirprivate jet more rapidly than an airline can depreciate passenger aircraft, whether it is the carried interest loophole thatputs, very likely, the billionaire getting out of his limousine in front of his New York apartment in a lower tax rate than theguy holding the umbrella over his head, the doorman. How fair is that? But that is the status of the tax law. We couldn't getanybody to budge on that because there are obviously big, powerful interests who don't want to see that messed with. Why shouldthey pay taxes like ordinary people when they are superwealthy immortals who can buy themselves politicians?  So the ironies of the party that declaimed about debt and deficit with such vehemence through so many hearings, with so muchblame on President Obama even though it was carried-forward Bush policies they were defending that were driving so much of thatdebt--to have that group of people now come and use the reconciliation process designed and intended to address the debt and thedeficit instead to try to repeal but not replace ObamaCare in ways that I think can be very fairly projected to raise Medicarecosts, reduce Medicare solvency, and undo a good deal of the savings that doctors and taxpayers have shared from hard-workingpractices like Rhode Island Primary Care Physicians and Coastal Medical in Rhode Island, which have relied on the ACO provisionsin the Affordable Care Act to get those savings--who wants to undo that? It makes no sense, and least of all, it makes no budgetsense because those outyear health care costs will come home into the budget in those outyears. Of course, you compound thatwith the fact that no tax loophole is to be touched. No tax loophole can be addressed. No revenue can be generated by closingthe carried interest loophole, closing the private jet deduction, closing the tax benefits for the fossil fuel industry, whichis making more money than any industry has in history and hardly needs the support of the poor American taxpayer. But, no, bigspecial interests have big tax breaks, and they are going to be protected at all costs. That is really where we are on this.  I understand we used reconciliation to move It did, in fact, do the job of reducing the deficit, I believe.Undoing it goes in the opposite direction, but there is a certain ``what is good for the goose is good for the gander''equivalence about using that to undo what we did. I get that. But if we are really serious about addressing the debt anddeficit, then we shouldn't be using the reconciliation process, which is designed to reduce them both, to attack a health careprogram whose effect has been to reduce them both. That is where we stand right now.  In the months ahead, I hope we will be able to look at tax expenditures. More money goes out the back door through taxexpenditures than gets spent on some of our biggest programs. It is a huge loophole, and within it are a lot of veryunattractive special interest special provisions--loopholes in the worst sense of the word. We don't want to touch them becausenobody dares to touch the special interests behind them.  So that is where we are. I hope we can make real progress on the debt and the deficit and stop defending private jetreductions, stop defending fossil fuel subsidies, stop defending billionaire special tax breaks, and actually put the debt andthe deficit that America faces first rather than having conversations about that being window dressing until you get aRepublican President, and then you go completely haywire, using the reconciliation process to undo health care laws, raiseMedicare costs, and undo the ACO program that has been so effective in my  I see the junior Senator from Utah is presiding, and I know that Utah and Intermountain have some of the best health carework being done on delivery system reform, and it would surprise me very much if the leaders at Intermountain in Utah wereexcited about undoing the delivery system reform provisions of The Innovation Center at the Centers for MedicareServices, the ACO provisions, the provisions for shared savings between doctors and the taxpayer when savings accrue because ofbetter practices, the changes toward better models of payment--I would be very surprised if they were very enthusiastic aboutundoing those.  But, as I said, this is where we are, and I will close my remarks, and I hope that soon, once this exercise is over, we canactually get serious about closing loopholes and reducing the debt and reducing the deficit--the nominal cause of the Republicanson the Budget  I yield the floor.

1231,topic-id,3061,"Mr.President, this is the 152nd time I have come to the floor for my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, warning about the perilous effects of climate change. I am going to continue this in the new Congress, continuing to present the latest and most compelling scientific evidence of the changes that are coming our way driven by carbon pollution.  Nobody should take my word for it. I urge my colleagues to listen to their own home State's climatologists, their own home State's university researchers, their own home State's public health officials, and their own constituents who are out there fighting to protect their communities from the changes that are already happening right before their eyes.  In Rhode Island, we have a lot of fishermen, just as Louisiana has, Mr.The president of the Rhode Island Commercial Fishermen's Association is Chris Just this past week, he was the subject of a New York Times article. ``Climate change is going to make it hard on some of those species that are not particularly fond of warm or warming waters,'' he told the ``We used to come right here''--where he was on his boat, The Proud Mary--``and catch two, three, four thousand pounds a day, sometimes 10.'' But the whiting, the fish he was after, have moved north to cooler waters.  The Times reports that two-thirds of marine species off the northeast coast have moved from their traditional ranges into deeper and cooler water.  John Manderson is a biologist at NOAA's northeast fisheries science center, and he told the Times in that article that public policy needs to keep pace with the rapidly changing oceans, where species are shifting northward in response to warming 10 times as quickly as they do on the land. ``Our ideas of property rights and laws are purely land-based,'' he said, ``but the ocean is all about flux and turbulence and movement.''  In Rhode Island, fishermen are getting clobbered by that flux.  Captain Dave Monti is a member of the Rhode Island Marine Fisheries He wrote in the Providence Journal this week:       I often think about the fish and how important it is to      grow them to abundance so there are more fish for all to      catch and eat. . . . In 2017 we need a fish-first agenda, or      someday there may be no fish left to catch. Climate change,      acidification, overfishing by world nations, and changing      federal strategies could make it the worst of times for fish      in 2017. . . . We need to make an effort to understand what      is happening to the environment and the fish, and then take      that second step of communicating it to others to affect      policy.  That is what I am being asked.  The Providence Journal also recently wrote about how in Rhode Island the sea is moving higher and farther inland, as it is in Louisiana, which is the State losing ground fastest to the ocean of all the 50. They reported on StormTools, a program developed by Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council director Grover Fugate and University of Rhode Island emeritus professor of ocean engineering Malcolm StormTools provides 3D maps of the potential flooding damage along Rhode Island's coast. The Journal described the project as ``one of the most sophisticated models developed anywhere to project future damage from storm surges and sea level rise.'' And we are taking the results seriously.  The Journal quoted William DePasquale, who is the director of planning in one of our cities, Warwick, He said, ``When I saw some of those scenarios, my jaw hit the ground.'' That is what we are looking at, and Warwick is now using those maps to prepare for the future.  The Providence Journal has also recently written about Matunuck Beach in South Town manager Stephen Alfred warns that if the sea takes out Matunuck Beach Road, 240 homes will be totally cut off, without a water supply or access to emergency services.  The article features Kevin Finnegan, who owns the Ocean Mist, a renowned local establishment. The Journal said:       The Ocean Mist has occupied the same spot under different      names since Prohibition ended in 1933. But the ocean has      moved. Where once beach bathers had to plan a trek across      sand to reach the water from the Mist, waves now flood the      supports holding up the tavern's deck.  Finnegan and the town of North Kingstown are scrambling to build seawalls. Engineer Bill Ladd, who works for Finnegan and who the Providence Journal reports had his first beer at the Ocean Mist back when the drinking age was 18, estimates that the two walls may only buy Matunuck Beach 20 or 30 more years against the oncoming ocean. That is because, as The Independent--a local newspaper in the southern part of Rhode Island--reported in December, about 4 feet of Matunuck Beach is eroding every year. According to Director Fugate of the CRMC, that erosion will more than double by the end of the century. Rhode Island is not a big We cannot afford to have this much reclaimed by the ocean.  The Independent article quotes North Kingstown Town Council president Kerry McKay, who says that climate change threatens the property values of his community's coastal homes, which is a significant portion of the town's revenue base.       He said historical values ``will have to change'' as      coastal concerns rise, and residents ``have to be more      receptive'' to redoing building infrastructure, such as      through elevating houses.  He also said that homes ``may not be there'' in 20 years, resulting in a ``major revenue loss.''  Another Providence Journal article last week featured Tanner Steeves, a[[Page S98]]wildlife biologist with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, which has to tear up roads and parking lots along the Sakonnet River as the seas rise. The Journal writes:       As the barrier beach just south of Sapowet Point has      narrowed--losing nearly 100 feet since 1939--the salt marsh      on the other side has become more susceptible to flooding.  The Independent made Rhode Island's case for climate action in a December editorial. They said:       The signs are clear, if not immediately visible to most.       There are the well-documented, widely publicized shifts      with global import, such as the loss of polar ice and the      growing frequency of extreme weather events. Locally, there      are changes in the ecology of Narragansett Bay, and locations      at which the effects of a rising sea level--sometimes subtle,      sometimes less so--may be plainly seen. . . . But we      encourage all Rhode Islanders, from coastal communities and      beyond, to remain attuned to the situation--in terms of both      what the sea is telling us and what is being proposed to      prepare for coming changes. The stakes are enormously high,      and the broadest possible effort is required to meet the      challenge.  That is the message to me from Rhode That is why I give these speeches.  As I continue to push for honest debate on this issue in Congress, I also tour around the country to see folks on the ground in other I have now been to 15 In the closing months of 2016, I hit Texas and  In Texas, I joined Representative Elliott Naishtat, the advocacy group Public Citizen Texas, and Texas environmental advocates at a public event in Austin to call out Congressman Lamar Smith, Republican chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, for his abuse of congressional power to harass public officials and climate scientists, including subpoenas demanding that States attorneys general divulge their investigative materials relating to their inquiries into ExxonMobil's potentially fraudulent climate misinformation. The committee is also harassing the Union of Concerned Scientists, 350.org, Greenpeace, and various university scientists because they are exposing Exxon for years of misleading the public on its understanding of climate change. Texans are taking notice. The San Antonio Express-News, which had previously always endorsed Congressman Smith for reelection, decided not to endorse him in this latest election cycle. The paper cited his ``bullying on the issue of climate change'' as behavior that ``should concern all Americans.''  I joined a panel discussion with leading scientists from Texas universities to discuss their research into climate change in The panel included John Anderson from Rice University, Andrew Dessler from Texas A&M University, Charles Jackson and Kerry Cook from the University of Texas at Austin, and Katherine Hayhoe from Texas Tech They had a unified voice on the dangers of climate change.  Hayhoe said Texans are seeing changes all around them.       We get hit by drought. We get hit by heat. We get hit by      storms. We get hit by sea level rise. And we're starting to      see those impacts today. . . . Texas is really at the      forefront of this problem.  Anderson of Rice agreed that the Texas climate is already changing. He said:       Accelerated sea-level rise is real, not a prediction. Its      causes are known--thermal expansion of the oceans and melting      of glaciers and ice sheets--and it is causing unprecedented      change along the Texas coast.  Dessler from Texas A&M laid out what he called ``the fundamental and rock-solid aspects of climate science: humans are loading the atmosphere with carbon, this is warming the climate, and this future warming is a huge risk to our society and the environment. We should insist that our elected representatives rely on this sound science when formulating policy.''  I returned to Austin in November to speak to the Association of Public and Land-grant President David Dooley of the University of Rhode Island had invited me to join a panel that he moderated with, among others, John Nielsen-Gammon, Texas State climatologist and professor at Texas A&M  The bottom line was simple: Climate change is real, and the scientists at our universities will be increasingly forced to defend good science, academic freedom, and climate action. University leadership will have to defend their scientists against the onslaught of FOIA requests and personal attacks that are the modus operandi for climate deniers and against the phony science fronts propped up by the fossil fuel industry to spread calculated misinformation. The American scientific community faces a real threat from that operation.  On to Pennsylvania, I had the opportunity to spend a day traveling with my friend and colleague Bob Casey around southeastern Pennsylvania getting a firsthand look at the effects of climate change and hearing about the work Pennsylvanians are doing to address it. At the University of Pennsylvania's Morris Arboretum, leaders from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Community Asthma Prevention Program, Moms Clean Air Force, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and other groups talked about kids with asthma and other conditions that worsen when temperatures and pollution levels are high.  In Malvern, we toured the LEED platinum North American headquarters of Saint-Gobain, the world's largest building materials company. The company is demonstrating that green building materials and technologies can be married with stylish design to produce stunning results. With operations in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and around the globe, Saint-Gobain is developing innovative technologies to reduce pollution, generate clean energy, and improve air quality for millions of people.  From there, we visited the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, which is the Nation's first urban wildlife refuge and Pennsylvania's largest freshwater tidal wetland. Lamar Gore, the refuge manager, showed us how the refuge is at risk from the saltwater pushed in by rising sea levels. The refuge is adjacent to the Philadelphia International Airport, along the Delaware  As you can see from these graphics reproduced from the New York Times, at 5 feet of sea level rise, some of the city goes underwater and the refuge is in real trouble. Water encroaches upon the Philadelphia airport. At 12 feet of sea level rise, 6 percent of the city--including the refuge, airport, and parts of downtown Philly--is underwater. Projections that parts of Philadelphia will one day be uninhabitable due to sea level rise are one of the major drivers for forward-looking climate mitigation and adaptation policies of Philadelphia's Office of Senator Casey and I met with them too.  Being in Pennsylvania gave me a chance to connect with Robert Brulle of Drexel He is the scholar who documented the intricate propaganda web of fossil fuel industry-funded climate denial, connecting over 100 organizations, from trade associations, to conservative think tanks, to plain old phony front groups. The purpose of this climate denial apparatus is, to quote Brulle, ``a deliberate and organized effort to misdirect the public discussion and distort the public's understanding of climate.''  I will wrap up with a special thank-you to one of the folks who helped organize my Texas trip: Tom Smith, who has been director of Public Citizen of Texas for more than 30 years. Known by his friends and colleagues as Smitty and known for his signature straw hat, over his career he has testified more than 1,000 times before the Texas Legislature and Congress--Mr.Uphill Struggle indeed. He was successful, though, and central in creating the Texas Emissions Reduction Program, which led to wide-scale deployment of solar and wind across A true environmental champion, Smitty retires this year.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent tribute from the Texas Tribune entitled: ``Analysis: `Smitty,' a Texas Lobbyist for the Small Fry, Retiring after 31 years.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Texas Tribune, 21, 2016]  Analysis: ``Smitty,'' a Texas Lobbyist for the Small Fry, Retiring                              After 31 Years                            (By Ross Ramsey)       Tom ``Smitty'' Smith, a colorful lobbyist and liberal      activist who turned Public Citizen Texas into a strong voice      on environmental, utility, consumer and ethics issues, is      hanging up his spurs after 31 years.[[Page S99]]       In the early 90s--the heyday of consumer rights legislation      and regulation in Texas--Robert Cullick, then a reporter at      the Houston Chronicle, gave Tom ``Smitty'' Smith of Public      Citizen Texas an unofficial title: Everybody's Third            Smith, 66, announced his retirement Tuesday from his      official post after 31 years, ending a long run of organizing      and lobbying on behalf of consumers and citizens on a range      of issues like utilities, insurance and political ethics. He      was often the voice of the opposition in legislative fights      and in the media, which earned him that reporter's epithet.       He's from that part of the Austin lobby that doesn't wear      fancy suits, doesn't drive the latest luxury cars and doesn't      spend its time fawning over and feeding elected officials.      Smitty has a beard, an omnipresent straw hat and, often, a      colorful sheaf of flyers making his points on whatever cause      he's pushing at the time.       Smitty has been a leading voice for government intervention      and regulation of big industries and interests in the capital      of a state with conservative, business-friendly politicians      from both parties who pride themselves on light regulation,      low taxes and a Wild West approach to money in politics.       For the most part, Smith seems to have disagreed strongly,      vociferously, but agreeably. He doesn't wear his wins or his      losses on his sleeve.       ``The thing that I learned time after time, story after      story, is that people standing up does make a difference,''      Smith says. ``It does change policy.''       ``Citizen activism does matter, and it's the only known      antidote to organized political corruption and political      money,'' he says.       His causes over the years have included food security,      decommissioning costs of the nuclear reactors owned by      various Texas utilities, insurance regulations, ethics and      campaign finance laws. He's lobbied on environmental issues      and product safety.       He counts the ethics reforms of 1991 as one of his big      wins. As unregulated as Texas political ethics and campaign      finance might seem today, things were a lot looser before      reformers used a flurry of scandals and attendant media      coverage to force changes. Smith is proud of a medical bill      of rights that gave consumers some leverage with their      doctors and their health insurers.       Public Citizen was a key player in the creation of the      State Office of Administrative Hearings, which took      administrative courts out of several regulatory agencies and      put them in a central office, farther from the reach of      regulated industries and elected officials. Smith now points      to the Texas Railroad Commission, which still has its own      administrative hearings, as an example of a too-close      relationship between regulators, the companies they regulate      and the judges supposed to referee their differences.       He was an early and noisy advocate for renewable energy,      urging regulators and lawmakers to promote wind and solar      generation--and transmission lines to carry their power--as      an alternative to coal plants and other generating sources.      That looks easier from a 2016 vantage point than it did in      1989, when an appointed utilities regulator derided      alternative energy in an open meeting by saying that he      hadn't smoked enough dope to move the state in that      direction.       That regulator is gone now, and Texas leads the nation in      wind energy. Chalk one up for the environmental advocates.       Smitty is leaving with unfulfilled wishes. He'd like to      have made more progress on Texas emissions and climate      change, on campaign finance reforms and conflict-of-interest      laws.       The ethics reforms of 1991 included creation of the Texas      Ethics Commission and a number of significant regulations on      the behavior of the Texans contending for and holding state      office. There is always more, of course. Smith had a list of      13 reforms that year, and eight made it into law. Some of the      remaining items remain undone 25 years later.       ``All the time I've been working here, Texas politics has      been largely controlled by organized businesses pooling their      money together and making significant contributions to key      legislators,'' Smith says. ``Legislators are more concerned      about injuring their donors than they are about injuring      their constituents.''       He illustrates that with stories, like one about a      legislator asking, during a House debate, if his colleagues      knew the difference between a campaign contribution and a      bribe. ``You have to report the campaign contribution.'' And      another, when a member--former state Eddie Cavazos, D-     Corpus Christi, who went on to become a lobbyist--was making      a plea for cutting the influence of big donors. Cavazos      recalls telling a story about getting simultaneous calls from      a big donor and from someone who wasn't a political friend.      He says he told his colleagues, ``You know which one you're      going to answer first.''       ``I'm sorry to see Smitty go,'' Cavazos said ``He      provided a large voice in the Legislature that was needed--a      balancing voice. He's a good guy.''  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,1823,HELPING ANGELS LEAD OUR STARTUPS ACT,2017.0,5.0,January

1672,topic-id,271,"Mr.Chair, I rise today not only in strong support of the[[Page H262]]HALOS Act but for the entrepreneurs everywhere in this country.  The facts are simple. Angel investors provide vital, often necessary capital for startup companies. Unfortunately, after the passage of the JOBS Act, the SEC made this more difficult, placing unnecessary burdens on companies who are just starting out.  Mr.Speaker, the positive impact these startups often have on a community are staggering. In the City of Austin, which I am proud to represent, startup companies provide more than just new technologies. They provide jobs, they generate taxes, and they give back to their local community. In 2015 alone, tech companies in Austin were able to raise almost a billion dollars in new capital. With our economy still on the mend from the financial collapse in 2007, it is time to give businesses, both large and small, the resources they need to compete in an often competitive environment.  H.79 rightly amends the SEC Act of 1933 to formally define an angel investor group and exempts them from having to comply with burdensome, third-party verification rules. The HALOS Act provides essential protection for trade associations that often facilitate such meetings between investors and fund managers, continuing to cultivate small business capital formation relationships. This change may be small, but the impact will be great.  Mr.Speaker, I will end my remarks by saying this: If the 115th Congress is serious about jobs, serious about turning our economy around, and serious about real change, passing bills like the HALOS Act will be paramount to our success.

1211,topic-id,1745,"Madam President, I want to begin my remarks this morning by taking stock of how the 115th Congress, led by my Republican colleagues, seems to be coming out of the gate. Here is what is coming if the budget process that began this week plays out: 30 million Americans from Portland, OR, to Portland, ME, will be in danger of being kicked off their health care plans; sharply rising health care costs for everybody else, even those who get their insurance through their employer; broken campaign promises about a replacement coming on day one. With this resolution, Republicans in the Congress are building a Trojan horse of tax cuts for the most fortunate in  I want to discuss each of those issues this morning, but first let us recognize the bottom line. What is at stake in this debate is whether or not America is going to go back to the dark days when health care was reserved for the healthy and wealthy. For nearly 7 years and through 4 punishing campaigns, Americans have heard and felt the steady, partisan drumbeat of repeal and replace from the other side. Dozens and dozens of show votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act have been held in either There have been countless press conferences, speeches, and hearings, even a government shutdown, and the message is always the same. The President-elect himself said that repeal and replace would happen--his words, not mine--simultaneously.  The replacement plan was coming. It would be fully written, ready to plug in--no gap, no harm relevant to anyone in our country. The same words, ``Coming Soon,'' have sat on that marquee for 7 years now. It seems to me it is time to admit that the show will not open. This is a broken promise, plain and simple. Americans are no longer looking at repeal and replace; now it is repeal and run. The consequences will be serious and immediate for tens of millions of Americans, both in access to health care and the bottom line for family budgets across the country. In short, it is a plan that will make America sick again. According to independent analysis, nearly 30 million Americans will lose their health insurance quickly after repeal. The first act of a new Congress: Kicking 30 million people off the insurance rolls--that is seven times the population of my home  The overwhelming majority of those 30 million Americans are not wealthy people. They are not in a position to be able to afford to go out and pick an expensive plan once the insurance companies get back in the driver's seat. Millions come from working families who will lose tax cuts for health insurance. Millions of others toil, often working multiple jobs, but still what they bring home is just barely enough to keep them out of poverty.  For many, signing up for Medicaid brought an end to the years when they had to choose between visiting a doctor and putting food on the table. If repeal goes forward, Americans all over the country are going to face that dilemma once again. I think it is important to remember that the danger of repeal does not end with Americans getting kicked off their insurance plans.  Repeal will send costs skyrocketing for everyone across the board, even those Americans who get their insurance through work, including a lot of folks who say the Affordable Care Act has not touched them at all. They are going to get a gut punch, a gut punch with higher premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs. When you kick tens of millions off the insurance rolls and send the markets into chaos, there is going to be a ripple effect. Everyone is going to feel those harmful effects, even those who have had the same plan from a particular employer for years or decades. Rising costs are going to eat into paychecks, crowding out the pay raises that our people need so desperately.  Colleagues, if you are watching this budget debate at home, I am sure you are going to say: Why in the world would any lawmaker go forward with this plan? I am going to go back to what I just said. In my view, this is a Trojan horse of tax cuts for the wealthy and the most fortunate.  When you look at both sides of the ledger, you see how exceptionally unfair this scheme actually is. On one[[Page S86]]side, tens of millions of Americans lose insurance and suffer economic pain. That is the typical family. On the other side, there are substantial tax breaks for those at the top of the income scale.  One of the questions I am asked nearly every day in these halls, and I am asked this by many in the press and elsewhere, is whether Democrats are going to take part in this effort and what ideas Democrats would put forward. I want to take just a minute to describe why that question is so off the mark. First, you have to look at the nature of the reconciliation process itself. Budget reconciliation is inherently a partisan exercise. Inherently, it is not a process that brings people together. It is a process that drives people apart. It is inherently partisan.  A typical proposal that comes to the Senate floor is subject to unlimited debate and unlimited amendments. Usually it takes 60 Senators, Members from both parties to come together and pass legislation. It is very rare that a party builds that kind of supermajority on its own, so the two sides have to work together. That is the Senate at its best.  I see my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator He and I have served on the Finance At its best, that is what the Finance Committee has always been about--trying to find common ground, working together to get a proposal that can get 60 votes.  Reconciliation throws those unique characteristics of bringing Senators together; basically, reconciliation just trashes it, throws it out the window. In my view, when you use reconciliation the way it is being used here, you are telling the other party you neither need nor want their votes. It puts a one-sided proposal on the fast track to passage, tight limits on debate and amendments, a bare majority of votes required to actually pass it.  I am very concerned that what is at issue now is a serious misuse of the reconciliation process. This is not a simplified procedure to address a budget issue; this is an effort to ram through repeal and run. Second, this is not your run-of-the-mill congressional debate where you have both sides bringing their best ideas forward to tackle a policy issue.  For years, my Democratic colleagues and I have said that we are ready to work on a bipartisan basis to solve this country's health care challenges. I think I have spent about as much time as anybody in the Senate working to try to find bipartisan solutions to the country's big health challenges. Back in 2008, 2009, we had a bipartisan proposal: seven Democrats, seven We had never had that before. I can tell you, we Democrats are ready to work on a bipartisan basis to solve the country's health care challenges.  For me, essentially what I have tried to make my top priority for public service--health care is one-sixth of the American economy. It has always been the issue that Americans care the most about because if you and your loved ones don't have health, nothing else much matters. So we ought to be working on a bipartisan basis to solve the country's health care challenges, finding ways to bring costs down for families, making prescription drugs more affordable, upholding the promise of Medicare, and strengthening its guaranteed benefits.  When I was director of the Gray Panthers at home, a senior citizens group, we always said that Medicare was a promise. It was a promise of guaranteed benefits. We ought to strengthen that promise, particularly updating it to incorporate changes in the program that reflect the needs of the Americans who face chronic health conditions, which is where the vast majority of Medicare dollars are going.  That is what we ought to be doing, upholding the promise of Medicare, working together in a bipartisan way. But that is not what is happening here. From the other side, what we have heard again and again is repeal and replace, dozens of partisan votes producing legislation that burned out in the Senate or met the veto pen.  Now, with a new administration, the Trump administration coming in, the Republicans kick off a procedural scheme that slashes taxes for the most fortunate, raises costs for typical Americans, and takes insurance coverage away from tens of millions of people. No Democrat is going to buy in to that proposition. The reason they won't is that the American people are not going to buy into that proposition.  This scheme is going to bring on a manufactured crisis that does harm to millions of Americans across the land, rocks our health care sector, our providers, our plans--all of those who make up this health care system. One side is pushing it, but the other side is saying: No, let's not create this catastrophe.  That is why, in my view, the questions about Democrats signing on to flawed, bad proposals miss the point. Everyone recognizes that the strict and immovable strategy adopted by the other side 8 years ago paid dividends in elections. But politics is different from governing. Politics is different from governing because there are serious life-and-death consequences to actions that deprive Americans of health insurance. Families are going to feel economic pain when premiums and deductibles jump.  I believe Americans are going to speak out. They are going to rally against an unfair, unbalanced bill that cuts taxes for the most fortunate, while putting insurance companies back again in the driver's seat. What is at stake here is pretty simple; it is whether or not America is going to turn back the clock and go back to those dark days when health care in our Nation was reserved for the healthy and the wealthy.  My colleagues and I say no way. We are going to fight that unfair, imbalanced approach in every way we can.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING Who yields time?  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,1247,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued",2017.0,5.0,January
1503,topic-id,969,"Madam President, I am very pleased to be able to join Senator Donnelly, Senator Hirono, and Senator Blumenthal on this extraordinarily important issue that goes right to the heart of what we want health care to be in this country. I have always felt that the really big issues, the really important issues, need to be bipartisan. You need to find a path to some common ground.  As Senator Donnelly and our colleagues have pointed out, what is being discussed now is an inherently partisan process for dealing with one of the most sensitive and most important issues of our time; that is, Medicare and what it represents. I had a chance to listen to Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono discuss this issue. It made me recall my days when I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers, the senior citizens group. I was director of the group for almost 7 years before I was elected to This was back in the days when I had a full head of hair and rugged good looks.  We always talked about Medicare being a promise. It was a promise of guaranteed benefits. They were going to be there. They were going to be secure. They were going to be defined. In effect, all who supported Medicare said they would oppose unraveling that promise, unraveling that pledge of guaranteed benefits. It seems to me, without strong legislation, the kind of legislation my colleagues are advocating, we are putting that promise at risk.  I think when you look back at the history of what was available for older people before Medicare, you would see why this promise and this pledge is so important. For so many older people, there was, essentially, what amounted to poor farms. We had one not far from where we lived at home in When Medicare was being debated, people brought out those pictures. They talked about what it meant, in a country as strong and good and rich as ours, for older people not to have a life of dignity and security and decent health care.  When Medicare was adopted in 1965, it was all about the promise. It was all about the guarantee. That is what Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono are standing up for as part of this debate. I know that some who don't share our view are going to say: Well, there are tremendous challenges with respect to There is no question about that--10,000 people turning 65 every day for years and years--but there is so much that can be done, Democrats and Republicans, if you want to reject something that is partisan like reconciliation and come together. You can come together around updating the Medicare guarantee. I say this to my friends Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono, who have done such good work on this.  We are not saying there aren't any challenges. The fact is that Medicare today in 2017 is very different than Medicare when it began in 1965. It is dominated by chronic illness: cancer, diabetes, heart disease. But we can come up with fresh, practical approaches for dealing with those challenges, consistent with what Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono are talking about, which is keeping the Medicare promise, keeping the Medicare guarantee, not allowing the program to be privatized.  We started on that with the Affordable Care There were a number of us in the Senator Isakson was very involved. At the time, Senator Markey was a Member of the other body. We advocated for something called Independence at Home, which allowed the Medicare Program to begin to take care of those with chronic illness at home.  So I am very appreciative of what Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono are doing because what they are saying is this: Instead of gambling on the health of older people with a partisan reconciliation process, let's work in a bipartisan way to build on the promise of Medicare, the promise of those guaranteed benefits.  We can do that. We can do that by creating more options for caring for older people at home. We can do it by expanding telemedicine and using new technology. We can do it by creating more opportunities for nonphysician providers. These are all ways that we can build on the Medicare promise and the Medicare guarantee and deal with the challenges of our time. But we are not going to be able to deal with those challenges through partisan approaches like reconciliation that would privatize the program and unravel the promise.  So I am very pleased to be able to have a chance to be out on the floor with my colleagues who have been strong advocates for Medicare, who rightly put this issue front and center in the debate, because I think a lot of what is being discussed is really getting lost. A big part of this debate really seems to be about creating a Trojan horse to give tax cuts to some of the most fortunate, while, in effect, raising health care costs for millions of others and breaking the Medicare promise, which is what my colleagues are seeking to protect in their amendment 20.  We are going to be talking more about this. Certainly, as the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, we will be having significant debates about these issues in the committee. But I am very appreciative that Senator Donnelly and Senator Hirono have allowed us to jump-start what this debate is really all about; and that is, keeping the promise of Medicare, keeping the promise of guaranteed benefits, working in a bipartisan way to update the guarantee to deal with chronic illness and improve options for home care. I commend them both for their good work.  I yield the floor.

1519,topic-id,1555,"Mr.President, my colleague from Illinois has addressed very clearly what some of the human consequences of this are going to be. I am going to take a few minutes as well to describe it. I am very pleased our colleague Senator Murray is here because she has really led the effort--and I have been very pleased to join her--in terms of trying to promote expanded health care services for vulnerable women in  I say to Senator Murray, I saw there was a comment made by some who advocate the repeal of the Affordable Care They said: Nobody was going to get hurt--nobody in America was going to get hurt. The reality is, that is not true for the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of women who depend on Planned Parenthood for basic health care, for preventive health services, for essential services, for example, like cancer screens.  So this notion that somehow nobody is going to get hurt by repealing the Affordable Care Act is simply contradicted, from rural Oregon to rural Maine, when you see the kind of pain and suffering this is going to end up generating for some of the poorest and most vulnerable women in our country. The fact is, what has been set in motion by Republicans here in the Senate is a scheme that I call repeal and run. It is about very large tax breaks for the most fortunate, paid for by taking health insurance away from millions of working people. Under it, the insurance companies are back in the driver's seat, health care costs skyrocket across the board, and that is true even for those who get their insurance at work.  The replacement plan our colleagues on the other side have promised for years is somehow hidden away, with tens of millions of Americans in the dark about what is coming next for their health care.  Whenever I hear about the replacement, the whole notion of what would be there for families in the future, it reminds me of what used to be the old movie house in town. It had a big marquee up at the top of it, and it would always talk about the movie ``coming soon,'' but the movie never actually got there. When I hear about the replacement, what I think about is that everybody is going to be sitting in the dark again.[[Page S140]]  What is essentially at stake here is whether America is going to go back to the days when health care was for the healthy and the wealthy. That is what health care used to be all about. If you were healthy, no problems, nothing to worry about. If you were wealthy, you could just write out checks when you had a whole host of preexisting conditions.  What the Senate is going to vote on this week is whether to green-light the first step in this scheme to go back to the days when health care was for the healthy and wealthy with a budget resolution.  I think it is fair to say budget resolutions usually aren't the prime topic at dinner table conversations in America, but this year there are serious consequences--serious consequences--personal, life-and-death consequences because of this scheme that is being pushed through the That is where I believe the focus ought to be and why I am going to spend the remainder of my time talking about persons whose lives in Oregon are going to be directly affected and, in some cases, endangered.  Maleta Christian is from Douglas County, OR, a beautiful rural community. She is a personal support worker, providing care to adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. She had always carried health insurance until she was unexpectedly laid off from her job. She was without coverage for more than a year, but then she was able to buy a plan through the Affordable Care  For Maleta, having insurance meant cancer screenings that, very likely, saved her life. Doctors found tumors that had to be removed. Later, she was diagnosed with a degenerative hip and back problems that caused her pain every day, making it difficult to get through a physically demanding and grueling job.  Her prescription drug coverage, which she gets through a plan under the Affordable Care Act, is what makes it possible for Maleta to get up every morning and get through that workday. Thanks to the care she has received, Maleta made it to her daughter's wedding, and she was proud that she even baked the cake.  Another Oregonian, Rita from Salem, comes from a family who has been struggling with depression. It is a condition that has been stigmatized for far too long in this country.  I know something about this because my late brother, Jeff, faced the stigma of mental health. He was a schizophrenic, and he passed at far too early an age. Far too many of those with mental illness have been denied care and shunted to the fringes of society.  Before Rita got coverage through the Affordable Care Act, she was forced to pour a staggering share of her income into health-related expenses. It was nearly two-thirds in 2011. Even then, she didn't have access to the mental health treatments she needed. Her depression used to keep her out of work.  With coverage from the Affordable Care Act tax credits that made it affordable, Rita's costs have fallen substantially. She now gets the prescription and therapy that help her manage her condition, and she can live a healthier life.  Another of my constituents is Mary, who lives in Milwaukie, OR, with her husband and 7-year-old daughter. She has a hereditary disease known as It is a rare genetic condition that causes dangerous swelling, lasting days at a time, affecting various parts of the body. If Mary goes without treatment, attacks come on regularly, even multiple times a week. When they do, it is completely disabling.  Before she got insurance through the Affordable Care Act, she rotated through health plans and insurers to maintain coverage and avoid hitting caps on treatments. She sought out clinical studies to get free care, typically participating in one each year.  So on top of holding down a job, raising a daughter, battling a life-threatening condition that affects 1 in 50,000 Americans, she was basically out trying to cobble some decent health care together. The system was so badly broken, she basically sewed her own health care safety net, but the ACA protected patients like Mary from discrimination and guaranteed access to care.  These are three They come from different backgrounds, and they have battled different conditions, but they share a lot in common with each other and with people around the land.  Not long ago, in the eyes of insurance companies, the women who I just mentioned would have worn their preexisting conditions like scarlet letters. But the insurance they have now gives them the opportunity for healthier, more productive lives, and that is what is endangered because of the scheme that is being pushed through Congress, pushed through the Senate by Republicans right now.  Costs are going to shoot up if the plan goes forward. The premium subsidies millions of Americans count on to buy insurance could be eliminated. Even if Americans with preexisting conditions have access to health care after this repeal scheme goes through, it doesn't mean they can afford it.  What my colleagues on the other side have said repeatedly for years is that they were going to repeal and replace--no gap, no harm done to anybody. The replacement would be ready on day one.  It sure looks as though that promise is going to be broken. The replacement is still hidden somewhere, but the process of repeal is rolling forward. In the meantime, millions of Americans are left guessing what is going to happen to their care if this plays out.  The bottom line for me and my colleagues is really this. If Members on the other side want to debate how to solve this country's health care challenge, we will have that debate.  I would say to my colleagues on the other side: I have spent about as much time as anybody here in this body looking for bipartisan approaches to address health care. So let's find ways to bring down costs for families. Let's make prescription drugs more affordable. Let's uphold the promise of Medicare because that is what it is; it is a promise of guaranteed benefits. But we are not going to be able to do that on a partisan scheme called the budget resolution and reconciliation. That is not about bringing people together for a bipartisan effort. That is about tearing things down, tearing down the Affordable Care Act, so I want that understood.  My colleague Senator Murray is here. She and I work together closely because of our committees. We feel very, very strongly about how uniquely important this time is because this is a time when our country has to decide not to go back to the dark days when health care was reserved for the healthy and wealthy. That is what the other side has on offer right now. It is a proposition that my colleagues and I are going to fight with all our strength.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS126.txt,1247,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,9.0,January
1029,topic-id,9646,"I thank my colleague.  Mr.Speaker, as a strong supporter of a two-state solution, as a Jewish Member of Congress and as someone who has been to Israel and has seen the settlements firsthand, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution.  Settlements are an impediment to peace between Israelis and This resolution only provides ammunition to those who oppose a two-state solution--the approach that is our only hope for lasting peace. We all agree that the incitement of violence and terrorism must end, which U.Security Council Resolution 2334 discusses. But as Secretary Kerry so eloquently stated in his speech on December 28:       Some seem to believe that the U.S.' friendship means the      U.must accept any policy regardless of our own interests,      our own positions, our own words, our own principles--even      after urging again and again that the policy must change.      Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and      friendships require mutual respect.                              {time}  1815  Well, my friends, Israel must end settlement expansion, close their outposts, and get to the negotiating table. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not treated the Obama administration with respect, and this resolution does not offer the American people the honest, true debate we should be having about this critically important issue.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the Obama administration, especially Secretary of State Kerry, for their dedication in trying to find a path forward for a two-state solution. It is my hope that the principles laid out in Secretary Kerry's December 28, 2016 speech will help guide serious negotiations in the days ahead. To ensure that his remarks are a part of this debate, I will now read his entire statement.  Secretary Kerry said: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. Thank you. (Coughs.) Excuse me. Thank you for your patience, all of you. For those of you who celebrated Christmas, I hope you had a wonderful Happy And to everybody here, I know it's the middle of a holiday week. I understand. (Laughter.) But I wish you all a very, very productive and Happy New  Today, I want to share candid thoughts about an issue which for decades has animated the foreign policy dialogue here and around the world--the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Throughout his Administration, President Obama has been deeply committed to Israel and its security, and that commitment has guided his pursuit of peace in the Middle This is an issue which, all of you know, I have worked on intensively during my time as Secretary of State for one simple reason: because the two-state solution is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and It is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors. It is the only way to ensure a future of freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people. And it is an important way of advancing United States interests in the region.  Now, I'd like to explain why that future is now in jeopardy, and provide some context for why we could not, in good conscience, stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.  I'm also here to share my conviction that there is still a way forward if the responsible parties are willing to act. And I want to share practical suggestions for how to preserve and advance the prospects for the just and lasting peace that both sides deserve.  So it is vital that we have an honest, clear-eyed conversation about the uncomfortable truths and difficult choices, because the alternative that is fast becoming the reality on the ground is in nobody's interest--not the Israelis, not the Palestinians, not the region--and not the United  Now, I want to stress that there is an important point here: My job, above all, is to defend the United States of America--to stand up for and defend our values and our interests in the world. And if we were to stand idly by and know that in doing so we are allowing a dangerous dynamic to take hold which promises greater conflict and instability to a region in which we have vital interests, we would be derelict in our own responsibilities.  Regrettably, some seem to believe that the U.friendship means the U.must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles--even after urging again and again that the policy must change. Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect.  Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations, who does not support a two-state solution, said after the vote last week, quote, ``It was to be expected that Israel's greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share,'' and veto this resolution. I am compelled to respond today that the[[Page H155]]United States did, in fact, vote in accordance with our values, just as previous U.administrations have done at the Security Council before us.  They fail to recognize that this friend, the United States of America, that has done more to support Israel than any other country, this friend that has blocked countless efforts to delegitimize Israel, cannot be true to our own values--or even the stated democratic values of Israel--and we cannot properly defend and protect Israel if we allow a viable two-state solution to be destroyed before our own eyes.  And that's the bottom line: the vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two-state solution. That's what we were standing up for: Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living side by side in peace and security with its neighbors. That's what we are trying to preserve for our sake and for theirs.  In fact, this Administration has been Israel's greatest friend and supporter, with an absolutely unwavering commitment to advancing Israel's security and protecting its legitimacy.  On this point, I want to be very clear: No American administration has done more for Israel's security than Barack Obama's. The Israeli prime minister himself has noted our, quote, ``unprecedented'' military and intelligence cooperation. Our military exercises are more advanced than ever. Our assistance for Iron Dome has saved countless Israeli lives. We have consistently supported Israel's right to defend itself, by itself, including during actions in Gaza that sparked great controversy.  Time and again we have demonstrated that we have Israel's back. We have strongly opposed boycotts, divestment campaigns, and sanctions targeting Israel in international fora, whenever and wherever its legitimacy was attacked, and we have fought for its inclusion across the UN system. In the midst of our own financial crisis and budget deficits, we repeatedly increased funding to support In fact, more than one-half of our entire global Foreign Military Financing goes to And this fall, we concluded an historic $38 billion memorandum of understanding that exceeds any military assistance package the United States has provided to any country, at any time, and that will invest in cutting-edge missile defense and sustain Israel's qualitative military edge for years to come. That's the measure of our support.  This commitment to Israel's security is actually very personal for me. On my first trip to Israel as a young senator in 1986, I was captivated by a special country, one that I immediately admired and soon grew to love. Over the years, like so many others who are drawn to this extraordinary place, I have climbed Masada, swum in the Dead Sea, driven from one Biblical city to another. I've also seen the dark side of Hizballah's rocket storage facilities just across the border in Lebanon, walked through exhibits of the hell of the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, stood on the Golan Heights, and piloted an Israeli jet over the tiny airspace of Israel, which would make anyone understand the importance of security to Out of those experiences came a steadfast commitment to Israel's security that has never wavered for a single minute in my 28 years in the Senate or my four years as  I have also often visited West Bank communities, where I met Palestinians struggling for basic freedom and dignity amidst the occupation, passed by military checkpoints that can make even the most routine daily trips to work or school an ordeal, and heard from business leaders who could not get the permits that they needed to get their products to the market and families who have struggled to secure permission just to travel for needed medical care.  And I have witnessed firsthand the ravages of a conflict that has gone on for far too long. I've seen Israeli children in Sderot whose playgrounds had been hit by Katyusha rockets. I've visited shelters next to schools in Kiryat Shmona that kids had 15 seconds to get to after a warning siren went off. I've also seen the devastation of war in the Gaza Strip, where Palestinian girls in Izbet Abed Rabo played in the rubble of a bombed-out building.  No children--Israeli or Palestinian--should have to live like that.  So, despite the obvious difficulties that I understood when I became Secretary of State, I knew that I had to do everything in my power to help end this conflict. And I was grateful to be working for President Obama, who was prepared to take risks for peace and was deeply committed to that effort.  Like previous U.administrations, we have committed our influence and our resources to trying to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict because, yes, it would serve American interests to stabilize a volatile region and fulfill America's commitment to the survival, security and well-being of an Israel at peace with its Arab neighbors.  Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy.  The truth is that trends on the ground--violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement expansion and the seemingly endless occupation--they are combining to destroy hopes for peace on both sides and increasingly cementing an irreversible one-state reality that most people do not actually want.  Today, there are a number--there are a similar number of Jews and Palestinians living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean They have a choice. They can choose to live together in one state, or they can separate into two states. But here is a fundamental reality: if the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic--it cannot be both--and it won't ever really be at peace. Moreover, the Palestinians will never fully realize their vast potential in a homeland of their own with a one-state solution.  Now, most on both sides understand this basic choice, and that is why it is important that polls of Israelis and Palestinians show that there is still strong support for the two-state solution--in theory. They just don't believe that it can happen.  After decades of conflict, many no longer see the other side as people, only as threats and enemies. Both sides continue to push a narrative that plays to people's fears and reinforces the worst stereotypes rather than working to change perceptions and build up belief in the possibility of peace.  And the truth is the extraordinary polarization in this conflict extends beyond Israelis and Allies of both sides are content to reinforce this with an us or--``you're with us or against us'' mentality where too often anyone who questions Palestinian actions is an apologist for the occupation and anyone who disagrees with Israel policy is cast as anti-Israel or even anti- That's one of the most striking realties about the current situation: This critical decision about the future--one state or two states--is effectively being made on the ground every single day, despite the expressed opinion of the majority of the people.  The status quo is leading towards one state and perpetual occupation, but most of the public either ignores it or has given up hope that anything can be done to change it. And with this passive resignation, the problem only gets worse, the risks get greater and the choices are narrowed.  This sense of hopelessness among Israelis is exacerbated by the continuing violence, terrorist attacks against civilians and incitement, which are destroying belief in the possibility of peace.  Let me say it again: There is absolutely no justification for terrorism, and there never will be.  And the most recent wave of Palestinian violence has included hundreds of terrorist attacks in the past year, including stabbings, shootings, vehicular attacks and bombings, many by individuals who have been radicalized by social media. Yet the murderers of innocents are still glorified on Fatah websites, including showing attackers next to Palestinian leaders following attacks. And despite statements by President Abbas and his party's leaders making clear their opposition to violence, too often they send a different message by failing to condemn specific terrorist attacks and naming public squares, streets and schools after terrorists.  President Obama and I have made it clear to the Palestinian leadership countless times, publicly and privately, that all incitement to violence must stop. We have consistently condemned violence and terrorism, and even condemned the Palestinian leadership for not condemning it.  Far too often, the Palestinians have pursued efforts to delegitimize Israel in international fora. We have strongly opposed these initiatives, including the recent wholly unbalanced and inflammatory UNESCO resolution regarding And we have made clear our strong opposition to Palestinian efforts against Israel at the ICC, which only sets back the prospects for peace.  And we all understand that the Palestinian Authority has a lot more to do to strengthen its institutions and improve governance.  Most troubling of all, Hamas continues to pursue an extremist agenda: they refuse to accept Israel's very right to exist. They have a one-state vision of their own: all of the land is Hamas and other radical factions are responsible for the most explicit forms of incitement to violence, and many of the images that they use are truly appalling. And they are willing to kill innocents in Israel and put the people of Gaza at risk in order to advance that agenda.  Compounding this, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, exacerbated by the closings of the crossings, is dire. Gaza is home to one of the world's densest concentrations of people enduring extreme hardships with few opportunities. 1.3 million people out of Gaza's population of 1.8 million are in need of daily assistance--food and shelter. Most have electricity less than half the time and only 5 percent of the water is safe to drink. And yet despite the urgency of these needs, Hamas and other militant groups continue to re-arm and divert reconstruction materials to build tunnels, threatening more attacks on Israeli civilians that no government can tolerate.[[Page H156]]  Now, at the same time, we have to be clear about what is happening in the West The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements. The result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself just described as ``more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history,'' are leading in the opposite direction. They're leading towards one state. In fact, Israel has increasingly consolidated control over much of the West Bank for its own purposes, effectively reversing the transitions to greater Palestinian civil authority that were called for by the Oslo  I don't think most people in Israel, and certainly in the world, have any idea how broad and systematic the process has become. But the facts speak for themselves. The number of settlers in the roughly 130 Israeli settlements east of the 1967 lines has steadily grown. The settler population in the West Bank alone, not including East Jerusalem, has increased by nearly 270,000 since Oslo, including 100,000 just since 2009, when President Obama's term began.  There's no point in pretending that these are just in large settlement blocks. Nearly 90,000 settlers are living east of the separation barrier that was created by Israel itself in the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state. And the population of these distant settlements has grown by 20,000 just since 2009. In fact, just recently the government approved a significant new settlement well east of the barrier, closer to Jordan than to What does that say to Palestinians in particular--but also to the United States and the world--about Israel's intentions?  Let me emphasize, this is not to say that the settlements are the whole or even the primary cause of this conflict. Of course they are not. Nor can you say that if the settlements were suddenly removed, you'd have peace. Without a broader agreement, you would not. And we understand that in a final status agreement, certain settlements would become part of Israel to account for the changes that have taken place over the last 49 years--we understand that--including the new democratic demographic realities that exist on the ground. They would have to be factored in. But if more and more settlers are moving into the middle of Palestinian areas, it's going to be just that much harder to separate, that much harder to imagine transferring sovereignty, and that is exactly the outcome that some are purposefully accelerating.  Let's be clear: Settlement expansion has nothing to do with Israel's security. Many settlements actually increase the security burden on the Israeli Defense And leaders of the settler movement are motivated by ideological imperatives that entirely ignore legitimate Palestinian aspirations.  Among the most troubling illustrations of this point has been the proliferation of settler outposts that are illegal under Israel's own laws. They're often located on private Palestinian land and strategically placed in locations that make two states impossible. There are over 100 of these outposts. And since 2011, nearly one-third of them have been or are being legalized, despite pledges by past Israeli governments to dismantle many of them.  Now leaders of the settler movement have advanced unprecedented new legislation that would legalize most of those outposts. For the first time, it would apply Israeli domestic law to the West Bank rather than military law, which is a major step towards the process of annexation. When the law passed the first reading in the Israeli parliament, in the Knesset, one of the chief proponents said proudly--and I quote--``Today, the Israeli Knesset moved from heading towards establishing a Palestinian state towards Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.'' Even the Israeli attorney general has said that the draft law is unconstitutional and a violation of international law.  Now, you may hear from advocates that the settlements are not an obstacle to peace because the settlers who don't want to leave can just stay in Palestine, like the Arab Israelis who live in But that misses a critical point, my friends. The Arab Israelis are citizens of Israel, subject to Israel's law. Does anyone here really believe that the settlers will agree to submit to Palestinian law in Palestine?  Likewise, some supporters of the settlements argue that the settlers could just stay in their settlements and remain as Israeli citizens in their separate enclaves in the middle of Palestine, protected by the Well, there are over 80 settlements east of the separation barrier, many located in places that would make a continuous--a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Does anyone seriously think that if they just stay where they are you could still have a viable Palestinian state?  Now, some have asked, ``Why can't we build in the blocs which everyone knows will eventually be part of Israel?'' Well, the reason building there or anywhere else in the West Bank now results in such pushback is that the decision of what constitutes a bloc is being made unilaterally by the Israeli Government, without consultation, without the consent of the Palestinians, and without granting the Palestinians a reciprocal right to build in what will be, by most accounts, part of Bottom line--without agreement or mutuality, the unilateral choices become a major point of contention, and that is part of why we are here where we are.  You may hear that these remote settlements aren't a problem because they only take up a very small percentage of the land. Well, again and again we have made it clear, it's not just a question of the overall amount of land available in the West It's whether the land can be connected or it's broken up into small parcels, like a Swiss cheese, that could never constitute a real state. The more outposts that are built, the more the settlements expand, the less possible it is to create a contiguous state. So in the end, a settlement is not just the land that it's on, it's also what the location does to the movement of people, what it does to the ability of a road to connect people, one community to another, what it does to the sense of statehood that is chipped away with each new construction. No one thinking seriously about peace can ignore the reality of what the settlements pose to that peace.  But the problem, obviously, goes well beyond settlements. Trends indicate a comprehensive effort to take the West Bank land for Israel and prevent any Palestinian development there. Today, the 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C--much of which was supposed to be transferred to Palestinian control long ago under the Oslo Accords--much of it is effectively off limits to Palestinian development. Most today has essentially been taken for exclusive use by Israel simply by unilaterally designating it as ``state land'' or including it within the jurisdiction of regional settlement councils. Israeli farms flourish in the Jordan River Valley, and Israeli resorts line the shores of the Dead Sea--a lot of people don't realize this--they line the shore of the Dead Sea, where Palestinian development is not allowed. In fact, almost no private Palestinian building is approved in Area C at all. Only one permit was issued by Israel in all of 2014 and 2015, while approvals for hundreds of settlement units were advanced during that same period.  Moreover, Palestinian structures in Area C that do not have a permit from the Israeli military are potentially subject to demolition. And they are currently being demolished at an historically high rate. Over 1,300 Palestinians, including over 600 children, have been displaced by demolitions in 2016 alone--more than any previous year.  So the settler agenda is defining the future of And their stated purpose is clear. They believe in one state: greater In fact, one prominent minister, who heads a pro-settler party, declared just after the U.election--and I quote--``the era of the two-state solution is over,'' end quote. And many other coalition ministers publicly reject a Palestinian state. And they are increasingly getting their way, with plans for hundreds of new units in East Jerusalem recently announced and talk of a major new settlement building effort in the West Bank to follow.  So why are we so concerned? Why does this matter? Well, ask yourself these questions: What happens if that agenda succeeds? Where does that lead?  There are currently about 2.75 million Palestinians living under military occupation in the West Bank, most of them in Areas A and B--40 percent of the West Bank--where they have limited autonomy. They are restricted in their daily movements by a web of checkpoints and unable to travel into or out of the West Bank without a permit from the  So if there is only one state, you would have millions of Palestinians permanently living in segregated enclaves in the middle of the West Bank, with no real political rights, separate legal, education, and transportation systems, vast income disparities, under a permanent military occupation that deprives them of the most basic freedoms. Separate and unequal is what you would have. And nobody can explain how that works. Would an Israeli accept living that way? Would an American accept living that way? Will the world accept it?  If the occupation becomes permanent, over the time the Palestinian Authority could simply dissolve, turn over all the administrative and security responsibilities to the What would happen then? Who would administer the schools and hospitals and on what basis? Does Israel want to pay for the billions of dollars of lost international assistance that the Palestinian Authority now receives? Would the Israel Defense Force police the streets of every single Palestinian city and town?  How would Israel respond to a growing civil rights movement from Palestinians, demanding a right to vote, or widespread protests and unrest across the West Bank? How does Israel reconcile a permanent occupation with[[Page H157]]its democratic ideals? How does the U.continue to defend that and still live up to our own democratic ideals?  Nobody has ever provided good answers to those questions because there aren't any. And there would be an increasing risk of more intense violence between Palestinians and settlers, and complete despair among Palestinians that would create very fertile ground for extremists.  With all the external threats that Israel faces today, which we are very cognizant of and working with them to deal with, does it really want an intensifying conflict in the West Bank? How does that help Israel's security? How does that help the region?  The answer is it doesn't, which is precisely why so many senior Israeli military and intelligence leaders, past and present, believe the two-state solution is the only real answer for Israel's long term security.  Now, one thing we do know: if Israel goes down the one state path, it will never have true peace with the rest of the Arab world, and I can say that with certainty. The Arab countries have made clear that they will not make peace with Israel without resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That's not where their loyalties lie. That's not where their politics are.  But there is something new here. Common interests in countering Iran's destabilizing activities, and fighting extremists, as well as diversifying their economies have created real possibilities for something different if Israel takes advantage of the opportunities for peace. I have spent a great deal of time with key Arab leaders exploring this, and there is no doubt that they are prepared to have a fundamentally different relationship with That was stated in the Arab Peace Initiative, years ago. And in all my recent conversations, Arab leaders have confirmed their readiness, in the context of Israeli-Palestinian peace, not just to normalize relations but to work openly on securing that peace with significant regional security cooperation. It's waiting. It's right there.  Many have shown a willingness to support serious Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to take steps on the path to normalization to relations, including public meetings, providing there is a meaningful progress towards a two-state solution. My friends, that is a real opportunity that we should not allow to be missed.  And that raises one final question: Is ours the generation that gives up on the dream of a Jewish democratic state of Israel living in peace and security with its neighbors? Because that is really what is at stake.  Now, that is what informed our vote at the Security Council last week--the need to preserve the two-state solution--and both sides in this conflict must take responsibility to do that. We have repeatedly and emphatically stressed to the Palestinians that all incitement to violence must stop. We have consistently condemned all violence and terrorism, and we have strongly opposed unilateral efforts to delegitimize Israel in international fora.  We've made countless public and private exhortations to the Israelis to stop the march of settlements. In literally hundreds of conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, I have made clear that continued settlement activity would only increase pressure for an international response. We have all known for some time that the Palestinians were intent on moving forward in the UN with a settlements resolution, and I advised the prime minister repeatedly that further settlement activity only invited UN action.  Yet the settlement activity just increased, including advancing the unprecedented legislation to legalize settler outposts that the prime minister himself reportedly warned could expose Israel to action at the Security Council and even international prosecution before deciding to support it.  In the end, we could not in good conscience protect the most extreme elements of the settler movement as it tries to destroy the two-state solution. We could not in good conscience turn a blind eye to Palestinian actions that fan hatred and violence. It is not in U.interest to help anyone on either side create a unitary state. And we may not be able to stop them, but we cannot be expected to defend them. And it is certainly not the role of any country to vote against its own policies.  That is why we decided not to block the UN resolution that makes clear both sides have to take steps to save the two-state solution while there is still time. And we did not take this decision lightly. The Obama Administration has always defended Israel against any effort at the UN and any international fora or biased and one-sided resolutions that seek to undermine its legitimacy or security, and that has not changed. It didn't change with this vote.  But remember it's important to note that every United States administration, Republican and Democratic, has opposed settlements as contrary to the prospects for peace, and action at the UN Security Council is far from unprecedented. In fact, previous administrations of both political parties have allowed resolutions that were critical of Israel to pass, including on settlements. On dozens of occasions under George Bush alone, the council passed six resolutions that Israel opposed, including one that endorsed a plan calling for a complete freeze on settlements, including natural growth.  Let me read you the lead paragraph from a New York Times story dated December 23rd. I quote: ``With the United States abstaining, the Security Council adopted a resolution today strongly deploring Israel's handling of the disturbances in the occupied territories, which the resolution defined as, including All of the 14 other Security Council members voted in favor.'' My friends, that story was not written last week. It was written December 23rd, 1987, 26 years to the day that we voted last week, when Ronald Reagan was president.  Yet despite growing pressure, the Obama Administration held a strong line against UN action, any UN action, we were the only administration since 1967 that had not allowed any resolution to pass that Israel opposed. In fact, the only time in eight years the Obama Administration exercised its veto at the United Nations was against a one-sided settlements resolution in 2011. And that resolution did not mention incitement or violence.  Now let's look at what's happened since then. Since then, there have been over 30,000 settlement units advanced through some stage of the planning process. That's right--over 30,000 settlement units advanced notwithstanding the positions of the United States and other countries. And if we had vetoed this resolution just the other day, the United States would have been giving license to further unfettered settlement construction that we fundamentally oppose.  So we reject the criticism that this vote abandons On the contrary, it is not this resolution that is isolating Israel; it is the permanent policy of settlement construction that risks making peace impossible. And virtually every country in the world other than Israel opposes settlements. That includes many of the friends of Israel, including the United Kingdom, France, Russia--all of whom voted in favor of the settlements resolution in 2011 that we vetoed, and again this year along with every other member of the council.  In fact, this resolution simply reaffirms statements made by the Security Council on the legality of settlements over several decades. It does not break new ground. In 1978, the State Department Legal Adviser advised the Congress on his conclusion that Israel's government, the Israeli Government's program of establishing civilian settlements in the occupied territory is inconsistent with international law, and we see no change since then to affect that fundamental conclusion.  Now, you may have heard that some criticized this resolution for calling East Jerusalem occupied territory. But to be clear, there was absolutely nothing new in last week's resolution on that issue. It was one of a long line of Security Council resolutions that included East Jerusalem as part of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, and that includes resolutions passed by the Security Council under President Reagan and President George H.And remember that every U.administration since 1967, along with the entire international community, has recognized East Jerusalem as among the territories that Israel occupied in the Six-Day  Now, I want to stress this point: We fully respect Israel's profound historic and religious ties to the city and to its holy sites. We've never questioned that. This resolution in no manner prejudges the outcome of permanent status negotiations on East Jerusalem, which must, of course, reflect those historic ties and the realities on the ground. That's our position. We still support it.  We also strongly reject the notion that somehow the United States was the driving force behind this resolution. The Egyptians and Palestinians had long made clear to all of us--to all of the international community--their intention to bring a resolution to a vote before the end of the year, and we communicated that to the Israelis and they knew it anyway. The United States did not draft or originate this resolution, nor did we put it forward. It was drafted by Egypt--it was drafted and I think introduced by Egypt, which is one of Israel's closest friends in the region, in coordination with the Palestinians and others.  And during the time of the process as it went out, we made clear to others, including those on the Security Council, that it was possible that if the resolution were to be balanced and it were to include references to incitement and to terrorism, that it was possible the United States would then not block it, that--if it was balanced and fair. That's a standard practice with resolutions at the Security The Egyptians and the Palestinians and many others understood that if the text were more balanced, it was possible we wouldn't block it. But we also made crystal clear that the President of the United States would not make a final decision about our own position until we saw the final text.  In the end, we did not agree with every word in this resolution. There are important[[Page H158]]issues that are not sufficiently addressed or even addressed at all. But we could not in good conscience veto a resolution that condemns violence and incitement and reiterates what has been for a long time the overwhelming consensus and international view on settlements and calls for the parties to start taking constructive steps to advance the two-state solution on the ground.  Ultimately, it will be up to the Israeli people to decide whether the unusually heated attacks that Israeli officials have directed towards this Administration best serve Israel's national interests and its relationship with an ally that has been steadfast in its support, as I described. Those attacks, alongside allegations of U.S.-led conspiracy and other manufactured claims, distract attention from what the substance of this vote was really all about.  And we all understand that Israel faces very serious threats in a very tough neighborhood. Israelis are rightfully concerned about making sure that there is not a new terrorist haven right next door to them, often referencing what's happened with Gaza, and we understand that and we believe there are ways to meet those needs of security. And Israelis are fully justified in decrying attempts to legitimize their state and question the right of a Jewish state to exist. But this vote was not about that. It was about actions that Israelis and Palestinians are taking that are increasingly rendering a two-state solution impossible. It was not about making peace with the Palestinians now--it was about making sure that peace with the Palestinians will be possible in the future.  Now, we all understand that Israel faces extraordinary, serious threats in a very tough neighborhood. And Israelis are very correct in making sure that there's not a terrorist haven right on their border.  But this vote--I can't emphasize enough--is not about the possibility of arriving at an agreement that's going to resolve that overnight or in one year or two years. This is about a longer process. This is about how we make peace with the Palestinians in the future but preserve the capacity to do so.  So how do we get there? How do we get there, to that peace?  Since the parties have not yet been able to resume talks, the U.and the Middle East Quartet have repeatedly called on both sides to independently demonstrate a genuine commitment to the two-state solution--not just with words, but with real actions and policies--to create the conditions for meaningful negotiations.  We've called for both sides to take significant steps on the ground to reverse current trends and send a different message--a clear message--that they are prepared to fundamentally change the equation without waiting for the other side to act.  We have pushed them to comply with their basic commitments under their own prior agreements in order to advance a two-state reality on the ground.  We have called for the Palestinians to do everything in their power to stop violence and incitement, including publicly and consistently condemning acts of terrorism and stopping the glorification of violence.  And we have called on them to continue efforts to strengthen their own institutions and to improve governance, transparency, and accountability.  And we have stressed that the Hamas arms buildup and militant activities in Gaza must stop.  Along with our Quartet partners, we have called on Israel to end the policy of settlement construction and expansion, of taking land for exclusive Israeli use and denying Palestinian development.  To reverse the current process, the U.and our partners have encouraged Israel to resume the transfer of greater civil authority to the Palestinians in Area C, consistent with the transition that was called for by And we have made clear that significant progress across a range of sectors, including housing, agriculture, and natural resources, can be made without negatively impacting Israel's legitimate security needs. And we've called for significantly easing the movement and access restrictions to and from Gaza, with due consideration for Israel's need to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.  So let me stress here again: None of the steps that I just talked about would negatively impact Israel's security.  Let me also emphasize this is not about offering limited economic measures that perpetuate the status quo. We're talking about significant steps that would signal real progress towards creating two states.  That's the bottom line: If we're serious about the two-state solution, it's time to start implementing it now. Advancing the process of separation now, in a serious way, could make a significant difference in saving the two-state solution and in building confidence in the citizens of both sides that peace is, indeed, possible. And much progress can be made in advance of negotiations that can lay the foundation for negotiations, as contemplated by the Oslo process. In fact, these steps will help create the conditions for successful talks.  Now, in the end, we all understand that a final status agreement can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties. We've said that again and again. We cannot impose the peace.  There are other countries in the UN who believe it is our job to dictate the terms of a solution in the Security Others want us to simply recognize a Palestinian state, absent an agreement. But I want to make clear today, these are not the choices that we will make.  We choose instead to draw on the experiences of the last eight years, to provide a way forward when the parties are ready for serious negotiations. In a place where the narratives from the past powerfully inform and mold the present, it's important to understand the history. We mark this year and next a series of milestones that I believe both illustrate the two sides of the conflict and form the basis for its resolution. It's worth touching on them briefly.  A hundred and twenty years ago, the First Zionist Congress was convened in Basel by a group of Jewish visionaries, who decided that the only effective response to the waves of anti-Semitic horrors sweeping across Europe was to create a state in the historic home of the Jewish people, where their ties to the land went back centuries--a state that could defend its borders, protect its people, and live in peace with its neighbors. That was the vision. That was the modern beginning, and it remains the dream of Israel today.  Nearly 70 years ago, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 finally paved the way to making the State of Israel a reality. The concept was simple: to create two states for two peoples--one Jewish, one Arab--to realize the national aspirations of both Jews and And both Israel and the PLO referenced Resolution 181 in their respective declarations of independence.  The United States recognized Israel seven minutes after its creation. But the Palestinians and the Arab world did not, and from its birth, Israel had to fight for its life. Palestinians also suffered terribly in the 1948 war, including many who had lived for generations in a land that had long been their home too. And when Israel celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2018, the Palestinians will mark a very different anniversary: 70 years since what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe.  Next year will also mark 50 years since the end of the Six-Day War, when Israel again fought for its survival. And Palestinians will again mark just the opposite: 50 years of military occupation. Both sides have accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242, which called for the withdrawal of Israel from territory that it occupied in 1967 in return for peace and secure borders, as the basis for ending the conflict.  It has been more than 20 years since Israel and the PLO signed their first agreement--the Oslo Accords--and the PLO formally recognized Both sides committed to a plan to transition much of the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian control during permanent status negotiations that would put an end to their conflict. Unfortunately, neither the transition nor the final agreement came about, and both sides bear responsibility for that.  Finally, some 15 years ago, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia came out with the historic Arab Peace Initiative, which offered fully normalized relations with Israel when it made peace--an enormous opportunity then and now, which has never been fully been embraced.  That history was critical to our approach to trying to find a way to resolve the conflict. And based on my experience with both sides over the last four years, including the nine months of formal negotiations, the core issues can be resolved if there is leadership on both sides committed to finding a solution.  In the end, I believe the negotiations did not fail because the gaps were too wide, but because the level of trust was too low. Both sides were concerned that any concessions would not be reciprocated and would come at too great a political cost. And the deep public skepticism only made it more difficult for them to be able to take risks.  In the countless hours that we spent working on a detailed framework, we worked through numerous formulations and developed specific bridging proposals, and we came away with a clear understanding of the fundamental needs of both sides. In the past two and a half years, I have tested ideas with regional and international stakeholders, including our Quartet partners. And I believe what has emerged from all of that is a broad consensus on balanced principles that would satisfy the core needs of both sides.  President Clinton deserves great credit for laying out extensive parameters designed to bridge gaps in advanced final status negotiations 16 years ago. Today, with mistrust too high to even start talks, we're at the opposite end of the spectrum. Neither side is willing to even risk acknowledging the other's bottom[[Page H159]]line, and more negotiations that do not produce progress will only reinforce the worst fears.  Now, everyone understands that negotiations would be complex and difficult, and nobody can be expected to agree on the final result in advance. But if the parties could at least demonstrate that they understand the other side's most basic needs--and are potentially willing to meet them if theirs are also met at the end of comprehensive negotiations--perhaps then enough trust could be established to enable a meaningful process to begin.  It is in that spirit that we offer the following principles--not to prejudge or impose an outcome, but to provide a possible basis for serious negotiations when the parties are ready. Now, individual countries may have more detailed policies on these issues--as we do, by the way--but I believe there is a broad consensus that a final status agreement that could meet the needs of both sides would do the following.  Principle number one: Provide for secure and recognized international borders between Israel and a viable and contiguous Palestine, negotiated based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed equivalent swaps.  Resolution 242, which has been enshrined in international law for 50 years, provides for the withdrawal of Israel from territory it occupied in 1967 in return for peace with its neighbors and secure and recognized borders. It has long been accepted by both sides, and it remains the basis for an agreement today.  As Secretary, one of the first issues that I worked out with the Arab League was their agreement that the reference in the Arab Peace Initiative to the 1967 lines would from now on include the concept of land swaps, which the Palestinians have acknowledged. And this is necessary to reflect practical realities on the ground, and mutually agreed equivalent swaps that will ensure that the agreement is fair to both sides.  There is also broad recognition of Israel's need to ensure that the borders are secure and defensible, and that the territory of Palestine is viable and contiguous. Virtually everyone that I have spoken to has been clear on this principle as well: No changes by Israel to the 1967 lines will be recognized by the international community unless agreed to by both sides.  Principle two: Fulfill the vision of the UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of two states for two peoples, one Jewish and one Arab, with mutual recognition and full equal rights for all their respective citizens.  This has been the fundamental--the foundational principle of the two-state solution from the beginning: creating a state for the Jewish people and a state for the Palestinian people, where each can achieve their national aspirations. And Resolution 181 is incorporated into the foundational documents of both the Israelis and Recognition of Israel as a Jewish state has been the U.position for years, and based on my conversations in these last months, I am absolutely convinced that many others are now prepared to accept it as well--provided the need for a Palestinian state is also addressed.  We also know that there are some 1.7 million Arab citizens who call Israel their home and must now and always be able to live as equal citizens, which makes this a difficult issue for Palestinians and others in the Arab world. That's why it is so important that in recognizing each other's homeland--Israel for the Jewish people and Palestine for the Palestinian people--both sides reaffirm their commitment to upholding full equal rights for all of their respective citizens.  Principle number three: Provide for a just, agreed, fair, and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue, with international assistance, that includes compensation, options and assistance in finding permanent homes, acknowledgment of suffering, and other measures necessary for a comprehensive resolution consistent with two states for two peoples.  The plight of many Palestinian refugees is heartbreaking, and all agree that their needs have to be addressed. As part of a comprehensive resolution, they must be provided with compensation, their suffering must be acknowledged, and there will be a need to have options and assistance in finding permanent homes. The international community can provide significant support and assistance. I know we are prepared to do that, including in raising money to help ensure the compensation and other needs of the refugees are met, and many have expressed a willingness to contribute to that effort, particularly if it brings peace. But there is a general recognition that the solution must be consistent with two states for two peoples, and cannot affect the fundamental character of  Principle four: Provide an agreed resolution for Jerusalem as the internationally recognized capital of the two states, and protect and assure freedom of access to the holy sites consistent with the established status quo.  Now, Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue for both sides, and the solution will have to meet the needs not only of the parties, but of all three monotheistic faiths. That is why the holy sites that are sacred to billions of people around the world must be protected and remain accessible and the established status quo maintained. Most acknowledge that Jerusalem should not be divided again like it was in 1967, and we believe that. At the same time, there is broad recognition that there will be no peace agreement without reconciling the basic aspirations of both sides to have capitals there.  Principle five: Satisfy Israel's security needs and bring a full end, ultimately, to the occupation, while ensuring that Israel can defend itself effectively and that Palestine can provide security for its people in a sovereign and non-militarized state.  Security is the fundamental issue for Israel together with a couple of others I've mentioned, but security is critical. Everyone understands that no Israeli Government can ever accept an agreement that does not satisfy its security needs or that risk creating an enduring security threat like Gaza transferred to the West And Israel must be able to defend itself effectively, including against terrorism and other regional threats. In fact, there is a real willingness by Egypt, Jordan, and others to work together with Israel on meeting key security challenges. And I believe that those collective efforts, including close coordination on border security, intelligence-sharing, joint cooperations--joint operation, can all play a critical role in securing the peace.  At the same time, fully ending the occupation is the fundamental issue for the They need to know that the military occupation itself will really end after an agreed transitional process. They need to know they can live in freedom and dignity in a sovereign state while providing security for their population even without a military of their own. This is widely accepted as well. And it is important to understand there are many different ways without occupation for Israel and Palestine and Jordan and Egypt and the United States and others to cooperate in providing that security.  Now, balancing those requirements was among the most important challenges that we faced in the negotiations, but it was one where the United States has the ability to provide the most assistance. And that is why a team that was led by General John Allen, who is here, for whom I am very grateful for his many hours of effort, along with--he is one of our foremost military minds, and dozens of experts from the Department of Defense and other agencies, all of them engaged extensively with the Israeli Defense Force on trying to find solutions that could help Israel address its legitimate security needs.  They developed innovative approaches to creating unprecedented, multi-layered border security; enhancing Palestinian capacity; enabling Israel to retain the ability to address threats by itself even when the occupation had ended. General Allen and his team were not suggesting one particular outcome or one particular timeline, nor were they suggesting that technology alone would resolve these problems. They were simply working on ways to support whatever the negotiators agreed to. And they did some very impressive work that gives me total confidence that Israel's security requirements can be met.  Principle six: End the conflict and all outstanding claims, enabling normalized relations and enhanced regional security for all as envisaged by the Arab Peace It is essential for both sides that the final status agreement resolves all the outstanding issues and finally brings closure to this conflict, so that everyone can move ahead to a new era of peaceful coexistence and cooperation. For Israel, this must also bring broader peace with all of its Arab neighbors. That is the fundamental promise of the Arab Peace Initiative, which key Arab leaders have affirmed in these most recent days.  The Arab Peace Initiative also envisions enhanced security for all of the region. It envisages Israel being a partner in those efforts when peace is made. This is the area where Israel and the Arab world are looking at perhaps the greatest moment of potential transformation in the Middle East since Israel's creation in 1948. The Arab world faces its own set of security challenges. With Israeli-Palestinian peace, Israel, the United States, Jordan, Egypt--together with the GCC countries--would be ready and willing to define a new security partnership for the region that would be absolutely groundbreaking.  So ladies and gentlemen, that's why it is vital that we all work to keep open the possibility of peace, that we not lose hope in the two-state solution, no matter how difficult it may seem--because there really is no viable alternative.  Now, we all know that a speech alone won't produce peace. But based on over 30 years of experience and the lessons from the past 4 years, I have suggested, I believe, and President Obama has signed on to and believes in[[Page H160]]a path that the parties could take: realistic steps on the ground now, consistent with the parties' own prior commitments, that will begin the process of separating into two states; a political horizon to work towards to create the conditions for a successful final status talk; and a basis for negotiations that the parties could accept to demonstrate that they are serious about making peace.  We can only encourage them to take this path; we cannot walk down it for them. But if they take these steps, peace would bring extraordinary benefits in enhancing the security and the stability and the prosperity of Israelis, Palestinians, all of the nations of the region. The Palestinian economy has amazing potential in the context of independence, with major private sector investment possibilities and a talented, hungry, eager-to-work young workforce. Israel's economy could enjoy unprecedented growth as it becomes a regional economic powerhouse, taking advantage of the unparalleled culture of innovation and trading opportunities with new Arab partners. Meanwhile, security challenges could be addressed by an entirely new security arrangement, in which Israel cooperates openly with key Arab states. That is the future that everybody should be working for.  President Obama and I know that the incoming administration has signaled that they may take a different path, and even suggested breaking from the longstanding U.policies on settlements, Jerusalem, and the possibility of a two-state solution. That is for them to decide. That's how we work. But we cannot--in good conscience--do nothing, and say nothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away.  This is a time to stand up for what is right. We have long known what two states living side by side in peace and security looks like. We should not be afraid to say so.  Now, I really began to reflect on what we have learned--and the way ahead--when I recently joined President Obama in Jerusalem for the state funeral for Shimon Shimon was one of the founding fathers of Israel who became one of the world's great elder statesmen--a beautiful man. I was proud to call him my friend, and I know that President Obama was as well.  And I remembered the first time that I saw Shimon in person--standing on the White House lawn for the signing the historic Oslo And I thought about the last time, at an intimate one-on-one Shabbat dinner just a few months before he died, when we toasted together to the future of Israel and to the peace that he still so passionately believed in for his people.  He summed it up simply and eloquently, as only Shimon could, quote, ``The original mandate gave the Palestinians 48 percent, now it's down to 22 percent. I think 78 percent is enough for us.''  As we laid Shimon to rest that day, many of us couldn't help but wonder if peace between Israelis and Palestinians might also be buried along with one of its most eloquent champions. We cannot let that happen. There is simply too much at stake--for future generations of Israelis and Palestinians--to give in to pessimism, especially when peace is, in fact, still possible.  We must not lose hope in the possibility of peace. We must not give in to those who say what is now must always be, that there is no chance for a better future. It is up to Israelis and Palestinians to make the difficult choices for peace, but we can all help. And for the sake of future generations of Israelis and Palestinians, for all the people of the region, for the United States, for all those around the world who have prayed for and worked for peace for generations, let's hope that we are all prepared--and particularly Israelis and Palestinians--to make those choices now.  Thank you very much. (Applause.)  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH146.txt,1853,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,5.0,January

We were elected by the good men and women of the United States who believe in our vision of America and who believe in our dedication to doing whatever it takes to ensure the American Dream is alive and achievable. It is for these reasons the REINS Act must pass.  Federal regulations imposed on American the job creators and households, an estimated $1.9 trillion burden in 2015.  Who pays that?  The American citizen does. It costs on an average, as Chairman Goodlatte brought up, $15,000 per U.household.  Could that money be better used to offset the cost of a college education or maybe the staggering cost of health care due to the Affordable Care Act?  Let me give you a real-life illustration from my district. A couple of years ago, a constituent, a dairy farmer, was targeted by an incredibly vague, broad, and costly EPA rule called WOTUS, Waters of the United The EPA sued and won this case not due to environmental damage, but due to the vagueness of this rule and the determination in court. It cost my constituent over $200,000 in fines and court costs for a natural depression in his pasture that the EPA determined could qualify as navigable waters.  The rule states that any water or any land that becomes seasonably wet is affected. I live in We get 54 inches of rain a year. That is my whole State of  This is downright outrageous. This is just one example of the many times the EPA has overstepped its authority by enforcing vague regulations unfairly on individuals. The REINS Act will prevent these costly job-killing regulations from going into effect and safeguard against Federal bureaucrats imposing the heaviest burdens on the American economy, and this will increase the livelihood of the American people.

1408,topic-id,194,"Mr.Speaker, the 115th Congress has a unique opportunity to clean the swamp, especially of Members who were convicted of committing felonies while serving in office and drawing a retirement check from the taxpayers.  I reintroduced the Trust Restored to the United States Taxpayer Act, which eliminates the taxpayer-funded portion of congressional pensions for Members who were convicted of a felony while serving. I applaud the 10 fellow Members of the House who cosponsored TRUST, and, in doing so, demonstrated they were willing to hold themselves accountable to their employers, the American taxpayers.  We are willing to hold ourselves to the same standards we hold those who serve in our military and elsewhere. If Members of Congress are serious about cleaning up Washington and are truly accountable for their actions then supporting this bill is common sense. If we break the law and break the trust of the people who have placed us in power as their representatives then we should be willing to forfeit the taxpayer-funded portion of our retirement.  We are not above the law. If anything, we should be held to a higher standard. I encourage my colleagues to support this.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgH220-3.txt,2115,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,9.0,January
1587,topic-id,428,"Mr.Speaker, today I will reintroduce my bill, the State Sponsors of Terrorism Review Enhancement This legislation passed the full House last Congress unanimously. I hope this Chamber will once again take up this commonsense legislation and pass it as soon as possible.  The designation of a foreign government as a ``State Sponsor of Terrorism'' is one of the United States' most powerful statements that we can give on another statement.  Besides imposing sanctions, the stamp of ``State Sponsor of Terrorism'' labels a state untouchable to the international community.                              {time}  1030  This pariah status is much deserved as these are states that support the killing of innocent people as a matter of policy.  Under current law, in order for a state to be delisted, the President of the United States only needs to certify that the country being considered for delisting has not engaged in supporting terrorism for a paltry 6 months. We are talking 6 months to be delisted. Considering the heinous acts of violence these countries have supported in the past, we should not be allowing them to be delisted after only 6 months.  To address this, my legislation will--and, again, it passed last Congress unanimously--quadruple the time a designated country must refrain from sponsoring terrorism, before the President can remove it from the sponsor list, from 6 to 24 months; increase congressional oversight by doubling the time Congress has to review the President's proposed removal from 45 to 90 days; establish a uniform process through which Congress can disapprove of the President's decision to remove a country from that list; and require the administration to notify and brief Congress upon initiating a review of a designated country's potential removal from the list.  This legislation will assert congressional scrutiny and oversight and hopefully bring to an end politically motivated delistings. Successive administrations--both Republican and Democrat alike--delisted countries based on their presidency's legacy rather than the facts. This will stop absurd delistings like that of North Korea in 2008.  North Korea was delisted in exchange for their promises of dismantling their nuclear program. However, 9 years and 5 nuclear tests later, they remain off the list. This rescission from the list has enabled North Korea to engage in supporting terrorism abroad. By increasing the amount of time for a state to not be engaged in terrorism and increasing congressional oversight and scrutiny, my legislation will not allow mistakes such as this delisting of North Korea's to take place.  I want to remind people that this passed unanimously, and we hope that we will get the support again.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH242-2.txt,2115,OBJECTING TO UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2334,2017.0,10.0,January

1025,topic-id,260,"Mr.Speaker, I oppose U.Security Council Resolution 2334--an anti-Israel, anti-Jewish attempt on behalf of pro-Palestinian nations to delegitimize Israel and ethnically cleanse East Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria of the Jewish people.  The Israelis have long been willing to compromise large swaths of land in this region in pursuit of a two-state solution. It has been the Palestinians who have, time and again, declined real offers on the table for their own state. Just think about this reality. If the Israelis agreed right now to make all of the concessions this U.Security Council resolution calls for, there would still not be peace. A viable two-state solution isn't just about Israel's recognizing the Palestinians' right to exist; it is also about the Palestinians' recognizing Israel's right to exist.
