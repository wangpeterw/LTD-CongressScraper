               HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLESTON HARTFIELD

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of 
Charleston Hartfield.
  Charleston was a military veteran who served for 16 years and was 
deployed to Iraq. He had received a Presidential Citation for 
extraordinary heroism in Iraq, along with numerous other individual 
commendations and achievement medals.
  After the military, Charleston began his career with the Las Vegas 
Police Department, where he had worked for 11 years while also being an 
active member of the National Guard.
  Along with protecting our Nation, he also enjoyed coaching youth 
football. Although he had no experience in football, he bought and 
studied books about coaching.
  Charleston was a husband and a father to a son and a daughter.
  He attended the Route 91 music festival on October 1 in Las Vegas 
with his wife, who was his high school sweetheart.
  Charleston died trying to save the lives of concertgoers. As gunfire 
erupted, he immediately jumped in to usher people to safety.
  He was loved by many and touched many lives.
  As a published memoir author, Charleston's story will always be 
remembered. He was a selfless man who dedicated his life to protecting 
the community and country he loved.
  We also grieve the loss of Charleston's mother, who died 2 days after 
his funeral from what many people said was a broken heart.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Charleston Hartfield's 
family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas and the 
State of Nevada and the entire country grieve with you.
