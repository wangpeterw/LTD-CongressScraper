             UNSEAL RECORDS INTO AGENT BRIAN TERRY'S DEATH

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, in December 2010, U.S. Border Patrol Agent 
Brian Terry was killed with a gun that was traced back to the 
Department of Justice's Operation Fast and Furious. His family awaits 
answers.
  Agent Terry's family recently testified before the House Oversight 
and Government Reform Committee that the Obama administration 
continually denied all efforts to release any additional information 
about his death. They are now calling on President Trump to finally 
unseal the records and expose the dirty secrets behind this tragic 
scandal.
  It is shameful that the Trump administration has been repeatedly 
accused of collusion and coverups based on unsourced rumors, while 
little attention was given to the Obama administration's blatant 
efforts to cover up the truth into Agent Terry's murder.
  Under Operation Fast and Furious, roughly 2,000 firearms were 
purposely sold to criminals, which were later smuggled into Mexico, and 
have been linked to multiple homicides.
  The Obama administration stonewalled Congress, investigators, and 
Americans for years and, to this day, refuse to take responsibility for 
their mistake.
  It is time for the truth. We have an opportunity to return 
transparency and trust to our government, and I fully support the Terry 
family's request for the records to be unsealed.
