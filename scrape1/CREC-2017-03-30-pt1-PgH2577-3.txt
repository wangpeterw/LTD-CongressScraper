                     SUPPORTING PLANNED PARENTHOOD

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my unwavering 
support for Planned Parenthood.
  Planned Parenthood is America's most trusted provider of reproductive 
health care. One in five American women has chosen Planned Parenthood 
for health care at least one time in her life.
  The heart of Planned Parenthood is in our local and rural 
communities. These healthcare centers provide a wide range of safe, 
reliable health care; and the majority is preventive care, which helps 
prevent unintended pregnancies through contraception, reduce the spread 
of sexually transmitted infections through testing and treatment, and 
screen for cervical and other cancers.
  In my district, Planned Parenthood was instrumental in providing the 
following services to over 50,000 constituents in 2016, including:
  23,215 pregnancy tests and counseling;
  5,798 breast exams; and
  5,052 pap smears.
  This is the end of Women's History Month. That is why I am here today 
to stand with Planned Parenthood, and I will continue to fight.
