             37TH ANNIVERSARY OF ``I LOVE LIFE'' RADIO SHOW

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize one of radio 
broadcasting's longest running shows, ``I Love Life.'' Created by South 
Dakota native, Jerry Dahmen, the show has hosted several of country 
music's biggest stars and been featured on a number of local and 
national television programs.
  Since the program began airing on KXRB Radio in Sioux Falls, the show 
has featured more than 1,600 guests who have shared inspirational 
stories of what it takes to turn adversity into victory. ``I Love 
Life'' has also given

continued success in the years to come.
