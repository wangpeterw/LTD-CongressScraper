                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, through whom we see what we could be, and what we can 
become, thank You for giving us another day.
  Send Your spirit upon the Members of this people's House to encourage 
them in their official tasks. Be with them and with all who labor here 
to serve this great Nation and its people.
  Assure them that whatever their responsibilities, You provide the 
grace to enable them to be faithful in their duties and the wisdom to 
be conscious of their obligations and fulfill them with integrity.
  Remind us all of the dignity of work and teach us to use our talents 
and abilities in ways that are honorable and just and are of benefit to 
those we serve.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
