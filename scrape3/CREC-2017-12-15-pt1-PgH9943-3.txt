                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Peoples Church, Jacksonville, Texas, 
offered the following prayer:
  Our Father in Heaven, during this Christmas season may we remember it 
is better to give than to receive. And the best gift is the one given 
to those who cannot repay.
  And let us remember the homeless this holiday season, for so was our 
Savior's family on the night of his birth.
  And while the world went to be taxed, God taught the world about 
giving your best to perfect strangers, for in so doing we may be 
entertaining angels unaware.
  And like the wise men, let us never consider the distance or 
difficulty of our journey to offer our gifts to the King. And may we 
follow the example of this King, who being the very image of God, 
humbled himself to save others, laying down his life on the cross for 
their sin. That was the most perfect Christmas gift of all.
  In Jesus' name I pray.
  Amen.
