        COMMEMORATING THE DEDICATION OF THE WASHINGTON SPY TRAIL

  (Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the dedication of the 
Washington Spy Ring along Route 25A of Long Island's North Shore, in my 
and Congressman Zeldin's district.
  This group of American heroes is often overlooked because knowledge

that George Washington's Culper Spy Ring existed was not disclosed 
until 1930.
  Nathan Hale of the often noted ``I only regret that I have but one 
life to lose for my country'' is claimed by Huntington to have been 
captured there and gave rise to the spy ring.
  One of Culper's top spies was Robert Townsend of Raynham Hall, Oyster 
Bay, also known as Culper, Jr.
  Townsend posed as a Tory merchant in New York City. He relayed 
intelligence concerning troop movements, supplies, and British plots, 
using an expensive spy ring, coded messages, invisible ink, and 
elaborate signal system using everything from drying laundry to buttons 
on clothing.
  Their efforts turned the tide of the war by assisting Washington to 
outfox the British, even saving him from capture.
  As Washington said, and as is recounted to members of today's CIA:
  ``There is nothing more necessary than good intelligence to frustrate 
a designing enemy, and nothing requires greater pains to obtain.''
  I would like to thank the North Shore Promotional Alliance, Raynham 
Hall, the Ward Melville Heritage Organization, and the producers of the 
AMC television show ``Turn'' for promoting the legacy of these unsung 
American patriots.
