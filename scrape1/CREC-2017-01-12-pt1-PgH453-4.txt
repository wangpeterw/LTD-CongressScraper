                           HUMAN TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week we observed National 
Human Trafficking Awareness Day, and we continue to shine alight on 
this modern form of slavery. As a part of that effort, I am 
cosponsoring the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act, which isthe next 
step in helping the victims of human trafficking.
  The heinous practice of human trafficking exploits young girls and 
boys. These victims are oftentimes our most vulnerableand are taken 
advantage of by those with no regard for their well-being. The 
Trafficking Survivors Relief Act will allow victimsto petition courts 
to have their criminal records cleared of nonviolent offenses that were 
committed as a direct result of beingtrapped in human trafficking. It 
is a very important step, Mr. Speaker, in helping these individuals get 
the opportunity toreturn to living fulfilling lives on their own terms 
and getting the fresh start that they deserve.
  No man, woman, girl, or boy should ever be subjected to sex 
trafficking. We must remain vigilant in our fight against thiscrime and 
ensure that the victims receive the support and resources they need 
because, together, we can stop human trafficking.
