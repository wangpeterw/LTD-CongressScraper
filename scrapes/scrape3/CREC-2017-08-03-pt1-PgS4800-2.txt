            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. 
on Tuesday, September 5, the Senate proceed to executive session for 
consideration of Calendar No. 171, the nomination of Timothy Kelly to 
be U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia. I further ask that 
there be 30 minutes of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the 
usual form; that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate 
vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate; and that if 
confirmed, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's 
action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
