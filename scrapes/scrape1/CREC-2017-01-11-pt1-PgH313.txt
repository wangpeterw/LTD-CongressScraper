  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House

  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Meg Daly, 
the board of directors, the founders and partners whohave rallied 
behind the great vision of creating The Underline.
  Located in my congressional district, The Underline is a 10-mile 
linear park, an urban trail that extends from the DadelandSouth station 
to the Miami River and that will connect millions of Americans across 
Miami-Dade County through safe, alternativemethods of transportation.
  Mr. Speaker, this is underutilized land below Miami's Metrorail that 
has transformative potential for community mobility,positive economic 
impact, and enhanced quality of life.
  Thanks to the overwhelming collaboration of our south Florida 
community, there are also many new ideas that will beincorporated in 
creating this vision, such as dog parks, yoga programs, street art, and 
pop-up stores. This Saturday, January14, this recreational space will 
feature local artists, and the public will be able to experience art 
that inspires andchallenges us to be healthy, mobile, and connected.
  Congratulations to Meg and to all involved in The Underline.
