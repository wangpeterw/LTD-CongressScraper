                          Personal Explanation

  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No. 
305, No. 306, and No. 307 due to my spouse's health situation in 
California. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on the 
Democratic Motion to Recommit H.R. 2581. I would have voted ``nay'' on 
the Passage of H.R. 2581--Verify First Act. I would have also voted 
``nay'' on the Passage of S. 1094--Department of Veterans Affairs 
Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.
