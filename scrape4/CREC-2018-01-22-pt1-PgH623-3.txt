              WHY I VOTED NO ON THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION

  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I wish to explain to the American people 
exactly why I voted ``no'' on this continuing resolution earlier today.
  If you look at all that has been said about the Children's Health 
Insurance Program, what you are going to find is that we extended that 
program in this CR for 6 years with a savings of $1 billion.
  It is a sleight of hand, because we did not fund community health 
centers; we did not fund the disproportionate share hospitals, mostly 
rural in my district; we did not fund adequately the teaching 
hospitals.
  So if you wanted to really be honest with the American people, we 
could have extended the Children's Health Insurance Program permanently 
and saved $6 billion and would have had enough money in the savings to 
expand our community health centers, to fund disproportionate share 
hospitals, and to fund teaching hospitals, that which we did not do, 
and I voted ``no.''
