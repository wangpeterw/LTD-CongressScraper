                 CONGRATULATING SPECIALIST SUSAN TANUI

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Specialist Susan Tanui, the 2016 Army Soldier-Athlete of 
the Year.
  Specialist Tanui currently serves the soldiers at Fort Riley, Kansas, 
as a dental assistant.
  During her time in service, she has exemplified the Army's seven core 
values--loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and 
personal courage--through her dedicated service, which is exemplified 
by her numerous decorations and awards.
  In addition to serving the U.S. Army, Specialist Tanui is currently 
pursuing a degree at Liberty University, represents the Fort Riley 
Division running team, the All Army team, and the U.S. Armed Forces as 
an Army athlete.
  She has also represented the U.S. Army in the U.S. Track and Field 
National Cross Country Championships in 2015 and 2016 and hopes, one 
day, to compete in the Olympics.
  I commend Specialist Tanui's accomplishments, her outstanding 
character, and look forward to witnessing what she will do in the near 
future.
  Mr. Speaker, we are so proud of Specialist Tanui, the soldiers of 
Fort Riley, the home of the Big Red One.
