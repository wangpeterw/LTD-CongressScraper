               BIOMETRIC SCANNING AT THE NORTHERN BORDER

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express concern 
about the President's executive order wherein he supports the use of 
biometric scanning at all northern border crossings, including the 
crossing between the United States and Canada at Buffalo.
  The President's biometric scanning plan would effectively shut down 
the Peace Bridge, which is the busiest northern border crossing for 
passenger vehicles, and second for commercial vehicles, thus stopping 
the movement of traffic and trade, and creating a wall-like effect 
between the United States and Canadian relations.
  Canada is not our enemy. We are friends and trading partners. In my 
Buffalo district, we border Southern Ontario, the most populated 
province of all of Canada; and the Peace Bridge moves $30 billion in 
commerce, representing $230 billion in economic activity, and 1 million 
jobs.
  The biometric scan plan for the northern border is unworkable and an 
unnecessary barrier between friendship and trade.
