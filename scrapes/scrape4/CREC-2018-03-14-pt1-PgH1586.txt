                 IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT MARK J. BASERMAN

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in remembrance of a remarkable 
community servant, a faithful friend and husband, and a brave veteran: 
Sergeant Mark J. Baserman.
  A corrections officer who devoted many years of service at the State 
Correctional Institute in Somerset, Pennsylvania, Mark tragically lost 
his life in the line of duty on February 26, 2018. Known throughout 
Johnstown and by colleagues as a man of integrity, bravery, and 
strength, thousands attended his remembrance service to pay their 
respects to Mark and his family.
  A 1975 graduate of Greater Johnstown Vo-Tech High School, as a young 
man, Mark volunteered many years with the Oakland Volunteer Fire 
Company and he served in the Army. Before becoming a corrections 
officer, Mark worked more than 20 years as a first responder with East 
Hills Ambulance Service.
  Mark's life history of public service is evident. Putting others 
first, including his wife, Rebecca, and mother, Lucille--both who have 
physical disabilities--is a powerful testimony and a shining example.
  Mr. Speaker, as we grieve the loss of this honorable man, I offer my 
deepest condolences to Mark's family, friends, and the Johnstown 
community.
