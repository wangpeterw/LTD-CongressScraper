                THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS FOR SENATOR McCAIN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator McCain is an American hero. He 
is a hero to our conference. He is a hero to our country. Here in the 
Senate, he is a friend to almost all of us. Our collective prayers are 
with him now. We are thinking of Cindy and the rest of his family as 
well, along with his staff and the people of Arizona.
  Senator McCain, as we all know, has never shied away from a fight, 
and I assure you he isn't going to back down now. I know the Senator 
from Arizona will confront this challenge with the same extraordinary 
courage that has characterized his entire life, and he should know that 
we are all in his corner, every single one of us.
  We look forward to seeing our friend again soon, and we hope he will 
be back in the very near future.
