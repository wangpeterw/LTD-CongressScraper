                   SERGEANT JOHN BASILONE POST OFFICE

  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of 
the bill (H.R. 2815) to designate the facility of the United States 
Postal Service located at 30 East Somerset Street in Raritan, New 
Jersey, as the ``Sergeant John Basilone Post Office'', as proposed to 
be passed under suspension of the rules, be modified by the amendment I 
have placed at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.
  The Clerk read as follows:

       Amendment by Mr. Gianforte
       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
     following:

     SECTION 1. GUNNERY SERGEANT JOHN BASILONE POST OFFICE.

       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal 
     Service located at 30 East Somerset Street in Raritan, New 
     Jersey, shall be known and designated as the ``Gunnery 
     Sergeant John Basilone Post Office''.
       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, 
     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the 
     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be 
     a reference to the ``Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone Post 
     Office''.

  Mr. GIANFORTE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to dispense with the reading.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Montana?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request 
of the gentleman from Montana?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, the 
unfinished business is the question on suspending the rules and passing 
the bill, as amended.
  The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana 
(Mr. Gianforte) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, as 
amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to 
designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 
30 East Somerset Street in Raritan, New Jersey, as the `Gunnery 
Sergeant John Basilone Post Office'.''.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
