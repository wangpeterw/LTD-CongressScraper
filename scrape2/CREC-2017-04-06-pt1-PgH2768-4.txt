                   OUR WORK ON HEALTH CARE IS UNDONE

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, Congress is leaving for Easter break with 
work undone. For 7 years, we have told the American people that we 
would repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something better, and we 
have legislation that provides that opportunity. It is not a perfect 
bill--no bill is. But President Trump has said this is our best and 
only chance to get this done.
  The bill cuts taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars and reduces 
government by hundreds of billions, too. It keeps preexisting condition 
prohibitions and lets 26-year-olds stay on their parents' health care. 
But most importantly, it unshackles American families from government-
forced mandates costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars each 
year. Simply put, it is an enormous improvement over the status quo.
  My hope is we will be back next week before Easter. I know many of my 
colleagues are ready for the holidays, but we need to do what we said 
we would do: repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something better.
