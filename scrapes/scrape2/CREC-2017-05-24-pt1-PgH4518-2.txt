                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I am going to follow up on the prior 
speaker. I rise in support of National Foster Care Month. This month, 
we renew our commitment to ensuring that the 420,000 youth who are in 
our Nation's foster care system have a caring family and the 
opportunities they deserve.
  I am proud to be a member of the Foster Youth Caucus, which is 
devoted to highlighting the efforts of all those involved with 
improving our Nation's foster care system.
  I also rise to celebrate Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day. 
Today, more than 100 former foster youth from across the country are in 
D.C., paired with Members of Congress as we conduct the Nation's 
business.
  I am privileged to host Shantell House and Jeremiah McWright from 
California. Shantell is currently a student at Mills College and is 
passionate about current and former foster youth. Jeremiah joins me 
from San Diego, where he is studying public policy and has the 
potential to become a great business leader, or even a politician.
  It gives me great pleasure to welcome Shantell and Jeremiah, along 
with all of the participants of the Congressional Youth Shadow Day, to 
our Nation's capital.
