     WORKERS AND FAMILIES ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE NEW TAX CUT LAW

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, as I travel to each corner of my 
district, I hear from workers and families who are optimistic about the 
new tax cut law and what it means for their pocketbooks.
  There is a momentum in our economy, and the latest jobs report from 
February is another piece of positive news. Last month, the economy 
added 313,000 jobs, far exceeding expectations; the unemployment rate 
remained at a 17-year low for the fifth consecutive month; and labor 
force participation increased by more than 800,000 workers, the biggest 
surge in 15 years.
  Earlier this week, the National Federation of Independent Business 
released a survey that found small-business owners' confidence in the 
economy is soaring, and they are prepared to hire and raise wages 
without a government mandate. Imagine that.
  Madam Speaker, these are encouraging signs that our policies of 
reducing excessive red tape and cutting taxes are working.
  Let's build on these results and continue to advance solutions that 
improve the lives of the people we represent.
