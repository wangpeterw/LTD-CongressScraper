                          NORTH KOREA MISCHIEF

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this week, North Korea declared that 
it can launch an intercontinental ballistic missile at any time that it 
wishes.
  Even our own Deputy Secretary of State recently warned that Little 
Kim's weapon capabilities have shown qualitative improvement within the 
past year resulting in ``unprecedented level of activity.''
  Why is that?
  Well, because this administration has done little to stop Little Kim. 
Instead, the administration has naively pursued a strategy it calls 
``strategic patience.''
  Strategic patience is a fancy phrase for ignoring the obvious. There 
was a time when we kept North Korea on the State Sponsors of Terrorism 
List. They came off the list because they have made promises that they 
have clearly broken.
  Mischievous Little Kim's threats continue to grow bolder and bolder, 
with no repercussions. We cannot afford to risk the security of our 
citizens for the sake of diplomatic strategy that has proven to be a 
failure.
  This week I will reintroduce legislation to put North Korea back on 
the State Sponsors of Terrorism List because Little Kim is a terror to 
world peace.
  And that is just the way it is.
