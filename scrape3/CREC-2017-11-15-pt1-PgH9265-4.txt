                             WHY THE HURRY?

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the tax 
bill.
  Again, we find ourselves faced with a bill that will impact every 
American, but my Republican colleagues are rushing through. They won't 
even wait for the Congressional Budget Office to show us what the cost 
will be, to assess what this bill will do to our economy, to our 
children and our grandchildren.
  Why the hurry, Mr. Speaker?
  Is it in hopes that Americans won't notice the repeal of the estate 
tax, a tax that only applies to people so wealthy that entire States 
don't have someone affected by it in some years.
  Is it so that Americans won't notice that this bill repeals the State 
and local tax deduction for families, but not for businesses?
  Or is it so that Americans won't notice that it won't tax businesses 
earning income abroad, but it does tax individuals working abroad?
  Eighty percent of the tax cuts in this bill go to the top 1 percent 
of Americans. Republicans may pretend to hope that the money will 
trickle down to the average American, but we know it won't work. 
Trickle-down does not work.
