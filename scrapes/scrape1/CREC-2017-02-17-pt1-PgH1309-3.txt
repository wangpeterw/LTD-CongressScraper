                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Vincent DeRosa, St. Francis Xavier Church, Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer:
  O God, our creator and ruler, grant us to worship and serve You in 
truth of spirit and with reverent bodies.
  Keep blessing on our lips both in private and in public. Help us to 
honor the laws that govern us by humble submission.
  Dispose us to show affection to our own and to our neighbors. Help us 
to become truly one Nation under God until one day we share in the 
fullness of Your kingdom.
  We ask this in Your most holy name.
  Amen.
