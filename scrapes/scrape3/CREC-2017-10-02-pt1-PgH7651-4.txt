                        ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, last night we witnessed another 
unspeakable act of gun violence that took too many innocent lives.
  Today my heart breaks once again for those victims of the Las Vegas 
shooting and for the families whose

lives have been irrevocably changed by this terrible tragedy. Each of 
them is in my prayers today.
  Mr. Speaker, prayers alone are not enough. We cannot, in good 
conscience, sit idly by as innocent people continue to die.
  Mr. Speaker, there are reasonable steps that we can take to make our 
communities safer, things like limiting high-capacity magazines and 
banning assault weapons--weapons, by the way, that are weapons of war 
and have no business being on the streets in the first place.
  Mr. Speaker, we have a solemn responsibility as Members of Congress 
to ensure that our communities are safe. Let us honor the victims of 
the Las Vegas shooting by doing something to prevent such tragedies 
from happening in the future.
