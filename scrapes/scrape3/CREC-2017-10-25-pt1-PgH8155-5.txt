                  40TH ANNIVERSARY OF SUNBELT AG EXPO

  (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
the 40th anniversary of the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition.
  Last week, I had the pleasure in attending the expo with a few of my 
colleagues. Known as North America's Premier Farm Show, this annual 
event in Moultrie, Georgia, attracts visitors from across the Nation to 
showcase farming technology, research, and equipment. More than 1,200 
exhibitors participated to display the latest and greatest agricultural 
technology and innovation.
  Agriculture is the largest and oldest industry in the State of 
Georgia, and it is only fitting that an event that celebrates and 
encourages the success of agriculture be held in Georgia's Eighth 
Congressional District.
  American agriculture depends on strong and tireless advocates, and I 
commend the participants for creating an opportunity to educate the 
public on the importance of strengthening our farmers.
  As the world's agricultural leader, the expo recognizes the tireless 
work of American farmers and their role in providing a safe and 
affordable food supply. I could not be more delighted to stand here 
today and honor a truly spectacular event and look forward to its 
continued success.
