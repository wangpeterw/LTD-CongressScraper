                         TRIBUTE TO DUSTIN WAHL

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Dustin Wahl, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Dustin is a graduate of Sioux Falls Christian High School in Sioux 
Falls, SD. Currently, he is attending Liberty University in Lynchburg, 
VA, where he is majoring in politics and policy. Dustin is a dedicated 
worker who has been committed to getting the most out of his 
experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Dustin Wahl for all of 
the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years 
to come.
