                         MUSLIM AND REFUGEE BAN

  (Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to give voice to my constituents 
and their families whose worlds have been turned upside down following 
President Trump's executive order last Friday, which they feel is 
directed at Muslims. Since the order was signed, we have been flooded 
with calls, with messages; and no matter where I am in the district, 
people are scared and terrified.
  I cannot convey to this House enough the feelings of individuals who 
have gone through a stringent vetting process, who hold green cards, 
who are official legal residents--in some cases, even citizens--who are 
afraid that someone is going to knock on their door at 3 a.m. and take 
and deport them from this country. They are real people.
  The Detroit headlines are full today of stories of an Iraqi whose 
mother died, who had served with the military in Iraq, and was trying 
to bring his mother back. He is an American citizen. Another is a 
doctor whose wife is in Qatar and had taken her baby home--both here 
legally.
  We all care about keeping this Nation safe. We also have to protect 
the fundamental pillars of our Constitution.
