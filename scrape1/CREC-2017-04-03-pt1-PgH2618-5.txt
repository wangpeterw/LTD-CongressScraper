                         JOBS SHOULD BE JOB ONE

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her 
remarks.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the consensus for 
this Friday's Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report is that it will 
show the economy added about 178,000 new private sector jobs in March. 
That is a good number, though not as good as the March numbers in 
recent years.
  As The New York Times put it: ``Growth in the first 3 months of the 
Trump administration is looking much the way it did'' in the growth 
under President Obama.
  But because of the current administration's inaction on vital 
economic issues, like infrastructure spending, right now about one in 
three market experts now think that a near-term stock market correction 
may be in the cards.
  Instead of doing the things we need to do to rev up the economy, this 
body has been spending time trying to make it harder for women to 
access contraceptives, gutting our right to privacy on the internet, 
and trying to take health care away from millions of Americans. That is 
no way, Mr. Speaker, to create jobs.
  How about we do what the President said he wanted to do? Let's make 
the investments that we need now that will stimulate the creation of 
good jobs--good-paying jobs for Americans. That should be job number 
one for this Congress.
