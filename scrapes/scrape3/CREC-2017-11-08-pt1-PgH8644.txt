          RECOGNIZING WEST LUTHERAN HIGH SCHOOL FOR PATRIOTISM

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the patriotism of 
West Lutheran High School in Plymouth, Minnesota, and their annual 
Veterans Day celebration.
  Every day, the students at West Lutheran recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance, even when they did not have enough flags for their 
classrooms. So the senior American Government class raised $1,200 to 
purchase flags that will honor their alumni who have answered the call 
to serve in uniform.
  The West Lutheran Veterans Day ceremony is now a central part of life 
in the Plymouth community, and every year they recognize contributions 
and sacrifices made by those in uniform. This year, veterans will be 
treated to breakfast, the music of the West Lutheran band, and remarks 
by Tom Warren, Sr., a veteran of the U.S. Army and Operation Desert 
Storm.
  So, Mr. Speaker, I commend the West Lutheran community for keeping 
this tradition alive, and I also thank our veterans for the selfless 
acts of courage that keep our country safe.
