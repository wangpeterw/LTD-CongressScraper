SENATE RESOLUTION 64--CONGRATULATING THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION 
                        ON ITS 80TH ANNIVERSARY

  Mr. JOHNSON submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on the Judiciary:

                               S. Res. 64

       Whereas the Plastics Industry Association is the leading 
     association in the United States that represents companies in 
     the plastics industry;
       Whereas the Plastics Industry Association was founded as 
     the Society of the Plastics Industry in 1937 in Shawnee-on-
     Delaware, Pennsylvania, as the collective voice of a then-
     nascent plastics industry and has since become the chief 
     advocate for the entire plastics supply chain, including 
     plastics machinery manufacturers, plastics material 
     suppliers, plastics processors, moldmakers, recyclers, and 
     consumer brand owners;
       Whereas, today, the Plastics Industry Association 
     represents the interests of an industry that makes regular 
     and vital contributions to the healthcare, automotive, 
     advanced manufacturing, transportation, aeronautics, building 
     and construction, telecommunications, recycling, packaging, 
     and consumer electronics sectors;
       Whereas, over the course of the 80-year history of the 
     Plastics Industry Association, the association has--
       (1) advocated for the use of plastics; and
       (2) presided over the development of plastic from a low-
     cost replacement for metals, wood, glass, marble, shell, and 
     other traditional materials to the sustainable material of 
     choice because of its strength, light weight, recyclability, 
     and design versatility;
       Whereas the Plastics Industry Association hosts NPE: The 
     Plastics Show, which is the second largest trade show in the 
     United States and attracts more than 60,000 plastics 
     professionals from more than 100 countries to the United 
     States every 3 years;
       Whereas the Plastics Industry Association has hosted NPE: 
     The Plastics Show in the United States since the show was 
     first founded in 1946 and the show has served as a platform 
     for growth and innovation in the plastics industry of the 
     United States for 70 years;
       Whereas the Federal Government, through the War Production 
     Board, recognized the importance of plastics and the 
     contributions of plastics to the war effort during World War 
     II, a conflict in which plastics played an essential military 
     role with respect to weaponry, aircraft, wire and cable 
     technology, medical devices, and troop supplies; and
       Whereas the plastics industry generates $418,000,000,000 in 
     revenue annually in the United States and supports 
     approximately 954,000 jobs: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) congratulates the Plastics Industry Association on its 
     80th anniversary;
       (2) reaffirms the crucial role that plastics have played 
     over the last 80 years and continue to play in strengthening 
     the economy of the United States and improving the everyday 
     lives of the people of the United States; and
       (3) recognizes the importance of continued investment in 
     plastics, manufacturing, research, and education in the 
     fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
