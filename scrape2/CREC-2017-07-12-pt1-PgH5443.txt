                         PROTECT NET NEUTRALITY

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, net neutrality is something that is 
fundamental to our country. It is rooted in our First Amendment rights. 
It allows for an open marketplace, exchange of ideas, center for 
innovation, hub for communication, and so much more.
  In today's digital age, especially, ensuring an open, free, and equal 
internet for all--not just for those who can afford to pay to play--is 
crucial to level the playing field for everyone.
  The FCC's current proposal rolls back these freedoms for the benefit 
and profit of big internet service providers on the backs of students, 
entrepreneurs and innovators, small businesses, and all of us. Millions 
across the country have already sent in comments to the FCC expressing 
their strong opposition.
  On today's net neutrality day of action, I encourage everyone to make 
their voices heard. In just 5 days, the FCC public comment period 
closes. Now is the time for us to raise our voices to protect net 
neutrality, fairness, and equality for all.
