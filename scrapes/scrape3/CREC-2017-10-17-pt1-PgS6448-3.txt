                      REMEMBERING ROBERT BRADSHAW

 Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to remember former 
Reno police chief Robert Bradshaw, who recently passed away at the age 
of 79.
  Mr. Bradshaw served as chief of the Reno Police Department from 1981 
to 1991. Before that, he was an assistant chief for the San Jose Police 
Department. After working in Reno, Bradshaw served with the Nevada 
Highway Patrol and later became chief of the Concord Police Department 
in California.
  Mr. Bradshaw strongly believed in the role community plays when it 
came to reducing and preventing crimes in Reno. The Reno Police 
Department said he was widely regarded as an expert in community-
oriented policing and is credited with bringing that philosophy to the 
force.
  In fact, the police department's current motto of ``Your Police, Our 
Community'' has been attributed to him.
  One of Reno's longest serving chiefs, Bradshaw was a mentor to 
countless officers and had a large impact on the city. During his 
tenure, Bradshaw developed specialized units and created neighborhood 
advisory groups. He also started the community satisfaction survey in 
1987, which still continues three decades later.
  As Nevada's senior Senator, I know firsthand that Mr. Bradshaw's 
tireless efforts while chief made Reno a safer place. My thoughts and 
prayers go out to his family and loved ones as they mourn his 
loss.
