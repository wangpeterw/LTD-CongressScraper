                        FATHER TRAFFICS DAUGHTER

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House

  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is said that there is no need in 
childhood as strong as the need for a father's protection. That is a 
father's job.
  Recently, a Texas father arrogantly violated all of his 
responsibilities. He forcibly sex trafficked his teenage daughter. In 
the milky darkness of night, he would take her to truck stops and 
coerce her to have sex so he could pocket the filthy lucre.
  The 16-year-old was sold to multiple customers in a single night. 
Every dollar the deviant collected was stolen at the expense of his 
daughter's childhood. His evil and greed were so boundless that this 
so-called father placed ads on the internet to sell his daughter. She 
was sold on the marketplace of sex trafficking. But the girl was 
rescued. The defendant was convicted and put in the deepest bowels of a 
Texas prison.

  America cannot turn our back on the scourge of sex slavery. Mr. 
Speaker, our children, our daughters, are not for sale.
  And that is just the way it is.
