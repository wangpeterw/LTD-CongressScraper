                        RECENT ATTACKS IN SYRIA

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a mother. As I looked at the 
video of young children trying to survive, trying to live in Syria--
this is one of the most potent pictures--I had to come and cry out for 
the mothers and children of that vile and heinous act.
  I am calling upon Americans and this government to stop talking and 
to act, to begin to demand that Russia stop assisting President Assad--
himself a terrorist--against his people and begin to understand that 
the chemical attack was driven by Assad's bombers.
  No matter where it might have been, you have to know that families 
are here.
  To my Syrian neighbors in Houston, Texas, we are standing with you. 
We must find a resolution.
  Even as we are investigating Russian collusion and Russian 
investigation into elections, the President must say to Vladimir Putin 
to become a world citizen and not a thug. This is thuggish. We are 
killing people.
  The Syrian people and Syria deserve to live. We must stand up and 
fight together, and I hope that we will immediately be able to respond 
to this with the United Nations, with our surrounding neighbors, and 
with legislation that brings sanctions against Russia and Assad.
