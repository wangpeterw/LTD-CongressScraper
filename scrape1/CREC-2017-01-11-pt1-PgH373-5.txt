              GEORGIACYBER INNOVATION AND TRAINING CENTER

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud Governor Deal's plan 
to begin construction on the Georgia Cyber Innovationand Training 
Center in Georgia.
  Cyber is the new frontier in warfare. In order to field the threats 
of today and tomorrow, a 21st century military isessential. Our 
community back home in Georgia is proving to be a major influencer and 
champion in the cyber arena. With the U.S.Army Cyber Command's 
transition to Fort Gordon, numerous tech companies and jobs investing 
in our area, the creation of localcyber institutes substitutes, and now 
the establishment of the Georgia Cyber Innovation and Training Center, 
Georgia's 12thDistrict has the potential to become the security, 
technology, and innovation hub of the southeast.
  Because of the work that will be done here, we will be leading the 
charge in creating the cyber workforce and leading ourNation. The 
battlefields don't look like they used to. We have got to adapt fast. I 
am thankful to Governor Deal for his effortsto not only create jobs, 
but to strengthen our national security and invest in our community.
