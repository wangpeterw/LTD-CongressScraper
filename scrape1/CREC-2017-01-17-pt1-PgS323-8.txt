                        REMEMBERING TIM MITCHELL

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we received sad news yesterday. We lost a 
dear friend to many of us here in the Senate, a wonderful man, Tim 
Mitchell. He had a long battle with brain cancer. He was a member of 
the floor staff for many years. He did an amazingly outstanding job.
  Every organization has what they call unsung heroes. On the 
battlefield, they are the soldiers, our infantry men and women. In the 
automobile plant, they are the assembly line workers. In the hospital, 
they may be the nurses, the clerical workers, or the folks who clean up 
the floors late at night. Those organizations can't go on without

these people. They are the heart and soul of these organizations. They 
do their work quietly but proudly.
  If you had to pick someone who personified the unsung hero of this 
body, it would be Tim. He did his job every day. When you talked to 
him, you could see the pride and the knowledge he had in doing his job 
and doing his job well. He will be sorely missed by every Member here 
today, Democrat and Republican.
  Let's take a moment to remember Tim and send our best wishes and 
prayers to his family and his loved ones.
  (Moment of silence.)
  Thank you, Mr. President.
