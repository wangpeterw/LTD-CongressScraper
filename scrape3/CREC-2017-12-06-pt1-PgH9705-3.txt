                 DENOUNCING CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, New Jersey has one of the ten lowest firearm 
death rates in the country. That is because the people of my State have 
set the bar high for public safety.
  The bill my Republican colleagues just passed would undermine the 
will of the people and make New Jersey less safe.
  Mr. Speaker, in New Jersey, gun owners who want to carry a concealed 
weapon in public must meet stringent public safety requirements and 
have a really good reason to carry a concealed weapon loaded while in 
public.
  The people of my State can feel secure because they know that the 
people licensed to carry these guns in public are carrying their guns 
safely and responsibly.
  Mr. Speaker, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is the peak of 
Federal overreach. It is a special interest bill from the NRA that will 
overturn laws and undermine the safety of the State of New Jersey. 
Today's vote was bad for New Jersey and bad for our Nation.
