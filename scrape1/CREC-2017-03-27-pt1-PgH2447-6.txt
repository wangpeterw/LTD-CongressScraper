                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  In this moment of prayer, please grant to the Members of this 
people's House Your grace. Endow them with the gifts of wisdom and 
discernment, that in their words and actions they will do justice, love 
with mercy, and walk humbly with You.
  In so many places in our world, there are people living with unrest 
and uncertainty, most especially in Syria and South Sudan. In our own 
country, there is great concern about the future of health care among 
our citizens. Bring comfort to all who live in fear of their lives and 
welfare into the future, and empower those who have the access and 
ability to be of meaningful assistance.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
