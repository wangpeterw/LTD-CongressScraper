                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of mercy, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We thank You once again that we can come before You and ask guidance 
for the men and women of this assembly. Send Your spirit of peace, 
honesty, and fairness during this week when the budget is being 
considered and the work of appropriations continues.
  As violence and the threat of violence hang over our world, may we be 
continually thankful for and supportive of those whose life's work is 
keeping us safe. Send Your spirit of healing and comfort to those who 
are victims of these horrors in our world.
  May we in America, and all men and women of good will, be committed 
to working for peace in our homes, neighborhoods, and throughout our 
land and the world.
  Bless us this day and every day. May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
