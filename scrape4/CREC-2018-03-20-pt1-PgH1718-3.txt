  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the 
Speaker's table the bill (S. 2040) to designate the facility of the 
United States Postal Service located at 621 Kansas Avenue in Atchison, 
Kansas, as the ``Amelia Earhart Post Office Building'', and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
  The text of the bill is as follows:
