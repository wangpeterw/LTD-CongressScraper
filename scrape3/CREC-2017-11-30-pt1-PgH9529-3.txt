                                 HBCU 9

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the HBCU 9, the nine 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are celebrating 150 
years of academic excellence.
  These schools hail from six States and count great African-American 
leaders such as Eva Clayton, John Lewis, and Martin Luther King, Jr., 
as members of their illustrious alumni.
  The nine include: Alabama State University, Barber-Scotia College, 
Fayetteville State University, Howard University, Johnson C. Smith 
University, Morehouse College, Morgan State University, St. Augustine 
University, and Talladega College.
  Their achievements for the past 150 years are remarkable. They have 
cultivated a long history as incubators of innovation and continue to 
produce the next generation of leaders.
  Twenty-five percent of African-American STEM graduates, 40 percent of 
African-American lawyers, 50 percent of African-American teachers, and 
21 current members of the Congressional Black Caucus are proud HBCU 
grads.
  These schools were born out of necessity and have endured the test of 
time to spark a movement and create the African-American middle class, 
fundamentally changing this country for the better.
  Please stand with me in recognizing the HBCU 9 for their years of 
leadership in African-American communities and their dedication to 
helping students realize their dreams.
