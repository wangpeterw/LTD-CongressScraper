         RECOGNIZING SAN PEDRO HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS SOFTBALL TEAM

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the San Pedro 
High School girls softball team who late last month reclaimed their 
crown as L.A. City Section Division I champions.
  On the night of Friday, May 19, the Pirates won their first city 
title in 8 years and 17th overall. Star pitcher Cindy Robles persevered 
through illness to throw a four-hitter with three strikeouts, 
illustrating her toughness after coming down with a 102-degree fever 
earlier in the day.
  Her teammates were behind her every step of the way, always making 
the key play at the necessary moment. By rallying together and 
continually picking each other up, the Pirates girls softball team 
represents the true spirit of California's 44th Congressional District.
  No matter what adversity we might face individually, our community 
always finds a way to rally together in pursuit of our common goals. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to these strong young women 
and all they represent.
