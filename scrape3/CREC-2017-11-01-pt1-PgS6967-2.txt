                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS

                                 ______
                                 

                       TRIBUTE TO DIANA TOLSTEDT

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, during National Adoption Awareness 
Month, I have the distinct honor of recognizing Diana Tolstedt of 
Billings. For nearly three decades, she has been helping people 
navigate all aspects of the adoption process. She has made a positive 
and lasting impact in the lives of many Montanans.
  Through her work with Lutheran Social Services of Montana, Diana has 
gently guided and counseled adoptees, birth parents, and adoptive 
families. For a dozen years, she has been a recruiter with Wendy's 
Wonderful Kids, leading a program dedicated to finding adoptive 
families for the longest waiting children in foster care from eastern 
Montana.
  Throughout the United States, there are over 100,000 children in 
foster care who are waiting for adoption, each needing a loving home 
and stable environment to allow them to thrive and reach their 
potential. In the midst of this adoption challenge, folks like Diana 
are a guiding light to help others traverse adoption obstacles. I would 
like to thank Diana for having a heart as big as Yellowstone County and 
a commitment to brightening the hopes of children one life at a 
time.
