   CELEBRATING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL NATIVE AMERICAN CODE TALKERS

  (Mr. O'HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, Native American Heritage Month affords 
us the opportunity to honor the Native American veterans who fought for 
this great country.
  I rise today to celebrate the indispensable contributions of all 
Native American code talkers. Throughout much of the 20th Century, 
Native American soldiers used their native languages to develop 
unbreakable codes for military operations. Their actions were critical 
for many Allied victories.
  Every day, I am reminded of the contributions of the code talkers who 
served at Iwo Jima. A tribute to their service hangs in my office, and 
it contains this quote from Major Howard Connor, a signal officer for 
the Navajo code talkers: ``Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines 
never would have taken Iwo Jima.''
  I want to extend my sincere thanks to all the brave code talkers who 
served with honor and our veterans.
  One of the founding principles of this country is the celebration of 
the diversity of its people. When we recognize that, we truly are a 
more perfect union.
