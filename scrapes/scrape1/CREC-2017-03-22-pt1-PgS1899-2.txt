                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty and Eternal God, thank You for listening to our prayers. You 
are the high and lofty One, but You choose to dwell with those who have 
contrite hearts. Dwell with our lawmakers. May they meditate upon Your 
precepts and be guided by the light of Your Word.
  Lord, give them the wisdom to seek Your help in the day of trouble 
and beyond. May the memories of what You have already done provide them 
with the confidence that the best is yet to come. Do for them 
immeasurably, abundantly, above all that they can ask or imagine, 
according to Your power, working in and through them.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
