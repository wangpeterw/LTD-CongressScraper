  CONGRATULATING THE SERGEANT ANDREW BRUCHER VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS 
                               POST 5499

  (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Sergeant 
Andrew Brucher Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5419, located in Kauneonga 
Lake, New York, which will soon be celebrating its 50th anniversary.
  At the anniversary dinner, the post will honor two very special 
people: Mrs. Mabel Brucher, a Gold Star mother whose son Post 5499 is 
named for; and Mr. Raymond Jankowski, a veteran of the Second World War 
and founding charter member of Post 5499.
  Honoring those who have served our Nation should be a top priority 
for all Americans, and the VFW is an essential organization that 
fosters camaraderie among American veterans and advocates on their 
behalf.
  Congratulations to Post 5499. I look forward to honoring this 
important milestone with members of the post this weekend.

                          ____________________
