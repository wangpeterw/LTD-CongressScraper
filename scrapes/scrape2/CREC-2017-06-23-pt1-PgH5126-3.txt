        HONORING THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF JEFFERY M. SANDERS

  (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, sometimes this well feels like the well of 
sorrow, and such is the case today.
  I rise to honor a true and selfless public servant whose life was 
tragically taken before his time. Mr. Jeffery Sanders, a lifelong 
resident of Mayview, Missouri, and a firefighter, was killed in the 
line of duty on Monday, June 19, 2017. I have decided that I will be 
praying through the weekend and next week for his family.
  Mr. Jacob Hayward was a man who gave a great deal to his community. 
He was seriously injured also in the same heartbreaking accident.
  Jeff was well known in the close-knit community of 200 residents, 
having been a farmer in Mayview all of his life. He and his wife, 
Connie, raised two wonderful children, who continue to live in 
Lafayette County in Missouri's Fifth Congressional District.
  Mr. Sanders dedicated much of his time to Mayview and its Fire 
Protection District. He could always be counted on to make a fire call 
and help someone in need.
  In all of his activities, Mr. Sanders demonstrated dedication and 
commitment to the greater good of others. He was actively involved in 
the Mayview Lions Club, the Mayview Area 4-H Club, the Antique Tractor 
Club, and the Odessa FFA Advisory Board, along with his work as a 
volunteer firefighter with the Mayview Fire Protection District. He 
also spent time serving on the Mayview Special Road District.
  Mr. Speaker, this family has given a great deal, and we owe a great 
deal to them.
