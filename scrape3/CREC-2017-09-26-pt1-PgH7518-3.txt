                  HELP FELLOW AMERICANS IN PUERTO RICO

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we are right now 
witnessing a humanitarian crisis--not in some far-flung corner of the 
world, but right here at home. Mr. Speaker, 3\1/2\ million of our 
fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, fellow U.S. citizens, are without 
water and without electricity, cut off from the rest of the world. 
These are our fellow Americans.
  Puerto Ricans are just as American as we are. They have fought in 
every single one of our American wars. They need our help now. This is 
what we do best as Americans.
  When there is a crisis, we come together and help our fellow 
Americans. We must act now. This should be the number one priority of 
Congress and the White House this week, and we should not leave here 
until we have let the millions of people in Puerto Rico know that we 
will be there for them.
