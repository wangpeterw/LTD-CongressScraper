                       REMEMBERING KEVIN MAINHART

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Lieutenant Deputy Kevin Mainhart. A Yell County Sheriff's deputy, Kevin 
was killed during a traffic stop on May 11, 2017.
  Lieutenant Mainhart had served as a police officer for 20 years in 
West Memphis, Arkansas, before returning to Yell County 5 years ago to 
protect and serve his hometown. He lived a life of service that his 
wife, Pam, and two sons, Lucas and Cody, can be proud of.
  While words will never be able to console the pain and grief his 
family, community, and the State of Arkansas feel, we can take solace 
in the words of Christ, who said: ``Greater love hath no man than this, 
that a man lay down his life for his friends.''
  Yell County has lost a true friend and a servant. I thank Lieutenant 
Mainhart for his service and sacrifice and send my most sincere 
condolences to his friends, family, and all those affected by this 
senseless act of violence.
