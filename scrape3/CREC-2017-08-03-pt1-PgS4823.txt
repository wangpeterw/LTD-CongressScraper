                     CONFIRMATION OF MARVIN KAPLAN

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I voted in opposition to the 
nomination of Marvin Kaplan to the National Labor Relations Board, 
NLRB. The NLRB has an important responsibility to resolve labor 
disputes, protect worker rights, and ensure fair access to collective 
bargaining. Mr. Kaplan does not have experience arguing the law before 
the NLRB; rather, he has a history of working to erode its authority to 
protect the workforce.
  As a staffer on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, 
Mr. Kaplan has worked on legislation to overturn key NLRB decisions and 
delay and distort the union election process. He has provided no 
assurance that he would recuse himself from issues pertaining to his 
prior work that might lead to bias. Throughout his career, he has 
pursued policies that would undermine worker protections. He should not 
be appointed to a board that is charged with safeguarding them.
  President Trump has repeatedly promised to put the American worker 
first. The NLRB has a key role to ensure a fair deal for workers. It is 
unfortunate that the President's nominees for the Board have not 
demonstrated a commitment to that mission.
