                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Bless abundantly the Members of this people's House. During this 
season of new growth, may Your redemptive power help them to see new 
ways to productive service, fresh approaches to understanding each 
other, especially those across the aisle, and renewed commitment to 
solving the problems facing our Nation.
  The disagreements on the Hill are profound. Send Your spirit of hope 
and goodwill upon those who are struggling through current, contentious 
issues.
  May all Members, and may we all, be transformed by Your grace and 
better reflect the sense of wonder, even joy at the opportunities to 
serve that are ever before us.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
