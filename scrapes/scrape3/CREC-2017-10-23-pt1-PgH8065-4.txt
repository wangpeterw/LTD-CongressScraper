                 CONTINUE PROVIDING AID TO PUERTO RICO

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Friday marked 1 month since Hurricane Maria 
devastated Puerto Rico.
  According to my constituents, current conditions are as follows: more 
than 1 million Americans there lack access to clean water; mothers 
cannot make infant formula; people are getting sick from infected 
water; and nearly 80 percent of the island still lacks electricity.
  Struggles are everywhere: where there is help trickling in, there are 
lines, always lines; supplies simply aren't enough; medical facilities 
are running on hope; there is no reliable means of communication, so 
people cannot even register for aid; entire communities are cut off 
from modern civilization; millions desperately need assistance.
  President Trump visited the island for as long as it takes to play a 
round a golf, and he went to the wealthiest part of the capital city. 
Last week, he granted himself a perfect score for his response to the 
devastation. But the Trump administration continues to fail our fellow 
citizens in Puerto Rico.
  Mr. Speaker, 3.4 million Americans live in Puerto Rico, and they 
deserve our full support.
  Mr. President, can't you at least air-drop fresh water packets, food 
provisions, and telephones? Our military can do this anywhere in the 
world, why not Puerto Rico?
