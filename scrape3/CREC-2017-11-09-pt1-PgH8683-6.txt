                           SALUTING VETERANS

  (Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute all veterans on this day.
  As veterans, you may forever and eternally take your place amongst 
the unbroken line of patriots who have stepped forward, whether 
voluntarily or drafted, with youth and rigor and bravery for your 
Nation, for your family, and for the soldier on your left or right.
  On this day, we bestow honor upon you for once standing the watch.
  Because of the standard you have set, future generations will 
continue to serve with pride in our American heritage and be willing to 
preserve its providential promise, willing to uphold our God-given 
inheritance as free people, and they shall fight for freedom, whatever 
the cost, with dogged persistence and with an iron will handed down 
from your legacy.
  Happy Veterans Day, and may God lift you up, and may He always bless 
these United States.

                          ____________________
