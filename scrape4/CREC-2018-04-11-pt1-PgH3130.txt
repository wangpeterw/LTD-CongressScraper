                   CONGRATULATING COACH LANCE WIGFALL

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to honor Coach Lance 
Wigfall of East Orange, New Jersey, for becoming the 2017-2018 boys 
indoor track and field coach of the year.
  Coach Wigfall was a star track athlete at East Orange during the late 
1990s and early 2000s. Now, as coach, he is helping a new generation of 
young men grow as athletes and leaders.
  During Coach Wigfall's tenure at East Orange, the school's track and 
field team has broken onto the national stage. But Coach Wigfall 
reminds his athletes to enjoy the moment, trust the process, and always 
put academics before athletics.
  Coach Wigfall is a mentor and a role model for his team. He is an 
asset to East Orange and to all young people in New Jersey's 10th 
Congressional District.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coach Wigfall for 
becoming coach of the year.
