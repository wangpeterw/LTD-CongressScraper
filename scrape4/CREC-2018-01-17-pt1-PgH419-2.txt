                  MEDICAL DEVICE TAX BURDENS HOOSIERS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Messer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, after a 2-year delay, one of the worst parts 
of ObamaCare went back into effect at the first of this year. The 
medical device tax prevents Indiana companies from innovating, 
expanding, and hiring. This tax was created when ObamaCare was created, 
and that result has been a burden for the tens of thousands of Hoosier 
workers all over the State, including those in Warsaw, Bloomington, 
Mishawaka, and Indianapolis. It must be repealed.
  This tax is bad for patients because it drives up the cost of much-
needed medical devices, and it is bad for workers because it makes 
America's medical device industry less competitive around the globe.
  Fortunately, this week, some relief may soon be on the way. After 
weeks of debate and a lot of work, the government funding bill we are 
voting on this week would provide immediate relief by repealing the 
medical device tax for another 2 years.
  This result will be good for Hoosier workers and good for Indiana's 
economy. In the long run, repealing the medical device tax will provide 
certainty in the marketplace and help keep good-paying jobs in Indiana.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the 2-year 
repeal of the medical device tax in the bill this week, and then 
continue working to find a long-term solution by permanently repealing 
the medical device tax.
