                             END HUNGER NOW

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, as kids, we were taught that breakfast is 
the most important meal of the day. Still, far too many students--
especially those living in poverty--arrive at school hungry each day. 
Congress can and must do more to bolster our school breakfast programs 
so that all students across the country have access to a nutritious 
breakfast to start the day.
  I have joined my Republican colleague on the House Agriculture 
Committee, Congressman Rodney Davis, on a bill to expand commodity 
support to the School Breakfast Program. The bipartisan Healthy 
Breakfasts Help Kids Learn Act will provide schools with additional 
nutritious food to ensure no student starts his or her day hungry. 
Importantly, this legislation will allow schools to expand their 
breakfast programs, improve their menus, and serve students nutritious, 
American-grown foods.
  Mr. Speaker, school meals are just as essential as a textbook when it 
comes to helping our kids learn and succeed. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues to advance this bipartisan legislation that, 
combined with other antihunger safety net programs, will work to end 
hunger now.
