                           SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to reaffirm this Congress' 
commitment to America's greatest ally in the Middle East,Israel.
  Last week, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to 
object to the United Nations Security Council anti-Israelresolution. H. 
Res. 11 was supported by most Democrats and all but four Republicans. 
The House vote was prompted by the Obamaadministration's refusal to use 
its veto power to shoot down a U.N. resolution condemning Israeli 
settlements.
  As I wrote in a recent op-ed: This U.N. resolution was one-sided. It 
failed to recognize that Israel is the only Jewishstate and that it is 
fighting for survival every single day. This U.N. resolution will be 
used to justify the actions of thosewho want to wipe Israel off the 
map.
  As I speak, we are still mourning Sunday's attack on a group of 
Israeli soldiers that left four dead and more than a dozeninjured.
  Mr. Speaker, I think most of us can agree that U.S.-Israel relations 
have hit a low point under this administration. When Ifirst ran for 
Congress 4 years ago, I ran on a seven-point platform that included 
standing with Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, I will not waver in my support for our friend. I hope 
the incoming administration sets a new tone inreestablishing America's 
alliance with the Jewish state.
  In God we trust.
