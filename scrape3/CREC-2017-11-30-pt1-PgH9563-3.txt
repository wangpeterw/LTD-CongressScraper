            IN MEMORY OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN MAURICE HINCHEY

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week we lost 
one of the finest people ever to serve the people of New York State and 
the country when Congressman Maurice Hinchey passed away.
  I would like to express my deepest condolences to his wife, Ilene; 
his sons, Reese and Josef; his daughter, Michelle; and the entire 
Hinchey family.
  Maurice leaves behind a legacy of service that is second to none. 
During his 18 years in the New York State Assembly, he became what 
former Governor Mario Cuomo called ``the environmental conscience of 
New York State'' for his groundbreaking investigations into polluters 
and landmark environmental laws.
  When he came to Congress in 1993, he continued that work, creating 
the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, preserving wild public 
lands, and doing everything possible to clean and protect his beloved 
Hudson River.
  Maurice and I came to Congress in the same class and we became fast 
friends. I already miss him dearly, but I know that his work and his 
legacy will be remembered for generations to come. To know him was to 
love him.
  Rest in peace, my dear friend.
