       CREATING ACCOUNTABILITY AT DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the passage of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act. This important 
legislation will create a culture of accountability at the VA and begin 
the process of restoring the VA's sole mission of providing high-
quality care for our Nation's veterans.
  For far too long, the VA has been plagued with scandal. From years' 
long wait lists to out-of-control bonuses, the VA needs real reform.
  In their selfless service to our great Nation, our veterans have 
sacrificed so much to protect us. They shouldn't be plagued with 
difficulty accessing the care that they need and deserve.
  As the mother of an Active-Duty U.S. Marine, I am sympathetic to the 
needs of our veterans. It is among my top priorities to make sure that 
we advocate for a better, more accountable VA. On behalf of the 
veterans of the 22nd District of New York, I am pleased to see this 
legislation pass with bipartisan support.
  Today, we are correcting a wrong that has hurt too many of our 
Nation's heroes. I look forward to seeing the President sign this 
measure into law and have full confidence in VA Secretary Shulkin's 
ability to implement the important reforms contained in this critical 
piece of legislation.
