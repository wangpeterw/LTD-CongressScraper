                   REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, for over 6 years, we have watched House 
Republicans attack the Affordable Care Act. The law maynot be perfect, 
but Republicans can't ignore the fact that the ACA has allowed 30 
million Americans to access affordable healthcare.
  Calls and emails have poured into my office from my constituents who 
are begging me to do everything in my power to protecttheir health care 
and to strengthen the ACA. Earlier this week I received an email from 
Brian in San Bernardino, who shared thathis wife didn't have insurance 
before the ACA. When the law went into effect, she had a physical, 
whereby doctors discovered shehad ovarian cancer. It was caught early 
and treated, and now she is living healthy in San Bernardino. If she 
had not obtainedhealth insurance through the ACA, she wouldn't have had 
a preventative screening, which saved her life.
  Mr. Speaker, we cannot strip 30 million people of their health care. 
We cannot look people in the eyes and say we are doingeverything we can 
to help them if we allow insurance companies to discriminate against 
them and to cap their coverage. I willnot compromise their health care 
or our future, and neither should you.
