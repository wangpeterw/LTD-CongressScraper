                     WELCOMING RABBI HERSHEL LUTCH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my friend, Rabbi Hershel 
Lutch, and to thank him for reading the opening prayer here on the 
House floor today.
  Rabbi Lutch has devoted his life to working for the Jewish community 
in the United States and around the globe.
  I met Rabbi Lutch on a trip to Israel that he and his organization, 
Aish HaTorah, helped to coordinate. That special trip showed me 
firsthand how our ally in Israel fights to survive and thrive every 
day.
  In addition to his work for Aish HaTorah, Rabbi Lutch is the CEO of 
the MEOR Foundation, an organization that strives to inspire Jewish 
students on college campuses to learn more about their history and 
heritage.
  In his personal life, Rabbi Lutch is a husband and a father and a 
son. He is an asset to his community and our country, and I am pleased 
we could hear from him on the floor today.
  Thank you, Rabbi, for blessing us here today and for your continued 
dedication to the Jewish people and to people of all faiths. It is an 
honor to know you.
