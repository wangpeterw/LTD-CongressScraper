                    LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Law Enforcement 
Appreciation Day, a day we set aside to thank those who risk their 
lives to protect our communities nationwide.
  These men and women are the hidden heroes of our country, and they 
deserve our respect and our gratitude. When they put on their badge and 
kiss their family good-bye each day, these officers have no certainty 
that they will return home safely. They willingly face that risk to 
keep the rest of us safe.
  This past year, 135 law enforcement officers made the ultimate 
sacrifice. One of those courageous individuals was our own Officer Scot 
Fitzgerald, who lost his life serving on duty with the South 
Jacksonville Police Department, located in my district.
  Last night, throughout the Capitol, blue lights were lit to honor our 
heroes in blue. In my office, we lit our blue candle in remembrance of 
fallen Officer Scot Fitzgerald.
  In 2016, more officers lost their lives on duty than in any of the 
previous 5 years. Let us show our admiration and appreciation to the 
sworn law enforcement officers across the State of Illinois and the 
900,000 who serve and face danger in the United States every day. Not 
just this week, but throughout the year, we need to honor our law 
enforcement officials.
