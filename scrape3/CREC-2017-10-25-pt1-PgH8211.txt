      NORTH KOREA HAS WON THE TITLE: A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the saber-rattling rogue regime of 
North Korea should be back on the state sponsors of terrorism list, and 
here is why:
  This year, the North Korean regime kidnapped, tortured, and killed 
American citizen Otto Warmbier.
  In 2014, North Korea launched a cyber terrorist attack against Sony 
Pictures. A U.S. court also found, in 2014, that North Korea materially 
supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah in Israel.
  In 2010, another court found that North Korea provided support for 
the terrorist organization the Japanese Red Army for their 1972 attack 
at an Israeli airport.
  In 2009 alone, there were three weapons shipments from North Korea to 
terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.
  U.S. officials have said North Korea aided Assad the Butcher by 
setting up a nuclear reactor that was destroyed by Israel in 2007.
  Mr. Speaker, it is clear, North Korea is a state sponsor of 
terrorism, so let's let them officially wear the title along with their 
buddy, Iran.
  And that is just the way it is.
