                       INDIANA'S FISCAL STRENGTH

  (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, here in Washington, we are 
currently in the middle of an important debate on the Federal budget.
  It is clear that dramatic changes need to be made in the way that 
taxpayer dollars are spent. We need to get our Nation's fiscal house in 
order.
  As we consider important reforms, we would be wise to turn to my home 
State of Indiana. Last week, Indiana State Auditor Tera Klutz announced 
that our State currently has a rainy day fund of nearly $1.8 billion. 
Contrast that with a nearly $20 trillion national debt here in 
Washington.
  As Auditor Klutz noted in a press conference last week: ``Hoosiers 
can rest assured that their government takes the task of managing 
taxpayers' money seriously. Just like people across the State live 
within their means, Indiana has worked hard to spend less than we take 
in, invest in our priorities, and retain resources in the event of an 
economic downturn.''
  To get our fiscal house in order, we need more of this Hoosier common 
sense in Washington. The attitude and approach that has worked well in 
Indiana should be a model for the Nation.
