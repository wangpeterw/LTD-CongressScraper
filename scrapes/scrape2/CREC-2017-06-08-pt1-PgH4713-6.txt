                     FOOD POLICY IS FOREIGN POLICY

  (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, for years, I have said: Food policy is 
foreign policy.

[[Page H4714]]

  And I will say it again: Our food policy is our foreign policy.
  Think about it. Food unites family and friends. Food is nutritional. 
Food is medicine. Food is the cement that sets a foundation for strong, 
healthy neighborhoods.
  Just as Senator Dole and Senator McGovern worked together to rebuild 
SNAP, expand our School Lunch Program, and create WIC to fight hunger 
40 years ago, we know food security is a bipartisan issue.
  In Philadelphia, 20 percent of our population is food insecure, 
meaning 1 in 5 Philadelphians often don't know where their next meal 
will come from. To make our neighborhoods stronger block by block, we 
need to lay the framework for a strategy that gives our cities the 
resources to tackle this issue.
  Believe me when I say that I know our country is facing trying times 
we have never seen before. From Comey to Russia, to the President's 
budget, and the Republican attack on healthcare, I know firsthand that 
the Nation has a lot to lose under this administration.
  This is why we need to ensure that we have more tools in our toolbox. 
It is time to retool to fight hunger.
  Food is the glue that keeps neighborhoods and nations united. 
Together, let's roll up our sleeves and work to retool the way we fight 
hunger in our cities, our Nation, and around the globe. Our food policy 
is our foreign policy.
