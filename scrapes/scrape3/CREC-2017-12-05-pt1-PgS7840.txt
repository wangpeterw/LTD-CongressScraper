            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time 
to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the 
Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for 
consideration of Calendar No. 321, the nomination of Joseph Balash to 
be an Assistant Secretary of the Interior. I further ask that there be 
1 hour of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; 
and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on 
confirmation with no intervening action or debate; and that if 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon 
the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's 
action.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
