                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this Friday, the Federal Government runs 
out of money. We owe the American people a long-term solution to keep 
the government open.
  Democrats insist that this solution address the urgent issues facing 
the American people, those we represent. That means long-term funding 
for the Children's Health Insurance Program; funding for communities 
fighting the deadly opioid epidemic; funding for the VA Choice Program 
so that our heroic veterans get the care they need and deserve; passing 
the Dream Act; and providing additional disaster recovery funds for 
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Texas, Florida, and Colorado.
  I urge my Republican colleagues to be sure that these issues are 
addressed in the continuing resolution. Work with the Democrats. Let's 
get this done for the American people.
