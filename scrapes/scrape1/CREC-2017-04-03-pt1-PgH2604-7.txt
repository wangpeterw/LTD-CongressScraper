        REMEMBERING LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE OFFICER NICK RODMAN

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the city of Louisville will lay to 
rest Officer Nick Rodman, a loving husband, father, son, and friend, 
who died in the line of duty last week.
  The special commitment that the men and women of law enforcement make 
to protect and serve their fellow citizens is one that the Rodman 
family holds dear, and Nick felt that call to service deeply, growing 
up as the son and brother of fellow officers.
  He is survived by the loves of his life: his wife, Ashley; his young 
son, Mason; and his newborn daughter, Ellie Jean.
  I ask my colleagues and our Nation to join me, the Louisville Metro 
Police Department, and our entire city in honoring this public servant 
as he is laid to rest.
  To Nick's wife, Ashley: I hope the memories you have with your 
husband will be a source of comfort as you face this heartbreaking 
tragedy. The city of Louisville joins you in grief, and we will ensure 
that Nick will always be remembered.
