                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is the 30th anniversary of Domestic 
Violence Awareness Month.
  Domestic violence is a crime that impacts every race, gender, class, 
and sex.
  In my home State, 33 percent of California women and 28 percent of 
California men will experience domestic violence. Nevertheless, since 
this month was recognized for the first time in 1987, much progress has 
been made.
  I began my professional career as a prosecutor back in 1996, and I 
can tell you, back then it was tough to get a jury to understand and 
even listen to the circumstances behind domestic violence, and it was 
tough to convince jurors that domestic violence is not a private issue 
that should be kept in the bedroom, but instead, it is a righteous 
issue that needed to be brought out in our courtrooms.
  Fortunately, there were police officers to make arrests, there were 
prosecutors to try the cases, and there were advocates to give the 
victims the confidence they need to come forward.
  So this month we recognize those who support domestic violence 
victims, we vow to hold abusers accountable, and we strive to create 
and to update legislation that not only protects, but emboldens victims 
of domestic violence so that they can embrace living their lives.
