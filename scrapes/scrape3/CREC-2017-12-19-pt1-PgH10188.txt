                        THE REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to say 
no to this outrageous tax bill and do what is right for the American 
people.
  This bill gives more riches to the richest Republican donors, at the 
expense of middle class families and the poorest. This bill does what 
the American people already said no to, which is, it dismantles the 
Affordable Care Act. It throws 13 million Americans off of their 
healthcare and increases premiums for millions more.
  This tax bill eliminates most of the State and local tax deduction 
and shortchanges so many communities across the Nation, slashing 
education funding by as much as $152 billion over the next decade.
  This tax heist runs up the deficit by $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion 
and triggers automatic spending cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and 
services that children and seniors depend on.
  This tax scam gives 80 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. 
That is a war on any idea of opportunity and income equality in this 
country. It is not tax reform, and I urge a ``no'' vote.
