                   HONORING THE LIFE OF BRIAN FRASER

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Brian 
Fraser, who attended the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas on October 1.
  Brian loved adventures. He enjoyed hunting, deep-sea fishing, 
snowboarding, and above all, attending the sporting events of his four 
kids. When he wasn't working as the vice president of sales at 
Greenpath, he was out flying a plane with his newly earned pilot's 
license.
  Brian was known for being willing to help anyone and everyone. He 
loved giving back to the community and acted as a mentor for so many. 
He will be remembered for his love and passion for his children and 
family.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Brian Fraser's family and 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the entire country grieve with you.
