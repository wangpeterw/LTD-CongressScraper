           FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the first 100 days of 
President Donald Trump's administration.
  In his first 100 days, President Trump has enacted more pieces of 
legislation than any other President since Truman, facilitated the 
earliest Supreme Court confirmation since 1881, eliminated many onerous 
regulations to restore economic optimism and opportunity, protected the 
sanctity of life, and driven illegal border crossings to a 17-year low. 
His accomplishments are truly remarkable.
  I have appreciated President Trump's willingness to listen and work 
with Congress on major pieces of legislation. His effort to work with 
Congress is a breath of fresh air.
  President Trump made several promises to the American people, and I 
am encouraged by his efforts to fulfill them. Mr. Speaker, the American 
people are watching--they are watching both the President and those of 
us in Congress. They will not accept broken promises or half-hearted 
measures. They want results. I look forward to working alongside 
President Trump to keep our promises.
