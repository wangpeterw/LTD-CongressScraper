          CONGRATULATING PENN STATE WRESTLING NATIONAL CHAMPS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
the Penn State men's wrestling team for winning the NCAA Division I 
National Championship earlier this month in St. Louis, Missouri.
  Mr. Speaker, Penn State has been a force to be reckoned with in 
Division I wrestling. This is Penn State's sixth title in 7 years. It 
is the second consecutive national title.
  I could not be more proud of my alma mater or this team that gave us 
a season to remember.
  Many college athletes dream about participating at the NCAA 
championships. It marks the pinnacle of their athletic careers.
  Among the Nittany Lion national champions, All-Americans Bo Nickal, 
Jason Nolf, and Zain Retherford combined for a total of 82.5 points, 
which would have placed the trio sixth overall in the final team 
standings.
  Penn State also made history with All-Americans true freshman Mark 
Hall and redshirt freshman Vincenzo Joseph earning their first titles 
to become the first freshmen NCAA champions in program history.
  Congratulations to Coach Sanderson and the Nittany Lions on this 
outstanding achievement. Your hard work and dedication shows, and you 
are the pride of Happy Valley.
