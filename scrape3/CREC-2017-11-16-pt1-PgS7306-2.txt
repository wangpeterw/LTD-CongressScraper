       Whereas the United States is the only country with the 
     intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement;
       Whereas the economy of the United States grew by 15 percent 
     between 2005 and 2015 while net greenhouse gas emissions 
     decreased by 11.5 percent during that period;
       Whereas 30 States have adopted renewable electricity 
     standard requirements to demand clean energy production;
       Whereas 20 States have adopted greenhouse gas emissions 
     targets;
       Whereas 20 States have adopted energy efficiency resource 
     standards;
       Whereas 10 States have adopted zero-emission vehicle 
     targets;
       Whereas 9 States have implemented the Regional Greenhouse 
     Gas Initiative to construct a market-based system that sets a 
     cap on emissions from the electric sector that declines by--
       (1) 2.5 percent per year through 2020; and
       (2) 3 percent per year from 2021 through 2030;
       Whereas additional States may also soon join the Regional 
     Greenhouse Gas Initiative;
       Whereas 11 States have approved at least 1 energy 
     efficiency standard for appliances or equipment that are not 
     covered by Federal standards;
       Whereas 47 cities in the United States have adopted 100 
     percent clean and renewable energy goals;
       Whereas more than 2,500,000 people in the United States

     roofers, electricians, and steel workers;
       Whereas the majority of clean energy jobs in the United 
     States are blue collar jobs that pay well;
       Whereas the ``2017 U.S. Energy and Employment Report'' 
     issued by the Department of Energy found that there are 5 
     times as many people in the United States working in the 
     renewable energy sector than there are people in the United 
     States working in fossil fuel industries;
       Whereas the establishment of vehicle fuel economy emissions 
     standards--
       (1) is the single most significant action that has been 
     taken to reduce global warming pollution;
       (2) has helped create 700,000 domestic jobs in the 
     automobile industry of the United States since 2009;

     $100,000,000,000 at the gas pump; and

       Whereas the States, cities, Tribal nations, businesses, and 
     institutions of higher education of the United States that 
     support the objectives of the Paris Agreement represent more 
     than half of the economy of the United States; and
       Whereas millions of dollars for clean energy and climate 
     change adaptation resiliency in developing countries have 
     been provided by the United States through contributions that 
     are--
       (1) private, public, and Federal; and
       (2) made directly, bilaterally, and through multilateral

     United States--
       (1) should remain a signatory to the Paris Agreement; and
       (2) should support policies at the Federal, State, and 
     local level that promote the reduction of global warming 
     pollution and aim to meet the objectives of the Paris 
     Agreement.
