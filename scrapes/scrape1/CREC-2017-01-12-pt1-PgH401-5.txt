               LET'S WORK TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTHCARE PLAN

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, in his farewell speech, President Obama 
said that if anyone can put together an alternativehealthcare plan that 
is demonstrably better and covers as many people at less cost, he would 
publicly support it. I feel thesame way.
  The ACA is not perfect, and anyone who is serious about working to 
improve our healthcare system should count me as awilling partner. But 
that is not what we have heard from President-elect Trump and my 
Republican colleagues. Their irresponsibleplan is to repeal ObamaCare 
and then figure out what comes next. That is like jumping ship without 
a life raft or a plan.
  Repealing ObamaCare will leave 1.2 million people in my State without 
health insurance, allowing insurers to again denycoverage based on 
preexisting conditions or put annual and lifetime caps on coverage, and 
deny young people the option ofstaying on their parents' plan. This 
will hurt real people who depend on the Affordable Care Act.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in finding ways to improve our 
Nation's healthcare system rather than burning it down.
