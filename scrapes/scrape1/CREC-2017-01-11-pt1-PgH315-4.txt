                   MISSION STATEMENT OF A NEW MEMBER

  (Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for my first statement from 
the House floor, honored and humbled to serve as theRepresentative from 
New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District. I vow to work tirelessly on 
their behalf.
  We are all tired of Washington's partisanship, and I will work across 
the aisle, whenever possible, to get things done. NewJersey families 
and businesses are struggling with high taxes and not seeing good 
return on investment for the hard-earned taxdollars they send to 
Washington each year.
  I will work to bring those dollars home to fight domestic terror, 
deal with opioid abuse, improve our schools, and fix ourcrumbling roads 
and bridges. I will work to bring good-paying jobs back to New Jersey 
and keep them there, to lower our taxes,cut wasteful spending and 
unnecessary regulations, and ensure every tax dollar is used wisely.
  I will stand up for New Jersey values, ensuring that women, 
minorities, and the LGBT community are always treated withrespect. I 
will have the backs of our veterans, law enforcement, firefighters, and 
all first responders. I will stand withIsrael, ensure our children have 
clean drinking water, and stand up for equal pay and a woman's right to 
choose. I will work foreveryone in the District.
  Working together, I believe our best days will always be ahead of us.
