       REPEAL MANDATES AND TAXES OF OBAMACARE AND REFORM TAX CODE

  (Mr. GIBBS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. GIBBS. Madam Speaker, this Congress must keep our promises to the 
American people. Our first responsibility is to institute policies that 
will grow our economy and create jobs.
  For 8 years, Americans looking for work have suffered while the 
regulatory state sucked nearly $2 trillion out of our economy. We must 
rescind these burdensome regulations and enact a commonsense approach 
to regulations.
  ObamaCare has failed, and it is time to repeal or replace it with a 
patient-driven plan that incorporates free market-based principles. We 
have to repeal the mandates and taxes of ObamaCare and make sure no one 
falls through the cracks.
  Finally, we have to reform our Tax Code. It is far too long and 
complicated. We have to cut the tax rate from a maximum of 15 to 20 
percent.
  These policies will jump-start the American economy from a stagnant 
growth rate to more than 4 percent GNP growth rate. Only a vibrant 
economy can provide for a strong national security and robust 
infrastructure capable of supporting jobs.
