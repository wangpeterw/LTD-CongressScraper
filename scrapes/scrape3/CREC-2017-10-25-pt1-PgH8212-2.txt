        THE GREATEST ANTIPOVERTY PROGRAM IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the greatest 
antipoverty program in all of human history: the free enterprise 
system. Maybe the most remarkable achievement in human history is the 
fact that, over the last 40 years, about 80 percent of the world's 
worst poverty has been eliminated.
  We know the right combination of smart investments in things like 
research, education, infrastructure, and defense; fewer burdensome 
regulations; and simpler and fairer taxes creates the perfect 
environment for growth and innovation.
  So far this year, we have secured investments in things like boosting 
programs for early childhood education and Head Start, and medical 
research at the NIH. We have done away with job-killing regulations, 
saving hardworking Americans billions in compliance costs and millions 
of hours in paperwork.
  Now we have the opportunity to reform our Tax Code to help millions 
of Americans keep more of their hard-earned money, help small 
businesses create millions of new jobs, and help millions rise out of 
poverty.
  Mr. Speaker, now is the time to act. Let's get tax reform done and 
get tax relief to those who need it the most.
