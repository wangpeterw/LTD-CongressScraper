SENATE RESOLUTION 213--HONORING THE MEMORY OF DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT 
 SENIOR CORPORAL LORNE AHRENS, SERGEANT MICHAEL SMITH, OFFICER MICHAEL 
 KROL, OFFICER PATRICK ZAMARRIPA, AND DALLAS AREA RAPID TRANSIT POLICE 
 OFFICER BRENT THOMPSON, WHO WERE KILLED DURING THE ATTACK IN DALLAS, 
            TEXAS, THAT OCCURRED 1 YEAR AGO, ON JULY 7, 2016

  Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Cruz) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 213

       Whereas the horrific act of violence and hatred that 
     occurred in Dallas, Texas, on July 7, 2016, was the deadliest 
     attack on United States law enforcement officers since the 
     terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001;
       Whereas the attack occurred during a lawful, peaceful, 
     nonviolent demonstration and took place with the intention of 
     targeting police officers;
       Whereas law enforcement personnel and first responders 
     performed their duties and responsibilities admirably during 
     the attack and risked being killed for the safety of the 
     people of Dallas;
       Whereas President Barack Obama, President George W. Bush, 
     and other officials joined together for a memorial service 
     following the attack;
       Whereas the Dallas Police Chief helped a wounded community 
     heal in the aftermath of the attack and called on members of 
     the community to join law enforcement and become part of the 
     solution;
       Whereas the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (referred to in this 
     preamble as ``DART'') Police Chief demonstrated strong 
     leadership and compassion in responding to the first fallen 
     officer from DART in the line of duty;
       Whereas Friday, July 7, 2017, marks 1 year since the 
     attack;
       Whereas the community of Dallas and communities across 
     Texas and the United States continue to support the victims 
     of this attack and the families, friends, and loved ones of 
     those victims; and
       Whereas the community of Dallas and communities across 
     Texas and the United States continue to support the brave men 
     and women of local law enforcement for the dedicated service 
     that local law enforcement provides to the community: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) commemorates the victims killed in the heinous attack 
     in Dallas, Texas, on July 7, 2016, and offers heartfelt 
     condolences and deepest sympathies to the families, loved 
     ones, and friends of the victims;
       (2) honors the survivors of the attack and pledges 
     continued support for the recovery of the survivors;
       (3) expresses the belief of the Senate that an attack on a 
     law enforcement officer is an affront to the rule of law, the 
     promise of justice, domestic tranquility, common defense, 
     general welfare, and the blessings of liberty secured by the 
     Constitution of the United States;
       (4) applauds the bravery and dedication exhibited by the 
     hundreds of Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
     officials, emergency medical responders, and others who 
     offered support and assistance during and after the attack; 
     and
       (5) stands together united against violence and hatred, and 
     in support of the brave and honorable police officers across 
     the United States who work every day to keep the United 
     States safe.
