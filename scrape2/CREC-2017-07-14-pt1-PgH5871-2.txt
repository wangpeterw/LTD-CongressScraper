                      CHINA ABUSES ITS OWN PEOPLE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the United States is finally holding 
China accountable for its longstanding human trafficking abuses.
  In the State Department's 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report, China 
was downgraded to the worst level: tier 3.
  This means that, in the past year, the Chinese have done little to 
nothing to end human trafficking, which is nothing more than modern-day 
slavery in this communist nation.
  China's crimes include state-sponsored forced labor, sex trafficking, 
and trafficking of children, men, and women from other countries.
  This puts China alongside some of the world's worst offenders of 
human rights: Russia, Syria, and Iran.
  It illegally detains and tortures its own people, as well as U.S. 
citizens that are there. It also restricts the fundamental human right 
to free speech and freedom of religion.
  China is allowing labor and sex trafficking to flourish in its 
borders. Now the entire world knows what has been taking place behind 
their great wall of brutality: abuse.
  And that is just the way it is.
