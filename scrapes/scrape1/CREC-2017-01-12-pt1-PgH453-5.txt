                   REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the first time as a Member of 
Congress to discuss an issue that is at the forefront ofthe American 
conscience and is one that I care deeply about: protecting and 
improving the Affordable Care Act.
  Today, over 45,000 of my constituents have access to reliable, 
affordable healthcare coverage thanks to the Affordable CareAct. These 
are seniors who would otherwise be unable to afford their prescription 
drugs. These are working families who nolonger have to worry about 
being one illness away from bankruptcy. These are children who have 
been born with birth defects whowould have previously been denied 
coverage for having a preexisting condition or reached their lifetime 
limits before they evenstarted school.
  What concerns me most is this effort to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act without putting forth any sort of replacement. Thiswill have real 
consequences for American families, and it is simply reckless 
governance. We cannot play politics with 20 millionAmerican lives who 
depend on the Affordable Care Act for access to quality, affordable 
health care. This is not a game.
