            25TH ANNIVERSARY OF BMW GROUP PLANT SPARTANBURG

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 25th 
anniversary of the BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in Spartanburg, SC.
  Twenty-five years ago, BMW decided to make an investment in South 
Carolina. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the risk 
and vision it took to begin this venture. The Spartanburg workforce has 
a world-renowned reputation and is second to none. Without this 
workforce, we would have nothing to celebrate, so it is with great 
pride that I extend my sincerest gratitude for all of their efforts.

  In addition to the contributions BMW has made to South Carolina, we 
are also celebrating the strong relationship between Germany and the 
Palmetto State. Globalization and trade are crucial to South Carolina's 
economic success and play a huge role in maintaining a positive 
relationship with the United States and Germany. I am proud to be an 
owner of a made-in-South Carolina BMW X5 because it represents all that 
makes our country great.
  BMW has been a gift that keeps on giving for South Carolina, and 
South Carolina has been a wise investment for BMW. Thank you to all the 
hard-working men and women of South Carolina who have made this day a 
possibility. It is because of their dedication and diligence that South 
Carolina continues to be a prime destination for companies looking to 
invest and grow.
