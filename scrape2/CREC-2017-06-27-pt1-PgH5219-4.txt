    CONGRATULATING THE NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the National 
Air Traffic Controllers Association, also known as NATCA, on its 30th 
anniversary.
  Since its foundation, NATCA has worked to guide aviation policies and 
improve working conditions for its members with one goal in mind: to 
ensure that passengers arrive safely to our destinations.
  I would also like to recognize three remarkable individuals--Billy, 
Jim, and Mitch--whom I have met through NATCA's advocacy efforts. These 
men are committed to public service, first through their service in our 
Armed Forces, and then later as air traffic controllers ensuring that 
Miami's skies remain safe for all. Though Mitch has now retired, I know 
that his contributions to our Nation have not stopped.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating NATCA 
and its members on 30 years of outstanding public service.
