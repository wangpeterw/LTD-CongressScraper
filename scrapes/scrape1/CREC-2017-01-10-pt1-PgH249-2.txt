                   DESHAUN WATSON, A MAN OF CHARACTER

  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, last night, as we all watched 
football, no matter who you rooted for, team sports also still comes 
down to individuals. Last night, a young man named Deshaun Watson--the 
favorite son of Gainesville, Georgia, my hometown--showed the character 
that I have witnessed since he was a young boy, playing with my son in 
the 7- and 8-year-old little flag football league.
  His athletic ability has never been questioned, and last night it was 
on full display for the world to see. I believe that he is the best 
college football player in the country. Beyond football playing, he is 
a better man. He is looking forward to the leadership of his team, to 
the leadership of his classmates, and the leadership he has shown in 
his community back in Gainesville is exemplary and will not be 
forgotten.
  Gainesville is proud of its favorite son, Deshaun Watson, and of the 
national championship that he won last night with his team, Clemson, 
during the football game. But, as with everything in life, as the game 
ended, it reminded us that the games are played by men of character. 
Deshaun Watson is a man of character, and I look forward to watching 
his career as he goes forward.
