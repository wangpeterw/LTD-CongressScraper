                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Eternal Lord God, our sure foundation, we need You during this 
challenging season.
  As our lawmakers face a Friday deadline to fund the Federal 
Government beyond April 28, inspire them to be part of the solutions 
and not the problems. Remind them that Your first command to humanity 
in Genesis 1 was to be productive, to solve problems, to subdue the 
Earth, and to have sovereignty.
  Lord, give our Senators the wisdom to subdue division, rancor, and 
partisanship. May their primary desire be to unite in the common cause 
of doing what is best for our Nation and world. Show them how to 
protect the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
  May those who believe in You remember that You are the only 
constituent whom they must always seek to please.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
