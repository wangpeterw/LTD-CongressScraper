 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Olivia Torbert, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work she has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Olivia is a graduate of Washington High School in Sioux Falls, SD. 
Currently, she is attending Georgetown University in Washington, DC,

experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Olivia Torbert for all 
of the fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the 
years to come.
