                       TAX CREDIT AWARENESS DAY''

  Ms. BALDWIN (for herself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Coons, Mr. Reed, Mrs.

following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary:

                               S. Res. 28

       Whereas the earned income tax credit is a refundable 
     Federal tax credit available to low- and moderate-income 
     working families and individuals;
       Whereas the earned income tax credit encourages and rewards 
     work;
       Whereas, in 2015, the earned income tax credit lifted 
     approximately 6,500,000 people out of poverty, including 
     approximately 3,300,000 children;
       Whereas the earned income tax credit provides substantial 
     economic benefit to local economies; and
       Whereas an estimated 20 percent of eligible workers do not 
     claim the earned income tax credit: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates Friday, January 27, 2017, as ``Earned Income 
     Tax Credit Awareness Day''; and
       (2) calls on Federal, State, and local agencies, community 
     organizations, nonprofit organizations, employers, and other 
     partners to help increase awareness about the earned income 
     tax credit and other refundable tax credits to ensure that 
     all eligible workers have access to the full benefits of the 
     credits.
