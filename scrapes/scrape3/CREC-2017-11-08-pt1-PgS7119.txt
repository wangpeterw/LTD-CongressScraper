    DIABETES HEART HEALTH AWARENESS DAY'', COINCIDING WITH AMERICAN 
                             DIABETES MONTH

  Mr. NELSON (for himself and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 324

       Whereas 30,300,000 people in the United States, or 9.4 
     percent of the population, have diabetes, including an 
     estimated 7,200,000 people who are undiagnosed and an 
     additional 84,100,000 people who have prediabetes;
       Whereas adults with diabetes are 2 to 4 times more likely 
     to die from heart disease than adults without diabetes;
       Whereas at least 68 percent of people who are 65 or older 
     and who have diabetes die from some form of heart disease;
       Whereas, among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, 
     diabetes and cardiovascular disease are common, with 
     cardiovascular disease affecting 31 percent of beneficiaries 
     and diabetes affecting 28 percent of beneficiaries;
       Whereas the American Heart Association considers diabetes 
     to be 1 of the 7 major controllable risk factors for 
     cardiovascular disease;
       Whereas minority populations are disproportionately 
     affected by both cardiovascular disease and diabetes;
       Whereas findings from a recent study reveal that 52 percent 
     of adults living with type 2 diabetes are unaware they are at 
     an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and 
     complications from cardiovascular disease;
       Whereas 2 out of 3 deaths in people with type 2 diabetes 
     are attributed to cardiovascular disease;
       Whereas obesity, poor diet, and lack of physical activity 
     are all major risk factors for type 2 diabetes and 
     cardiovascular disease;
       Whereas 1,250,000 people in the United States have type 1 
     diabetes and the incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing 
     by more than an average of 2 percent each year;
       Whereas cardiovascular disease is a major cause of 
     mortality for people with type 1 diabetes;
       Whereas, according to the American Diabetes Association, 
     diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes cost the United States 
     $322,000,000,000 in 2012;
       Whereas cardiovascular disease accounts for 26 percent of 
     the hospital inpatient costs of treating people with 
     diabetes;
       Whereas most of the costs of diabetes, 62 percent, is 
     provided by government insurance, including Medicare, 
     Medicaid, and the military;
       Whereas appropriate awareness and education about the 
     cardiovascular risks associated with diabetes can effectively 
     reduce the health and financial burden of illness; and
       Whereas the designation of November 9, 2017, as ``National 
     Diabetes Heart Health

     Awareness Day'' and coinciding with American Diabetes Month, 
     will raise public awareness about the specific risks of heart 
     disease for people with diabetes and help to ensure people at 
     risk receive a timely diagnosis and proper treatment: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates November 9, 2017, as ``National Diabetes 
     Heart Health Awareness Day'';
       (2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of Health and 
     Human Services, as well as the entire medical community, to 
     educate people about the risks, symptoms, and treatment of 
     diabetes to include comorbid cardiovascular diseases and risk 
     factors;
       (3) encourages the greater coordination of federally funded 
     efforts that address diabetes or cardiovascular disease 
     independently to incorporate the common comorbidity of 
     diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including education and 
     actions that address both; and
       (4) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of Health 
     and Human Services.
