                        OBAMACARE'S MARKETPLACE

  (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, as a medical provider, I understand how 
critical and necessary patient choice and input is to theoverall 
quality of our healthcare system. Put simply, patients are better off 
when they are equipped to make their owndecisions.
  Unfortunately, ObamaCare limits patient choice, as outlined in this 
chart. In fact, in the ObamaCare marketplace, patientsin two-thirds of 
our country are limited to a choice of one or two insurers. Across five 
entire States, patients have only oneoption. To me, the marketplace 
looks more like a government-created monopoly under a system where 
every American is required bylaw to purchase the product.
  To make matters worse, the onerous mandates in the law have led to 
restricted physician networks. So not only do patientshave little 
choice regarding their insurers, they are also limited to what 
physicians they can see.
  It turns out we can't keep our doctors even if we like them. That is 
why we are offering a Better Way plan that expandschoice and empowers 
patients.
