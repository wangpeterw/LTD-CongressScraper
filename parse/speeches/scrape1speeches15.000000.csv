Mr.Speaker, I represent a part of the country that is the economic engine of not only Texas but our entire My Houston area district and the surrounding districts are responsible for some of the strongest economic growth in our entire country. These are good, well-paying jobs. There are few places in the Nation where you can graduate from high school, get some trade school certifications, and then be earning close to six figures just a couple of years out of high school.  You can do that in my district, where the petrochemical plants are thriving because of the low cost of crude oil and natural gas. Manufacturing is coming back and growing strongly in the petrochemical sector. Over $150 billion is being invested by American chemical countries across the Nation, with the largest concentration in the Houston area.  The previous administration took numerous steps to stop the oil and gas boom, and the Bureau of Land Management rule that was published in the waning days of the Obama administration was an example of one such overreach. This ill-advised rule was aimed at removing States and localities from[[Page H1026]]the BLM decisionmaking process and centralizing decisionmaking by a few political appointees here in Washington, D. This move simply undermines local communities and It undermines our ability to develop oil and gas resources on public lands. It threatens American jobs.  I call on my colleagues to put American manufacturing first. A vote for this bill today is a vote for American manufacturing jobs, many of them high-paying, blue-collar jobs and many of them union jobs across America's petroleum and chemical plants.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support and vote for this bill.  ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1023.txt,2270,1215,2017.0,7.0,March

14577,topic-id,285,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the so-called Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection I agree with the chairman of the full committee that we don't want to take away Second Amendment rights from our veterans. In fact, our veterans have the skills and understanding of how to handle firearms. I think about this as a doctor, though, who has served veterans and who has worked in the VA system.  We have an epidemic on our hands right now. Every day, 20 veterans commit suicide. That is 20 too many. As someone who has sat in the exam room and listened to these veterans, if there is any evidence or risk of suicidal ideations, if there is any risk of that, I[[Page H2107]]don't want to take doctors out of this process, and that is what I am worried about here. My first job is to do no harm and to do good and help protect these veterans.  Two out of three veterans who commit suicide do so with a firearm. We have got to prevent this. This is an epidemic, and it is a national crisis, and we know gun suicides are preventible.  When we see those risks, I want to make sure I, as a doctor, have the ability to act and protect that veteran. We need to address this problem like the public health issue that it is. We need to continue to allow doctors to report the risks when they see them. It makes their patients safer, their communities safer, and it is the right thing to do.  I would love to work with my colleague, a fellow doctor and the chairman of the full committee, on making sure we protect our veterans.

14572,topic-id,265,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection  It is unfortunate that under current practices, it doesn't take a doctor or a judge to determine a veteran is unfit to own a firearm. Not a doctor, not a judge; it just takes the assignment of the fiduciary.  Mr.Speaker, the women and men took an oath of office to protect and defend our Constitution--the same as we do in our offices to serve our veterans--and to stand in harm's way.  Mr.Speaker, this is exactly the opposite of what our legal system should allow. There is no due process. All of a sudden they go to the They are seeking help with maybe other issues that are out there--because they can't even have a judge or a doctor make that decision, if that is the case--but they do make a decision that they have to have a fiduciary to help them with certain things.  It is vitally important that we maintain the due process. This legislation still allows for dangerous individuals to be denied their firearms, but it leaves the determination to someone with the expertise to understand their case. This is a case where bureaucracy has run amok. We have got to stop it. That is what our job here is to do.  Our Second Amendment rights are vitally important. Each amendment and those rights under our Constitution are vitally important. And for those men and women who have served to protect those rights, shouldn't we make sure that they are protected with due process.  I urge my colleagues to support H.1181.

14548,topic-id,1295,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 91 provides for consideration of three separate joint resolutions intended to address government overreach by using the Congressional Review Act process. The first measure deals with the Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0 rule. This rule represents a remarkable overreach that encroaches on State and local authority.  By law, BLM is required to coordinate with local governments, but this rule would disrupt that longstanding principle. Under the Planning 2.0 rule, faceless bureaucrats in Washington would be tasked with micromanaging much of our Nation's land and resources. The rule also disregards the Department of the Interior's multiple-use mission. If left intact, the rule will harm grazing, timber, energy, mineral development, and recreation on our public lands.  This is government overreach at its worst. The Federal Government should not be telling communities and States what works best for them. Decisions should be made on the local level, with site-specific considerations, not landscape-level analyses as called for in this rule.  For 4 years, I had the privilege of serving on the Planning Commission for the city of Land use planning is and has historically been, in the United States, a local function.  Imagine a Washington bureaucrat trying to tell planning commissions in municipalities or counties anywhere in the United States how they are going to manage land down to the landscaping level. That is not the role of the Federal That is not what our Founding Fathers had in mind when they created this government. Yet this regulation would take us somewhere we have never been before.  Making matters worse, this regulation was pushed through in the waning days of the Obama administration, making it one the many midnight regulations jammed through at the last minute.                              {time}  1230  This Congressional Review Act measure is supported by over 60 organizations, ranging from the American Farm Bureau Federation to the National Association of Counties, to the National Mining There is broad support for revisiting this misguided rule.  This rule also provides for consideration of Congressional Review Act measures for two rules from the Department of Now, typically, in America, we think of education as a local and State endeavor. The Federal Government provides 15 percent, on average, of the funding for local school systems. Yet, we know that the Federal Government comprises over 50 percent of the requirements for red tape and paperwork. That imbalance harms our ability to deliver education at the local level where it matters the most.  As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I have been a consistent advocate for ensuring control over education is largely left in the hands of local school boards, teachers, parents, and administrators who know their students best.  I was very pleased to see Congress pass the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015, which replaced No Child Left Behind and fundamentally changed our Nation's K-12 education policies. Even better, this was a bipartisan effort that brought Members from both sides of the aisle together; and, yes, it was signed by President  The Wall Street Journal called the Every Student Succeeds Act ``the largest devolution of Federal control to the states in a quarter-century.''  A major goal of our reform bill was to empower States to create their own accountability systems. This is something else that has been consistent throughout American history. We have looked to the States to put in these accountability systems. I served on the Alabama State Board of This is much of what we did.  While there are broad-guiding principles outlined in the law, the intent of Congress was for there to be very little Federal involvement in the accountability process. Despite clear efforts in the Every Student Succeeds Act to limit the influence of the Federal Secretary of Education, the rule proposed by the Department of Education dealing with accountability gave far too much control to the Secretary, which ultimately harms our students.  Most concerning, the rule will restrict the flexibility that was at the core of the philosophy behind the Every Student Succeeds  We heard from local administrators, local school board members, State superintendents of education, State school board members from all over the country, from all types of States and all types of communities. They wanted to have more flexibility. They wanted to have their own control over their accountability programs.  When the rule was first proposed, leaders in the House and Senate sent a very clear and thorough explanation of their concerns to the Department of In fact, I even expressed my concerns about the proposed rule's contradiction of the statute directly to the[[Page H1024]]then-Secretary of Unfortunately, most of the concerns of Congress went unaddressed. The final rule gives far too much authority to the Federal Department of Education and stands in direct contrast to law passed by  As States work on their accountability plans, it is important that they have certainty that the Federal Government will not continue to exert undue power and influence over the process. Through this Congressional Review Act challenge, we can ensure control is at the State and local level and prevent unnecessary Federal overreach into our classrooms.  Finally, this rule provides for a Congressional Review Act resolution overturning the Obama administration's teacher preparation regulation. This is yet another rule that would exert far too much Federal authority over an area that has been traditionally reserved for the Teacher preparation is critically important to the success of our Nation's education system, but it is a process that has been successfully controlled and implemented at the State level with some grant assistance from the Federal  What might work to prepare a teacher in one State is totally different from what might work in another This rule makes no acknowledgment of that fact. This regulation sets up a one-size-fits-all Federal system, which is not what Congress intended.  As a former member of the Alabama State Board of Education, I can attest that we have highly qualified people who worked very hard every day to make sure we have skilled teachers in our schools who are adequately prepared. These school board members do not need the Federal Government to intervene and place additional burdens and requirements on them. The challenges are serious enough as it is.  Sadly, this regulation is just another attempt to allow bureaucrats in Washington to micromanage our States and local school districts. Groups like the American Council on Education and The School Superintendents Association expressed their concerns with the Federal overreach created by this rule. This resolution would block this unnecessary Federal involvement and keep control in the hands of the States, where it belongs.  Each of the three bills covered by this rule focus on taking power away from bureaucrats in Washington and, instead, empowering States and local communities. Heavy-handed policies from Washington have failed time and time again. It is critical that we use our power to overturn these overreaching regulations. It is clearly what the American people elected to us do.  Many on the other side of the aisle claim that, while they disagree with portions of these rules, Congress should not use the CRA process because it blocks the agencies from reissuing a rule in ``substantially the same form.'' However, this argument ignores the fact that the statute clearly states an agency may enact a similar rule if it is subsequently authorized by law. Thus, the CRA gives Congress the ability to rein in an out-of-control agency until we, the legislative branch, can give it further instruction.  Members on both sides of the aisle should welcome the chance to use this tool to make sure our legislative intent is actually followed by those implementing the law.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 91 and the underlying bills.  I reserve the balance of my time.

14550,topic-id,450,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to respond just briefly to a couple of points that my colleague from Colorado made, and I want to compliment him and his service on our committee. He is a tremendous member, and we appreciate his leadership.  We had a little bit of a constitutional law lesson there. The truth of the matter is, the Department of Education only exists because of an act of The only powers it has are the powers that we give them through the authorizing legislation. What we authorize, we can unauthorize.  The Every Student Succeeds Act took back a number of things we had authorized under No Child Left This is no violation of the separation of powers under the Congressional Review Act when we look at a rule-making authority that we have given to a Federal agency and see that they have done it in a way that is contrary to congressional intent and we take it back. We have the authority to do that, and we should take it back when we see overreach like this.  He also brought up how this might tie the hands of our new Secretary of Education, and I will take this point in time to congratulate her on her confirmation. What this will require her to do is to work with the Congress to make sure that we are on the same page.  I remember very clearly when the former Secretary of Education came before our committee. I, and many others, pleaded with him not to put out this rule because we told him this is not in keeping with the intent of Congress and with the words of Congress in the statute. He went forward anyway.  I believe Secretary DeVos is going to work with Congress to make sure, as the Department of Education, under her management begins to implement this law, it is done so in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the law.  I hope that that is what we will do between the legislative branch and the executive branch and every department of government, but, in the last 8 years, we didn't see very much of that. We basically had the executive branch of government force feeding things to us.  I think it is high time that we take action, whatever party we are in, to exercise our Article I powers to make sure we maintain control over the things we created through our authorizing statutes.

14559,topic-id,1421,"I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, the gentleman talks about regular order. This particular regulation from the Bureau of Land Management was enacted very quickly and hurriedly without input from State and county governments. So, essentially, this was a hurried-through rule that didn't have the regular order input that it should have had, yet another reason why it should be reversed through this Congressional Review  But it is also the case that this doesn't mean the BLM doesn't have any authority here. They can go back to their old regulation, which was already in place, and they can come up with a new rule so long as it is not a substantially similar rule, or they can come to us and seek specific authorization. The truth of the matter is this particular regulation has had so many problems, it cannot be tweaked or amended. They need to start all over again and take input from State and local government.  Now, I heard the gentleman talk about people who hunt and fish. I am a lifelong hunter and fisherman. In fact, I believe the gentleman has invited me to come to Colorado to go fishing with him, and I have invited him to come to the Gulf to come fishing with me. I spend a lot of my time with people who hunt and fish all over the country, and I have never heard anybody in the hunting and fishing community say: I really want the Federal Government to tell me when and how and where I can hunt and fish. Quite the opposite. My friends who hunt and fish want the Federal Government to stay out of it. They would rather let local and State people make those sorts of decisions, particularly as they pertain to land use management.  On the education issues, as I said before, I was an 8-year member of the Alabama State Board of My colleague from Colorado said something that is so true: getting a high-quality, well-trained, caring teacher in the classroom is the most important thing we can do for our schoolchildren. I don't trust the Federal Government to do that better than I trust State and local officials to do it.  We had this law, No Child Left Behind, that gave the Federal Government the power to determine when a teacher was highly qualified or not. I don't think anybody in Washington knows better how to assess whether a teacher is highly qualified or not than the principal and superintendent that that teacher works for, than the local school board that that teacher works for. There is nobody up here who can know that better than they can.  There is nobody up here who can do a better job of looking at the teacher preparation programs and saying they are good or bad than State school boards, most of whom, like me, were elected by the people, accountable to the people, instead of somebody up here who sits in some office and makes that decision for them.  Do we really think that is what the American people want? The American people want control of their lives back. They are tired of Washington bureaucrats telling them what to do, and they are really tired of the Federal Government telling the people they entrust with the education of their children what to do and what not to do. They want the people who make those decisions to be the people who live in their communities, that they see in church, that they see at the grocery store, that they interact with at the school every day. That is what they want. And they want us, the Federal Government, to get out of the way.                              {time}  1315  I talked to dozens and dozens of people who are school board members and teachers and people involved in the school administration who said this regulation by the Department of Education Accountability is way over the line, please don't let them go through with that. So we are being responsive to those people in doing this, and I am proud that we are.  Mr.Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 91 and the underlying joint resolutions.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 91 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       4. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution      the House shall proceed to the consideration, without      intervention of[[Page H1030]]     any point of order, in the House of the resolution (     78) reiterating the indisputable fact that the Nazi regime      targeted the Jewish people in its perpetration of the      Holocaust and calling on every entity in the executive branch      to affirm that fact. The resolution shall be considered as      read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on      the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening      motion or demand for division of the question except one hour      of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and      ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign       5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of House Resolution 78.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''

I had the opportunity, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to meet with Mr.I had a chance to talk with him concerning his vision for I participated in a lengthy committee hearing, where not only I had a chance to ask him questions but every member of the committee had a chance to ask questions and then had the opportunity to present questions for the Record and look at his responses to questions for the  I wish to say, at the outset of this debate before the U.Senate, Mr.Tillerson is a successful businessperson. I am certain he has great negotiating skills, as he has shown as the CEO of ExxonMobil, and I think that is an important ability to have if he were confirmed as Secretary of  I do think he wants to serve our Nation, and he has put forward his ability to serve as Secretary of State for the right reasons. However, I have serious reservations, as a result of this process, this confirmation process, that leads me to the conclusion that I cannot support his nomination, and I will be voting against his nomination. I wanted to at least start this debate by giving some of the reasons I will not be supporting Mr.Tillerson to be the Secretary of  Mr.Tillerson's business orientation and his lack of moral clarity to questions that were asked during the confirmation hearing, to me, compromises his ability to forcefully promote the values and ideals that defined America's leading role in the world for more than 200 years. When I am referring to the values, they are the values of good governance, the values of standing up for human rights, the values of speaking up for a free press, the values of recognizing the importance of civil societies, which is lacking in so many places around the world.  When Mr.Tillerson was asked the question as to how he would characterize what Russia is doing in Syria in supporting a regime that has attacked humanitarian convoys, whether that should be considered as war crimes, Mr.Tillerson was less than clear as to how he would characterize Russia's conduct in  When I asked Mr.Tillerson how he would characterize Philippine President Duterte's extrajudicial killings--this is a President who has authorized individuals to be killed on site without judicial process, which has been well-documented--whether that was a gross violation of human rights, Mr.Tillerson was less than clear as to whether that in fact would elevate to a serious human rights violation.  When I asked the question, whether under any circumstances we could have a national registry for any group of religious or ethnic minorities in America, his answer was not as clear as I would have hoped it to be. The answer should have been a simple ``no,'' but he did not give that answer in that moral clarity.  For all those reasons, I have serious concern as to whether he will speak with a strong voice on American values or whether that will be compromised for narrow business interests or for other considerations that should not take priority to the values that have made America the great Nation it is.  I was concerned about this before what has happened in recent days, but when I take a look at President Trump's first 10 days in office and I look at the Executive orders he has issued as President of the United States, it is even more critical that the next Secretary of State speak with moral clarity as to the values of  The gag order that was reimposed by President Trump wasn't the same gag order that other administrations have imposed. It is far broader and could prevent U.participation with health workers around the world to stop the spread of HIV-AIDS or to deal with the Zika virus or to deal with issues concerning global health issues, maternal health. I want someone, as Secretary of State, to say that America stands for providing the leadership we need on global health issues.  More recently, when President Trump announced his Mexican policy; that it would build a wall, he not only asked the taxpayers to pay for it once but to pay for it twice, to build the wall, which almost anyone will tell you will not work. We do have tunnels that we already know could go under walls. It will be expensive, but he is also asking Americans to pay for it twice because he is going to impose a tariff, at least that is under consideration, that middle-income families will end up paying--starting a trade war with And why? Why would you start this? Mexico is working with us to stop illegal immigration. They are working with us to stop the illegal trafficking of drugs. They are working with us to build a regional, natural economy that benefits both countries. Why would we pick a fight with our neighbor? It makes no sense whatsoever.  The last thing that was done over this weekend points out even more clearly why we need a Secretary of State who will speak with moral clarity, and that was this outrageous, reckless, and dangerous Executive order that would ban certain individuals from coming to It would put a hold on our refugee program and would establish a religious test for people coming to America--a Muslim ban. That is not what America stands for.  I believe that Executive order is illegal. I know that Executive order will put Americans at risk. I would like to know from our Secretary of State how he, if he is confirmed, would respond when other countries ask: Why should we help you when you will not allow people from Muslim countries the right to visit your country? Why should we give you that information? How will Americans, who are traveling abroad, be treated? It puts all at risk. Our next Secretary of State has to have that credibility to deal with other countries with moral clarity. Time and time again, when confronted with questions, Mr.Tillerson was not clear.  Let me give you one example that may sum up my concern on his moral clarity issues, and that is with We had asked several times whether he would support the existing sanctions, would he support stronger sanctions. After all, the sanctions were put on because Russia invaded They[[Page S466]]are still there. They are still in They are still interfering with eastern Unless they comply with the Minsk agreement, our European allies are looking for America to say no way would we ever weaken our sanctions as long as Russia is violating its commitment in  Since that, they have been doing other things. I already mentioned the war crimes they are committing in Syria, but they also attacked They attacked us through cyber, trying to bring down our democratic system of government, free elections. I would certainly have hoped Mr.Tillerson would have shown some compassion for increasing sanctions against Instead, we asked him a question about Cuba, and Mr.Tillerson was very clear when he talked about He said: Look, if we do business with Cuba, we are allowing a repressive regime to have greater resources. Why would we want to support a repressive regime?  Mr.Tillerson didn't show the same concern about He has no compulsion at all about doing business with Russia, even though that business is allowing the Putin repressive regime to carry out their activities of attacks against our allies, attacks against us, interfere with what is going on in Syria, and to do all the activities they are doing. I would have hoped that we were seeing a greater sense of moral clarity from our Secretary of State nominee.  There are other issues I am concerned about. I know we will have a chance to talk about it if this issue is still on the floor tomorrow, as I expect it will be. We will have a chance to talk about issues regarding his quick use of military power versus diplomacy. We asked him several times about external events and how he will respond to them. His answer was too quick about using our military and not quick enough about using our diplomacy. The use of military must be a matter of last resort. I want to make sure our next Secretary of State is very sensitive to that particular issue.  Then we get to the concern about the ethical issues. I need to mention this because when we asked him questions about his knowledge of ExxonMobil, he was less than forthcoming to the committee, not aware of ExxonMobil's lobbying on certain issues, and very unclear about how its activities were in Sudan, Syria, Iran, and other countries that have horrible human rights records. And his willingness to recuse himself from anything affecting Exxon for 1 year, not for the entire length of term that he would be Secretary of State if confirmed by the Senate--he should not deal with ExxonMobil for the entire length of his time as Secretary of He is a person who has substantial wealth as a result of his working at None of us criticize him for that, but it disqualifies him from dealing with  We are going to be involved in a lengthy debate on the next Secretary of State, as we should, but I just wanted to share with my colleagues my concern about Mr.Tillerson and why I am opposing his nomination. And I would just indicate that I think the events particularly over the weekend with this immigration policy really point out the need for the next Secretary of State to be willing to stand strong for American values, and I have serious questions in that regard on Mr. With that, I yield the floor.

Steve Hammond is a Maryland native, raised in Towson's Rodgers Forge neighborhood. He learned many of life's lessons on the football and lacrosse fields before graduating from the University of Delaware with a degree in mass communications. Since his mother, sister, and brother have all been involved in television production, it is no surprise, perhaps, that Steve gravitated toward the business of broadcasting and interned for several stations. He discovered he felt most at home in the newsroom and was drawn particularly to the variety of daily reporting. In 1985, after working without pay for 2 weeks to illustrate his potential value, Steve was hired by WHYY, a[[Page S1888]]PBS affiliate in Philadelphia, Two years later, on March 23, 1987, he joined WBOC-TV to serve as the first bureau chief for Dover, It was there that he first began to anchor news broadcasts. It was a role, it turned out, which suited him perfectly.  Today Steve Hammond is WBOC-TV's main anchor and managing editor. He has become a household name in the region, having covered countless elections, major crisis, and natural disasters. Steve has flown with the Blue Angels and interviewed U.He also has filed reports from several foreign countries to tell the stories of local troops in harm's way in Iraq and Steve is highly respected in his field and has been widely recognized, winning innumerable awards, including a prestigious national Edward Murrow Award and distinctions from the Associated Press and Radio Television News Directors Association; yet Steve is characteristically modest about his accomplishments. If he were inclined to brag about anything, it probably would be about his beloved family--his sons Graham and Hunter, and his wife, Heather, who are his favorite companions for a day at the beach.  Steve Hammond is deeply invested in his community and has volunteered for many years for numerous charitable organizations, including Junior Achievement, March of Dimes, Easter Seals, Big Brothers/Big Sisters and The Salvation He has helped spearhead The Salvation Army's Red Kettle Holiday Campaign on the Eastern Shore of He also serves as a member of the board of trustees for Worcester Preparatory School in Berlin, MD, and is a member of Trinity United Methodist Church in Steve's coworkers, friends, and audience appreciate the dedication, service, and leadership he shown professionally and privately throughout his career. As he enters his fourth decade at WBOC-TV 16, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Steve Hammond on 30 years of exemplary work and community service and wishing him all the best in the years ahead.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1887-2.txt,,CONGRATULATIONS TO READING RED KNIGHTS' VICTORY,2017.0,21.0,March

Mr.Speaker, first, let me say that the previous question and the rule should be defeated not just because it is designed to undo the protections that help the American people but because voting for this will prevent Congress, this Chamber, this body from clearly rejecting some of the White House's worst behavior.  Just over a week ago, the White House issued a statement on International Holocaust Remembrance That statement failed to mention that 6 million Jewish people were killed in the It never mentioned them.  It is deeply troubling because the United States has, until now, been at the forefront of the fight against efforts that would deny the extent of Jewish suffering and death during the And yes, there are still many deniers of the Holocaust who traffic in conspiracy and claim the whole thing never happened.  It should be a shocking omission coming from the White House, but, frankly, not all that surprising for an administration based on a campaign that trafficked in anti- But you know what? I thought to myself: maybe they will fix the statement; maybe this is all a misunderstanding, an accident. But no, they didn't fix it. They doubled down and they defended it. Not only that, we found out that the White House purposely took out the language stating that Jews died in the So it was not an error. It was purposeful from beginning to end.  Now, I know this: the White House thinks it is living in a post-factual world. They think that they can get away with saying anything they like and anything they want and that people will just believe it. But the truth is, what they say has very, very real consequences.  Even after our parents and grandparents, the Greatest Generation, fought and worked so hard to defeat Nazism, now we see a public dinner party held right here in this city where people were doing the Nazi salute.  Even after there has been so much work to stop targeting religions, now we are seeing a resurgence of swastikas across the country and around the world.  Even after law enforcement has worked hard to protect our people, now there is a wave of bomb threats against synagogues.  This is what is happening. This is fact. Frankly, those now feeling emboldened were inspired by the President, first in his campaign and now in his  We all know that one of the President's members of his National Security Council led a website that fosters extremist views. So don't count me amongst the surprised when the White House issues a statement like this, but don't expect me to accept it either. None of us, Democrat nor Republican, should accept it.  So I urge my colleagues to vote against this previous question, against this rule, to allow consideration of a resolution that states this Congress' clear position against Holocaust deniers. We need to restate the truth as clearly as we can.  The White House was wrong on this issue, and here are some more facts. Yes, the Holocaust happened. No, the Jewish people weren't simply another group of people in a long list of targets. The Holocaust was designed to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the Other groups of people were targeted and killed, but anti-Semitism was at the core of the Nazi ideology of a Final  As the late Nobel Peace Prize recipient Elie Wiesel said, while receiving the Congressional Gold Medal from President Ronald Reagan: ``It is true that not all victims were Jews, but all the Jews were victims.''  I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this measure so that we can, in a bipartisan way, express the truth. If people aren't going to tell the truth about this then we are all lost.  Truthfully, I found the White House statement to be shameful. It needs to stop, and it needs to stop now. This is your chance to lend your voice to the record. Will you stand with me? Will you stand against Jewish Holocaust deniers? Don't be enablers. This is your opportunity. There may not be another to repudiate what the White House has done.  Vote ``no'' on this previous question and vote ``no'' on this rule.

The proposed budget gives us a look into one's vision, our President's, for the future of  When I think about a vision for the future of America, I personally think of a vision that exceeds our wildest expectations. This is a vision where every boy and girl, regardless of the color of their skin, their gender, their religion, sexual orientation, where they live or how much money their parents have in the bank, has an opportunity to succeed, particularly in this country that we say is the greatest country in the world, and I do believe it to be so.  There is a famous Scripture that says: Because of a lack of a vision, the people perish.  I ask the question tonight: What is the vision for America under this budget?  My colleague has so eloquently laid out that education truly is the key. It starts in education for higher learning. But what about secondary education, where every child should have an opportunity to receive quality education?  We know that the budget proposed in America First cuts very necessary important programs that particularly hit the State of Florida, for example, the Teacher Quality Partnership, and Impact Aid support payments for Federal property, and international education programs. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers supports before- and after-school programs where children are able to receive tutoring, learn about the arts and music, and receive a meal during those programs.  Florida would be particularly hurt. Those programs are designed particularly for children that come from at-risk and poverty-stricken areas.  In those before-school and after-school programs, there is a focus on reading and math. And those programs often offer literary services to families of children that participate in those programs.  So back to the gentleman from Texas' question about what do we have to lose? In Florida, the overall graduation rate is 80 percent. But for African Americans, the graduation rate is about 72 percent, and lower for African-American boys. I can tell you, it is the lowest group.[[Page H2458]]  We can't afford to pull more resources from the Department of Education--a proposed budget cut of 13.5 percent, in the double digits--resources that have been dedicated to lifting up all children, but particularly children of color and children from low-income neighborhoods. In President Trump's budget, that 13.5 percent is about $9.2 billion from education.  What is being cut?  Not only the programs that I named, but about 20 other programs: $3.7 billion in grants for teacher training to make sure that children not only receive the best education that money can buy, but also have the best, most qualified, most prepared, most trained teachers. Programs aimed at helping to ensure vulnerable children in low-income neighborhoods are able to succeed. They, too, really deserve a fair shot.  These Federal programs were created to ensure that every child, no matter who they are, has access to education.  This budget cut completely eliminates Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity The name alone says it all, opportunity grants, grants that could offer need-based aid to around 1.6 million low-income undergraduates every year.

14613,topic-id,353,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in support of H.687. This legislation would establish a review process for grant applicants seeking to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed national voluntary consensus standards.  With threats consistently evolving, it is reassuring to see new technology emerge which will promote the safety of our communities and first responders. However, emerging technology is frequently developed faster than voluntary consensus standards can be implemented.  Recipients of grants under FEMA's State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative must procure equipment that meets these standards. Unfortunately, if emerging technology or equipment does not have a voluntary consensus standard and a grant recipient would like to use those funds to purchase such technology, FEMA does not have a uniform process to consider applications for that equipment.  H.687 requires FEMA to develop such a process for reviewing these requests. Previously, this bill was introduced in the 114th Congress by the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr.Payne, and subsequently received bipartisan support by my subcommittee and the Committee on Homeland Security as well as the House when it was passed under suspension of the rules in September of 2016.  I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Payne) for reintroducing this commonsense bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.687 because it will ensure our first responders have the ability to purchase equipment and emerging technology needed to effectively adapt to the current threat landscape.  Earlier this month, the Committee on Homeland Security released the January Terror Threat Snapshot, which found that the United States remains a top target for terrorists. It is clear that the threat to our communities is not going away.  Congress has the responsibility to make America safer and stronger. We can do so by ensuring commonsense measures are in place to ensure first responders have the tools that they need to address these threats.  I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.687.

14792,topic-id,551,"Mr.President, last week in testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Comey confirmed what many of us have been urging for months: the need for an independent commission to look into the Russian act of cyber war on our election and any possible collusion with members of the Trump campaign.  Comey confirmed that the FBI was ``investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russian efforts.''  He continued that FBI agents would pursue the investigation ``no matter how long that takes.''  This is incredible. I am not surprised, but it is incredible. Our Nation's top law enforcement agency is investigating possible links between those involved in President Trump's campaign and a foreign adversary known to have conducted an aggressive intelligence operation to help him get elected, and all the while, this President continues to deny any such attack, praise the dictator who launched the attack, and pursue policies that mirror those of the attacker, including the weakening of the Western security alliance.  Yet what has been the priority of the majority party amid this mounting and serious breach, one we already knew about 5 months ago?  Has it been to set up an independent commission to look into this unprecedented threat to our Nation and democracy?  Has it been to work with the White House to disclose all information in an open and transparent manner to clear up any concerns or suspicions? No, in fact the opposite--we still haven't even seen the President's tax returns to get answers on Russian money in his businesses.  Has it been to pass sanctions on Russia for its attack on our Nation?  Has it been to pass meaningful cyber security legislation, legislation blocked by the majority in the last Congress to make sure our next elections in less than 2 years are secure from attack?  So what has been the priority instead? Well, last week, the majority voted to make it easier to kill baby bears and their mothers in their dens. The majority also reversed internet privacy protections for consumers. A few weeks ago, the majority voted to reverse a law to help mitigate corruption in some of the world's most impoverished nations.  Of course, the majority failed to advance TrumpCare, which would have[[Page S2148]]stripped 24 million Americans of healthcare, a cruel bill that would have disproportionately hurt those who voted for President  This is a dereliction of our responsibility here in the Not one of these issues is more important than getting to the bottom of possible collusion with the Russians or of the possibility that some in the White House have been compromised by a foreign government.  I want to praise the few on the majority side who have spoken out on the need for an investigation, including Senator Graham and Senator They noted early on the need for an independent investigation.  Today a majority of Americans also want an independent commission. I am again calling for the same. We need an independent commission, one led by American statesmen or women of unquestioned reputation, say Sandra Day O'Connor or Colin  We did this after the attack of September 11, and this attack and its unanswered questions demand nothing less again today.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2147.txt,326,CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,2017.0,30.0,April

14601,topic-id,485,"Mr.President, I rise to thank my colleagues for their support of my legislation to overturn President Obama's eleventh hour rule that revokes States' rights to determine the best eligible subgrantees for title X family planning funding. It should be the right of our States to allocate subgrants under the title X program in the way that best fits the needs of the people living there. Unfortunately, like many other rules that were issued during the Obama administration, this rule attempted to empower Federal bureaucrats in Washington and silence our  As we all know, States are closer to and more familiar with the healthcare providers and patients within their borders and should be able to make their own decisions about the best eligible title X subgrantees, be they hospitals, federally qualified community health centers, or other types of providers. A number of States have acted in recent years to prioritize title X subgrants to more comprehensive providers, where women can receive greater preventive and primary care than they can with providers like Planned  The Obama administration's rule attempted to claim that providers like Planned Parenthood can ``accomplish title X programmatic objectives more effectively.'' This rhetoric does not match the reality. In fact, after Representative Diane Black and I led more than 100 of our colleagues in pointing that out to the Obama administration, HHS acknowledged the challenge of measuring effectiveness across all types of title X recipients and subrecipients and therefore removed the word ``effectively'' from the final rule.  So why was this rule implemented in the first place? It is because the Obama administration wanted to do everything it could to secure Federal funding streams for Planned Parenthood before they turned over the keys to the Trump administration. With our vote today, we prevented that from happening.  But let me be clear. Although it is no secret that I do not believe Planned Parenthood--the Nation's single largest provider of abortion services--is deserving of Federal taxpayer dollars, this legislation does not prevent Planned Parenthood or any other specific entity from receiving title X funds. If States like Washington or Massachusetts want to distribute title X subgrants to Planned Parenthood, this legislation to overturn the Obama administration's rule will not prevent them from doing so, nor does overturning the rule reduce overall funding levels for the Title X Family Planning  In fact, this legislation does not in any way decrease women's healthcare[[Page S2139]]funding. Rather, overturning the rule merely empowers States over a Washington-knows-best mentality and assures that States have the ability to identify the best eligible title X subgrantees. It restores local control and ensures that States aren't forced by the Federal Government to provide abortion providers like Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dollars.  I appreciate my colleagues' support of this legislation, and I look forward to President Trump signing it and scrapping the Obama administration's overreaching eleventh-hour rule.

14569,topic-id,1902,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I recently joined the Committee on Veterans' Affairs because of its bipartisan history of working together to improve care for our veterans. I stand ready to work with the committee--in particular, with Chairman Roe--and with every Member of this House to improve and work on the important issues that affect our veterans every day. However, I cannot support this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it.  As this House knows all too well, there is a veterans suicide crisis in this country, a crisis that is enabled by the easy access to firearms. Just last week, the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs, David Shulkin, told the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs that the issue of veteran suicide is one of his highest priorities, and it needs to be a priority of this House as well.  Today, on this day that we have this debate, 20 brave men and women who have worn the uniform in service of this country will take their lives in suicide, and the vast majority of them will use a gun.  As folks all over the country who have helped veterans know, the means matter. Research has shown that more than 85 percent of suicide attempts with a firearm are ultimately fatal compared with just 5 percent for all other means. That is why addressing the public health crisis in the veteran community demands a thoughtful and comprehensive approach: to ensure that veterans in crisis do not have easy access to guns and that they get the care that they need and deserve.  And yet, today, this House is voting on legislation that completely ignores the crisis that many of our most vulnerable veterans are facing. Unfortunately, this bill was rushed to the floor with no consideration in committee, collaboration, or even time for all of us to understand its full implications. The majority scheduled H.1181 for a vote in committee last week with the bare minimum notice required, even having to move the start time of the markup to comply with the 48-hour notice requirement.  During last week's committee markup, I raised the concern shared by many who work closely on this issue that H.1181 would end up being applied retroactively. The result of this bill being applied retroactively would mean that, if it should pass, more than 170,000 veterans currently prohibited from owning a firearm would be able to[[Page H2104]]pass a background check and buy a gun.  While the chairman expressed his sincere intent and desire that this legislation not be applied retroactively, it is fair to say that reasonable people disagree on how this bill would be implemented. This honest disagreement, alone, illustrates exactly why this House should be taking its time on a bill that could have such a profound impact on our Nation's veterans.  The fact of the matter is that, should H.1181 be signed into law, it would need to be read together with the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which requires--requires--Federal agencies to update the records they have previously shared with NICS, meaning, should this bill pass, the VA would be required to remove the 170,000 records they have previously shared with NICS since none of those were approved by a court, nor did they meet the new standard established by this bill.  Now, with respect to the text of the bill itself, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, contrary to its name, would create an end run around the firearms mental health prohibitor that we have attempted to refine and improve since Congress passed the Brady Act nearly 20 years ago and the bipartisan NICS Improvement Amendment Act of 2007.  Put simply, this bill would make it easier, not harder, for those veterans in crisis to get access to a firearm by establishing a new judicial requirement that is far higher than any other agency's or department's implementation of the firearms mental health prohibitor, and, quite frankly, would be impractical, if not impossible, for the VA to actually use. The VA is already strapped for resources, and it is unclear if it has the legal standing to initiate a legal proceeding such as that suggested in the bill.  As Members of this House know very well, there has been a fierce debate in this country over the meaning and extent of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. But the question before this House today is not whether an American has a right to own a firearm. The Supreme Court has been very clear on this issue, and the controlling law has been settled. However, constitutional rights are not absolute. As the late Justice Scalia wrote in the controlling Supreme Court Heller decision on the Second Amendment, ``the Second Amendment is not unlimited.''  The question before this House is whether we are going to summarily overturn the VA's efforts over the last 20 years to help prevent veteran suicide and protect veterans' families by reporting the names of veterans with serious mental health issues to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as  Supporters of this legislation argue that the current process used by the VA to share mental health records with NICS is overinclusive and must be thrown out and replaced with a process that ensures veterans' due process rights.  I agree that the current process is overinclusive, and I agree that we must do more to ensure veterans have sufficient notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a meaningful opportunity to appeal any decision that may impact their constitutional rights; and I stand ready to work with my colleagues on the committee and in this House to more specifically tailor the application of the firearms background checks law as it applies to veterans, both prospectively and retroactively.                              {time}  1430  But a wholesale elimination of the VA's long-established practice to help keep firearms out of the hands of veterans who are at serious risk of harming themselves or others is dangerous and misguided.  To be clear, of the 170,000 veterans currently prohibited from owning a firearm, as of 2015, almost 20,000 of them were diagnosed with schizophrenia, over 11,000 with dementia, and over 5,000 with Alzheimer's. For a veteran suffering with a significant mental health condition like one of these, access to a firearm is a serious matter.  Moreover, just 3 months ago, this Congress passed bipartisan legislation that codified a process for how the VA can make a determination of the mental capacity of a veteran before that information is sent to The 21st Century Cures Act, which passed this House 3 months ago by a vote of 392-26, required a veteran to be provided notice of a proposed financial competency determination and given an opportunity to be heard, present evidence, and be represented at a hearing.  H.1181 seeks to undo this carefully crafted compromise before we even have a chance to study the impacts of the 21st Century Cures Act or the VA's existing practices.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by 12 veterans, including retired Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus, whose leadership and support for our military and veterans community is unquestioned and who believe that this bill could put mentally ill veterans in harm's way by giving them easy access to firearms.

Instead of passing this      irresponsible and dangerous legislation, Congress should      instead do more to guarantee that all veterans have access to      world-class medical and counseling services. We urge you to      oppose this bill.       Our nation is facing a devastating epidemic of veteran      suicide. The bill you are debating comes at a time when an      average of 20 veterans commit suicide each day, two-thirds of      whom do so by using a firearm. We know that non-deployed      veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk of suicide compared      to the American civilian population, and deployed veterans      are at a 41 percent higher risk. Firearms are the most lethal      means when it comes to suicide, resulting in death nine out      of ten times. When vulnerable veterans have access to      firearms, they can do harm not only to themselves but also to      family members and loved ones. The impact of these tragedies      is felt in communities across our nation.       Last week, we were pleased to hear Secretary of Veterans      Affairs (VA) David Shulkin announce his intent to provide      urgent mental health care services to veterans with other-     than-honorable discharges. This is a step in the right      direction. Over 22,000 soldiers in the Army alone have      received these bad paper discharges since 2009 due to mental      health conditions, and they are among the ones who most need      access to comprehensive mental health services.       But they are not the only ones. In 2008, President Bush      signed a law requiring all federal agencies to submit the      names of individuals who are legally prohibited from      possessing guns to the National Instant Criminal Background      Check System (NICS). Since then, the VA has submitted over      174,000 names of servicemen and women who require a fiduciary      to manage their benefits and have been determined through      clear and convincing evidence to meet the federal standard      for gun prohibition. Of these 174,000, 19,000 are individuals      that suffer from schizophrenia and another 15,000 have severe            For these individuals, possession of a firearm could be      fatal. The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act would put at      risk the safety of these veterans and our communities by      changing the standard for gun prohibition, so the VA's      determinations would no longer stop a veteran from obtaining      a gun. Instead, the names of veterans already in the      background check system would be erased, putting them at much      greater risk of self-harm. This would be irresponsible,      dangerous, and life threatening to those who need access to      care, not weapons.       Just last year, Congress worked to ensure that all veterans      have appropriate due process protections in place through the      21st Century Cures This codified existing practice and      guaranteed that individuals who disagree with their final      adjudication have the ability to appeal this determination.       We appreciate your service to your country in the United      States Congress, and look forward to working with you to      support and protect our men and women in uniform and their      communities. In doing so, we urge you to oppose the Veterans      2nd Amendment Protection Thank you for your      consideration.

Everytown for Gun Safety,                                      New York, NY, March 7, 2017.     Re Reject H.1181, which would put U.veterans in danger.     Phil Roe,     Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,              Tim Walz,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: I write to      express Everytown for Gun Safety's strong opposition to H.     1181. In the midst of a suicide epidemic among our veterans,      this bill would discard hundreds of thousands of mental      health records from the background check system and enable      Veterans Affairs beneficiaries suffering from severe mental      illness to buy firearms.       The stakes could not be higher. Twenty U.veterans take      their lives each day--a suicide rate more than 20 percent      higher than among the civilian population. Two in three of      those suicides are carried out with firearms. While suicide      in the general population has decreased since the turn of the      century, suicide among veterans has not.       H.1181 would repeal the law that blocks VA beneficiaries      from possessing or purchasing firearms if they have been      found mentally incompetent, after receiving due process and      the right to a formal hearing. According to the VA, more than      170,000 prohibiting records for these beneficiaries are      already in the background check system. Under this      legislation, those records would no longer lead to a failed      background check--and would be removed from the system      entirely. H.1181 would roll back the law that prohibits      people with a VA incompetency finding from purchasing      firearms--even though many of these beneficiaries suffer from      schizophrenia or severe long-term post traumatic stress      disorder.       The current process works, and it provides veterans with      due process. To make an incompetency finding, VA officials      must have clear and convincing evidence. The beneficiary has      an opportunity to request a formal hearing and may appeal an      adverse decision to a federal judge. Indeed, the 21st Century      Cures Act, passed in 2016 by the Republican Congress and      signed into law by President Obama, provides new comfort at      the statutory level that beneficiaries can present evidence      from a mental health professional and be represented by      counsel at incompetency hearings.       When it comes to suicide, means matter. When suicide is      attempted with a firearm, the chances that a person will      actually end his or her life are radically increased. Because      firearms are uniquely lethal, up to 90 percent of suicide      attempts with guns result in death. In addition, suicide is      often an impulsive act and 90 percent of people who attempt      and fail to kill themselves do not end up dying from suicide.      Preventing firearm access in these moments of crisis can be      the difference between a long life and a tragedy.       I urge you to protect our service members and veterans by      rejecting H.1181.           Sincerely,                                                   John Feinblatt,                                      ____                                      Newtown Action Alliance,                                      Newtown, CT, March 14, 2017.       Dear Members of Congress: We strongly urge you to oppose      H.1181--Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, a bill that      would immediately remove 174,000 individuals deemed      ``mentally incompetent'' by the Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA) Secretary from the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System (NICS). These individuals who suffer      from serious mental illnesses like dementia, schizophrenia,      and severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be able      to access firearms more easily. With veteran suicide rate      increasing by 32.2% from 2001 to 2014, Congress should be      closing the background check loopholes rather than weakening      our background check system.

Among all U.adult deaths from suicide, 18% (7,403) were      identified as Veterans of U.military service.       In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.civilian adults was      15.2 per 100,000.       Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.     civilian adults has increased by 23.0%.       In 2014, the rate of suicide among all Veterans was 35.3      per 100,000. Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide      among U.Veterans has increased by 32.2%.       In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.civilian adult      males was 26.2 per 100,000.       Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.     civilian adult males has increased by 0.3%.       In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.Veteran males was      37.0 per 100,000.       Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.     Veteran males has increased by 30.5%.       In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.civilian adult      females was 7.2 per 100,000.       Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.     civilian adult females has increased by 39.7%.       In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.Veteran females was      18.9 per 100,000.       Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.     Veteran females has increased by 85.2%.''       Gun suicides and homicides are preventable with common      sense gun laws. Connecticut passed the second strongest gun      violence prevention laws in America after the Sandy Hook      tragedy, without infringing on the Second Amendment rights of      gun owners. Regrettably, Congress failed to take action after      the Sandy Hook massacre and over 400,000 Americans have been      killed or injured by guns since the gunman with severe mental      illness brutally gunned down 20 innocent children and six      educators in five minutes. If it can happen in Sandy Hook      then it can happen anywhere.       We urge you to adequately represent the 90 percent of      Americans who continue to support expanded background checks      to keep guns away from individuals who are a danger to      themselves or others.

14586,topic-id,448,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I note that the chairman noted the support of some of the veteran service organizations, and I think it is noteworthy that the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, has in the past supported this bill. They do not support it this year. They do not because they are so concerned about the crisis we are facing, particularly in their members--those who have come back from the wars in the last 10 or 20 years. They are concerned about that veteran suicide crisis that we are facing and are concerned that this bill might make that worse.  We have heard repeatedly assertions that this would be the only category, that veterans alone would be deprived without adjudication. That is not true. In fact, the law for the firearms prohibitor covers many categories of people who do not have any legal determination:       Anyone who is an unlawful user or addicted to a controlled      substance is prohibited, does not require any adjudication.  The NICS has 23,000 people who are prohibited under the controlled substance addiction and use category. Anyone adjudicated as mentally defective or committed to a mental institution, there are 4.2 million people. There are a wide variety of people who are in that category, again, many without court orders. Those were aliens, those dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, that is 10,000 individuals. So it is not unique to veterans. There are other categories as well.  But I really think the bottom line is this: we have heard a great deal of agreement that we care about our veterans, we want to prevent military suicides, and we know that for some of these veterans, it would be dangerous for them to have a firearm. That is precisely why this committee should have had a hearing, so we would have had the opportunity to systematically address these issues and find a better way forward that recognizes that some veterans who need a fiduciary also should not have firearms, and some who need a fiduciary, there is no concern there. But we have been deprived of that opportunity in committee, to do the work we should be doing in committee, to work together in a bipartisan way to fashion a better way forward.  This is way too far. It is an overreaction to a process that should be fixed, and we are committed to do that. But the alternative we are presented with today will wholesale uproot the 20-year process of the Veterans Administration that would be dangerous and wrong, and we remain committed to working together in committee.

14587,topic-id,281,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I note that 18 of the 26 Members of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee did not serve during a time when there has been a hearing on this bill--18 of us, and that includes me. The evidence that the chairman was referencing from 2015 was from a hearing that never occurred, so there was never an opportunity to discuss that evidence. Again, I think this underscores the extent to which we really do need a hearing.  I have to say, since 2012, when the Newtown shootings occurred in my district, the public feels differently about this now, and our veterans numbers have been going up and up. So I think it is high time for us to have a hearing. It has been 5 years. We should be looking at this process.  The last point I will note: there has been much made of the Constitution today and how outrageous it is. In 20 years since this process has been in place in the VA, I note that no one has ever challenged this successfully in court as a violation of constitutional due process, and I know the love our veterans have for the Constitution, as we do in this That tells me that many families, for example, actually are relying on this.  So, again, I pledge to the chairman we should be working together in committee to get this process right. This is not the way to do it, not with this bill, not with the questions, and not without an opportunity for us to do the things I have referenced.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

14631,topic-id,858,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague for his leadership, along with my classmate, who is also a very fantastic person. So I thank both of you for your leadership in terms of the Congressional Black Caucus and exactly what that means.  My colleague from Florida said that budgets are values. Something that you may not know, I have spent 36 years in the Pennsylvania Of those 36 years, I spent 28 years on the appropriations committee, and 20 of the 28 years as the chairman of that committee. So my colleague from Florida is absolutely correct that it is put your money where your mouth is, and that sets a tone for what you believe and what you think.  The President's proposed budget puts America's middle neighborhoods at greater risk, tilting towards decline.  What do I mean by ``middle neighborhoods''?  Middle neighborhoods are the neighborhoods that are caught between growth and decline, neighborhoods that, with just a little love and a little help, you can keep those neighborhoods. Those neighborhoods are all over Those are communities that we should value. We should understand that affordable housing and stable communities in those neighborhoods are very important to the backbone of  So these American middle neighborhoods are neighborhoods we should relish. We should value the importance of these communities. But under the proposed budget, they do not give our seniors, our children, or our working families a chance to get ahead--major cuts, Mr.Speaker, in funds for Federal student services, such as LIHEAP, grants for afterschool programs, community development block grants, community service block grants, and others to help families and help raise them out of Pennsylvania poverty.  Last week, Mr.Speaker, I met with students from the Pennsylvania TRIO, Gear Up, and Upward Bound programs. President Trump's budget proposes cuts for millions of these programs, which would support first-time, first-generation college students through outreach to low-income and minority middle and high school students.  This is our future. This is our future. We are in the 21st century. We understand if we are to be very competitive in the world, we must leave no child behind.  It is important, Mr.Speaker, to recognize that the investments we are talking about benefit all of us. If we want a strong economy, these middle neighborhoods are essential. These middle neighborhoods are where people grow and develop. They go on to college. They do well in school, and they hold our society together.  The President's budget undermines and cuts the crucial investments we have made in our cities and our neighborhoods, neighborhoods that we all come from, neighborhoods where we all recognize the importance of these communities. We should not take this for granted because the reality is, as my colleague from Florida said, our values are where our dollars are.  I totally agree with her because she is really telling us all that you can pay now or you can pay later. It is better to pay on the front end rather than the back end. It is better to understand that these communities are communities that help America be what it is today.  The President's budget undermines and cuts critical investments. The President's budget does not give our cities the adequate resources to invest in our communities and moves our cities in the wrong direction.  I think that the President, as my colleague just said earlier, says: What do we have to lose? Well, we have a lot to lose under this proposed budget.  This budget is no new deal for Black As a matter of fact, this is no deal at all. We clearly understand that this means cuts in health care, education, affordable housing, and food nutritional programs.  This is no deal because we understand that we must make investments. If we are talking about moving America forward and we are talking about making it what we know it can be in terms of America, we must make this investment. But we cannot make these investments, we cannot be talking out both sides of our mouths, and we cannot, on one hand, say what do we have to lose and then, on the other hand, do nothing in the budget whatsoever. So it is clear, Mr.Speaker, that we have a missed opportunity here.  I am proud to stand as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and join with all of my colleagues, as the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus has said, as being the conscience of the It is important to understand that we don't take that lightly. That is why we stand here today, Mr. We stand here to raise the voice, to stress to people that we are not going to give up, that we recognize that we all have a responsibility and an obligation in this democracy, that this is our democracy and it is something that we should never take for granted.  We have a lot to lose. We stand to lose everything that made our neighborhoods stronger block by block. So, Mr.Speaker, I stand here with all of my colleagues to carry this message to everyone that we are never going to give up--never, never, never.

Last summer when speaking to the African-American community at a rally in Philadelphia, President Trump asked the question: What do you have to lose? Yes, he asked that question: What do you have to lose?  President Trump, what don't we have to lose? The programs the President wants to cut is the Community Development Block Grant, Meals on Wheels, and funding for There are programs that help combat poverty by providing the resources for better schools and food nutritional programs. These are the programs that help provide for the most vulnerable Americans who are fighting every day to try to get ahead.  What do we have to lose? Look at what the Republicans are trying to do with the Affordable Care They say they want to cut costs and cover more Americans, but their plan doesn't do that. It does the opposite.  Take, for example, how they want to change the core structure of They want to shift the Medicare from an open-ended entitlement program to one with a limited lens that does not take into account individual needs on a case-by-case basis.  What do we have to lose? All of the investments we have made to try to stabilize our cities, the budget cuts will have a direct impact. Take, for example, Temple University Hospital in the heart of the Second Congressional Temple University Hospital stands to lose $45 million in funding. This translates into less jobs for our city and reduces the capacity of quality patient care. The President's proposal takes our city backwards. It unravels all of our hard work to make our communities more stable.  What do we have to lose? Everything that builds a brighter future for our neighborhoods, block by block. It is time step up, speak up, and speak out to hold our President accountable.  President Trump, we have a lot to lose. We are going to make sure you hear our message and our voice.

14578,topic-id,173,"Mr.Speaker, under current practice, if a veteran or beneficiary is appointed a fiduciary by the VA, they are automatically labeled as mentally defective and added to the FBI's background check system which prohibits them from purchasing a firearm. This rule fails to identify which beneficiaries have a mental illness that make them a danger, instead instituting a blanket ban on anyone who needs help managing their benefits, and it discourages veterans who need help from seeking help.  The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act will prohibit the VA from considering a beneficiary just because they are assisted by a fiduciary as mentally defective without due process. Just because you have trouble managing your finances doesn't mean you are dangerously mentally ill. This discourages veterans who may need help from seeking help.  We owe it to our veterans and to all Americans to protect the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and ensure that they are not taken away without due process.

14738,topic-id,14115,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to present H.1301, the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2017.  In total, this bill provides $577.9 billion in funding for the Department of Defense: $516.1 billion in discretionary funding and $61.8 billion in overseas contingency operations and global war on terrorism funding.  When combined with the funding provided in the continuing resolution supplemental enacted in December, total defense funding for fiscal year 2017 equals $584 billion, consistent with the top line provided in the National Defense Authorization Act, and $10.9 billion more than fiscal year 2016 levels.  Mr.Speaker, strengthening our national security and rebuilding our military starts today, with this agreement,[[Page H1640]]the first step after years of cutbacks. Our Armed Forces and intelligence community are currently operating under a continuing resolution, which denies them stability and predictability, both of which they have not had for many years.  H.1301 provides that stability, removing defense funding from under continuing resolution autopilot, preventing further damage to our national defense and providing additional support for our men and women in uniform and their families.  Our troops serve with honor in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, South Korea, Japan, across the Baltics, the Sinai, and Africa on the ground, in the air, and aboard ships across the globe doing the work of freedom.  Mr.Speaker, this agreement rejects the troop reductions proposed by the previous administration, providing for increased end-strength levels authorized by the NDAA: 1.3 million Active Duty troops and 813,000 National Guard and Reserve troops, all of whom work as one team.  Our bill also fully funds the authorized 2.1 percent pay raise and provides increased funding for Defense Health Programs to ensure full care for all of our warfighters, their families, and military retirees.  This agreement also ensures that our Armed Forces have the training and equipment they need to conduct successful missions. Funding is increased for key readiness programs that prepare and train our troops and that modernize essential military installations. It reverses the previous administration's cuts to procurement, providing for additional production of state-of-the-art aircraft and ships.  In addition, we enhance cyber and ISR programs, or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance programs, capabilities our combatant commanders badly need.  This reflects congressional priorities. We took into account the views of each and every Member who worked with us throughout the process. This is a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that deserves the support of the  I thank Chairwoman Kay Granger for her efforts in bringing this bill to the floor today and for taking over the leadership of the Defense Subcommittee in  I also thank the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr.Visclosky, for his contributions to this bill and the earlier bill. He has been an excellent partner throughout this process, and I am grateful for our continued strong working relationship.  In addition, I commend Nita Lowey, the ranking member of the full committee, for her partnership and commitment to completing all of our appropriations work.  Lastly, I thank the staff of the subcommittee that is behind me, both minority and majority, as well as our personal offices and the full Appropriations Committee for their tireless work putting this bill together.  In particular, I would like to acknowledge Will Smith and David Pomerantz, the outgoing staff directors for the Appropriations Committee, both majority and minority, in this remarkable committee. Both have made immeasurable contributions to the Appropriations Committee in this institution, and we are indebted for their service. We thank both of them and wish them both the best.  Mr.Speaker, today our Nation faces a dangerous and unpredictable world. At the same time, our Armed Forces are struggling to have our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines fully trained and ready to meet every conceivable threat. That important work to address that critical situation starts with this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of the agreement, and I reserve the balance of my time. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY FRELINGHUYSEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE          HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS REGARDING H.1301       The following is an explanation of the effects of this Act,      which makes appropriations for the Department of Defense for      fiscal year 2017. Unless otherwise noted, references to the      House and Senate reports are to House Report 114-577 and      Senate Report 114-263, respectively. The language contained      in the House and Senate reports warrant full compliance and      carry the same weight as language included in this      explanatory statement unless specifically addressed to the      contrary in the bill or this explanatory statement. While      repeating some language from the House or Senate reports for      emphasis, this explanatory statement does not intend to      negate the language referred to above unless expressly      provided herein.              DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY       For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency      Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-177), as amended      by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control      Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-119), and by the      Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), the      terms ``program, project, and activity'' for appropriations      contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific      level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense      Appropriations Act, 2017, the related classified annexes and      explanatory statements, and the P-1 and R-1 budget      justification documents as subsequently modified by      congressional action.       The following exception to the above definition shall      apply: the military personnel and the operation and      maintenance accounts, for which the term ``program, project,      and activity'' is defined as the appropriations accounts      contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations       At the time the President submits the budget request for      fiscal year 2018, the Secretary of Defense is directed to      transmit to the congressional defense committees budget      justification documents to be known as the ``M-1'' and the      ``O-1'' which shall identify, at the budget activity,      activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts      requested by the President to be appropriated to the      Department of Defense for military personnel and operation      and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget      request, for fiscal year 2018.                         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow      the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as      specified in the report accompanying the House version of the      Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year      2008 (House Report 110-279). For operation and maintenance      accounts, the Secretary of Defense shall continue to follow      the reprogramming guidelines specified in the conference      report accompanying H.3222, the Department of Defense      Appropriations Act, 2008. The dollar threshold for      reprogramming funds shall remain at $10,000,000 for military      personnel; $15,000,000 for operation and maintenance;      $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research,      development, test and evaluation.       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is      directed to continue to provide the congressional defense      committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II      and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for      Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of      this Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with      guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying      the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The      Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior      approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified      dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or      research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is      less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for      reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.      Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of      a military personnel (M-1), an operation and maintenance (O-     1), a procurement (P-1), or a research, development, test and      evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the      Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval      reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In      addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval      reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest      items are established elsewhere in this statement.                           FUNDING INCREASES       The funding increases outlined in the tables for each      appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific      purposes indicated in the tables.                  CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS       Items for which additional funds have been provided or      items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in      the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase      ``only for'' or ``only to'' are congressional special      interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming      (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD      Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in      the explanatory statement.                            CLASSIFIED ANNEX       Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the      accompanying classified annex.                  BUDGET LIAISON SUPPORT TO THE HOUSE                    AND SENATE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS                              SUBCOMMITTEES       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees      rely heavily on offices within the Comptroller organizations      of the military departments and the Office of the Secretary      of Defense to conduct their oversight responsibilities and      make funding recommendations for the Department of      Established in the 1970s in accordance with a recommendation      of the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, these offices facilitate      the appropriate flow of information between the House and      Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees and the      Comptroller of the respective department or agency. In the      early 1990s, the House and Senate Defense Appropriations      Subcommittees restated the[[Page H1641]]     support these organizations provide to the Committees and      noted that ``while the various offices of legislative affairs      offer great assistance to DoD and the Congress, they do not      provide the expertise and the direct relationship to the      Comptroller organizations which are essential to the      effective communication between DoD and the Committees on      Appropriations.''       Further, the explanatory statement accompanying the      Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 echoed the      imperative to maintain the existing liaison structure to      achieve the highest level of communication and trust between      the Department of Defense and the House and Senate Defense      Appropriations       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees      repeat this support for the budget liaison organizations and      reiterate previously stated concerns that efforts to      incorporate these organizations into the military and Office      of the Secretary of Defense legislative affairs offices would      be deleterious to the appropriations process and to the      utility of the budget liaison operation. Therefore, the      agreement retains a provision in title II of this Act from      previous years that prohibits the use of funds in this Act to      plan or implement the consolidation of a budget or      appropriations liaison office of the Office of the Secretary      of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military      department, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed      Forces into a legislative affairs or legislative liaison      office.                         CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES       The agreement fully funds the fiscal year 2017 base budget      requirement of $6,734,000,000 for the Army, Navy, Marine      Corps, Air Force, and the defense agencies cyberspace      activities, an increase of $992,000,000 over the fiscal year      2016 enacted level.       While the Service and defense-wide budget justification      material, as well as the Department of Defense classified      cyberspace activities information technology investments      budget justification materials, provide some level of detail,      much of the funding is encompassed within larger programs and      funding lines, which limits visibility and congressional      oversight of requested funding for cyberspace activities      specifically.       Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Department of Defense      Chief Information Officer is directed to modify the      cyberspace activities exhibit in order to provide increased      visibility and clarity into the cyberspace activities funding      requirements and changes to funding requirements from the      previous fiscal year enacted levels, to segregate civilian      and military pay, and to provide a crosswalk between the      cyberspace activities justification books and the Services      and defense-wide budget justification material.       Further, in order to provide additional clarity and to      enhance oversight, the Department of Defense Chief      Information Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary      of Defense (Comptroller) and the Service Secretaries, is      directed to conduct a review of the budget justification      material and provide a proposal to the House and Senate      Appropriations Committees not later than September 1, 2017,      for how to clearly delineate the Department of Defense cyber      investment activities requested in the operation and      maintenance, procurement, and research, development, test and      evaluation accounts as part of the budget justification      material beginning with the fiscal year 2019 budget      submission. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and      the Chief Information Officer are encouraged to consider      establishing a unique cyber sub-activity group for operation      and maintenance accounts and individual cost codes, projects,      or program elements for procurement and research,      development, test and evaluation accounts as part of this      review.       The Department of Defense cyberspace activities table      provided shows the amount of funding provided to each Service      and defense-wide account in fiscal years 2016 and 2017.      Funding appropriated therein may be used only for cyberspace      activities as defined by the classified cyberspace activities      information technology investment budget request for fiscal      year 2017. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use normal      prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funding      out of any operation and maintenance, procurement, or      research, development, test and evaluation accounts as      identified in the table titled ``Department of Defense      Cyberspace Activities'' for any purpose other than cyberspace      activities. The Department of Defense Chief Information      Officer shall submit to the House and Senate Appropriations      Committees two reports not later than May 30, 2017, and      November 30, 2017, which provide the mid-year and end of      fiscal year financial obligation and execution data for      cyberspace activities of each year.       This language replaces the language included under the      heading ``Cyberspace Operations'' in House Report 114-577.[[Page H1642]]     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH08MR17.001     [[Page H1643]]                    QUARTERLY CYBER OPERATIONS BRIEFING       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide quarterly      briefings to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees      on all offensive and significant defensive military      operations in cyberspace carried out by the Department of      Defense not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal      quarter.

The agreement also provides the funding      necessary to support a 2.1 percent pay raise for all military      personnel, as authorized, effective January 1, 2017.         reprogramming guidance for military personnel accounts       The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for      Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017      appropriations accounts not later than 60 days after the      enactment of this The Secretary of Defense is prohibited      from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any      purpose other than originally appropriated until the      aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate      Appropriations       The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal      prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in      the Services' military personnel accounts between budget      activities in excess of $10,000,000.               military personnel special interest items       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have      been specifically reduced as shown in the project level      tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or      ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional      special interest items for the purpose of the Base for      Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be      carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as      specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below      Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or      reduce funding from congressional special interest items as      identified on the DD Form 1414.                             military bands       Military bands honor and celebrate warfighters, promote      patriotism during community events, inspire servicemembers,      and enhance efforts to recruit and retain troops. Band      engagements play an important support role for national      security and joint operations, opening diplomatic doors for      political and military discussions while building trust and      confidence with foreign military and civilian authorities.      However, the activities of military bands must not detract      from the core competencies of the military. The Secretary of      Defense should review opportunities to ensure that only the      critical functions of military bands are supported while      minimizing impacts on funding for essential readiness,      military personnel, modernization, and research and      development activities.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have      been specifically reduced as shown in the project level      tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or      ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional      special interest items for the purpose of the Base for      Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be      carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as      specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below      Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or      reduce funding from congressional special interest items as      identified on the DD Form 1414.                               READINESS       The agreement provides additional readiness funds for the      Services within the operation and maintenance accounts. This      funding shall be used only to improve military readiness,      including increased training, depot maintenance, and base      operations support. None of the funding provided may be used      for recruiting, marketing, or advertising programs. The      funding provided is a congressional special interest item.      The Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries are      directed to submit a detailed spending plan by sub-activity      group to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not      less than 30 days prior to the obligation of these funds.      These transfers may be implemented 30 days after      congressional notification unless an objection is received      from either the House or Senate Appropriations                  ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT       The agreement does not include a provision included in the      House-passed version of H.5293 that referenced the Energy      Independence and Security Act of 2007. It is noted that the      enforcement of section 526 of the Energy Independence and      Security Act of 2007 may lead to higher fuel costs for      federal fleets in the absence of competitively priced new      generation fuels that emit fewer emissions. In carrying out      this statute, the Secretary of Defense and the Service      Secretaries should work to ensure that costs associated with      fuel purchases necessary to carry out their respective      missions should be minimized to the greatest extent possible.                           CIVILIAN PAY RAISE       Although the agreement does not include additional funds      specifically for the civilian pay increase from 1.6 percent      to 2.1 percent, sufficient funding is available within the      appropriations accounts to fully fund the increase due to      assets created by the civilian hiring freeze and the extended      length of H.2028, theFurther Continuing and Security      Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017.                       AQUEOUS FILM FORMING FOAM       The use of the fire-extinguishing agent Aqueous Film      Forming Foam (AFFF) by the Department of Defense has been      linked to elevated levels of perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs)      on military bases and in neighboring communities. According      to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the      National Institutes of Health, PFCs have adverse impacts on      human health. The Navy and Air Force have begun remediation      of PFC contamination. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged      to require all Services to establish procedures for prompt      and cost-effective remediation. In addition, the Secretary of      Defense is directed to submit a report to the congressional      defense committees not later than 120 days after the      enactment of this Act that assesses the number of formerly      used and current military installations where AFFF was or is      currently used and the impact of PFC contaminated drinking      water on surrounding communities. The report should also      include plans for prompt community notification of such      contamination, when the contamination was detected, and the      procedures for timely remediation.

Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming      funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and      $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is      directed to continue to provide the congressional defense      committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports      for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of      this Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the      guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying      the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The      Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior      approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified      dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or      research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is      less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for      reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.      Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of      a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and      evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the      Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval      reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In      addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval      reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest      items are established elsewhere in this statement.                           FUNDING INCREASES       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be      provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the      tables.                   PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS       Items for which additional funds have been provided as      shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the      phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory      statement are congressional special interest items for the      purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of      these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated      amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory      statement.       JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS AND CONTRACTING       Throughout the fiscal year 2017 budget review process, the      Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Joint Program Office provided      insufficient justification and incomplete information in an      untimely manner. It is imperative that requested information      is received promptly for proper congressional oversight of      this major defense acquisition program.       It is understood that the Secretary of Defense is reviewing      potential alternative management structures for the JSF      program as directed by the National Defense Authorization Act      for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328). This review will      provide an opportunity to improve communication between the      JSF Program Executive Officer (PEO), the Services, and the      congressional defense committees to ensure the program's      funding requirements are fully understood, communicated, and      justified.       Additionally, there is concern that the number of F-35s      enacted in annual Department of Defense Appropriations Acts      are not being placed on contract by the JSF PEO in a timely      manner. Four F-35s included in the Department of Defense      Appropriations Act, 2015 and 13 F-35s included in the      Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 were not part      of their respective low rate initial production (LRIP)      contracts due to the PEO's contracting strategy.      Specifically, only four F-35Cs were included on LRIPs 9 and      10, rather than the ten F-35Cs enacted in the Department of      Defense Appropriations Acts, 2015 and 2016, impeding      production efficiencies. The agreement directs the JSF PEO to      use a contracting approach that would award all aircraft      included in each Department of Defense Appropriations Act on      the respective production contract for that fiscal year. The      agreement includes funding for 74 F-35 aircraft. The JSF PEO      is directed to brief the congressional defense committees not      later than 45 days after the enactment of this Act on the      contracting strategy for these aircraft.

Additionally, the Navy is addressing increasing ballistic and      cruise missile threats through the development and      acquisition of an Air and Missile Defense Radar, which is      planned for integration on the DDG-51 class of ships through      an engineering change proposal, resulting in a new Flight III      configuration. However, a recent Government Accountability      Office report (GAO 16-613) details concerns regarding a lack      of sufficient acquisition and limited detail design knowledge      to support the Navy's current Flight III procurement      strategy. Further concerns remain regarding the full costs of      DDG-51 Flight III destroyers. Therefore, the Secretary of the      Navy should award and complete the additional DDG-51 ship,      fully funded in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, as an additional      DDG-51 Flight IIA ship. The Secretary of the Navy is directed      to expeditiously award this ship construction contract.               polar icebreaker recapitalization project       The Navy and the Coast Guard are collaborating to refine      requirements and an acquisition strategy for procurement of      an affordable polar icebreaker. This collaboration continues      to refine program costs and requirements in an effort to      award a detailed design and construction contract for the      lead ship in fiscal year 2019. The agreement supports this      effort and provides $150,000,000 in advance procurement      funding to buy long-lead time material for the program's      initial ship. The Coast Guard is encouraged to budget for      follow-on efforts.

TH08MR17.137     [[Page H1821]]              REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow      the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report      accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense      Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming      funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and      $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is      directed to continue to provide the congressional defense      committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports      for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of      this Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the      guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying      the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The      Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior      approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified      dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or      research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is      less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for      reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.      Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of      a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and      evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the      Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval      reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In      addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval      reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest      items are established elsewhere in this statement.                           FUNDING INCREASES       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be      provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the      tables.   RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS       Items for which additional funds have been provided as      shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the      phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory      statement are congressional special interest items for the      purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of      these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated      amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory      statement.              JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER FOLLOW-ON MODERNIZATION       The Joint Strike Fighter Program Executive Officer is      directed to comply with the reporting requirement included      under the heading ``Joint Strike Fighter Follow-on      Modernization'' in Senate Report 114-263.

To limit such transfers and improve      oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and      maintenance account, the agreement includes a provision which      caps the funds available for Private Sector Care under the      TRICARE program subject to prior approval reprogramming      procedures. The provision and accompanying explanatory      statement language should not be interpreted as limiting the      amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-House Care      budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities within      the Defense Health In addition, funding for the In-     House Care budget sub-activity continues to be designated as      a congressional special interest item. Any transfer of funds      from the In-House Care budget sub-activity into the Private      Sector Care budget sub-activity or any other budget sub-     activity requires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior      approval reprogramming procedures for operation and      maintenance funds.       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide written      notification to the congressional defense committees of      cumulative transfers in excess of $10,000,000 out of the      Private Sector Care budget sub-activity not later than      fifteen days after such a transfer. Furthermore, the      Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the      congressional defense committees not later than 30 days after      the enactment of this Act that delineates transfers of funds      in excess of $10,000,000, and the dates any transfers      occurred, from the Private Sector Care budget sub-activity to      any other budget sub-activity groups for fiscal year 2016.       The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is      directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional      defense committees on budget execution data for all of the      Defense Health Program budget activities and to adequately      reflect changes to the budget activities requested by the      Services in future budget submissions.                 PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM       The agreement provides $60,000,000 for the peer-reviewed      cancer research program to research cancers not addressed in      the breast, prostate, ovarian, kidney, and lung cancer      research programs.       The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research      program are directed to be used to conduct research in the      following areas: bladder cancer, brain cancer, colorectal      cancer, immunotherapy, listeria-based regimens for cancer,      liver cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and other skin cancers,      mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pediatric      brain tumors, stomach cancer, and cancer in children,      adolescents, and young adults.       The reports directed under this heading in House Report      114-577 and Senate Report 114-263 are still required.                 PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM       The agreement provides $300,000,000 for a peer-reviewed      medical research program. The Secretary of Defense, in      conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, is directed to      select medical research projects of clear scientific merit      and direct relevance to military health. Research areas      considered under this funding are restricted to the following      areas: acute lung injury, antimicrobial resistance,      arthritis, burn pit exposure, chronic migraine and post-     traumatic headache, congenital heart disease, constrictive      bronchiolitis, diabetes, diarrheal diseases, dystonia, early      trauma thermal regulation, eating disorders, emerging      infectious diseases, epidermolysis bullosa, focal segmental      glomerulosclerosis, Fragile X, Guillain-Barre syndrome,      hepatitis B and C, hereditary angioedema, hydrocephalus,      immunomonitoring of intestinal transplants, inflammatory      bowel diseases, influenza, integrative medicine, interstitial      cystitis, malaria, metals toxicology, mitochondrial disease,      musculoskeletal disorders, nanomaterials for bone      regeneration, non-opioid pain management, pancreatitis,      pathogen-inactivated dried cryoprecipitate, polycystic kidney      disease, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, pulmonary fibrosis,      respiratory health, Rett syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis,      scleroderma, sleep disorders, spinal muscular atrophy,      sustained-release drug delivery, tinnitus, tuberculosis,      vaccine development for infectious disease, vascular      malformations, and women's heart disease. The additional      funding provided under the peer-reviewed medical research      program shall be devoted only to the purposes listed above.                    ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM       Concerns remain with the progress being made by the      Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to fully develop,      procure, and deploy an interoperable electronic health record      solution. The two systems must be completely and meaningfully      interoperable, and the Under Secretary of Defense      (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) is encouraged to      focus on the overall goal of seamless compatibility between      the two Departments' electronic health record systems.

These reports should also include any changes to the      deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full operating      capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full      operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the      program; an assurance that the acquisition strategy will      comply with the acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines,      and systems acquisition management practices of the federal      government; the status of the effort to achieve      interoperability between the electronic health record systems      of the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, including      the scope, cost, schedule, mapping to health data standards,      and performance benchmarks of the interoperable record; and      the progress toward developing, implementing, and fielding      the interoperable electronic health record throughout the two      Departments' medical facilities.

14583,topic-id,1596,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1181. As a combat veteran in the Iraq war, the issues we are debating this afternoon are deeply personal to me.  Veteran suicide has reached crisis levels in this country, and our failure to do more to help veterans in desperate need of mental health care is truly shameful. Unfortunately, Republicans have brought forward a bill today that will make this crisis even worse.[[Page H2108]]  Here is the plain truth. If we allow people with serious mental illnesses to purchase dangerous weapons, we are putting their lives and the lives of their loved ones at risk.  Mr.Speaker, at a time when more veterans are taking their own lives, we should be debating how to get them greater resources and support, not easier access to firearms. At least 10--10--esteemed military leaders, including David Petraeus, Michael Hayden, and Stanley McChrystal all agree. Here is what they wrote in a heartfelt letter to Congress:  ``Our Nation is facing a devastating epidemic of veteran suicide. The bill you are debating comes at a time when an average of 20 veterans commit suicide each day, two-thirds of whom do so by buying a firearm.  ``We know that nondeployed veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk of suicide compared to the American civilian population, and deployed veterans are at a 41 percent higher risk'' than the American civilian population.  ``When vulnerable veterans have access to firearms, they can do harm not only to themselves but also to their family members and loved ones. The impact of these tragedies is felt in communities across our  ``The VA has submitted over 174,000 names of servicemen and -women who require a fiduciary to manage their benefits and have been determined through clear and convincing evidence to meet the Federal standard for gun prohibition.  ``Of these 174,000, 19,000 are individuals that suffer from schizophrenia, and another 15,000 have severe  ``For these individuals, possession of a firearm could be fatal.''  They conclude by calling the bill before us today ``irresponsible, dangerous, and life threatening to those who need access to care, not weapons,'' and I couldn't agree more with that.  The question for my Republican friends is a simple one: Do you know more about what is best for our veterans than General Hayden? Do you have a better understanding of what would improve their welfare than General McChrystal? Do you appreciate their needs more acutely than General Petraeus? If the answer is no, then you should vote ``no'' on this bill later today.  Mr.Speaker, if this legislation is signed into law, more veterans will take their own lives. That is the tragic reality we face. Please side with General Petraeus and General Side with your conscience and your values. Side with our veterans. Please vote ``no.''  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence regarding a summary of the effect of H.1181.                                                     Law Center to                                         Prevent Gun Violence,                                                   March 10, 2017.                               Memorandum     To Interested     From Americans for Responsible     Re Effect of H.1181 (2017): Veterans 2nd Amendment          Protection                                Summary       H.1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, would      mandate that veterans determined to be mentally incompetent      or incapacitated by the Veterans Administration (VA) shall      not be considered to have been ``adjudicated as a mental      defective'' for the purposes of federal firearms law without      a finding by a judge or judicial authority that the veteran      is a danger to self or others.       The VA has reported records to the FBI's National Instant      Criminal Background Check System (NICS) regarding more than      170,000 beneficiaries who were adjudicated as mentally      incompetent under a very different standard. The vast      majority of those incompetency adjudications have been made      (1) without a finding of dangerousness and (2) without the      involvement of a judge or judicial officer.       In short, this bill would drastically change the standard      under which veteran beneficiaries may be considered      ``adjudicated'' for the purposes of federal firearms law, and      it provides no express time limitation to ensure that this      new standard would not be applied to VA adjudications that      occurred before enactment of this bill. As a result, there is      significant concern about how this legislation would affect      veterans who have previously been adjudicated as mentally      incompetent by the VA, and who are, as a result, currently      considered subject to federal law's firearm prohibition.       The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) states      that once a federal department or agency is aware that, when      the basis under which a record was made available to NICS      does not apply, or no longer applies, a federal agency must      ``update, correct, modify, or remove the record from any      database that the agency maintains and makes available to the      Attorney General, in accordance with the rules pertaining to      that database; and (ii) notify the Attorney General that such      basis no longer applies so that the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System is kept up to date.'' A strong      argument could be made that, if H.1181 were to become law,      most beneficiaries who have been found to be mentally      incompetent by the VA could no longer be considered subject      to federal law's firearm prohibition.                           Relevant Language       The relevant language of the bill states: ``Notwithstanding      any determination made by the Secretary under section 5501A      of this title, in any case arising out of the administration      by the Secretary of laws and benefits under this title, a      person who is mentally incapacitated, deemed mentally      incompetent, or experiencing an extended loss of      consciousness shall not be considered adjudicated as a mental      defective under subsection (d)(4) or (g)(4) of section 922 of      title 18 without the order or finding of a judge, magistrate,      or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction that      such person is a danger to himself or herself or others.''       The key phrase is ``in any case arising out of the      administration by the Secretary of laws and benefits under      this title.'' This phrase determines the scope of the      individuals that would be affected by this bill. It is not      limited to cases that the Secretary administers subsequent to      the enactment of the bill, but rather is unbounded in time.      This language could therefore be interpreted to apply to any      case arising out of the administration of these laws and      benefits by the Secretary, regardless of when the case      occurred. If the NICS Section of the FBI follows this      interpretation, it may remove records of these individuals      from       This would have far-reaching impact. Currently, few if any      mental incompetency determinations by the VA are made by a      judge, magistrate, or judicial authority. These      determinations are made my VA examiners who determine, in the      course of processing veterans' benefits claims, that as a      result of as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or      mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease, a      beneficiary ``lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage      his or her own affairs'' and requires a fiduciary to handle      the disbursement of benefits. Because these beneficiaries      require a fiduciary to handle disbursement of their payments      due to mental incompetence, they are considered to ``lack[]      the mental capacity to . . . manage [their] own affairs . . .      as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental      illness, incompetency, condition, or disease,'' and are      therefore prohibited from possessing a firearm under existing      federal law.       These incompetency determinations may be appealed to the      VA's administrative Board of Veterans Appeals, and then      eventually to federal court, but the federal judges reviewing      the case would be reviewing the VA's finding that the veteran      is mentally incompetent, and would have no basis for      determining whether or not the veteran was ``a danger to      himself or herself or others.'' Determining whether a person      is a danger to self or others is generally outside the      purview of the Veterans Benefits Administration or cases      arising out of the administration of laws regarding veterans'      claims for benefits.       If an incompetent beneficiary seeks relief specifically      from the NICS firearm prohibition, the VA must determine      whether the beneficiary has proven by clear and convincing      evidence that ``he or she is not likely to act in a manner      dangerous to self or others, and the granting of relief is      not contrary to public safety and/or the public interest.''      Essentially, the VA is tasked in these cases with assessing      whether the beneficiary met a substantial burden of proving      non-dangerousness. This does not involve a finding by a      judge, magistrate, or judicial authority. Though veterans may      then appeal an action by the VA denying NICS relief to a      federal district court judge, that judge would be tasked with      reviewing whether the evidence reasonably justified the VA's      determination that the veteran failed to provide clear and      convincing evidence that he or she was not dangerous. It is      not clear even in these rare cases that a judge upholding the      VA's determination would have occasion to make an affirmative      finding that the person was a danger to self or others.       In short, this bill would drastically change the standard      under which veteran beneficiaries may be considered      ``adjudicated'' for the purposes of federal firearms law, and      provides no express time limitation to ensure that this new      standard shall not be applied to previous adjudications by      the It could therefore threaten to implicitly require      that NICS lose nearly every prohibiting mental health record      it has ever received from the                           Limiting Amendment       In order to avoid the loss of these records in NICS, we      suggest amending the phrase ``in any case arising out of the      administration . . .'' to refer only to cases arising      subsequent to the enactment of this law.[[Page H2109]]    ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2102-2.txt,2226,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017",2017.0,16.0,January
14661,topic-id,953,"Mr.Speaker, I am a marine, just like James While I was a grunt and he was a general, we both fought inHe is a man of social integrity and patriotism.  War shows the character of military leaders. Marines who served under Mattis in Iraq speak in glowing terms about hisstrength, intelligence, and ability.  Mr.Speaker, it is with sadness that I rise this evening to oppose legislation that would allow General Mattis to serve asour 26th Secretary of This might seem contradictory. It might appear partisan or unpatriotic. In fact, the opposite istrue.  My position is entirely straightforward, Mr.When it comes to something as basic as civilian control of themilitary, I believe exceptions should be granted for extraordinary circumstances, not extraordinary people.  For more than half a century, recently retired military leaders have been barred from assuming the top post at the Pentagon.The Members of Congress who enshrined this prohibition in law had fresh memories of the Second World They are wary of adecorated general slipping off his uniform and immediately stepping into a civilian role. They were apprehensive aboutinstalling a Secretary of Defense who could be perceived as partial to one service over others. They are also worried aboutwhether the reputation of our military as a nonpartisan institution would suffer if its most respected leaders could transitiondirectly into political positions.  The last time a recently retired military man, the great George Marshall, was permitted to lead the Pentagon, America wasfacing the prospect of a humiliating defeat in the Korean war. Even then, congressional leaders specified that his waiver was aone-time exception to the rule.  While our country must confront an array of threats today, none of our national security challenges remotely compares to amassive ground war in the Far  Mr.Speaker, I understand that many of my colleagues are eager to grant this waiver because they greeted the announcement ofMattis' appointment with a sigh of relief, a sigh of relief because it meant Donald Trump had picked someone who is known to becompetent and patriotic, and someone who doesn't have a cozy relationship with the Russian  That is an understandable reaction, and we are all extremely confident that General Mattis will do a much better job thanGeneral Flynn or some of the other alternatives.  We shouldn't let Trump's bad behavior and poor judgment compel Congress to lower the bar. If anything, we should raise thebar for Trump, not make exceptions just because we are glad he didn't go with someone like  Mr.Speaker, a simple set of rules and norms form the fabric of American democracy. Since the founding of the Republic,leaders of every party and political persuasion have upheld this basic framework. For generations, American leaders have placedprinciple before party.  With remarkably few exceptions, Presidents from George Washington to Barack Obama have valued our institutions and ourdemocracy more than private gain or personal advancement. Now, Mr.Speaker, we have a President-elect who doesn't think therules should apply to him. We have a President-elect who is brazenly breaking norms left and right. We have a President-electwho promises to make America great again, but is dividing the country as never before.  Here in the United States, we believe every American is entitled to equal justice under the law. But Donald Trump believesthat a different set of rules should apply to him than apply to President Obama or President Bush or any of the other men whohave held our highest office.  Unlike his predecessors, Donald Trump has stubbornly refused to release his tax returns. Unlike his predecessors, DonaldTrump has irresponsibly meddled in our foreign relations throughout the transition. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has donenothing to diminish massive conflicts of interest stemming from his complex business dealings overseas.  Yet, instead of applying a check on this pattern of reckless behavior, House Republicans have rolled over time and timeagain.  Mr.Speaker, the Republicans won't stand up to a President entering office with just a 37 percent approval rating because itis precisely that 37 percent of the public that scares them. In fact, that 37 percent has terrified them for 8 long years. Itscared them into turning a blind eye to the racist birther conspiracy theories. It scared them into shutting down the That 37 percent even scared them into risking a debt limit default which would have immediately triggered anunprecedented economic meltdown.  Mr.Speaker, we need a President like Barack Obama who looks out for 100 percent of the American people. We need a Presidentlike Barack Obama who abides by 100 percent of the rules. We need a House majority that is willing to uphold its constitutionalobligations 100 percent of the time.  Moving forward in this Congress, the power to check Donald Trump is in Republican hands and depends on Republican votes, butthey have been too scared, too cowed, and too unwilling to do what these tough times demand.  If we, the Members of this great body, won't stand up for the norms that have sustained this Republic for 238 years, thenwho will?  General Mattis is a patriot, but now is the time for all of us in this Chamber to reiterate a basic truth in ademocracy--rules matter. They shouldn't be discarded at the first sign of difficulty. They shouldn't be undercut by waivers.Important precedents must be upheld in good times and bad.  This is America, Mr.Speaker, not some banana republic where the incoming strongman gets to rewrite the rule[[Page H468]]book. Ourprinciples are enduring. Our values are timeless. For more than two centuries, our commitment to the rule of law has beenunshakable. That is why we should reject this waiver. That is why we must hold Donald Trump to the same high standards as all ofthe 43 Presidents who came before him.

14683,topic-id,1194,"Mr.Speaker, I rise this evening to cover several very, very important points.  Tomorrow is International Women's Day, and I was going to talk about the role of women in our society, talk about my five daughters and what they have been doing in their life of service, and my wife, but events intervened. And yesterday, our good friends on the Republican side introduced a piece of legislation that will dramatically affect women, young and old; children. They introduced a repeal of the Affordable Care  We are still trying to figure out all of the details involved in it. It is going to be a little hard, since it was changed late in the night. But there are some things we do know. I would like to start off with what we do know about the Affordable Care Act so that when we come to debate on the floor in the days ahead the Republican repeal and replacement of the existing Affordable Care Act, we have a foundation.  If you will indulge me, I will try to lay out some facts, not alternative facts, but facts. For example, 20 million Americans have gained coverage as a result of the Affordable Care The percentage of uninsured in America is the lowest it has ever been. Mr.Speaker, 6.1 million young adults between the age of 19 and 25 have gained insurance coverage by being able to stay on their parents' insurance program--6.1 million. Of the Americans who have preexisting conditions, and that is 27 percent of us who have some sort of preexisting condition--heart issues, diabetes, broken legs, bad backs, whatever--27 percent of those Americans are guaranteed coverage even though they have a preexisting condition.  I was insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and I must tell you the battles--well, it would take several days to talk about the battles that I had with the insurance companies who were denying coverage because of preexisting conditions. No longer the case in The Affordable Care Act said no. And by the way, the lifetime limits, they are gone, also.  California, which I have had the pleasure of being a citizen of, 3.7 million Californians are now insured under the Medi-Cal program, and 1.4 million have gained coverage through the exchange, called Covered About 1.2 million of those have received subsidies, averaging over $300 a month. Over 5 million Californians will be directly affected by a direct repeal.  And in the expansion of Medicaid, or Medi-Cal as we call it in California, if that is eliminated, that is a $16 billion hit to the State of California, and, obviously, an enormous hit to those 3.7 million Californians who have been covered under the Medi-Cal expansion.  Secondary impacts: employment. Maybe 200,000 jobs would be lost in  Individual stories: boy, they abound. Just this evening, I got a call from my wife, and she said: You really ought to talk about that young family in Woodland, California, whose 2-year-old son was diagnosed with some sort of a medical illness. They were able to get coverage before that under the covered California program. They went back a year later, and the kid had a brain tumor.  Fortunately, it was resolved because they had insurance. They were able to get the early diagnosis. And under the current law, the Affordable Care Act, they will be able to keep their coverage, even though previous to the Affordable Care Act, this young child and, quite probably, the family would be uninsurable.  It is working. The Affordable Care Act is working. Are there ways to improve it? Undoubtably, there are, and we could sit down and talk about ways to improve it.  But yesterday, our Republican colleagues introduced legislation that is going to have a profound negative impact on men and women all across this We will spend time in the days ahead to talk about the details, but we do know that, in general terms, there will be less coverage at a higher cost for literally everybody, except for a few special folks. And I would like to just put up a chart about that. Let's start with this one.  You see, in the repeal bill that was introduced, there are very serious tax cuts. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts over the next 2 years. Well, we all want a tax cut. But under the repeal, there are some very special people who are going to get a really big tax cut. Take a look at this.  The top 20 percent of taxpayers will receive 74.2 percent of the multihundred-billion-dollar tax cut, which is estimated to be somewhere in the range of $700 billion to maybe as much as $1 trillion, depending upon the final calculations.  By the way, the Congressional Budget Office has not had time to score, that is to tell us what the cost, what the benefits are, of the Republican proposal. But we do know from earlier studies of this, 75 percent of the multihundred-billion-dollar tax cuts go to the wealthy. And where does the money come from? It comes from the poor, it comes from the working families, the men and women who are struggling here in Maybe they are making a good living--$50,000 to $60,000 a year. They are going to see their benefit package reduced.  One more way to look at this is the famous pie chart. So who gets the tax breaks? Not the top 20 percent. Let's just focus more clearly here on the top one-tenth of 1 percent. What do they get? They are not a percentage. This is not the top 1 percent. This is the top one-tenth of a percent. What do they get? Well, they get nearly $200,000 a year in tax reductions. That is not bad. So the top 1 percent gets 57 percent of that 6-, 7-, $800-billion tax cut, and everyone else will get 43 percent.  So what we have here is a massive shift of wealth from the working men and women of America, from American families, to the very top--you know, the 1 percenters. That is who is getting the benefit in this massive tax cut that has been proposed. I don't know if that is good policy. It is not in my district. I don't think it is good policy for  We spent a lot of this last year in the Presidential campaign talking about the shift of wealth to the superwealthy and away from the great majority of But, here we go. In the very first big legislation of this year, we see the Republicans in a massive effort to increase the wealth of the superwealthy at the expense of the rest of Americans.[[Page H1578]]  There are many, many more things to talk about here. But I want to just take a deep breath, which I need, because I guess I am getting rather excited about what is happening--or maybe angry is a better word--and turn to my colleague from the great State of Virginia to carry on while I take a deep breath and cool off a bit.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Scott).  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1577-2.txt,1973,VETERANS 2ND AMENDMENT PROTECTION ACT,2017.0,7.0,January
14684,topic-id,404,"Mr.Scott, thank you so very much. You bring to this discussion a very important perspective as the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce You have that perspective of understanding the effect of this legislation on the working men and women and families of the United  I was just looking at some of the early comments that have come out about the bill, which is less than--well, it is almost 24 hours old now. Families USA said: ``The GOP healthcare proposal would be laughable if its consequences weren't so devastating. This bill will strip coverage for millions of people and drive up consumer costs.''  The Catholic Health Association of the United States said: ``This proposal would also take many backward steps in the continual effort to improve our healthcare system. . . .''  It goes on and on, and as more and more people come to understand the issues that the gentleman was discussing, I think they are going to find that, no, we will take the Affordable Care Act as it presently exists, and we will make some modifications to it to improve it.  The gentleman raised a very interesting point. It reminds me of another conversation I had earlier this week with my wife. She had gone to her hairstylist, who is about 29 years old, has run her own business for the last 7, 8 years, and she told me wife: It can't be true. They can't do it, can they? They can't kill the Affordable Care Act, the ObamaCare?  She said: For the first time in my life, I was able to get insurance; and now that I have insurance, there is this maternity benefit that is in my package, and now my husband and I, we can afford to have a child.  It was directly to the point the gentleman was making. If there is an option here on maternity coverage or any coverage for women's health, then we are going to find a situation where people will pick and choose; they will wait to get their insurance, and then the insurance pool is left with very expensive cases and the cost is not spread out.  The gentleman may have some other examples that may have come along or some other comments that he would like to make. I would be delighted to have the gentleman share those on the floor, and I will yield to the gentleman.

14685,topic-id,373,"The gentleman is correct on that. I was just looking at some statistics here a moment ago about the shifting of cost.  Under the Affordable Care Act, there are many, many benefits for Leaving aside the Medicaid population for a moment, the Medicare population, available to every individual 65 and older, there have been significant improvements.  You mentioned the doughnut hole earlier, the drug benefit. If you run up heavy expenditures on your drugs, you would come to a point where you had to pay 100 percent. Medicare didn't cover it. Well, that doughnut hole is collapsing, and in another 2 years, the Medicare program will cover all of the drug costs without limitation.  Also, there is the free annual checkup that is available to everybody that is on The result of these kinds of things, where drugs are available, blood pressure drugs, diabetes and the like, has led to--together with the additional taxes that the superwealthy are paying--has increased the solvency of Medicare by 11 years.  Now, the fiddling that is going on with the proposal that our Republicans have put through, it is not clear exactly what the result would be; but we do know that one of the major tax cuts is the elimination of this Medicare tax that the superwealthy have been paying, and that is over--together with one other tax is almost $340 billion. So the support for Medicare and the solvency of Medicare becomes a question mark as a result of the proposals.  We don't have all of the answers to this, but we do know that a 60-year-old presently getting an insurance policy from the Affordable Care Act, from ObamaCare, and making somewhere around $40,000 a year--perhaps working at Walmart--they are going to see a 57 percent reduction in the tax credit that is currently available versus what the Republican bill has.  So a 60-year-old making $40,000 a year under the ACA, ObamaCare, will receive somewhere around a $9,000 tax credit to support the purchase of insurance. Under the Republican bill, they are looking at $4,000--not $9,000, but $4,000--so 57 percent reduction in the support that they receive, probably leading to them not being able to afford insurance and winding up in your emergency room example.

14687,topic-id,344,"The fundamental nature of insurance is you gather a large population of healthy, not-so-healthy, and perhaps some very sick people into a large population, and the cost is spread across the entire population.  What we may be ceding here in this particular proposal is the unravelling of that fundamental insurance concept with young people, healthy, not bothering to buy insurance, staying out of the market; and then, eventually, when they become ill, they will get back into the market, leaving everybody else to pay for it.  There is another piece of this shifting of cost that did occur prior to the Affordable Care Act--significantly reduced, as a result of it--and that is the uninsured still get sick.  The gentleman mentioned the emergency room a while ago, and for the most part, in America, a person can get to an emergency room with or without insurance; but if they don't have insurance, there is still a cost associated with the visit to the emergency room and any other thing they may need. They may need to have their leg repaired, a broken leg, or maybe they need an appendectomy or whatever. That is still a cost. The question is: Who picks up that cost? That is called uncompensated care, and it was a huge problem prior to the Affordable Care  I had hospitals throughout my district and throughout California coming to me and saying: We can't afford this because we are not able to cover that uncompensated care for people that didn't have insurance that showed up at the emergency room.  Now, we know that from the early analysis done of the proposed legislation by our Republican friends that the number of uninsured is likely to increase, perhaps as much as 11 million people--maybe more, maybe somewhat less. Those people will still get sick. They may have money of their own to cover their costs, but the chances are they don't. That uncompensated cost will then be borne by the people who do buy insurance. It is a cost shift to those who have insurance.  ",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1577-2.txt,1973,VETERANS 2ND AMENDMENT PROTECTION ACT,2017.0,7.0,January
14688,topic-id,373,"There are so many pieces to this healthcare system.  One thing that I want to put on the table here from my experience as insurance commissioner in California is that there are two fundamental parts[[Page H1580]]to the healthcare system in the United States, and really around the world. One of those two parts is how we collect the money and then pay for the services. We call that insurance. It is also Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' programs, and the like. These are the way in which we collect money and pay for the services.                              {time}  2015  The other part of the healthcare system is the delivery of services; these are the doctors, the clinics, the hospitals, and other providers, mental health providers, and the like. We often get confused by putting these two things together.  There has been a lot of talk about what we are doing with the Affordable Care It is essentially a mechanism to pay for services. It is an insurance mechanism. Using the private insurance system, these various exchanges are set up to pool the population of people who do not have insurance from their employer, the individual people, individual coverage. It pools them so that you have that large population so that the cost is spread out across that large pool and the insurance becomes affordable. That is an insurance mechanism. That is a pooling. It has nothing to do directly with the provision of medical services.  The medical services are then provided out of that pooling arrangement by the individual doctors, maybe clinics, maybe hospitals, maybe group practices. Some of that will be capitated pay, and others will be a fee-for-service.  We haven't changed directly the way in which services are provided, that is, the delivery of services. And this is found in hospitals. In the Affordable Care Act, there was a penalty for hospitals that had readmissions for infections. What we have seen, as a result of that provision dealing directly with the way in which services are delivered in hospitals, is a dramatic decline in readmissions for hospital-acquired infections. What that means is some 60,000 people are still alive today because they didn't get a hospital-acquired infection.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Scott).

14689,topic-id,505,"Mr.Speaker, that is exactly right, and I see that in my district. I have a large rural district in And, even today, there are areas where it is difficult to find a physician to get medical services.  This is one of the things, as you so correctly pointed out, the Affordable Care Act had a part of that. One of the titles dealt with the education of medical personnel. And so what we have seen, at least in California--and I suspect across America--with the Affordable Care Act in place, we are seeing that one of the fastest growing areas for new jobs is the healthcare sector because we are adding a lot of people--we need more--and then the educational programs that you talked about, which comes under the jurisdiction, I believe, of your committee. That is an important part.  One of the things that I hope the American public comes to understand is this is not just a sound bite that was used in a political campaign. We are going to repeal the ObamaCare and we are going to replace it is a nice sound bite. But we are talking about the lives of Americans, we are talking about their health, their ability to stay healthy, their ability to get medical services.  When you start tinkering with something that is so personal--that is what people say in my district: This is about my ability to stay healthy, my ability to get medical care. That is what I hear.  They are saying they are frightened. They are concerned that the legislation and all of the discussion in the political campaigns has been so heated that they are afraid they are going to lose what they presently have.  A quick look at what has been presented to Congress just in the last 24 hours indicates that a couple of facts are clear. First of all, there is an enormous tax break for the very, very wealthy, probably to the tune of 3- to $400 billion over 10 years. That is an incredible tax break for the superwealthy and for the health insurance industry. That, we are pretty sure, is in this legislation. We don't know the exact numbers; but we do know that early indications are that there is a shift, tax breaks for the wealthy, and cost increases for everybody else. That we know.  We also know that there are certain elements of support for individuals that will be removed. As we go about debating this and understanding the full import and get the Congressional Budget Office information, I think we are going to find that Americans are going to say: Well, wait. Wait, wait, wait. You are doing what to me? What are you doing to me? You are taking away my health insurance?  I suspect that will lead to a rebellion of some sort. Certainly it has agitated a lot of people in my communities about the justifiable fear of what may be coming to  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Scott).

14690,topic-id,316,"Mr.Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia is absolutely correct about that. Unfortunately, my understanding is that as early as tomorrow--that would be Wednesday--that the committees intend to mark up the legislation. Normally, that means the version of the legislation that will pass out of committee is completed. And, I suspect, usually it is associated with a vote that takes place in committee. We don't know for sure if it is tomorrow or the next day, but we do know that if it is this week, we will not have the Congressional Budget Office information.  The gentleman mentioned something that I probably should have jumped on immediately because of my rural district, and those are the clinics. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, there are now seven significant clinic organizations that provide services to about 23 specific sites around my district. They are providing, really for the first time in many of the communities that I represent, immediately available healthcare services to a variety of people, some of whom have had an employer-sponsored health plan and others of whom are on Medi-Cal in California.[[Page H1581]]  The apparent reduction in the Medicaid, Medi-Cal for California, support from the Federal Government that will occur over the next 2\1/2\ to 3 years will eliminate one of the principal ways in which those clinics have been able to continue to operate and, that is, the expansion of the Medicaid population in  It appears that the legislation that is proposed will shrink the Medicaid program across the Nation and severely curtail in California the support available for people who are currently on Medi-That will be devastating to these clinics in these rural areas.

14691,topic-id,283,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Scott) for joining us this evening. This is a fundamental part of American life, that is, our health care. It is about 18 percent of the total GDP, gross domestic product. It is extremely important in terms of the total well-being of our society and our economy.  Changes to the Affordable Care Act that are being proposed will have a dramatic effect. And what we do know about it is that there will be a massive shift of wealth from working men, women, and families to the superwealthy. We know that from the tax proposals that have been made in the analysis of the tax.  We also know that there is a very, very high probability that perhaps 11 million people will lose their insurance coverage, either in the private insurance market through the exchanges or through the Medicaid programs across the And the effect on the providers, the hospitals, the clinics will be profound.  So when we have something as important as this, it is just wrong. It is wrong for the majority in this House to put this legislation before the committees without a full hearing on what the effect will be. But it appears that tomorrow, Wednesday, we will have the first markup in this process.  What I want--and I think the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Scott) does, too--is for the American public to hear the debate, to understand the implications where we are today with the Affordable Care Act and what it has brought to us in terms of quality and accessibility to health care and what it would mean with the proposed changes.

14645,topic-id,2848,"Mr.Speaker, it is Thursday evening in the House of Representatives, and I continue to hear friends, fellowMembers of the House, and reporters in anguish over the issue of a potential wall between the United States and Mexico; so Ithought it was worth looking at some information about Mexico--our closest neighbor to the south. The data should be recent.  They have got nearly 120 million people in The gross domestic product is around 2.1 trillion in pesos. They have 2.1percent growth--terrible. It is about like the Obama economy. The average income is around $17,000 per capita. Inflation is 4.0percent.  Yet, you look at the economics of Mexico in the world, and you think, wow. You look at their resources--extraordinaryresources, just extraordinary resources. We know they have got hardworking people because we know, from the people of Mexico whohave come to the United States, that people constantly indicate, gee, they are the best workers we have, these hardworking folksfrom  So you have got hardworking people in the nation of Mexico, and you have got incredible natural resources that have neverbeen tapped--or not adequately tapped. We don't even know the full potential--oil, gas, copper. There are all of these differentminerals that Mexico is supposed to have. You look at what people have done over the thousands of years--I mean, advancedcivilizations. Why is Mexico not one of the top 10 or even top five economies in the world? It is listed 62nd in the world.  They have got plenty of land. I can personally testify that they have some of the most beautiful terrain in theworld--beautiful beaches, mountains, farming regions; just magnificent land, minerals, and hardworking people. Why is it 62nd inthe world as an economy? That is an interesting question.  It would seem to be because--from hearing people who have looked at Mexico and who have either tried to start a businessthere or who have looked at it to start a business there, to start manufacturing there--of course, there are many who have set upmanufacturing shops down there, but they are easily persuaded out of it if they can find a more suitable place. The reason it isoften easy to persuade people to set up shop somewhere else is because of the drug cartels, the corruption that the drug cartelsbring to  What is it the drug cartels are making billions of dollars off of that allow them to corrupt police departments? citygovernments? the Mexican border patrol? the Mexican military?  Obviously, the people in all of the Mexican Government are not corrupt. I have met too many who want desperately to make thenation of Mexico one of the greatest in the world, and it is possible that could happen but not so long as the drug cartels are,potentially, the most powerful entities in I mean, they are right next to the United They really should be oneof the top, at least 10--if not the top five or the top three or four--economies in the world, but they are nowhere close.  Drug cartels, we have found--and we know--make money, particularly off shipping illegal drugs into the United Theyhave made a fortune off of it. I have heard from friends of mine in Texas who are in the drug enforcement business, both Federaland When the U.Congress took action to make it more difficult to get SUDAFED, which is used in the cooking ofsubstances that are put together in order to create methamphetamine, that meth lab became much more rare, especially in eastTexas, where I live, where we have got lots of trees, woods--terrain where people can easily hide out, set up a lab, cook somemethamphetamine, especially as developed during my time on the felony bench, where people in Texas learned how to cookmethamphetamine, create methamphetamine with a cold cooking process that didn't subject them to quite the danger and didn'tcreate quite the nasty smell that often got meth labs reported to the authorities.                              {time}  1945  By drying up so many of the meth labs, we were told it is going to be a great day for We dry up the meth labs bymaking it tougher to get Sudafed because you have to ask, give your driver's license, and you are restricted to a very limitedamount of We were told that is going to dry up drugs. Methamphetamine is going to be a thing of the past. We will cutit to next to nothing.  Well, it is true. It is not as widespread as it used to be, but I am told that more pure drugs with much more devastatingresults and much more addictive are coming up from Mexico in greater numbers, greater quantities. It is even worse than it waswhen methamphetamine was being cooked because of the purity of the substances and the addictive nature. Also, as a result ofdrying up so much in the way of methamphetamine, we have much more of the heroin epidemic crossing  Additional drugs have come from Mexico across our porous border that seems to have grown during the Obama administrationdramatically. Why? Because our border has really not particularly been all that enforced.  It turns out that it is not just other drugs that are coming across our border. Since we have been able to eliminate so manymeth labs, especially in Texas, we see stories like this one from Bob Price, January 5, ``Feds Seize Nearly $7M in Meth At TexasBorder.'' That is a story about the seizure of methamphetamine at two international border bridges in south Texas in 1 week. TheCustoms and Border Protection, CBP, that was assigned to the World Trade Center International Bridge in Laredo, this articlereports how they had caught two drug traffickers with 200 pounds of crystal meth in one vehicle, and that was December 22, 2016.  We also know that the border security under this administration has become just almost nonexistent. We had an article fromJanuary 12, today, from McAllen, from Fox News, entitled, ``Cartels, Smugglers Exploit Border Wall Fears Ahead of TrumpPresidency.'' So apparently they are using this time before President Trump is sworn in next week to scare people into comingnow. Bring your drugs now. Come illegally now into the U.before Trump becomes President.[[Page H466]]  I guess it is a bit akin to After holding American hostages for over a year under Commander in Chief Jimmy Carter,became so scared of a tough, independent-minded Ronald Reagan coming into office, they let those hostages go on the very day hewas sworn in. So they didn't risk him taking military action against them.  This is another story from Jessica Vaughan, January 2017, that reports that ``ICE Deportations Hit 10-Year Low.'' This isJanuary 2017. DHS has hit a 10-year low in deportations.  We see stories about how border control is almost nonexistent on our southern border, stories that expectation of amnesty isattracting immigrants to our U.border.  Here is another story from January 10 by Brittany Hughes, ``Border Agents Catch Another Wave of Illegal Aliens From CubaAmid Escalating Spike.'' I have been told, when I am down there, they are seeing more and more Cubans coming across the Mexicanborder of all places.  So the insecurity--not mentally--of the United States, but the actual insecurity of the United States because of ourvulnerability to people that hate us and drug cartels that want to make billions of dollars by hooking people on drugs thatthey will deliver, has reached insane levels. That is probably part of the reason that Donald Trump was elected President by anavalanche in the electoral college.  If you look at the counties that voted for Hillary Clinton and you look at the counties that voted for Donald Trump, itbecomes very clear that the Democratic Party in the United States has basically become a fringe party. They won the fringes:West Coast, East Coast, part of Florida, part of the northeast, Chicago, Detroit, some of the northern cities, the southernvalley of I mean, it is a fringe party. There are a few exceptions inside the country, but basically the rock-solidinterior that the American people make up--in what some refer to as fly-over country in America--voted rather solidly for  Here are numbers from the CIA World Factbook on Mexico:  Crude oil exports, a 2015 estimate, had 1.199 million barrels per day. Country comparison to the world, 13.  Crude oil imports, 11,110 barrels a day. Crude oil, proved reserves, 9.7 billion barrels, and that is just proven reserves.  If you look at natural gas from a 2014 estimate, 44.37 billion cubic meters. That is supposed to be 19th in the world, butwhen you consider how productive they could become once they began fracking, using more advanced technology, then you find outthat, wow, this is a nation--the nation of Mexico--that really should be one of the top 10 economies in the world.  What is the excuse that it is not? It has hardworking people, natural resources that most of the world could only envy. Whyis it not one of the top 10? We keep coming back to the drug cartels and the corruption that they have brought to Mexico and thebillions of dollars that are generated by the drug cartels.  As we have talked about here in the House, the border patrolmen tell me--I have been there all night--there is not a singleinch of the U.S.-Mexico border that is not controlled by one of the drug cartels and that nobody should cross the border unlessthey have paid the drug cartels, have the drug cartels' permission.  I have seen firsthand how it works. They will send a group across the river with coyotes in rafts when they are down on theRio That keeps the Border Patrol busy. At another place, they send people with drugs.  I have been there and seen their lookouts, climbed up on perches where they can watch. When the Border Patrol goes by, theyknow they won't be back for a while, so they get surprised when I drive by in the middle of the night.  They are all over the place around our southern border. They are making billions of dollars. Whoever came up with thebusiness model for the drug cartels that you could make such massive amounts of money bringing drugs illegally into the UnitedStates, it was really a business genius. But it would take a business fool in the United States to allow the kind of model thatMexico has set up for its drug business to even get a foothold in the United  As I have mentioned, one of the Border Patrol told me that the drug cartels call the Department of Homeland Security theirlogistics. They bring their drug dealers. They bring their drug traffickers. They bring their prostitutes. Unfortunately, girlsare being forced, often, into drug trafficking or human trafficking, and they are going to be used as prostitutes to make moneyfor the drug cartels. They send them across.  As a border patrolman said, they send them across, and then DHS here in America becomes their logistics. We ship themwherever they want them to go in the United All they have to do oftentimes is just have--I have seen them--a Xerox copy ofthe address where they are supposed to go, and DHS puts them on the bus--sometimes flies them, but usually buses--and ships themoff to a city where the drug cartels want them to set up shop.  I have been there in the middle of the night when border patrolmen will ask how much they paid to be brought in illegally tothe U.Some of the Spanish speakers in our Border Patrol are really incredible as they drill down and get answers to theirquestions that are not always on the list that DHS tells them to get.  ``How much money did you pay?'' They would say, ``Well, you didn't have $6,000, $7,000, $8,000. Where did you get thatmoney?''  ``Well, I was able to get $1,000 from somebody in the U.S., $1,000 from somebody in Mexico or Guatemala.''  ``Well, what about the rest?''  ``They are going to let me pay that out after I am in the United States.''                              {time}  2000  It becomes clear very quickly that, once again, this business model that the drug cartels have includes getting people inrafts where the Rio Grande River requires a raft, or just getting them across in unguarded areas, or areas where we need a walland don't have one, getting them across, and then getting DHS to send them to the city where they want to set up shop as drugtraffickers, human traffickers.  What a business model. You get the Federal Government of the United States to help you set up your business machine, yourbusiness model in the United They are shipping your employees around the country to different cities. Yes, it isnormally under the guise of: I have a relative there, here is the relative's address. They are going to take care of me.  Perhaps you get delayed and have to wait for an immigration judge that was appointed by Eric Holder to give you a notice toappear for a hearing 4 years later, a year, 2 years later, and then you can go on to the city where the drug cartels want you tofinish paying off what you owe them for getting you into the United  So to have a business model that requires your workers to pay you is extraordinary, but that is what drug cartels are ableto do when you have a willing Obama administration here in the United States that will help you set up your drug cartelmechanism here in the United That is what has been going on.  In the meantime, back in Mexico, you generate so much money by having your workers pay you to work for you, and gettingbillions of dollars from the drugs that are sent into the United States, hooking people here in America, making them reliant onand addicted to drugs that destroy their lives. So basically the drug cartels get a two-for. They destroy the humaninfrastructure of the United States with poison that some would say, well, that is another name for illegal drugs. And then, inthe meantime, you have got all of that money coming to you, and you use that money to buy off police. Thank God there are somestand-up police in Mexico that can't be bought. But if they go too strongly head to head with the drug cartels--we have seen thepictures--they can end up with their head on a pike as a message. We have had chiefs of police that were killed when they refusedto kowtow to the drug cartels, and so the message becomes pretty clear.  It seems to me that the biggest reason that Mexico--with extraordinary people and extraordinary natural resources, abeautiful, fantastic country, a location that is just incredibly advantageous because they have got shipping that can go out onthe West Coast like we do to the Pacific, shipping on[[Page H467]]the East Coast into the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, ready accessto North American markets, ready access to South American market, what an opportunistic location for Yet, they struggleso far behind most nations, or so many nations in the world. Dozens and dozens, 60 or so, are before them because drug cartelshave such a powerful part in Mexico itself.  So there are many Americans, especially friends of mine across the aisle here, who think it is an absolute outrage to talkabout building a wall between the United States and There are some Mexican officials that think it is an outrage to talkabout building a wall between the United States and  Now, some of those Mexican officials think it is an outrage because they haven't thought through the magnificence that mayarise in Mexico once we have secured the border between Mexico and the United States and we can slow the drug trafficking to atrickle. So the drug cartels will not be looking at billions of U.dollars; they will be looking at thousands; and if they areextremely powerful, maybe millions. But if we get that down to thousands, then the Mexican people will be able to have controlwithout corruption, without massive pockets of corruption, without a drug cartel that can buy soldiers, buy police, buy chiefsof police, and buy mayors. Again, thank God it is only a small part of Mexico, but it keeps Mexico suppressed from the greateconomic power that it could be. And the potential is all there.  You build a wall, then you shut down the drug cartels. And when they only have thousands of dollars to bribe police insteadof millions or billions of dollars, then law and order will prevail and the drug cartels will not, and we will have the mostextraordinary neighbor to our south all because we followed the example in Mending Wall, and we had a wall between us that wekept up, we took care of, we shut down, helped Mexico shut down the drug cartels by being a good neighbor, enforcing the border,and the standard of living in Mexico spirals upwards through the sky. The power Mexico would have as a nation in anyinternational organization will be extraordinary, and the United States will reach an unparalleled relationship as a neighbor.That is worth building a wall for.

14796,topic-id,3733,"Mr.Speaker, it is an honor to be here tonight at the beginning of this new year. It has been great being in east Texas this weekend, last weekend, hearing all of the hope that has arisen as we have entered this new year, 2017. I think it is going to be a good year.  I am told that just on the basis of a new President coming in who is promising to throttle back, remove so much of the heavy, iron boot off of the throat of the economy that firms are starting to hire again. Businesses are making plans to expand and grow. And then we are seeing reports of plants that are deciding to stay in the United States instead of going elsewhere. There is a lot of optimism out there.  There are young people that are asking what was it like back when you came out of college and had multiple job opportunities for most of the people coming out of college instead of opportunities to live with your parents or your grandparents or a parent or the other parent. They actually had multiple job opportunities, and that optimism has arisen.  As we entered this year, also, it is very sad to see a form of racism and negativity that arises. I have said before publicly, and I think it is still true, we need go back no further than the confirmation hearing for Clarence Thomas to the Supreme But the more you look, the more you find that the most persecuted person to be in America these days is a conservative African If you are Black and you are conservative, you can expect[[Page H228]]slings and arrows and hate from all over the country--vicious, mean.  And it was yet another slap, as if the high-tech lynching of the Senate confirmation hearing, as grossly unfair as it was, that woman that withheld any complaints whatsoever, followed a man from job to job, never raised a complaint until he gets ready to be confirmed to the United States Supreme Court, raised allegations that can't possibly be denied or supplemented, verified--not effectively.                              {time}  2030  You raise them 20-plus years. That is why we have laws on the books to protect from allegations too many years after the fact. We have statutes of limitations.  If you sit on something and don't tell people for years and years, and then all of a sudden, for political reasons, you raise up allegations against someone who is basically defenseless--the thing is Clarence Thomas was not defenseless. There were like 15 people, 15 women, who came forward and said: Look, I was there around Anita Hill when these things were going on. Those things never happened. Clarence Thomas is a brilliant, fine man, over and over.  Does any of that come up when HBO talks about him? Of course not because they were out to slander him, libel him, make him appear to be some crazy guy.  The guy is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Some say: well, yeah, of course the only way he got into Harvard--which, at the time, was too conservative, he thought, for him, law school after Holy Cross, and then it was too conservative, and he ends up applying to Yale and going there, one he didn't think quite as conservative.  But he began to notice, as he points out in his book, that the liberals would talk to him about sports and oppression of Black people in America, and that is all they wanted to talk about. But he began to notice that two or three other conservatives, the few that there were in Yale at the time, Yale Law School, basically would talk to him about anything, and I have had a conversation, in prior years, with him about that at  But it is interesting. You know, the liberals say: oh, yeah, we are the ones that care. Now you are only here because we pushed for affirmative action. You couldn't possibly be smart enough to be in a place where I am, the liberals think. So yeah, it is because of us liberals you are here.  No, the guy is brilliant; he deserved to be there on his own merit, on his own intellect. He deserves to be a member of the United States Supreme He deserves the acclaim that he has never properly gotten. But people who have clerked at that Court know the integrity, the intellect, the consistency of Clarence  He was maligned. They thought, basically, it was an effort to ``Bork,'' as it has come to become, or become a verb, what was done to Justice Bork, accuse him of outrageous offenses, derail his confirmation, so that this conservative, principled, qualified individual doesn't make it to the Supreme  Well, the effort worked on assassinating so grossly unfairly the character of Justice Bork, but it didn't work on Clarence Thomas because he is a man of steadfast faith, integrity, and not just the brilliant intellect.  And it is really heartbreaking. I mean, I thought--even though I didn't support President Obama because I didn't want him taking us down a socialist road, a socialist health care road. He talked about these things. The videos were out there. He wanted to get us to where the government controlled health care, single-payer, in other words, socialized medicine, where the government gets to decide whether you get health care or whether it is any good or not and, of course, it ends up not being, most of the time, once the government has total unfettered control.  I didn't want to go those places he wanted to go, but, I think the good thing is, it shows that America is above racism, and this is a man who can bind up this Nation as never before.  And yet, he has spent right at 8 years now creating more division in this country than we have had since the sixties. And who was stirring it up back then? Well, he was in the middle of groups that were stirring it up back then, protege of Bill First fundraiser he had in the home of someone who felt like it was a good idea to kill police, at least try to.  I hear constant allegations that are so unfair. Those who know Jeff Sessions make some very fair observations. I noted the great fairness of someone with whom I disagree often, but Senator Susan  This article from CNN Politics says: `` . . . a moderate Republican elected to the Senate the same year as Sessions in 1996, admits that she and Sessions `don't agree on a host of issues,' but she was happy to accept his''--Jeff Sessions--``request to introduce him at his confirmation hearing alongside senior Alabama Richard Shelby.''  `` `He's a decent, honorable, patriotic individual,' Collins said in an interview in her Senate office. `I felt bad he was not getting a fair shake from those who were denigrating him.' ''  ``The Maine lawmaker''--Susan Collins--``is referring to allegations of racial insensitivity--the same Democrats used to block Sessions from moving through committee thirty years ago.''  ``Collins explained that she is basing her endorsement of Sessions' character on her own experience working with him over the past 20 years.''  Well, isn't that a good thing, Mr.Speaker? You have a Senator that says: You know what? I'm not going to listen to the slings and arrows. I'm going to go based on the evidence that I have seen, heard, and known for myself.  You can denigrate someone all you want, but we are going based on what is real, what is factual; and God bless her for doing so.  ``I don't know what happened more than 30 years ago, when Jeff was nominated to be a district court judge, and his nomination failed,' she said. `But I do know the Jeff Sessions that I have worked with in the past 20 years. And he is a good person, and I believe that he will perform very well as attorney general.''  ``Another Republican colleague who went out of his way to get to know Sessions is Tim Scott, the only African-American GOP In December, Scott invited Sessions to visit his home state of South Carolina, where the two lawmakers met with criminal justice professionals in Charleston.''  And, you know, I have such great regard for my colleagues across the aisle, but I am heartbroken that 30 years after the denial of Jeff Sessions a judicial bench, when the Jeff Sessions that I have come to know in the 12 years I have been in Congress--I have come to know him, I feel like, pretty well. He is a good, decent, fair man. He tries to follow the teachings of Jesus He tries to treat people fairly and equally.  I saw this quote from assistant--he was Assistant District Attorney Thomas Harrison, who had started in helping prosecute regarding the lynching of a 19-year-old--just horrific--19-year-old African American, Michael Donald in And the Assistant District Attorney Harrison, at the time, who prosecuted the case in State Court, he was quoted as saying: ``Sessions asked what we needed''--because Sessions was U.Attorney, what they needed, in other words, to go after the culprits that would do such a horrendous criminal act. And he says: `` . . . I said, in order to get a capital murder conviction, we need these things, and he''--talking about Jeff Sessions--``said that in that regard whatever the federal agents did or the FBI did he would make those things available. He did in fact do that.''  I don't know, that is the kind of Jeff Sessions I have gotten to know over the years, and it is a little heartbreaking to hear allegations about a guy. I really like him.  And then to hear allegations that I have heard made about me in a grossly unfair manner. And I can't explain all of the allegations about--that are so grossly unfair about Jeff But I can address some of the things that have been alleged to make him unfit to be Attorney General that I know are ridiculous.  One of the points that was made was regarding his concern or opposition to the new Voting Rights Act extension, I guess that is what they were talking about, and I know a great deal about that. That comes through the Judiciary Committee, and I know my friend,[[Page H229]]fellow Republican, Jim Sensenbrenner, had reached an agreement with Democrat John Conyers and others, and they weren't letting amendments get through.  I was trying to make the point clear, if you want to save the Voting Rights Act, you can't keep punishing a State because they did something wrong 50 years ago. That is not constitutional. And if you insist on continuing to put these punitive positions in the Voting Rights Act that will continue to punish southern States that have recorded these days, and it was pretty well true across the South, they had less racial disparity than places in the North, in Wisconsin, in Massachusetts, in  Yet, people from these other States, because they made a majority, said: we don't care that they are--there is less racial disparateness in those southern states. There was harm 50 years ago, and there was, and it needed to be cleaned up. It desperately needed to be cleaned up, and we needed a Voting Rights Act in order to help cure the evils.  But what was pushed through in a voting rights extension, with my opposition--and I don't know what Jeff's arguments were, but I know how wrong it was. And I came down here, and my friend--and I mean that--my friend, John Conyers, was sitting right there, and it was toward the end of the year. And I said: Look, I have talked to liberal law deans from different parts of the country, New York, California, Texas; and when we discuss what you have put in the Voting Rights Act, you are still treating States punitively that are now doing better than California, New York, Massachusetts, at least some districts in those Wisconsin had a district with a huge problem.  You can't do that. It is going to be ruled unconstitutional. And I still cannot support it, but why don't we do a joint amendment and fix this?  And my friend, John Conyers, he is a very honorable man, and he said: Let me talk to some of our folks. And when I talked to him before the end of the year, he said: We think it is okay, and the people I talked to think it is okay. We don't need to amend it. We are going to leave it just like it is.  Well, it is wrong. Whether it is in a Voting Rights Act, whether it is in a criminal bill, a civil bill, if you are punishing people for the sins of their grandfathers or fathers, it is wrong. It is un-And I don't know if Jeff Sessions has called something like that un-American, but I will.  When you try to punish an individual for something their father or grandfather did, that is un-That is wrong.  And lo and behold, the liberal law professors and deans that I have talked to across the country, before I begged--well, I begged Jim He was sitting at the back right back there.                              {time}  2045  He said: Nope, we are not touching that bill.  They were happy to let it go to the Supreme Court one day just the way it was. Just as I explained to John Conyers right here, just as I explained to Jim Sensenbrenner right back there, this should be struck down if the U.Supreme Court is going to be fair and partial and follow the  You can't keep punishing people for something their fathers or grandfathers did when they are doing better than people in your own State and you vote to punish them. Why? Because you can. Their fathers or grandfathers committed a wrong many years ago. A grievous wrong it was, and it needed correction. There are some places where it still does, but you don't keep punishing people 50 years after they bring up their problem.  So I hear people say Jeff Sessions is not fit because he opposed the Voting Rights I tried to clean it up. It had an un-American provision in there.  I just can't believe anybody on either side of the aisle would continue to support the idea that we should punish children or grandchildren for something their father or grandfather did many years ago. This child has become an adult and they have made sure there is fairness abounding. Well, there is always going to be injustice.  One of the great problems in this Justice Department is that it was always quick to take up for someone who had been shot by policemen--before they knew any of the facts--and demonize the local police. Sometimes--in rare cases, but every now and then--they did deserve demonizing. But the Department of Justice should not demonize them before we find out the facts.  In most of those cases, when we find out the facts, whether it is Baltimore or other places, most of the time people or even a professor of some kind, like the President, said he acted stupidly, talking about the policeman. It turned out the policeman conducted himself very reasonably. We never did hear whether the President apologized to the policeman or not, but the point is that the President and the Justice Department have spent 8 years dividing us in ways I did not believe were possible 8 years ago.  So I hear my friends come in here and start condemning a man as not being fit to serve because of things like opposing an unconstitutional, un-American provision in the Voting Rights It was then, it is today. If somebody tries to pass a punishment of some group of people for something their grandparents did, it is wrong, it is un-I will say it to the day I die.  Now, it is very unfair. I saw it as a felony judge. It broke my heart. In chambers, but never in the courtroom itself, it would bring me to tears. I would break down when I saw the suffering of children because of the sins of their parents. But the government should not be in the business of punishing people intentionally. There was a provision in the Voting Rights Act that did just that.  I also heard an allegation about Jeff Sessions either opposing a hate crime extension or hate crime bill. I can tell you from conversations I had years past, back when we were talking about hate crimes bills, we did not need hate crime laws.  What was the fake news that was trotted out here in Washington, trotted out around the country?  Remember what happened down in south Texas?  It wasn't in my district, but I am familiar with what happened down there. There were three White guys that took a poor, decent African American, used a chain, tied him to their truck, and drug him until he was dead. It was in print and publicly.  I would personally have no problem with a jury ordering a sentence, if we could put it in the law, so that the family of that victim could decide what they were going to use to drag the defendants and the terrain they would drag those White defendants over, but that is not the law.  The law in Texas is that our juries can find you guilty and sentence you. Well, the juries don't actually sentence death. That is left to the judge. The juries answer three questions. I know. I have put it to juries three times.  On one occasion the jury came back locked up, so I sentenced that defendant to life. On two occasions of three capital murder cases I tried to completion, the jury found unanimously, number one, he committed the murder and he knew that a murder was going to be committed; number two, that he is a future danger to society; and number three, there was no evidence that mitigated against the imposition of the death penalty.  The jury comes back with yes, yes, and no; and it is left to a judge like me to look a man in the eyes and tell him that I sentence him to death. There is nothing that goes to your soul like looking someone in the eye and saying: You are going to be taken to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and you are going to be put to death for the crimes you have committed.  I believe in the death penalty, but I believe with all my heart you have to make sure due process occurs. I could care less about race.  I hear these allegations about Jeff I know Jeff and I know this is ridiculous. As I was listening to some of these broad statements just taking a swat at Jeff Sessions, a really fine, decent man, it took me right back to 20 years or so ago when I was that felony district judge in Texas and I tried capital murder cases, murder cases. Never mind the fact that I was court-appointed to appeal the capital murder conviction of an African American man and I did everything I possibly could ethically and within the[[Page H230]]law for my client, who I believed was wrongly convicted in this case.  His case was overturned after my argument. I was the only one arguing for our side. I was the one that solely did the brief. Even though the family paid thousands of dollars to somebody from another State, I did the whole thing. I did it all. I didn't have a clerk do it. I did it all.  His capital murder conviction was reversed. His mother used to bring me wonderful food. I loved her. I went to her funeral. She was just an incredible Christian woman and her funeral did her justice. Of course, then her daughter ran against me for Congress three times, but that is another story.  Nonetheless, I can remember back when I was a felony judge and I got served with a subpoena by a defense lawyer. They had taken the position in a pleading in another court that, because I had allegedly appointed a disparate number of White people to be grand jury foremen over African Americans, I must be bigoted. Therefore, convictions in Smith County should be overturned. I think they subpoenaed another district judge or two. We had three.  I knew that lawyer. He knew I wasn't a racist. He subpoenaed me and made allegations in print before he even knew who had been on my grand juries during those years I was a felony district judge, but he made the broad-based allegation that I must be racist and we have got to throw out these cases.  Before I came to testify, he actually got the list of my grand jurors. I didn't get to choose the grand jurors. Those were chosen by grand jury commissioners. The commissioners chose the grand jury members. I got to choose the grand jury foremen. I didn't care about race. I didn't care about gender. I appointed people because, when I looked at the background, the little bios we had on each of the grand jury members, I wanted somebody that was going to be a leader on that grand jury. I didn't care about race.  When the criminal defense lawyers did their homework after they made allegations, they notified me that I would not be called as a witness because I appointed too many African American grand jury foremen. Therefore, it was a disparate number of African It was too many. Therefore, I would hurt their case because I would show that maybe I was more biased for African Americans than against them. I didn't care about race.  I can remember a couple of grand jury foremen. One of them was, I think, an assistant school superintendent. I knew the guy. He was a solid citizen. I had seen him in action. He was a real leader in the community. He was an honest, fair man. I thought he would be great as a grand jury foreman. And he was.  Probably the best grand jury foreman I ever appointed--she was a saint--was ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgH227-3.txt,1801,CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,2017.0,9.0,March

The U.and our allies face constant threats from countries including Iran, Russia, China, and North ISIS and other global terrorists threaten our very way of life.  Our number one responsibility as Members of Congress is to provide for the defense of this I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen for the outstanding job he did drafting the FY17 bill. He deserves our thanks for producing such a significant and meaningful bill.  Since becoming the chairwoman of the Defense Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, I have spent a lot of time talking to senior defense leaders to find out what they need to combat these threats. They have unanimously stated that the only thing our adversaries respect is strength, and they need this bill passed to ensure our military is as strong and effective as possible.  Sequestration and reduced budget requests have caused the military to be underfunded for too long. This bill begins a process of rebuilding our military and giving our warfighters the resources they need to counter the numerous complex threats around the world. This bill reverses the drawdown of end strength and instead increases it by 36,000 troops above the FY17 budget request. This bill reverses steep cuts to procurement by funding additional ships and aircraft to modernize our weapons systems and address shortfalls. This is important because we have the smallest number of ships in the Navy since 1916, and the average age of an Air Force aircraft is 27 years old. Marine aviation squadrons have been forced to salvage parts from museums in order to keep our planes flying.  In every meeting I have had with defense leadership, they emphasize the devastating impact both sequestration and operating under a continuing resolution have on our security. When asked about the impact of a full year CR, General Goldfein, chief of staff of the Air Force, said: ``There is no enemy on the planet that can do more damage to the United States Air Force than us not getting a budget.''  Our military is counting on us to pass this bill now. It is the only way to ensure the United States will be strong and able to lead in this very dangerous world. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote.

When Rudy Giuliani--of all people--makes it clear that the President requested a Muslim ban and that they dressed up the policy to make it look better but still carved out exceptions to help Christians, you are probably acting in an unconstitutional manner.  That is not what one but two Federal judges thought: that there are significant enough constitutional issues that have been raised by recent executive actions to stop the President's order from being implemented.  Honestly, even at this hour, I am not sure they are fully complying with the orders or will reverse the actions of government officers at airports who coerced--intimidated--green card holders into signing away their rights and being deported.  On Sunday, the glaring bald spot of the President's executive order was combed over by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who said that keeping out travelers who already live in the U.and have green cards is not in the interests of the United States, to which the entire world said, sarcastically: Ya' think?

14525,topic-id,690,"Mr.Speaker, candidate Donald Trump promised he would drain the swamp. The American people believed him. But instead of draining the swamp, it has become abundantly clear he is driving his own pylons deeply into the swamp.  Already, Trump Incorporated is making significant profits off the President's position. Personal profits aren't what serving the public is about.  My mother used to ask about the superrich: Do they ever fill up?  In fact, The New York Times Editorial Board wrote a scathing indictment of Trump I include that article in the                [From the New York Times, 1, 2017]                            White House                        (By the Editorial Board)       As a candidate, President Trump spent contributors' money      for office space that he owned, stays at his resorts and food      at his restaurants. He spent contributors' money on Trump-     branded wine and water. He displayed Trump merchandise at      campaign events. Now he seems determined to milk the      presidency, apparently synonymous with his brand in his eyes,      for a fortune.       ``The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was      before,'' Mr.Trump observed, with satisfaction, shortly      after the election.       Last week, an executive of the Trump Organization, Eric      Danziger, said it would open Trump-branded hotels in the 26      largest metropolitan areas in the country, up from five. The      business, he said, would focus its expansion domestically for      ``the next four or eight years.'' The fee to join the Mar-a-     Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., which Mr.Trump calls the      ``Winter White House,'' just doubled to $200,000.       This news came less than a week after Mr.Trump and his      inauguration committee hosted parties and other events at the      Trump International Hotel in Washington, in the government-     owned Old Post Even his press secretary, Sean Spicer,      has become a pitchman: ``It's an absolutely stunning hotel,''      he said recently. ``I encourage you to go there if you      haven't been by.''       Self-dealing is such standard procedure for this White      House that a cynic (or satirist) might say it's time to give      in and try to put Mr.Trump's conflicts of interest to work      for the public. Maybe if he had hotels in every nation, he'd      have a financial interest in being less bellicose, and more      supportive of the free flow of trade and of people, even if      they happen to be Mexican or       But we really prefer the old-fashioned approach in which      presidents put the public interest ahead of their own      finances. Federal ethics officials have told Mr.Trump that      he should divest his business interests to avoid allegations      of bribery and to assure Americans that their needs are his      only concern. Mr.Trump argues that he can put a ``firewall''      between his businesses and himself by having his eldest sons      manage them. The president and the Trump Organization last      week hired lawyers to keep an eye on the Trumps, a laughable      ploy that doesn't meet ethical or anti-corruption standards      and constitutional requirements.       Mr.Trump has argued that the law permits the president to      keep his business--even though no modern president has done      so, and far poorer ones than he have sold off business      interests to serve. He and his lawyers have played down the      importance of the emoluments clause of the Constitution,      which prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or      income from foreign governments without the approval of      And he refuses to release his tax returns and      divest his assets and put the proceeds in a blind trust, as      his cabinet nominees are doing right now.

That unambiguous clause      exists to prevent corruption and self-dealing by government      officials.       Since Mr.Trump officially violated the lease when he      assumed office, the agency is clearly obligated to cancel the      lease or require that it be sold to another hotel operator.      Ranking Democrats on the House and Senate committees with      jurisdiction over the agency have for weeks been asking it to      address the lease violation.

Despite ample evidence from our defense community and European allies, President Trump still casts doubt on whether Moscow is backing Russian forces who have killed over 10,000 innocent Ukrainians and who recently killed at least eight more Ukrainian soldiers and 40 civilians and turned off water and electricity in the invaded region.  When Bill O'Reilly asked our President if he respected Putin, a known killer, the President replied: ``There are a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?''  The President equates Mr.Putin's actions with those of our country. It is not the first time this has happened.  Every time President Trump says something Putin likes, it is broadcast on Kremlin-owned propaganda machines like This is a dangerous threat to liberty.  President Trump openly admires and appeases Putin, whose tenure is known for human rights abuses, brutal suppression of political dissent, and mysterious deaths of journalists and political opponents, like Vladimir Kara-[[Page H1059]]Murza who wrote a letter critical of Putin to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the nomination of Secretary Last Thursday, while in Moscow, he fell into a life-threatening coma believed to be caused by an unknown poison.

Mr.Trump said he did not take offense at the outbreak of a      lethal bout of fighting in Ukraine that came within a day of      a phone conversation he had with Mr.Putin, saying of the      recent clashes, ``we don't really know exactly what that      is.''       ``They're pro-forces,'' Mr.Trump said of the Ukrainian      separatists in an interview that aired on Monday on ``The      O'Reilly Factor,'' on Fox ``We don't know, are they      uncontrollable?

Force readiness remains the defense community's top priority. Funding the capabilities to provide this responsibility must remain our top priority. We must approach Congress' appropriations responsibility from the historic bipartisan process that has broken down once too many times in recent years.  This political infighting harms the stability and predictability necessary for our Armed Forces to properly plan. It left both our adversaries and allies questioning our ability to defend or support the multiple conflicts we are currently engaged with abroad.  This compromise worked out by our responsible colleagues, Chairwoman Granger, Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, Ranking Member Lowey; and their Senate counterparts are strong glimmers of hope that we might actually finish the 2017 appropriations responsibilities. But we have ten additional subcommittee bills that are equally important and account for nearly half of our budget.  When will we vote on those compromised bills?  I could think of little that would be more irresponsible than to only move this defense bill and leave the remaining departments and agencies operating under a continuing resolution.  I have always supported our troops and our national defense. However, we know the safety and well-being of the American people does not merely rely on defense funding. It is rooted in the stability of the Republic they are sworn to protect and defend. We have a responsibility there, equally important.

I was proud when he testified at the field hearing I held on the issue while ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2014. In the years after, he worked to strengthen State resources for treatment and education programs. He has worked to improve the State's prescription drug monitoring system in order to curb harmful opioid prescribing and misuse.  Chen also led efforts to reduce tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol use among youth. In 2013, he and I worked to secure a $10 million grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, to expand substance abuse efforts in Vermont among young adults at risk of developing habits in alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and illicit drug use. Since his efforts, the conversation regarding youth substance abuse, especially on marijuana, has become a major public health discussion in the Vermont Statehouse and beyond.

Now an award-winning artisan cheese business, Jasper Hill Farm began two decades ago when the brothers Kehler pooled their resources to buy a small farm in rural Greensboro, They decided to try a new model of small-scale, value-added dairy farming that would transform raw milk into a more valuable product before leaving the farm. To do so, Mateo and Andy built a creamery with space to age cheese next door to the barn. After 5 years of hard work, the brothers finally had their first marketable cheese.  What started as a few racks of cheese with a couple of direct customers quickly expanded, as did the farm's notoriety. Within 3 years, Jasper Hill Farm took home ``Best of Show'' at the American Cheese Society Despite their hard-earned success, Andy and Mateo continued with their vision of increasing access to value-added production for all interested farmers. They took new measures to create opportunities for community success, opening their space to other cheesemakers. Now, the creamery is home not only to numerous cheese caves, but to a modern laboratory where scientists work to create cheese starter cultures. Years of research have enabled the creation of better cheese, and Jasper Hill Farm has become a magnet for other artisan cheesemakers along the way.  Andy and Mateo have created an outstanding business that is rooted in the Vermont values of hard work and perseverance, while emphasizing the importance of community. Their efforts to reinvigorate the State's dairy industry have contributed to our State's identity and culture, as well as our agricultural traditions.

Why does a small, rural creamery invest in technology for      what has long been a low-tech product? Because it doesn't      have 500 years to learn what its European counterparts      already know: the biological intricacies of how to make the      best cheese in a particular place. And because the same      diversity of microbial cultures is not available in North            ``Building a lab might seem extravagant or of questionable      value, but what we get as a business over two, three, four      generations--it's a no-brainer,'' said Mateo Kehler, who owns      the farm with his brother,       The making of cheese depends on the contribution of myriad      microbial actors. Both yeast and bacteria are components of      the starter cultures that help turn milk into solids, and      those solids into cheeses with distinctive aromas, flavors      and textures that are hard to resist. The interplay of these      species, while understood in a basic sense, is now receiving      renewed scientific scrutiny and appreciation in the United            Unlike their peers in Europe, who benefit from centuries of      tradition and from government support for research, American      farmstead cheese makers have typically gone it alone. Starter      cultures are a particularly vexing ingredient. The only three      domestic suppliers, including DuPont and Cargill, are      multinational corporations better known for chemicals, which      has limited the number of available cultures and caused      discomfort in a field that strives for individuality.       But now several small cheese producers are working with      scientists to develop their own starters and use microbiology      to create better cheeses.       Murray's Cheese is working with Rockefeller University to      learn more about the microflora in its cheese caves in Long      Island City, Uplands Cheese Company is working with      the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin      to create a new soft cheese, its first in seven years.       But perhaps none have taken on cheese science as rigorously      as Jasper Its laboratory, opened in 2013, has become a      hub for other cheese makers seeking help and insight.       When the Kehler brothers began making cheese in 2003, their      aim was to invigorate the local dairy industry, which was,      and still is, struggling. They started on their path to      applied science in 2010, when Rachel Dutton,[[Page S2044]]     a Harvard scientist, decided to use cheese as a model to      research how small microbial communities interact; she      focused on the composition of cheese rinds.       Her first contact in the cheese business was Mateo Kehler,      who taught her to make cheese and then helped her reach out      to more than 100 other producers for samples. The response      was overwhelming. ``I don't think she realized how excited      the artisan cheese industry was going to be,'' Mr.Kehler      said.       In 2014, Dutton published her findings in the journal      Working with Benjamin Wolfe, a postdoctoral researcher,      she reported that the environment (cows, cheese caves,      pastures) and methods (washing, salting, managing acidity)      were as important to the development of cheese rinds, if not      more so, than the ingredients.       This was a revelation. With this new scientific proof in      hand, the Kehlers stopped adding starter cultures to      Winnimere, one of their most popular raw-milk cheeses. ``What      we were adding wasn't growing, and when we stopped adding      that, the cheese ripened more gracefully and deliciously,''      Mateo Kehler said.       Their pasteurized cheeses, though, still needed starters      because pasteurization kills bacteria both good and bad for      cheese. So they began making starter cultures from bacteria      in their own milk supply.       Besides ending their reliance on big business, this has      allowed the brothers to create a cheese that can come only      from a singular place: Greensboro,       An on-site laboratory has its perks. In addition to having      staff members who deeply understand microbiology, Jasper Hill      Farm has become a magnet for researchers near and far. Now      working there are an engineering intern from Brittany,      France; a local microbiologist; and Panos Lekkas, a food      microbiologist who has investigated the best ways to feed,      tend and milk a cow for cheese production.       Lekkas, who was hired in November to work full time at      Jasper Hill, collaborates with Dutton, now at the      University of California, San Diego, and with Wolfe, who      leads a microbiology laboratory at Tufts       In addition to helping improve food safety procedures at      the 85-person Jasper Hill Farm, Lekkas is overseeing the      development of a new cheese--a French Camembert style that      for now the team is calling Wild       Lekkas was told that it takes eight months to bring a      new cheese to market. ``Mateo wants me to do it in three,''      he said. With science comes speed.       In order to make a soft pasteurized cheese that does not      rely on corporate additives, the scientists sampled 300      promising strains of yeast and bacteria, all pulled from milk      from Jasper Hill's own 250 cows.       What makes a homegrown starter promising? Sometimes it's      the color of the microbes in a petri dish, but smell, too,      can be telling. The group sniffed the samples and noted any      pleasing aromas: Play-Doh, Concord grapes, tomato juice,      clams, Kraft American Wolfe's lab ran a full      genomic sequencing on the 15 top contenders, which will      provide a blueprint for understanding how these strains are      related to, or differ from, other cultures in the cheese      world.       Making funky cheese is tricky, even for scientists. ``There      are subtle variations in flavor and aroma that you perceive      in cheese,'' Wolfe said. ``We want to understand what      drives that variation.'' With Wolfe's genomic data, the      team can track the microbes through the entire cheese-making      process.       In November, the first batch of cheese was produced using      five strains from the original 15 parent cultures--two yeast-     based and three bacterial. New batches are being made every      two weeks using different combinations, and every 10 days,      each will be tasted to see whether it is on target for the      ``deliciousness factor,'' Jasper Hill's zero-to-10 grading      system.       Seven or above is pretty good. Eight is out of this world.      Tens are likely to be bestowed only outside the farm: Jasper      Hill's Harbison cheese recently took Super Gold at the World      Cheese Awards in       ``I will be happy with a seven,'' Lekkas said.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2043.txt,1383,FIRST RESPONDER ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ACT,2017.0,28.0,January

I want to explain these two amendments because this is the only chance that we will have to talk about this.  The first amendment, which I have offered several times on a bipartisan basis, would prohibit the funding for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, the AUMF, beginning on September 30, 2017. And mind you, that 6-month window provides Congress ample opportunity to draft and debate a new AUMF and to vote it up or down.  Clearly, Congress is required to act. This amendment would require Congress to finally debate and vote on nearly a 3-year-long war that is raging in the Middle East, a war that has already claimed the lives of several brave servicemembers.

Let me be clear: For people living with HIV in this country--repealing the ACA could mean a death sentence.  Without the Affordable Care Act, people living with HIV are at risk of losing access to the medicine and doctors that keep them healthy.  Clearly, health insurance is critical to keeping people healthy and reducing health disparities.  Mr.Speaker, we know that the ACA works.  It has provided healthcare for over 20 million Americans--7 8 million of whom are African American--since it was signed into law.  And because of this bill, young people, working class people, and people of color now have high-quality, affordable healthcare.  But Republicans don't seem to care.  They are on a rampage to make America sick again--and we must stand in their way.  Mr.Speaker, millions of Americans are making their voices heard in protests, in town halls and in the streets.  And their message is simple: ``Keep your hands off of our healthcare.''  I'm standing with the millions of Americans who are in opposition to this disastrous healthcare bill.

14591,topic-id,581,"Mr.President, on December 23, 2016, the world lost a true hero.  Piers Sellers was a scientist and an astronaut, having flown three times on the space shuttle. On his first mission, he flew aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis to the International Space Station, where he completed nearly 20 hours of space walks outfitting and assembling the orbiting outpost.  Several years later, following the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, Piers returned to space and to the International Space Station aboard Discovery, carrying out the second of two test flights NASA needed to test critical on-orbit inspection and repair procedures resulting from the Columbia accident investigation.  On his third and final mission, he once more flew aboard Atlantis to the On this mission, he served as the robotics officer, again playing a key role in assembling and outfitting the space station.  His career as an astronaut exploring the frontier of space is by itself sufficient to justify Piers' status as a national hero; yet his service as an astronaut and explorer is a small subset of the contributions Piers made to our country and to our entire civilization.  Piers was a renowned climate scientist, specializing in using computer modeling and space-based observations to understand and predict the dynamics of our changing planet. He was also a brilliant communicator, whether testifying at a Commerce Committee field hearing in Miami about the impending dangers of sea level rise or standing in front of NASA's ``hyperwall'' video system narrating stunning and informative visualizations of the massive data sets that embody the ``vital signs'' of planet Countless policymakers, industry leaders, and even other scientists owe much of their understanding of the complex interactions of Earth's systems and of the alarming and undeniable signs that our civilization's carbon emissions are warming the planet to  Yet Piers' most heroic deed may be the decision he made shortly after being diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. He simply decided to keep going to work. To those that knew Piers, this was no surprise. A three-time shuttle astronaut and very capable manager, scientist, and engineer, Piers no doubt had many lucrative offers for employment following his final shuttle flight in 2010. Instead he chose to remain a civil servant scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center because he felt that was where he could contribute most to the future of our home planet. A few years later, when Piers received the devastating news that he had not long to live, he chose to spend his remaining time continuing his work at NASA and communicating climate science to the public in the calm and charming manner that was uniquely his.  In a short video Piers recorded shortly before his death, despite his body having been ravaged by cancer and surely knowing that he had very little time left, he appeared as cheerful and hopeful as ever.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION                          (a) In General.--Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of      2002 (6 U.S.341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end      the following new section:     ``708.

14804,topic-id,1023,"Mr.Speaker, for the next 60 minutes, it is with great honor that I rise to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour. For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people on the issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, to Congress, and to constituents who represent all  At this time, Mr.Speaker, we would like to use this time to talk about the Affordable Care What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose, Mr.Speaker? Such was President Trump's constant refrain to the African-American community when rallying for their support of his administration's various policies.  Mr.Speaker, today, I rise to say that with critical elements of the American healthcare policy on the chopping block, African-Americans have a lot to lose, possibly even their lives.                              {time}  1930  There is as much at stake if President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress healthcare policies take shape in their current form.  By illustration, I want to address the impact on low-income families and individuals in the Virgin Islands who rely on Medicaid, and, presently, Medicaid is capped in the Virgin You can look at our territory as an example of what will happen when there is a cap on services, which could compromise a State or local government's ability to administer those most in need.  Since its inception, Medicaid has been an open-ended program that was intended to expand and contract with need, especially when States and localities face crippling economic downturns of both manmade and natural origins. Medicaid covers one in five Americans, and of those, the majority of enrollees are children and individuals with disabilities.  Under the Affordable Care Act, widely known as ObamaCare, millions of African Americans finally gained access to healthcare coverage. In 2015, approximately 11.2 million African Americans became eligible for Medicaid through the expansion, health care that they previously did not receive and which would have cost this country much more if that early-warning health care was not taken care of.  President Trump and Republicans in Congress propose converting Medicaid from a shared payment program between States and Federal Government to an arrangement much like a block grant, where the Federal Government puts a cap on its payment assistance, creating a huge cost shift to the If you want to know what you have to lose if caps on Medicaid are enacted nationwide, look no further than my home, the Virgin It is a grim outlook.  Federal caps on Medicaid programs in the Virgin Islands are set on a per-enrollee basis. Unlike States in the mainland where Federal Medicaid spending is open-ended depending on the needs of the people, the Virgin Islands can only access Federal dollars up to an annual ceiling. Beyond that cap, the Virgin Islands' government is responsible for the remaining costs. That means many Virgin Islanders who would qualify in other States and in other circumstances don't get the healthcare coverage that they need now.  Under the proposed fiscal arrangement, spending caps don't take into account the cost of providing services or unpredictable changes in a community--such as the closure of a major employer or a natural disasters--forcing a cost obligation for critical support services onto the already strained budgets of the territory.[[Page H2227]]  As a result, States and local governments, increasingly, would have to make tough choices to either reduce services for recipients of Medicaid or restrict eligibility and enrollment of additional people who may need it. Those are the choices that Virgin Islanders must make. So the most vulnerable of our constituents--in this case, children--who need the safety net that Medicaid, by definition, is supposed to provide have that final option cut out from under them.  When it comes to Medicaid coverage, the Virgin Islands struggles to provide low-income families with Medicaid services for three major reasons:  First, while the Affordable Care Act raised the territory's Federal Medicaid assistance percentage up to 83 percent for newly eligible enrollees, this increase in Federal match funding did not apply to those previously enrolled, which the Federal Government only matched at 55 percent in the Virgin Islands, requiring that the remaining costs be covered by the Virgin Islands government, a government already strained to meet basic needs.  The Virgin Islands and the smaller territories are not included in the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital, DSH, program, which would shoulder the unanticipated costs our hospitals must take on to provide adequate care for individuals who use hospitals for basic services since they have no insurance.  Three, With no Affordable Care Act exchange and no Federal subsidies to create our own health exchange, many Virgin Islanders were only able to obtain coverage through the Medicaid expansion if they met the already strenuous requirements. That means that 30 percent of Virgin Islanders presently have no health insurance.  This is what the rest of the States are going to have if this American Health Care Act, as it stands, is passed. A cap on Medicaid is a cap on medical services that our constituents just can't do without; and in poor communities, it is going to be even more impactful.  When ObamaCare provided increased funding to expand Medicaid, the island of Saint Croix was able to start a monthly homeless clinic at the Frederiksted Health Care Center about 15 months ago. That clinic has been able to serve many people, providing them with medical care, showers, meals, and transportation.  On Thomas, with the East End health clinic, they were able to expand their services and increase dental services to people who were sorely in need of that. If this funding decreases or is lost altogether, it is highly unlikely that this initiative can be continued.  Our current healthcare struggle is set to become a future hardship for mainland American States that provide Medicaid to a significant number of their population should the current proposals to cap Medicaid nationwide become law.  How do we avoid this? Do not place a cap on Too many in the African-American community have everything to lose if healthcare policy goes in this direction.

And our colleagues have been giving us examples all the time.  I am always trying to let them know that the Virgin Islands stands as an example of what it will look like if the Affordable Care Act is repealed because the Virgin Islands doesn't have the expansion. We were not put in the mandate for the exchange, and that has led to 30 percent of Virgin Islanders having absolutely no health insurance, which then means that our hospitals are strained because the hospitals have to pick up costs for individuals who are without health care.  Listen, if your child is ill or sick, or you are dying, you are going to go to the hospital whether you can take care of it or not, whether you can pay the bill or not; and that has put a tremendous burden on our hospitals for them to meet the costs of those 30 percent of individuals living in the Virgin Islands who do not have health insurance, are not covered by either the government group insurance for the local government or by the Medicaid money that we utilized because we did not have the expansion.  And even that is scheduled to leave after the fiscal year 2019, and we are going to have to make choices of removing people from Medicaid, of removing care from children, removing care from elderly and from individuals with disabilities. That is not a choice that Americans should have to make in this day and age, that individuals do not receive health care.

Why don't they get jobs?  I mean, in the Virgin Islands, when we had our largest employer, Hovensa, an oil refinery, close, of course, then our unemployment rate went up. And these are families in need, families who need the support.  With a cap on Medicaid, we were only able to have 55 percent of individuals who would qualify for Medicaid with that cap, with that ceiling that was in place from the Federal It means that a tremendous amount of children, homeless individuals, people, families that are out of work for a period of time, are not covered. That, then, creates this huge burden on a hospital for those families to be taken care of, for individual care and individual need.  Particularly in the African-American community, when you have things like diabetes, hypertension, all of these diseases which need constant monitoring and primary care physicians to take care of and to ensure that they do not become life-threatening, and come to a place where then they are coming to the hospital, it is in the millions of dollars that you are going to need support and care for the servicing of individuals with these diseases.  So I know that we are pushing that there be an expansion of Medicaid, that the cap not be put on Medicaid services, not because we want to coddle people who are poor, but because we know it is necessary. And the cost of not taking care of them on the front end of health care, with Medicaid, is an astronomical cost on the back end when they have diseases that have just gone out of control because they have not been able to go to primary care physicians and get the health care that they need.

14549,topic-id,1541,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, one of the greatest honors that I have had as a Member of Congress has been the opportunity to serve on the Education and the Workforce Committee and on the conference committee that put the Every Student Succeeds Act together in its final form.  Before coming to Congress, I chaired the Colorado State Board of Education; I founded two charter schools, the New America School and the Academy of Urban Learning; and I worked closely with educators, school board members, and parents across our State to improve the quality of our schools in  I know firsthand the impact that Federal education policy has on States, on school districts, on schools, and on the families that they serve. So when I arrived in Congress, I was excited to roll up my sleeves and get to work on education policy.  One of the top issues in education when I arrived has always been the desire to replace No Child Left Behind, an outdated and inflexible law that, in many ways, set schools up for failure, with a new and better way of making sure that every student has the opportunity to succeed.  I heard from so many of my constituents that, under No Child Left Behind, schools were testing too much, districts lacked the flexibility they needed, and the Colorado Department of Education--like so many other State departments of education--was effectively at the whim of the U.Department of Education with regard to their State plans, effectively living waiver to waiver. That is no way to go about Federal education policy. It is why the Every Student Succeeds Act was so badly needed.  Now, early on, the work on the Every Student Succeeds Act wasn't as collegial as it should have been. Republicans introduced a hyperpartisan bill. It passed this Chamber with no Democrat votes and many Republicans voting against it as well. But throughout the process, one thing remained the same: Members were committed to moving past No Child Left Behind and replacing it with a bill that put the interests of students first. Finally that happened last Congress, 15 years after the passage of No Child Left Behind and almost 6 years after the expiration of the authorizing statute; but, finally, Congress did its job.  I am proud to say that everyone on the Education and the Workforce Committee has shown that we believe that every child deserves a great education. We may have different ideas at times about how to achieve that goal, and that is okay, but we all value the result of ensuring opportunity for every child in our country.  It was that very commitment and value, as well as our willingness to work together, that produced the Every Student Succeeds The bill passed overwhelmingly in the majority Republican House and Senate, and was signed by our then-Democratic It was and continues to be a bright spot of the last Congress, and what too often seems a Congress that is overwhelmed by partisanship.  Unfortunately, the bipartisanship under ESSA potentially ends with this bill. House Republicans have filed the resolution using the Congressional Review Act to overturn a key regulation consistent with the law that was finalized by the Obama administration in Now, before diving into the details of this particular Congressional Review Act that is considered under this rule, I want to say a little bit about the process.  We should look no further than the U.Constitution in learning how separation of powers works. There are three branches of government: the legislative, executive, and judicial. Each branch is separate, independent, and coequal, and different in how they function. That is an important background and a critical context in evaluating this legislation.  When Congress passed and the President signed the Every Student Succeeds Act in December of 2015, the process didn't end. Many bills, especially one as extensive as ESSA, require clarification from the Department of Education, the agency charged with executing the law. The text of the ESSA anticipated that. In fact, the law describes in detail how the Department of Education should and shouldn't write regulations. Frankly, that had been some of the problem under No Child Left Behind, is it lacked sufficient congressional direction with regard to the waiver process which was used effectively at the full discretion of then-Secretary of Education Duncan and President  It took the Department a year and a multistakeholder process, ensuring every voice was heard. Sure enough, a year after the legislation was passed, the Department of Education finalized its rules on accountability.  Last week, House Republicans took the first step towards taking a sledgehammer to that entire implementation. Rules that have extensive buy-in from stakeholders and are the blueprint for States in developing our State education plans would be thrown out[[Page H1025]]under this rule, effectively throwing public education into chaos across all 50 States and completely disregarding the hard work of educators, parents, school board members, superintendents, and principals over the last year.  The two education-related CRAs we are considering on the floor were introduced last Wednesday night. That is four legislative days between introduction and action. Once more, the CRAs weren't treated through the committee process. We did not consider them in the Education and the Workforce There were no hearings, no markups. In fact, the full Education and the Workforce Committee hasn't even had a markup yet with regard to a K-12 bill.  I am honored to be the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, which has jurisdiction over one of these three CRAs under this bill. We had no hearings or markups on this bill. It is really a disservice to the over 50 new Members of this Congress--no imprint on this bill--as well as the Members at large, that this committee avoids the regular process.  It is also counter to promises that were made by Republican leadership about returning to regular order. The actions today couldn't be further from regular order because Republicans have chosen to utilize the Congressional Review Act to move bills from introduction to the floor without going through committee.  Unfortunately, the Congressional Review Act not only overturns regulations, but it prevents the Department of Education from writing a new regulation that is similar to the regulation that was overturned.  Now, Mr.Byrne mentioned that there can be subsequent legislation that allows it. Let me point out that Every Student Succeeds Act was over 5 years overdue. It took Congress 5 years after the initial expiration of No Child Left Behind to even replace the authorizing statute. So if that is Congress' intent, we are putting the cart before the horse. We should alter or change the authorizing statute in a way that Democrats and Republicans agree, rather than throw out the work that has already occurred.  This statute would effectively tie the hands of the recently confirmed Secretary of Education DeVos and prevent her from implementing the will of this body through the Every Student Succeeds  Over the past few weeks, my office has received hundreds of pieces of mail regarding education, largely in opposition to Secretary DeVos; but I think the issue is that Secretary DeVos, who was recently confirmed--this CRA would prevent her from doing her job and implementing the Every Student Succeeds  Let me just say that this guidance on accountability isn't just for show. It is at the very heart of the Every Student Succeeds Act, which Democrats and Republicans supported. It has real impact.  I want to close my opening remarks with a story about that real impact from Christina in Pennsylvania, whose son has a learning disability. Christina's son has always had a tough time in school due to diagnosed dyslexia, dysgraphia, and While he is a smart and personable kid, when it came time to read and write, he could be thought of as the ``bad'' kid too often, and he acted out.  It would have been easy for the school to write him off without the protections that are offered under IDEA, but, luckily, he was required to participate in assessments. That accountability encouraged the school to work harder and to stick with it and to figure out why this otherwise smart student couldn't read simple words in different places on a page or demonstrate his achievement of knowledge.                              {time}  1245  If his school wasn't required to show student progress, there wouldn't have been the incentive for them to invest their time and money in helping his special needs. Without accountability, Christina's son's school would have had little incentive to set appropriate educational goals for him and offer the support necessary to reach them.  Accountability requirements inform school administrators, teachers, parents, students, and the community at large that all students have a learning goal and make sure that all students have the tools to get there.  Today, Christina's son is a college freshman majoring in biology with a 3.2 The accountability in this CRA that would be thrown out would undermine the very accountability that allowed not only Christina's son to succeed but so many other children across our country.

It is especially troubling in the current environment, where we have seen an increase in anti-Semitism and racism, generally, since the election of President Just last week, the Jewish Community Center in my district in Boulder, Colorado, had to close because of a bomb threat, the families and children sent home. We have seen swastikas on New York City subways and in our schools.  Frankly, I think many Jewish Americans are fearful about what the intentions are of the occupant of the White House and his top advisers and what we can do as a country to combat this; and it is exactly the wrong message to send on Holocaust Remembrance Day, to leave out the obvious truth that continues to be denied by anti-Semitic leaders around the world, including former Presidents of Iran and Supreme Leaders of Iran and others, that the Holocaust was a deliberate effort of terror and genocide directed against the Jewish people by the Nazi regime.

14556,topic-id,2177,"Mr.Speaker, over the last few years, one complaint I have heard over and over is how inconsistent education policy has been. States have been using waivers at the discretion of the Department of Finally, educators, school board members, families, hope that ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act, could provide more stability. Unfortunately for States, undoing the accountability CRA would only reenergize that uncertainty.  For months, States have been working on their State plans, and I have had the opportunity to join our Colorado group that has been working on that plan as required under the Every Student Succeeds We have had guidance from the Department of Education since last November, and we have been writing our State plans with that in mind. Now, if this regulation is overturned, it would pull the rug out from States that have been working diligently to enact their plans.  Likewise, H.58, another education-related bill that would occur under this rule, would effectively unravel the Department of Education's teacher preparation regulations. In the Higher Education Act, States are required to assess the effectiveness of teacher prep programs, and this regulation simply provides guidance for how States can do that, making sure our teacher training programs work, making sure that we are improving the quality of our public educators.  This provision also requires that TEACH grant recipients attend high-performing teacher prep programs. It is not a matter of picking winners and losers; it is making sure that our taxpayer dollars are used effectively to train high-quality educators.  If money is going to be invested in future teachers at high-needs schools, we want to make sure that teachers are attending the highest quality programs available. At the end of the day, a great education starts with a great teacher in the classroom, and this requirement ensures that even the neediest students have access to a great teacher. Taken together, these two bills represent a strategic attempt by Republicans to undermine public education.  The other CRA, which is completely unrelated to the two education-related CRAs, is actually related to a land management issue. I want to describe why that is a bad idea as well.  I come from a Western My district that I represent is over 60 percent public lands, so this BLM plan will actually affect my district, and that is why I am so impassioned to speak here today and listen to others in my State about this rule.  A revision of this BLM plan is long overdue. Few plans or rules can remain relevant for decades, and BLM's planning was last drafted in 1983. Needing a new planning system may not sound like the most exciting thing in the world, but it is actually critical because it can impact everything from cultural to environmental resources, to jobs in the economy in our district which relate to our use of public lands. That is why I have been contacted by groups of sportsmen, county commissioners, outdoor recreation groups, and conservationists asking how Congress can be wasting their time repealing something that makes BLM's process more transparent and conclusive.  Local control and constituent input are top priorities for those of us who live in and around public land, particularly in the West, so it makes sense that many counties and groups in Colorado who have worked with BLM offices on land use are pleading with Congress not to use a CRA to repeal this commonsense rule and join their voices with ours in opposition to this rule and this bill. The kinds of groups opposed to this bill include the International Mountain Bicycling Association because they know that, even though the planning process isn't perfect and, of course, can be refined, it would be a huge mistake to throw out the whole thing and bar the BLM from making necessary modernizations moving forward, especially when the Republicans are in the driver's seat.  Hunting and fishing groups and outdoor industry businesses, like the Outdoor Industry Association, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, know that this planning process will give them the voice they need in the planning process without diminishing anyone else's role. I believe that those who have actually experienced and been part of the process are the voices that need to be heeded when we are determining if the planning has been a success.  Here are a few of the quotes from some counties in Western States that have been part of the process and support the new planning system. From Lewis and Clark County in Idaho:       A great example of the potential of Planning 2.0 can be      found in eastern and central Idaho, where the BLM is      preparing to engage in a land use planning process for public      lands from the big desert to the benches of the Salmon      At the behest of local BLM leadership, which has already been      operating under the spirit of Planning 2.0, a number of      sporting groups, conservation organizations, and Salmon      Valley stewardship have reached out to a wide-ranging      constituency of ranchers, loggers, motorized users,      sportsmen, and other groups. The benefit of this early      conversation can be very valuable to sportsmen. Take the      Donkey Hills at the headwaters of the Pahsimeroi River as an      example. There has been near unanimous agreement that the      critical elk calving area in the Donkey Hills needs      thoughtful consideration as a critical wildlife area.       From Missoula County, Montana:       Western Montana, where the Missoula BLM field offices      engaged in a land-use planning revision process for public      lands from the John Long Range to Joshua Park all the way to      the Garnet Range, through this process, BLM has piloted the      steps in Planning 2.0 to further engage the public in land      management decisions.  I include in the Record letters from both of these counties, as well as a letter from a group of outdoor industries asking for this body to oppose the                                             Lewis & Clark County,                                Board of County Commissioners,                                                  Helena,     Re the Bureau of Land Management's Proposed Resource          Management Planning Rules, 81 8674 (February          25, 2016).

Director Neil Kornze,     Bureau of Land Management,     Washington,       Dear Director Kornze: We are writing you to commend you and      the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for your efforts to      improve BLM's planning process (Planning 2.0) and better      address the diverse interests found in Missoula County and      other communities across the western United       Missoula County is approximately 2,600 square miles in      size, and federal management in the county accounts for 52      percent of the land ownership. The BLM manages roughly 23,000      acres for the public in Missoula County and the sustainable      management of these public lands is vitally important to the      residents we represent Our citizens and local economies      depend on state and federal lands for water quality and      quantity, as well as for multiple sustainable uses ranging      from outdoor recreation to livestock grazing to mineral      exploration and development. Consequently, we wish to thank      the BLM for proposing to address their land management      options from a landscape perspective. This approach      recognizes that the management of federal lands has a direct      impact on other properties well beyond those close to or      adjacent to BLM managed land.       We support the provisions of the BLM's Proposed Resource      Management Planning Rules, 81 Reg, 8674 (25, 2016).      These rules provide additional opportunities for public      involvement earlier in the planning process, including the      chance to review preliminary resource management alternatives      and preliminary rationales for those alternatives. This early      public involvement will help resolve conflicts and produce a      Resource Management Plan that better reflect the needs of our      citizens as well as others who use the public lands and have      a stake in their future. Equally important is the improved      openness and transparency the rules bring to the process,      allowing any local government to actively participate and      share information on issues critical to local residents and      their elected representatives.       The proposed rules continue to provide for coordination      with state and local representatives in order to ensure, to      the extent allowable under federal law, that Resource      Management Plans are consistent with state and local land use      plans, as provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management      Act of 1976.

Re H.44 to disapprove BLM's Planning 2.0 rulemaking.     Liz Cheney,     Washington,       Dear Cheney: As representatives of the outdoor      recreation community and industry, we write to express our      support for the Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0      initiative and our opposition to its disapproval through the      Congressional Review Collectively, our members recreate      on BLM lands across the country and have a deep and personal      interest in the management of these areas, and these public      lands are also essential to supporting our businesses. While      Planning 2.0 may require improvements, those necessary      targeted changes would be foreclosed by a CRA disapproval,      drastically setting back the ability of BLM to deliver much      needed modernizations to the agency's planning process.       In our experience with land management planning across      agencies, a modern approach to planning built on robust      public engagement from the earliest stages of the planning      process is a tremendous benefit to land use management. It is      an essential step toward alleviating conflicts, ensuring      appropriately balanced and ordered uses, and stewarding our      country's public lands. Although there are aspects of BLM's      Planning 2.0 rulemaking that could be improved, this effort      has produced a strong step forward for the agency's planning      process, and we believe strongly that throwing this      rulemaking out in its entirety would be a costly and      unproductive decision.       During the Planning 2.0 development process, BLM engaged in      impressive public outreach and worked in an open and      collaborative fashion with a full spectrum of public lands      stakeholders. We believe the outcome is a process that      provides greatly improved opportunities for public input in      land use planning, in particular in helping the agency better      understand the values Americans ascribe to their public      lands, including where people go, why people go there, and      the experiences that these landscapes enable that are an      essential part of their inherent value. It also does a much      better job of recognizing the importance of recreation,      including for local economies, and greatly improves the      agency's ability to handle data.       Our feedback on this rulemaking is in part based on our      experience with the Forest Service's 2012 revisions to its      planning rule, which made similar changes to the Forest      Service's planning process. As that rule is being      implemented, we are seeing a significantly more transparent      process, with better up-front data collection and more      opportunities for collaboration. In North Carolina, for      example, where we have been engaged in Forest Planning on the      Nantahala-Pisgah Forests, loggers and hunters, kayakers and      off-road enthusiasts have been working side-by-side to      develop consensus recommendations for the Forest Far      from circumventing local input, these modern planning      processes reward long-term, local engagement, and empower      local communities to develop visions for their public lands      in concert with a full array of stakeholders.       Planning 2.0 has been a valuable step in helping BLM      modernize its planning process, and we believe strongly      that--while targeted improvements to the rulemaking may be      possible--this rulemaking should not be thrown out through      the Congressional Review Congress is well positioned to      pursue necessary changes or improvements with the new      administration, whereas CRA disapproval would not only block      these changes, but stymie future agency efforts at      modernization.       Thank you for considering our perspective on maintaining      this important step in modernizing BLM planning.

14558,topic-id,505,"It reads, in part: ``The current BLM planning methodology lacks adequate opportunities for public involvement, particularly early in the process.''  This rule that the CRA would invalidate addresses some of the shortcomings in the current rule. This last point is especially important, that changes would provide the public with an opportunity to raise concerns and review potential management alternatives before those alternatives become solidified. By having an opportunity for early involvement, BLM can actually avoid expensive litigation after a plan is complete.  This legislation is not only good for transparency, public involvement, and environmental and wildlife protections, but it saves taxpayer dollars. I don't know how anyone can oppose that. The process has widespread support from those of us who live in and around public land, from people who are on the ground, including landowners, farmers, ranchers, sportsmen, and conservationists.  In a hearing in the Committee on Natural Resources, one of our witnesses was a rancher from my home State of Colorado, who eloquently spoke about how the old system was not working and how this desperately needed new system had worked well in its limited implementation.

Mr.Speaker, the resolutions before us today represent everything that is wrong with When our constituents sent us here to Washington, D.C., they weren't asking us to engage in partisan bickering and using brutal techniques to undo thoughtful, nuanced regulation. If Members of this body have problems with rules that have been promulgated, change the authorizing statutes; don't simply prevent the agencies from enacting the very things that this body has told them to do. It doesn't make sense.  We have not engaged in regular order. We have avoided a thoughtful, deliberative process, and, unfortunately, the resolutions before us are yet another example of that. These resolutions undermine the basic responsibility of the Department of Education and the Bureau of Land They are a shortsighted strategy for governing that will have long-term negative consequences for our public lands and our use thereof, as well as for children in our schools and educators.  We should fix accountability and make it work in education rather than throw it out. We should make sure that our teacher training programs and those whom we support with your taxpayer money are the best possible teacher training programs; and, of course, we should have a multistakeholder process around use of our public lands, including recreationists, residents, county commissioners, and others.  For that reason, I strongly oppose the rules before us. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

These accusations should be taken literally and seriously.  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have seen absolutely no evidence that supports the President's claims. President Trump and the Department of Justice have a responsibility to completely clarify the President's statement on  If the White House and Department of Justice are unable to produce this evidence, as I suspect will be the case, the President owes the American people a thorough and immediate explanation and apology.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2090-9.txt,1967,ELKHORN RANCH AND WHITE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST CONVEYANCE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,16.0,March
14640,topic-id,428,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing, along with Senator Grassley, the Government Settlement Transparency and Reform This bill closes a loophole in the Tax Code that allows corporations to claim tax writeoffs for payments made at the direction of the government to settle investigations into illegal and abusive corporate behavior.  Corporations accused of illegal activity routinely settle out of court with government agencies because it allows all parties to avoid the time, expense, and uncertainty of going to trial. While there is nothing wrong with settlements that correct wrongful corporate practices and compensate for the resulting harm caused by a corporation, the Tax Code often permits offending companies to claim a business tax deduction for any portion of a settlement that is not paid directly to the government as a penalty or fine for a violation of the law. The Tax Code on this point is vague, and big businesses exploit this by characterizing settlement penalties as tax-deductible business expenses.  Illegal corporate behavior is not an ordinary business activity, and it shouldn't be subsidized by taxpayers. Yet, according to a 2015 study by U.Public Interest Research Group, PIRG, corporate settlements over a single 3-year period totaled nearly $80 billion, and corporations could claim business deductions for at least $48 billion of that amount. Moreover, there is no consistent, transparent way to track how these settlements can and will be treated by businesses for tax purposes.  The Reed-Grassley bill addresses these problems by amending the Tax[[Page S2177]]Code to require the government and the settling party to reach clear agreements on how settlement payments should be treated for tax purposes. It also clarifies which settlement payments are punitive and therefore nondeductible. It increases transparency by requiring the government to file a return at the time of settlement that accurately states the tax treatment of amounts to be paid by offending businesses. Last Congress, it was estimated that this legislation would raise $218 million in revenue over a ten-year budget window.  When a major corporate scandal breaks national news, Rhode Islanders and all Americans deserve to know that Federal regulators are protecting their interests by handing down punishments that deter future illegal and abusive business practices. That deterrent effect is undermined if corporations can claim a deduction for any penalty and build the cost of breaking the law into their business models.  I want to thank Senator Grassley for working with me again on this legislation and for being a champion for reform in this area. I urge our colleagues to join us by cosponsoring this legislation and seeking its passage.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgS2176.txt,1982,ELKHORN RANCH AND WHITE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST CONVEYANCE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,3.0,March

I was glad to support the bill. In fact, the director of our own scandal-ridden central Alabama VA became the first fired under the new law.  But, Mr.Speaker, we all know that law did not go far enough. Responsibility for failures at the VA doesn't just lie with senior managers. We need to provide the VA Secretary increased authority to swiftly remove, demote, or suspend any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct.

Providing for the common defense of our Nation is one of the most fundamental duties of Congress under the  Last week I appreciated the message that President Trump delivered in his joint session address, and I was particularly encouraged by his call to properly fund our military. For the last 6 years, we have been in almost constant tension with an administration whose sequestration policy threatened to hollow out our military.  Mr.Speaker, as a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I stand ready to work with the President and Secretary Mattis to make sure our military is properly funded, well equipped, and ready for the fight. That is why I am so proud to support this Defense Appropriations bill.  Our bill rejects the Obama administration's proposed troop level reductions that would have amounted to as many as 36,000 servicemen and -women cut from the ranks. Instead, our bill provides funding for an additional 1,000 Active-Duty Army soldiers, 1,000 Army National Guard soldiers, 1,000 Army Reserve soldiers, and 1,000 Active-Duty marines. The bill also fully funds a much-deserved 2.1 percent pay raise for military personnel.

While our men and women[[Page H1938]]in uniform fought asymmetric foes, our near-peer adversaries such as Russia and China made advancements in technology that threaten to degrade our military qualitative advantage.  This appropriations bill ensures our troops are ready and that we have enough of them to get the job done. It fully funds the new end strength number and allows for a 2.1 percent pay raise for our troops. This is the least we can do for the brave men and women who sacrifice for our country.  This bill also deters Russian aggression by fully funding the European Reassurance Initiative, and makes critical investments in missile defense technology.  This bill is a solid start, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it, but there is still work to be done. Our troops should trust that elected officials will support them and do their job to fund the government, just as we trust them to accomplish the mission assigned to them. Band-Aid budgets are bad for everyone--our partners in industry, the American taxpayers, and especially our Armed  Now is not the time to argue over partisan issues.

14574,topic-id,277,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1181.  The epidemic--actually, rather the tragedy--of veterans' suicide has affected families across the country, including my own. I recall walking home after school at the age of 10 or 11 in the month of November--as you know, Veterans Day is in the month of November--and hearing the news that my uncle, who lived across the street from us, had taken his own life with a firearm. He was a Vietnam veteran, and his memory serves as a personal reminder about the tragedy of veterans' suicide. To this day, it continues to plague our communities with our recent conflicts in Iraq and  Of the 20 veterans who die from suicide every day, two-thirds of those occur by firearm. Part of stopping this crisis is keeping guns out of the hands of our most vulnerable veterans.

To be clear, there are veterans currently flagged in the background check system who should not be there, and we need to create a fair and streamlined process for veterans to appeal their status.  But there is a balance between protecting veterans' Second Amendment rights and protecting veterans who are a danger to themselves or others. Immediately removing restrictions on every individual does not strike the right balance.

Mr.Speaker, thank you for allowing me time to be able to discuss this important legislation. H.698 is a very straightforward bill, which Congressmen Lamborn and Polis and I have reintroduced this year that confirms private ownership of 148 acres of land in my congressional district.  The lands concerned were patented into private ownership via the United States land patents issued in 1914, 1917, and 1957, but their ownership came into question by virtue of a 1949 government[[Page H983]]survey which erroneously showed them to be National Forest land rather than private land. A long-held U.law specifically states that a government resurvey cannot take away private property or private property rights.  Mr.Speaker, the Forest Service and the private landowner of the Elkhorn Ranch only became aware of the potential title issue in the early 2000s, and thereafter, the Forest Service conducted a lengthy and thorough review of the matter. Upon completion of their review in 2014, both the supervisor and the surveyor of the White River National Forest concluded the ownership of the 148 acres should be confirmed in the successors in interest to the original patentee; namely, the Elkhorn  In reaching this conclusion, the Forest Service noted that the land has never been managed as National Forest land and, indeed, has been fenced and occupied with stock ponds, developed springs, roads and other private improvements, and has been used as private land for ranching and agriculture for the better part of the past 100 years.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is a simple matter of fairness and equity to a private landowner to honor government land patents that were granted by the Federal Government to the landowner's predecessors 60 to 100 years ago. The bill is supported by both the surveyor and supervisor of the White River National Forest; the Garfield County surveyor; the Garfield County Commissioner; the city of Rifle; Colorado Club 20, which represents 20 Colorado counties; and Piceance Energy, which has a lease on part of the area.                              {time}  1700  In addition, the legislative hearing that was held on the same bill in 2015, the administration testified that this bill is a practical and workable way to address this longstanding issue. This bill is identical to the one that passed out of the House by voice vote in the last Congress, and I once again urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Once again, I extend my thanks to my colleagues Congressman Lamborn and Congressman Polis for all of their hard work on this legislation.

14623,topic-id,778,"Mr.Speaker, today's Special Order is going to be about the theme: What do we have to lose?  That was something that you heard during the Presidential campaign. Specifically, we want to focus on what do we have to lose: $54 billion in domestic spending.  Earlier this month, President Trump released his budget named America First, a Budget Blueprint to Make America Great After reading Trump's budget, I can't help but wonder: Is this truly a mirror of his campaign to put Americans first?  The easy answer to that is ``no.''  According to the Trump budget, America comes dead last. In fact, this budget proposal is all talk when it comes to helping U.students access education and well-paying jobs. One of the most alarming things about the budget is how it affects the education of students at minority-serving institutions.  Mr.Speaker, HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, were first created in 1964 to educate Black Americans excluded from segregated public and private universities, and this budget will perpetuate the inequalities that currently exist for Black students.  Today, HBCUs continue to provide students--no matter their race or their economic background for that matter--the ability to receive a quality education. According to the United Negro College Fund, 70 percent of all HBCU students rely on Federal grants and workstudy programs to finance their education.  After Trump pledged to support and strengthen HBCUs during a meeting with the presidents of HBCUs in the Oval Office, the budget at hand is another unfulfilled promise. A recent letter from the president of the UNCF, United Negro College Fund, explained the complete elimination of the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, as proposed under the Trump budget. This would negatively impact more than 55,000 HBCU students.  Helping low-income students achieve higher education is very serious, and we know that these cuts would hurt. Proposed reductions would also hurt the Federal workstudy initiatives, and it would eliminate another 26,000 students the ability to pay for college expenses or to improve their employment prospects.  I knew a lot of students who worked under the college workstudy program when I was a student in college, and I can tell you just how critical that program is. For a lot of kids, that is the difference between going to college and not being able to go to college. Having that job on campus allows you to earn money, but stay on campus, affording you more time to be able to study and do other things that you need to do in order to be a successful student.  Also, according to the Center for American Progress, the Trump budget will hit minority communities the hardest. The budget also calls for $200 million in cuts to Federal TRIO programs, which help low-income, first-generation, and disabled students; and GEAR UP, a program that helps prepare low-income middle and high school students for college.  It shouldn't be any surprise to us that President Trump would want to gut funding to help disabled students succeed. We saw this sort of nastiness on the campaign trail, and we really do need to see how we can, again, boost these programs because they have been helping so many kids for a long time.  I can tell you of someone who utilized a Pell Grant I am sure there are many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that had to use the Pell Grant Similarly, the Trump budget keeps the Pell Grant Program, but it cuts $3.9 billion in critical funding for many students.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the Pell Grant Program is the largest Federal grant program. The same study found that the program sends up to $5,900 to students and families that earn less than $40,000 a year and prioritizes funding for families earning closer to $20,000 or less.  Again, if you are a low-income family, being able to utilize that money, particularly at that level--$40,000 and below, $20,000 and below--even if you were doing a little bit better than that, you know that that is not a lot of money, and that is why these Pell Grant Programs are so important.  Pell Grant continues to be an important program that helps level the playing field for African Americans and helps to minimize student loans after graduation.  A study by Brookings reported that Black students who graduated, as of October 2016, owed over $52,000 in student loan debt, compared to White graduates who owed approximately $28,000. By reducing funding, Trump is limiting a child's ability to achieve economic mobility and move toward the American  I am going to ask that my colleague from the great sunshine State of Florida (",CREC-2017-03-27-pt1-PgH2456-5.txt,2166,CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,2017.0,27.0,January

14810,topic-id,1795,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin And I always enjoy hearing from the gentlewoman from the Chicago area, and I appreciate everything that she is doing as well.  It is interesting the President posed that question: What do you have to lose?  What he was referencing to was the African-American community. Instead of offering anything of substance, he just put out that very simple question.  I have got to tell you that it is pretty evident what we have to lose now. It is not only a lot of the gains that were made under the Obama Administration, but something that is near and dear to all of us, and that is health care.  I think about the district that I represent, and 40,000 people or more have actually been covered because of the Affordable Care They will probably lose that insurance if TrumpCare were to become law. And if you represent low-income families and workers out there, that is a scary prospect.  It is already bad enough that the State of Texas made probably what is considered one of the biggest policy blunders in Texas State legislative history when they decided not to expand Medicaid, which left so many others statewide, including in the district I represent, again, off of the insurance rolls.  What do you have to lose?  God, there are so many ways and so many areas that I can sort of describe what you would have to lose. The first thing I think about is, in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, if you lose your insurance, of course, that means that the burden is going to fall back on John Peter Smith Hospital, which is one of our county hospitals in the north Texas area, and Parkland Hospital in  So instead of people having insurance that they pay into, that they have where they can go and see a doctor, they will end up back in the county hospital rolls and, of course, that will end up costing the taxpayers more money.  During President Trump's first 50 days, the Republicans introduced this legislation that, again, will just decimate the progress that so many people around the country have seen under the Affordable Care  This Thursday, as we actually mark the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, the House is set to vote on the Republicans' healthcare replacement. Ironically, on a day that we should be celebrating the tremendous progress our country has made since this landmark law's passage, we will be defending the merits in our continued battle to fight its repeal.  So what does the Black community have to lose?  Again, we pose that question. The Congressional Budget Office--and there is a Republican appointee that runs that office, by the way--says that 24 million people are going to lose their healthcare insurance. Of those 24 million who are set to be kicked off of their healthcare plan and sent out to nowhere, African Americans are going to be hit the hardest.  The ACA boosted the African-American insured rate from 79 percent to 88 percent, just slightly below the 91 percent national figure. Some of those gains stem from Medicaid expansion under the ACA, where nearly 15 million of the nearly 40 million African Americans gained coverage.  That is what I was talking about a little bit earlier, Representative In Texas, we did not get to benefit from that. That would have been a huge benefit to us. Again, it is really considered one of the biggest policy blunders in the country.  As you see, Republican governors are actually afraid right now that the Medicaid expansion that has benefited their States that they are going to lose out on that because of this repeal that is going to take place. They are pushing back. They are saying this whole TrumpCare and RyanCare plan is a hot mess and that they absolutely want nothing to do with it.  It is also important to remember, under the Republican plan, the decision to cut $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years will translate into millions of African Americans potentially losing health care. While these numbers are alarming, it is the human impact that cannot be lost on GOP colleagues.[[Page H2229]]  I have heard directly from constituents that I serve how the ACA has improved or saved their lives, and I would like to actually share some of those stories with you today.  One of the constituents that I serve worked for the same company for 35 years but was forced to retire because of declining health before he was eligible for He faces drug costs of over $500 per day and requires a lifesaving procedure four times a year that costs $14,000 per treatment. You can imagine what $14,000 per treatment would do, and that is four times a year. Overall, his medical costs per month is $15,000.  With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, he had access to quality care that helped ease his financial burden. Under the Republican plan, this hardworking man, this taxpayer, this person that has worked hard, that worked for one company for 35 years--that used to mean so much in this country when people would give 35 years to one company and expected to be treated right--under the Republican plan, this hardworking man would pay thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket medical expenses for lifesaving care that would not be covered by this disastrous plan that we are actually going to have to take a vote on on  It is stories like that that I think are really sad and why we need to tap the brakes and see what we can do to help make the current healthcare plan that we have, the ACA, stronger and better, to help out people like this gentleman who are going to be left out in the cold.  You have to really be wondering what our Republican colleagues are thinking, because it is not just the constituents that I represent. It is many of the constituents that they represent, too. I can tell you that out in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, while I do represent largely urban areas--Dallas, Fort Worth, Irving, Grand Prairie, Arlington--I know that there are a lot of people that live out in these rural areas, that live outside of Dallas and Fort Worth, that live outside of Dallas County and Tarrant They consider themselves conservatives, and I can tell you that they cannot afford $14,000 per treatment; but if the Republicans pass their plan, that is what they are going to be left with and they are not going to be able to afford it. They are not going to get the care that they need, and that is what they need to understand tonight and that is what the Republicans need to understand tonight.  The only thing that they can guarantee individuals, like I just talked about, is that they are going to be paying a whole lot more for a lot less coverage. I think that is really a shame.  Another constituent was forced to pay $100 per month for medically necessary birth control pills after her husband lost his job in 2010. Luckily, the Affordable Care Act provided access to health care, and now her birth control that she needs is covered in full. And that is important, too.  We have actually seen teen pregnancy rates in this country drop all over the country, which is good. Because when people can afford to start a family when they are ready, when they are financially ready to start a family, those kids are more likely to do better in school. They are more likely to be in a stable household. They are more likely to get the education that they need to be able to achieve the things they want to achieve when they leave the house. So there are a lot of these initiatives around the country where we have really seen teen pregnancy rates drop 20, 30 percent or more. It has been great.  I can tell you that in Dallas County, while the teen pregnancy rate is dropping all over the country, we have actually seen it rise at an alarming rate.  So what does that tell me?  That tells me that if you see the teen pregnancy rate going up and that you are going to kick all these people off their health care, that is going to be more of a strain on the social service system.  Republicans used to pretend like they were for people to have an opportunity to get off the system. But once you take people's birth control away and not give them the options that they need for family planning, you are increasing the social services. The Republican CBO report actually points that out, and they are still going ahead with this. So I think that that is really what is sad.  I think overall what we want to get at tonight is that the Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for African Americans and African-American families. The full repeal will snatch the safety net out from under the Black community.  Despite the lies that our colleagues across the aisle and in the White House want to spread about the ACA, my colleagues and I will continue to defend it to the very end because it turns out that the Black community has a lot to lose under the Republican healthcare plan.  I am so glad that so many of our colleagues came out tonight. I am glad that you are here helping lead this hour because we need to get the word out. We can stop something really devastating from happening here. The thing about it is that we really need to try to stop something devastating from happening on a bipartisan basis, such as people losing their health care, getting left out in the cold, being kicked off of their health insurance; trying to figure out, if they have a preexisting condition, how they are going to afford being pushed back into a high-risk pool.  What is this going to do to so many Americans? We are here focusing on the African-American community tonight with the Congressional Black Caucus, but what is this going to do to all Americans?  It is going to hurt them. It is going to hurt their bottom line. It is going to hurt their families. It is going to leave them in financial disrepair. I think it is going to be a sad day for our country.  Instead of trying to destroy something, we need to be trying to work together to try to strengthen the current system and make sure that all Americans have the opportunity to be covered.

14814,topic-id,520,"Absolutely, Representative And one of our colleagues, who also happens to be my neighbor, Eddie Bernice Johnson, you can easily make the argument that she knows something about health care, considering that she worked in the healthcare arena before she came to And not only did she work in the healthcare arena, she has a lot of people that were uninsured that live in her district that are now insured because of the Affordable Care  So, again, not only does she have that healthcare experience, she has been out in the community and has met with people for many years now on health care, even before she came to the Congress, when she was in the State Senate; so she has sat down and she has talked to people. She understands why it is important for people to have health care. She understands why it can be financially hard on people when they are hit by a catastrophic illness.  She gave a speech on the House floor--or she has a speech that she is going to submit--where she talks about the fact that the district that she represents, the uninsured rate dropped 27.3, all the way down to 20.8 percent; and that was a huge benefit for the constituents that she serves on a daily basis.  I mentioned Parkland Hospital a little bit earlier. Parkland Hospital is a Dallas County public hospital. Parkland Hospital provided $1 billion in uncompensated care in 2015--$1 billion. And if this RyanCare-TrumpCare bill were to become law, you can imagine what a large system like Parkland, that already provides so much in uncompensated care, what they are going to be hit with. It is going to be absolutely devastating.  I already talked about the fact also that Texas--and Representative Johnson mentions Medicaid in her letter. I have already talked about the fact that Texas made a big public policy blunder and decided not to take the money that the Federal Government was going to give them to help expand Medicaid coverage. They just prefer to just leave all those people uninsured.  So now one of the things that will happen under this GOP bill that the Congresswoman points out is that the money will be sent to people in a block grant; and you can imagine the shortfalls that that would create, particularly in a large State like Texas, because there are going to be shortcomings. So hospital systems like Parkland, like John Peter Smith, they are really going to be hit with a hammer were this ever to pass and become law just because they are already being pushed so much.  Again, what just doesn't make any sense is that the Republicans so prided themselves for so many years about being the party that was about self-empowerment and helping people out, so[[Page H2231]]now they want to kick people off of their insurance and leave them out in the cold and have them start going back to Parkland, start going back to John Peter Smith because they are not going to be able to afford their insurance anymore under this. It doesn't make any sense.  ",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2226-3.txt,2166,ELKHORN RANCH AND WHITE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST CONVEYANCE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,20.0,March
14816,topic-id,1247,"All of those are absolutely good points, and I was talking about the uncompensated costs there for public hospitals. The one thing that I did not mention--and everybody knows this--is that if you don't have insurance and you do find yourself having to depend on the county hospital system or the public hospital system in your area, and those lines get longer and longer, which is what would happen if this bill were repealed--people have to remember that if someone is having an emergency and they know that the lines at the county hospital are just out of control and long, they are going to go to the private hospital.                              {time}  2015  They are going to go to the nonprofit hospital like in Dallas County that could be Baylor, that could be Huguley, and those hospitals are going to take on uncompensated costs. That is what is going to end up happening. They can't get a regular appointment there without insurance, but if they go to the hospital emergency room, they can't be turned away. Not only is it going to be a burden on our county hospital system, it is going to be a burden on our nonpublic providers as well.  Again, one thing to remember is that, before the Affordable Care Act, we had over 1 million people in Dallas-Fort Worth that did not have insurance. Just in the congressional district, alone, that I represent, I have the largest uninsured rate out of any congressional district in the entire country. That surprises a lot of people just because of the growth and the opportunities that the Dallas-Fort Worth area have been blessed with. But I actually have the largest uninsured rate out of any congressional Member in the country.  So when you think about the district that I represent and then you expand that across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, you are talking about 1 million people in a very prosperous area that still find themselves without insurance. That is scary.  I mentioned a little bit earlier the district I represent, the uninsured rate has gone from 37.9 percent to 31.4 percent since ACA was implemented; 2,003 individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers preventive services like cancer screenings and flu shots.  When you start talking about kidney dialysis, for instance, I visited a kidney dialysis center in Dallas County shortly after I was first sworn in. I was taking a tour of the kidney dialysis center, and I asked the doctor who was in charge of the center, I said: Wow, there are a lot of younger people in here.  About 60 percent of the patients were African About 40 percent were There was one White patient that was in there.  The lady said: It doesn't matter where you go. If you go to visit any of our clinics or any of our kidney dialysis centers, this is what a typical day looks like.  I asked her: Is it hereditary? What is going on? I don't understand what the problem is here.  She said: A lot of it is because they weren't receiving the care that they needed.  The sad part about that, she went on to explain to me, is sometimes it can be a person who has high blood pressure issues, and if they had just gotten those high blood pressure issues addressed, it could have been the difference between them taking some high blood pressure medicine instead of them basically having to give up their careers and go and sit in a chair to receive dialysis treatment 3, 4 days a week, 2 to 3 hours each time. That is sad.  She also talked about diabetes and how some people have diabetes, and they don't get that diabetes treated in time. Maybe they didn't even know they had diabetes. Again, type 2 diabetes is something very treatable. You can imagine the difference between treating somebody, giving them a prescription to treat their type 2 diabetes or their high blood pressure versus your earning capacity being greatly diminished by you having to go sit in a chair 2, 3, or more times 3 or 4 days a week versus if they had just been able to go see a primary care physician.  That is the type of thing that the Affordable Care Act is doing, giving people the opportunity to go and get those things treated before they become more costly to the system. That is something that is being missed.  The other thing that I think scares everybody--and it doesn't matter if you, again, live in my district or you live in the one of many districts in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, when you start talking about people who have preexisting conditions and you start talking about the fact that people are going to lose consumer protections that have been put in place under the Affordable Care Act and that they are going to see those consumer protections killed--like the prohibition on annual and lifetime limits, protection against unfair policy rescissions and coverage of preexisting conditions--again, if you see the ACA repealed, it is people like that who, for the first time, didn't have to worry about those limits, and they are going to see that snatched away from them. That is just really one of the tragedies.  Mr.Speaker, 27,000 people in the district that I represent, again, received financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016. Now they are going to risk being uninsured again, and the insurance is going to be unaffordable under the Republican plan. There are just so many stories like that.  One of the things that I didn't point out about some of the people that are going to lose some of these consumer protections is that some of those people have worked really hard on their jobs, they are still working on their jobs, and they are going to be hit with those lifetime limits. It is going to be completely unfair to them while they are out there working hard every day. It was something they didn't have to worry about before, or at least when the ACA was put in place. If the ACA is repealed, they are going to be subject to that, too.  I think the narrative that has been put out there by the Republicans is that, no, it is just people that are taking advantage of the system. But understand, there are people that fall into these categories that we are talking about right now that get up and they[[Page H2232]]go and work hard every day--every single day--and they have health insurance on their jobs, and they are going to be greatly impacted by this.  Speaking of people who go and work hard on their job every day, one of the things that I know that a lot of Democrats would like to see put in place--and even some Republicans have said they would like to see put in place--is they want to see the Cadillac tax repealed. That is not happening under this Republican plan. That is completely out of it.  So, again, there are a lot of problems with this and a lot of unfairness about this, about the people that are going to be harmed and affected. I hope that we can work in a bipartisan manner to really stop this from happening. And again, like we are here talking about tonight, the African-American community, in particular, will really be hit very, very hard.

14739,topic-id,569,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to begin by congratulating Chairman Frelinghuysen on bringing his first full bill to the House floor as chairman of the Appropriations I have greatly appreciated his friendship and steady leadership of the Defense  Further, I also thank our new subcommittee chairwoman, Kay She has been a great partner in completing the work on the fiscal year 2017 conference report, and I look forward to working with her as we proceed.  Finally, I thank the members of the subcommittee and our extraordinary staff for their wisdom and for their long hours that they have logged in putting this product together.  The chairman has well described H.1301. I would add that this bill includes strong positions countering Russian aggression, building partnership capacity, and supporting readiness. Because it is a product of bipartisan negotiation, this is a good bill, and I intend to support it.  Despite my support for this legislation, I am extremely troubled that we are still working on the fiscal year 2017 Defense bill 5 months and 8 days into the fiscal year.  For nearly 6 months, the Department of Defense has been operating under two separate continuing resolutions, which wastes the time of people's lives and leads to inefficiencies in spending. I would emphasize this is not the fault of the committee. All that has been absent is the lack of political will on behalf of the majority party.  Even more disconcerting is the fact that the Defense Appropriations Act is just one of 11 fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills that need to be completed by the end of next month. There is no excuse for them remaining unfinished. The investments made through these bills are vital to so many in our country, and they need equal attention from Congress and the administration.  It is imperative that we strive every day to prioritize keeping America safe and supporting our brave servicemembers, but we must also prioritize educating our workforce, making improvements in public health, in science, and in our economic and transportation infrastructure.  If we neglect these investments in our future and in the well-being and success of current families and future generations, then I am deeply concerned that we will not have a country worth defending.  Confounding a confused fiscal situation, there is a $30 billion supplemental request for fiscal year 2017 recently submitted to the Office of Management and Budget by the Department of Defense, which should make its way to Congress in the next few weeks. Additionally, as the administration modifies its fiscal year 2018 budget request, they are without a predictable base on which to build.  There is very little margin of error, given the few legislative days remaining before the continuing resolution expires on April 28. I, and I believe the chairman, do not view that date as another point for negotiation. It is an absolute deadline, and the value of this bill and every other appropriations bill diminishes the day they are not enacted.                              {time}  1545  In closing, I again appreciate the leadership and the management of this wonderful work by our chairman, Mr.Going forward, I will work hard with the chairman. I will work hard with Chairwoman Granger, with Ranking Member Lowey, and the other members of our full committee to return the appropriations process to its normal schedule.
