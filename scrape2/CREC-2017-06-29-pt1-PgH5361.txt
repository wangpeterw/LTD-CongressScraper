                    TRUMPCARE IS A DEVASTATING BILL

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as we go home to commemorate the birth 
of this Nation, to wish all well, we would hope we would be able to go 
home by feeling comfortable that the administration was taking care of 
the American people.
  We have come to find out that the EPA is reversing a decision of the 
Obama administration to allow a pesticide by the name of--trade name 
Lorsban, that is chlorophyll-based, to be utilized on fruits and 
vegetables.
  I understand the needs of farmers, but there are documented studies 
that indicate that it may have a significant impact on the brain 
function of little children as young as 7 years old.
  Where is the care of the Nation by this administration?
  And then, they are planning a healthcare bill that will see this 
young lady lose her healthcare.
  In my district, 89,000 people will lose their insurance when they cut 
$854 billion out of Medicaid; 16,000 will be children.
  Where will the hospitals survive if they are closed in rural and 
urban America, and where will the seniors be when their nursing home 
puts them out because the Medicaid that has been for working seniors 
but now retired in nursing homes who rely on Medicaid?
  The TrumpCare bill in the Senate is a devastating bill. We need to 
have an administration that takes care of the American people.
