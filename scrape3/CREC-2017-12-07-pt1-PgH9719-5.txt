                      PEARL HARBOR REMEMBRANCE DAY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, 76 years ago today, our 
Nation witnessed a devastating attack at a naval base in Pearl Harbor, 
Hawaii. That event hastened our entry into World War II.
  The surprise attack by the Japanese on the morning of December 7, 
1941, left 2,403 people dead. Among them were members of the U.S. Navy, 
Army, Marines, and also civilians. It was one of the deadliest attacks 
in American history. President Franklin D. Roosevelt described it as 
``a date which will live in infamy.''
  On this solemn day of commemoration, we remember and we reflect. 
Flags throughout our country are flown at halfstaff in honor of Pearl 
Harbor Remembrance Day.
  Mr. Speaker, let us remember and honor the lives of those brave 
Americans who perished on this day 76 years ago. As President Roosevelt 
said: ``No matter how long it will take us to overcome this 
premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might 
will win through to absolute victory.'' And we did.
  God bless all of our Pearl Harbor victims and survivors, and God 
bless the United States of America.
