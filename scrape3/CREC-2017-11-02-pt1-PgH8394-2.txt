                    REAL TAX REFORM FOR REAL PEOPLE

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have received hundreds of 
letters from constituents who are deeply worried about the proposed tax 
plan.
  One San Diegan told me that, without the State and local tax 
deduction, his family of seven faces a loss of over $40,000 in 
deductions.
  Another constituent told me that his family would lose $20,000 in 
take-home pay under this tax plan.
  Why on Earth would we do this to middle class families? Why would we 
cap the mortgage deductions middle class home buyers depend on to lower 
taxes for huge corporations?
  This plan is simply reckless and hurtful to the American people and 
our economic growth.
  Let's take a look at real tax reform for real people, not a plan that 
helps those who need it the least.
