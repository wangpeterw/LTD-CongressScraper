               SENATE MUST REJECT THE GRAHAM-CASSIDY BILL

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, once again, Senate Republicans are 
trying to pass a healthcare bill without serious hearings or a proper 
CBO score. But the process is not the only issue with this proposed 
legislation.
  The Graham-Cassidy bill would allow States to end critical consumer 
protections established in law by the Affordable Care Act. These 
protections ensure that patients with preexisting conditions can access 
affordable coverage and won't face lifetime caps that force families to 
choose between lifesaving care and bankruptcy.
  Regardless of whether you receive insurance through your employer or 
the individual market, this bill, the Graham-Cassidy bill, endangers 
access to quality, affordable health coverage for every American.

[[Page H7475]]

  Senators have proposed changes to this bill, but they cannot change 
the underlying fact that it would be unconscionable to rip healthcare 
away from more than 32 million Americans. I implore the Senate to 
reject this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to work in a 
bipartisan manner to reduce costs and expand coverage.
