            By Mr. LUETKEMEYER:
        H.R. 2133.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       The constitutional authority on which this bill rests is 
     the explicit power of Congress to regulate in commerce in and 
     among the states, as enumerate in Article 1, Section 8, 
     Clause 3, the Commerce Clause, of the United States 
     Constitution.
       Additionally, Article 1, Section 7, Clause 2 of the 
     Constitution allows for every bill passed by the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President to 
     be codified into law; and therefore implicitly allows 
     Congress to repeal any bill that has been passed by both 
     chambers and signed into law by the President.
