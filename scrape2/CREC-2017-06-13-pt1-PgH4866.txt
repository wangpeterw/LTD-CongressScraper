                          NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, June is National Dairy 
Month, and, personally, I can't think of a better way to start the 
summer.
  From calcium to potassium, dairy products, like milk, contain nine 
essential nutrients which may help to better manage your weight, reduce 
your risk for high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain cancers.
  Whether it is a protein to help build and repair the muscle tissue of 
active bodies or vitamin A to help maintain healthy skin, dairy 
products are a natural nutrient powerhouse. Those are just a few of the 
reasons that we should celebrate dairy not just in June, but all year 
long.
  National Dairy Month started out as National Milk Month in 1937 as a 
way to promote drinking milk. It was initially created to stabilize the 
dairy demand when production was at a surplus, but has now developed 
into an annual tradition that celebrates the contributions the dairy 
industry has made to the world.
  Proudly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is one of the largest milk-
producing States in the Nation, certainly the largest agriculture 
commodity in Pennsylvania. As vice chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee and chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I wish everyone a 
happy National Dairy Month.
