                        IMMIGRANT HERITAGE MONTH

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I am fortunate to represent the Dallas-Fort 
Worth metroplex, where a blend of cultures has shaped our community, 
from the food that we eat to the traditions that we celebrate. The 
north Texas area has benefited from immigrants that now call the 
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex home. In fact, over one-third of the 
district I serve was born outside of the United States.
  It is the rich diversity found in Texas and across the country that 
have helped make our country great. Immigrants bring their skills and 
cultures and a belief in the American Dream that benefits each and 
every one of us. They work alongside us, teach our children, worship in 
parishes, and contribute to the innovation that has kept America on the 
cutting edge for decades.
  In honor of Immigrant Heritage Month, I remind my colleagues of our

country's legacy as a nation of immigrants. I urge each of you to keep 
these ideas in mind as the month ends and as we promote policies that 
directly impact our immigrant communities.
