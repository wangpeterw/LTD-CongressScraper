minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Amy Wright, the 
cofounder of Bitty & Beau's Coffee Shop in Wilmington, North Carolina, 
on being named CNN Hero of the Year.
  When Amy and her husband, Ben, found out that 70 percent of adults 
living with disabilities do not have jobs, they opened the doors of 
Bitty & Beau's in January 2016 with the goal of providing these worthy 
individuals the opportunity to interact, contribute, grow, and succeed 
in the workplace.
  As those in Wilmington know, Bitty & Beau's is more than just a place 
to grab coffee. It is a warm, inclusive environment with exceptional 
customer service. Named after their two children who have Down 
syndrome, the coffee shop employs 40 exceptional individuals with 
disabilities.
  Congratulations to Amy on this very special honor. Her and Ben's 
contribution to our community and our fellow man is truly remarkable 
and an inspiration for us all.
