               MASS DEPORTATION WOULD DISRUPT OUR COUNTRY

  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, mass deportation of Temporary Protected 
Status recipients today would disrupt our country and theirs.
  More than 32,000 Salvadorans live in the District of Columbia metro 
area; and Salvadorans, at 200,000, are the largest group of TPS holders 
in the country today.
  TPS designation requires the Attorney General to find ``extraordinary 
and temporary conditions preventing returning to the state in safety.''
  The most recent influx of Salvadorans, one-third of them 
unaccompanied minors, shows that these conditions have been met for TPS 
holders and others. With the breakdown of civil society in Central 
America today, forced return of anyone now would be inhumane.
