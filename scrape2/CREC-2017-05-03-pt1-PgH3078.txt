                            HEALTHCARE SCAM

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, for the third time in 90 days, 
Republicans are trying to take away patient protections for Americans 
with preexisting medical conditions. Fifty percent of all Americans and 
86 percent of Americans ages 55 through 64 have preexisting conditions. 
There is a genetic influence in many people who have preexisting 
conditions, meaning that tens of millions of Americans are born into a 
predisposition for certain diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart 
disease.
  The Republican healthcare scam would obliterate protections for 
preexisting conditions. For example, if you have a dad with a kid who 
is stuck with childhood cancer, the dad could buy a policy, but that 
policy would not have to cover his kid's cancer treatments. That, Mr. 
Speaker, is a deliberate intent to deceive the American people.
