                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2017.
     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker: This is to notify you formally pursuant 
     to Rule VIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives 
     that I have been served with a third party subpoena for 
     documents, issued by the United States District Court for the 
     Eastern District of New York. The United States Attorney's 
     Office has explained that while my office is not involved in 
     this matter, it may possess documents that could assist the 
     investigation.
       After consultation with the Office of General Counsel, I 
     have determined that compliance with the subpoena is 
     consistent with the privileges and rights of the House.
           Sincerely,
                                                  Hakeem Jeffries,
                                               Member of Congress.

     

                          ____________________
