                   TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN SAM JOHNSON

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to a living 
legend: my friend and colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson.
  Recently, we had the opportunity to honor him by renaming the Texas 
Tech University Vietnam Archive as the Sam Johnson Vietnam Archive.
  Nobody in the United States Congress enjoys more esteem from his 
colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, than Sam Johnson.
  His legacy of service is awe-inspiring. Twenty-nine years in the 
United States Air Force, combat missions in Korea and Vietnam. Nearly 7 
years as a POW, roughly 3 of those years in solitary confinement.
  There are many forces in politics that pull us from pillar to post, 
and many interests that compete for our time and attention. There is 
one force that drives this man--it is his desire to fight for the 
future of this country. And there is only one interest, and that is 
only what is in the best interest of all Americans.
  I am grateful to Texas Tech for honoring Congressman Johnson's 
service and sacrifice, and I am proud of the example Sam has set for 
all of us who serve in the people's House.
