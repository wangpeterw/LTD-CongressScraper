                       WE STAND WITH THE DREAMers

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, since the President's decision last 
week to end the DACA program, DREAMers across the country have lived 
each day in fear. I have heard that fear from my constituents in 
Illinois, which hosts the fourth largest DACA population in the 
country.
  One of my constituents came to this country when he was 3. Now 23 
years old, he is a university student, works at the local senior 
center, and he helps out in his father's small business on the 
weekends.
  In his letter to me, he said: ``It is during these trying times that 
each one of us demonstrates who we are and what we truly stand for.'' I 
couldn't agree more. That is why I urge Speaker Ryan and my colleagues 
on both sides to pass the Dream Act.
  Passing the Dream Act will show our country's DREAMers that we stand 
with them and that we believe in their promise. It will also show who 
we are and what we truly stand for.
