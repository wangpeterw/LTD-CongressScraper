          ACT NOW ON A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO PROTECT DREAMERS

  (Mr. GRIJALVA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, given that each day that Congress delays 
action on the Dream Act, 122 people lose their DACA protected status--
since September 5, when Trump eliminated DACA, close to 16,000 young 
people have lost their protected status and face daily risk of 
deportation; given the fact that we have pleaded with Republican 
leadership on the urgency of finding a permanent legislative solution 
that will protect DREAMers; given the fact that the contradictions and 
confusion in the negotiations going on to craft a legislative fix 
continue to abound; and given the fact that this House has the 
opportunity to vote on a clean Dream Act, we must act now on a 
permanent solution that will protect DREAMers.
