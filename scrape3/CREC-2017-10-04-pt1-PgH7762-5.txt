                   RYAN-McCONNELL REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, middle class families should be the focus of 
tax relief, not billionaires, not the wealthiest Americans. 
Unfortunately, the Ryan-McConnell tax plan fails that basic test.
  Independent analysis shows that the Republican plan would actually 
raise taxes on many middle class families, giving billionaires, the top 
1 percent, the biggest breaks. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says 
that middle class families could actually pay an increase of $1,290 a 
year. Even worse, the families I represent would be asked to foot the 
bill for a big, massive giveaway to the rich.
  Under the Republican plan, the wealthiest families, 5,400 families 
that are the superwealthy in this country, would get a $270 billion 
break through the repeal of the estate tax--100 families in my home 
State of Michigan, the DeVos family, certainly the Trump family. This 
is not representative of the values of the American people.
  Just saying that the people at the top won't benefit doesn't make it 
true. Read the bill. Look at these analyses. This is a giveaway to the 
wealthiest Americans, and it is wrong.
