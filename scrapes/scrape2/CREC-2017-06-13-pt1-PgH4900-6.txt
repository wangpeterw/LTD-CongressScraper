                 EXPORT AMERICAN LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last week, Cheniere Energy, 
headquartered in Houston, Texas, delivered its first liquified natural 
gas shipment out of the Sabine Pass terminal to northern Europe, to the 
Netherlands, and to Poland. This follows shipments to southern Europe 
from earlier this year.
  Put simply, this is a tremendous game changer. Exporting LNG is not 
just an economic issue, it is a geopolitical security issue. These 
shipments help thwart Russian aggression and weaken Russia's 
stranglehold over Europe, and it is about time.
  Under Secretary Perry's leadership, the Energy Department is finally 
approving licenses for LNG terminals to ship LNG overseas.
  Our natural gas is cheaper and more abundant in supply than anywhere 
in the world. Harnessing our domestic energy resources and exporting 
some of it to our friends and to our allies around the world makes 
sense for our economy and for our national security.
  We should apply the Blue Bell ice cream philosophy to our domestic 
energy resources. It is: Use what we can and sell the rest.
  And that is just the way it is.
