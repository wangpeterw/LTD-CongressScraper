   ENCOURAGING JAMIE DUPREE AS HE BATTLES TONGUE PROTRUSION DYSTONIA

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about Jamie 
Dupree, who serves as the radio news director of the Washington Bureau 
of the Cox Media Group.
  I have had the privilege of knowing Jamie for more than two decades. 
With his professional coverage of both congressional and national 
politics, Jamie has become a trusted voice for radio listeners in 
Atlanta, as well as in my home State of Florida.
  However, in the summer of 2016, Jamie, a radio reporter, lost his 
voice to tongue protrusion dystonia, a neurological condition which can 
create severe speech, swallowing, and breathing difficulties. This is a 
rare condition, which has no known treatment, and it prevents Jamie's 
brain from connecting to his mouth and causes his throat to push his 
tongue out of his mouth when he attempts to speak, squeezing the sound 
out of his voice--a radio reporter.
  However, in spite of his severe health problems, Jamie has remained 
active through Twitter and his news blog. Mr. Speaker, Jamie Dupree is 
a perfect example of the positive role that devoted and professional 
journalists play in our free society, and I wish him and his family all 
of the best during this most difficult time.
  Thank you, Jamie. Godspeed.
