                               BURN PITS

  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, we need a hearing on burn pits immediately.
  Burn pits are used by our military at bases in Iraq and Afghanistan 
to eliminate tons of waste, including chemicals and plastics. They 
cause giant clouds of black smoke containing carcinogens.
  Thousands of our men and women in our military are exposed to these 
cancer-causing hazards. I know because my constituent and friend, 
Jennifer Kepner, a 39-year-old wife, mother, and Air Force veteran, 
died from pancreatic cancer 2 weeks ago. Her oncologist made the most 
probable link between her exposure to burn pits while serving in Iraq 
and her pancreatic cancer.
  Congress must act. Too many questions remain. Are burn pits still 
being used? What are the DOD and VA doing to help veterans who have 
been exposed?
  On behalf of Jenn and all concerned veterans, I, along with 
Republicans and Democrats, demand hearings in the Armed Services and VA 
Committees immediately to get answers.
