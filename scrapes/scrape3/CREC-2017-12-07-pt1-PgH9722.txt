                              GOP TAX CUTS

  (Miss RICE of New York asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
this deficit-exploding tax cut for the wealthy and big corporations.
  This bill will raise taxes on middle class families in my district on 
Long Island and add trillions to the deficit--and my Republican 
colleagues want to pay for it with cuts to education, healthcare, and 
Social Security.
  They seem to think that the biggest problem in America is that 
corporations and millionaires are struggling to pay their taxes, but 
that is not what I am hearing from my constituents.
  My constituents are asking: When will we take action to protect the 
DREAMers? When will we reauthorize CHIP? When will we take up the 
infrastructure bill that the President promised would be a priority?
  Instead of solving those real, urgent problems, Republicans spent the 
first 9 months of the year trying to take away people's healthcare and 
the next 3 on trying to cut taxes for corporations on the backs of the 
middle class.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues once again to reject this 
ridiculous trickle-down fantasy, stop the backdoor assaults on 
healthcare and Social Security, and work with us to solve real problems 
for the people we serve.
