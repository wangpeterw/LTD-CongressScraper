                          RUSSIAN TRANSPARENCY

  (Mr. MEADOWS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, as many of you know, we have had a Russian 
narrative that has been going on because of an infamous dossier. While 
there has been much reported on it, I can tell you that the 
Intelligence Committee has been fast at work, and Chairman Nunes has 
been doing outstanding work to get to the truth for the American 
people.
  Today, I had the opportunity to go into a confidential setting to 
make sure that what we can do is understand better what actually took 
place. I am here to tell all of America tonight that I am shocked to 
read exactly what has taken place. I would think that it would never 
happen in a country that loves freedom and democracy like this country.
  It is time that we become transparent in all of this. I am calling on 
our leadership to make this available so that all Americans can judge 
for themselves.
