                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Skyline Wesleyan Church, San Diego, 
California, offered the following prayer:
  Almighty Father, Alpha of life and the Omega to death. This Easter 
Monday we pray in the shadow of that old rugged cross, cast by the 
radiant glory emanating from His empty tomb, proclaiming confidently, 
``O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?'' Thanks 
be to God, who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord.
  Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always 
abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your governance is not 
vain in the Lord. As we walk crooked paths through perilous times, may 
that light from His empty tomb be a lamp unto our feet.
  Teach us to number our days, and apply our hearts unto wisdom. The 
fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and unless the Lord builds 
this House, our governance is naught and the King's speech vanity.
  Lord Jesus, build this House.
  Amen.
