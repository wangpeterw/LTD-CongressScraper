 RECOGNIZING HALEYVILLE, ALABAMA, AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE FIRST EVER 
                                911 CALL

  (Mr. ADERHOLT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my hometown and 
my home State of Haleyville, Alabama, as the birthplace of the first 
ever 911 phone call that was placed 50 years ago tomorrow, February 16, 
1968.
  This pioneering phone call remains a source of great pride in our 
city, in our State. The phone call was placed by Alabama's then-Speaker 
of the House, Rankin Fite; and my predecessor, Congressman Tom Bevill. 
The call was made on a bright red phone that has been showcased in our 
city hall for the last several years.
  I am proud to report to my colleagues this morning that this red 
phone, a piece of Haleyville history, will be temporarily showcased as 
a piece of American history at the Smithsonian. The current mayor of 
Haleyville, Ken Sunseri, has done an outstanding job in marking this 
anniversary for our town; and, by the way, his father-in-law, James 
Whitt, was the mayor at the time the phone call was made.
  I want to personally thank the mayor and so many others, including 
the National Emergency Number Association and all the 911 
organizations, for all their efforts to recognize this 50th anniversary 
of the world's first 911 call.
