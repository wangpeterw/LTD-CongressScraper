                      RECOGNIZING URBANDALE, IOWA

 Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the city of 
Urbandale, IA, which was founded 100 years ago.
  The city of Urbandale was incorporated on April 16, 1917. Early 
denizens worked primarily in local coal mines, many of which closed by 
the late 1940s. Urbandale was also a so-called street car suburb, where 
residents could commute to their jobs in the city--Des Moines--via a 
street car on the Urbandale Line until they were replaced by buses in 
the early 1950s. Over the years, the community saw homes go up, 
restaurants and business flourish, and people from all corners of the 
world pass through, from Presidential candidates to Pope John Paul II, 
who held mass at Living History Farms in 1979. Urbandale is one of 
those quintessential Iowa towns where you would want to raise a family. 
Though the community had only 298 residents in the 1920s, today over 
40,000 people call Urbandale home.
  I would like to congratulate the city of Urbandale on their 
centennial year, and I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join 
me in congratulating them and wishing them another prosperous 
century.
