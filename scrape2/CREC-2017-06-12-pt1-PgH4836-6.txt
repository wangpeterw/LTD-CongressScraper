                         SUPPORT THE STAPLE ACT

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, brilliant minds from around the world come 
to the United States to pursue advanced degrees. Unfortunately, for 
many of these individuals, after we train them, after we educate them, 
we force them to return to their home countries due to our outdated 
immigration policy. And then guess what? They compete with us. They 
compete with the American economy, and this makes no sense.
  That is why I am authoring the bipartisan Stopping Trained in America

Ph.D.'s from Leaving the Economy Act, the STAPLE Act, along with my 
colleague Congressman Quigley.
  The STAPLE Act exempts individuals born outside the United States 
from the limits of employment-based green cards and H-1B visas that are 
awarded annually if that individual has earned a Ph.D. from an American 
institution in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, or 
math.
  Mr. Speaker, by retaining the talent that has benefited from our 
education system, we can unleash even more economic and innovative 
opportunity here at home. Not only does the STAPLE Act help promote the 
American Dream for those from overseas, but it also brings the 
potential for new invention and ideas that benefit American families 
and jobs here at home.
