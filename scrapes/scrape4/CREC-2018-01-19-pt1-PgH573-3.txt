                            SAVE THIS NATION

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear to my colleagues 
and the American people why there is a major debate in the other body.
  This is not a shutdown campaign. What we need to understand is that 
this is not a shutdown for illegal immigration. I am offended by that 
terminology.
  The DREAMers have status. Their status was taken away by the 
President. What we are trying to do is ensure individuals who are in 
the United States, in the United States military, teaching, and 
committed to this Nation, have dignity.
  Relatives of my friends on the other side of the aisle may have come 
in undocumented or without status. Therefore, this is not about illegal 
immigration. It is about dignity and respect for people here in the 
United States.
  It is about my constituents who are suffering after Hurricane Harvey 
with no heat and their homes not being rehabilitated because we do not 
have disaster supplemental funding.
  It is about federally qualified health clinics, Mr. Speaker, that 
will be shut down because we have no funding--zero--in the CR so babies 
can go and get care.
  Finally, it is about the Department of Education, teachers, and our 
law enforcement, whom we have such respect for.
  This shutdown is not a campaign; it is a high calling to save this 
Nation. I stand with them.
