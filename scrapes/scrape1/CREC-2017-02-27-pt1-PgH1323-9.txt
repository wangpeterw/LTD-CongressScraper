                      REVIVE THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, President Trump has signed an 
executive order to revive the Canadian Keystone XL pipeline. If 
Keystone does not go through, it is not as if Americans will stop 
buying oil to meet our energy needs. No, we will just buy it from 
somewhere else. That includes countries like Saudi Arabia or corrupt 
Venezuela.
  It seems to me that we would rather see a stable country and neighbor 
like Canada get this contract than Venezuela or Middle Eastern 
countries.
  Keystone is also good for the United States. Keystone XL pipeline 
will bring thousands of jobs to my home State of Texas. This is where 
the pipeline ends at the refineries in southeast Texas.
  At peak capacity, the pipeline is expected to deliver 830,000 barrels 
a day to the Gulf Coast. That is as much fuel as we get from Saudi 
Arabia. At peak capacity, this will be better for the United States and 
energy independence.
  TransCanada has reapplied for this permit, and the State Department 
needs to approve it. Pipelines are the most economical and 
environmentally safe way to move fuel, and it is time we make this 
happen.
  And that is just the way it is.
