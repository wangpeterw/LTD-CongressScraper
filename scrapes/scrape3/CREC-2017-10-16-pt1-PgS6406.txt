                              S. Res. 292

       Whereas, in the late hours of Sunday, October 1, 2017, a 
     64-year-old man from Mesquite, Nevada, killed 58 individuals 
     and wounded more than 500 innocent individuals in a horrific 
     attack at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, 
     with more than 22,000 individuals in attendance;
       Whereas President Donald Trump called the attack an act of 
     pure evil and said that unity cannot be shattered by evil and 
     that the bonds between the people of the United States cannot 
     be broken by violence;
       Whereas the attack is the deadliest mass shooting in the 
     modern history of the United States;
       Whereas the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and 
     other law enforcement professionals within the city of Las 
     Vegas and Clark County, Nevada, including emergency response 
     teams from Henderson and North Las Vegas, the Nevada 
     Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of 
     Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
     Explosives, the Department of Justice, the Department of 
     Homeland Security, military service members and veterans, 
     ambulatory services, and other emergency and health care 
     professionals responded to the attack bravely, admirably, and 
     in a coordinated manner, saving many lives;
       Whereas doctors, nurses, paramedics, and other medical 
     professionals worked around the clock under harrowing 
     circumstances to provide life-saving care for hundreds of 
     victims;
       Whereas, during the attack, countless civilians selflessly 
     assisted victims and, following the attack--
       (1) hundreds of individuals stood in long lines to donate 
     blood for those who were injured in the attack; and
       (2) the people of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the 
     United States expressed overwhelming financial, physical, and 
     emotional support for the victims and the families of the 
     victims;
       Whereas local organizations, businesses, and caregivers 
     came together with Federal, State, and local government 
     agencies to support the victims and help the community heal; 
     and
       Whereas Nevada has a vibrant and renowned tourism economy 
     that will continue to thrive, attracting and welcoming 
     millions of visitors from across the United States and 
     internationally, and emergency management officials will 
     diligently dedicate local and Federal resources to boost 
     public safety and security in Las Vegas, Nevada: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) condemns the horrific attack at the Route 91 Harvest 
     festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 1, 2017, in which 
     58 innocent individuals were killed and more than 500 
     innocent individuals were injured;

     and offers heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to 
     the families, loved ones, and friends of the victims;

     pledges continued support for, those who were injured in the 
     attack;
       (4) offers compassion to those who attended the event, but 
     were not physically injured, and are dealing with symptoms of 
     post-traumatic stress or seeking grief counseling;
       (5) recognizes the spirit and resilience of the Las Vegas 
     and Nevada communities; and
       (6) applauds the dedication and bravery of local, State, 
     and Federal law enforcement and counterterrorism officials 
     and emergency medical and health care professionals for their 
     coordinated efforts in responding to the attack, securing the 
     community, and providing treatment.
