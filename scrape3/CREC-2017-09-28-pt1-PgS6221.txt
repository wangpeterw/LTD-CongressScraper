                          TRIBUTE TO BOB MILLS

  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Bob Mills as 
the 67th recipient of the Dayton Region's 2017 Citizen Legion of Honor 
Award from the President's Club. As founder of Synergy Building Systems 
and Mills Development, Bob Mills' leadership and vision for quality 
development in and around the I-75 and I-675 corridors has made a 
tremendous impact on the economic vitality of the region.
  More than a dozen corporate and not-for-profit boards have benefited 
from Bob Mills' leadership over the years, including Greene Memorial 
Hospital, the Air Force Museum, Wright State University Foundation, and 
the Dayton Development Coalition. He has been recognized for his 
generosity by the Dayton Regional STEM School, Beavercreek Chamber of 
Commerce, the American Cancer Society, the Leukemia Lymphoma Society, 
and as the recipient of the Mathile Community Award.
  Maybe most impressive, Bob Mills and his family created the Gala of 
Hope Foundation and have raised more than $6 million to fight cancer 
and improve cancer care in the Dayton region by providing grants and 
funding for patient care, families, caregivers, and research.
  Additionally, he and his family have worked tirelessly to support 
Dayton Children's new patient tower which supports local children's 
needs for important healthcare services.
  I would like to honor and congratulate Bob Mills for his many 
contributions to his community and our State.
