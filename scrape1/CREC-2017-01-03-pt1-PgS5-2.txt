                    WELCOMING MEMBERS OF THE SENATE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to welcome back familiar 
faces and express warm greetings to new Members.
  On the Republican side, that includes Senator Young of Indiana and 
Senator Kennedy of Louisiana.
  On the Democratic side, that includes Senator Duckworth of Illinois, 
Senator Cortez Masto of Nevada, Senator Hassan of New Hampshire, 
Senator Harris of California, and Senator Van Hollen of Maryland.
  To each of our incoming Senators, I hope you enjoy these ceremonies 
with your families and colleagues as you embark on your new Senate 
careers. The Senate has a lot of work ahead, but for now I would 
encourage each of our Members who have just been sworn in to take a 
moment to celebrate the rich tradition of this day.
  For those who served last Congress, you should be proud of what the 
Senate was able to accomplish on behalf of the American people. There 
is much more to do now, and I will have more to say on that tomorrow.
  We know the coming days are going to require hard work and 
cooperation from both sides, but if we work together, we will be able 
to continue a record of achievement for our constituents, for our 
States, and for our country.

                          ____________________
