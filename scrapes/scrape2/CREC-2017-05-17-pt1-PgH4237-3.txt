                      NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, this is National Infrastructure Week; yet, 
at the same time, our current President promised that, as soon as he 
took office, he was going to put forth a trillion-dollar infrastructure 
package. Where is that package? We haven't seen it.
  The economy is the number one thing we should all be focusing on. 
Everything else should fall into place after that. Yet this White House 
is too busy in turmoil to take care of the core business of this 
country.
  It is actually White House crisis week again. That is a sad comment, 
but it is the truth. Once again we hear about a President who is not 
respecting the fact that we have allies around the world who are there 
sharing information that should not be shared with the Russians, and 
yet, at the same time, this President chooses to violate that 
responsibility.
  The American people and economy are losing confidence in our 
President and our White House. They shouldn't be given these disturbing 
reports that come out almost every day. The actions are undermining our 
economy. It is undermining the confidence in our infrastructure, and it 
is undermining our confidence of the United States around the world.
