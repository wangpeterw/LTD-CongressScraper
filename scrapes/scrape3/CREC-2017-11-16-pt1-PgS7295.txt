                         TRIBUTE TO ROGER MEYER

 Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize Roger Meyer for 
all of his hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of 
South Dakota while working in my Washington, DC, office.
  Roger has devoted the majority of his career to public service, 
including working in Congress and at the Department of Energy. In 
addition, Roger spent time on detail at the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency as an adviser to the Small State and Rural Advocate.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Roger for his years in 
public service and wish him all the best in the years to come.
