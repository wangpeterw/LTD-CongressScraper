COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF U.S. CITIZENSHIP FOR THE PEOPLE 
                             OF PUERTO RICO

  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, a century ago today, a Federal 
law granted U.S. citizenship to individuals born in Puerto Rico. Island 
residents have made countless contributions to this country in times of 
peace and war, serving with exceptional valor in our Armed Forces. The 
bonds between Puerto Rico and Florida are unbreakable. The State is 
home to over 1 million Puerto Ricans, with most living in central 
Florida.
  Puerto Rico is going through difficult times, and I am determined to 
help the Island get back on its feet. The main reason Puerto Rico is 
struggling is because, as a territory, it is treated unequally under 
Federal law. I support equal treatment for Puerto Rico because I oppose 
second class citizenship.
  Ultimately, I believe Puerto Rico should discard its territory status 
and become a State or a sovereign nation. The choice lies with the 
people of Puerto Rico. However, my personal hope is that they will 
choose statehood so that they have full voting rights and full 
equality.
  Puerto Ricans have earned the right to become first class citizens of 
the Nation they have served with honor.
