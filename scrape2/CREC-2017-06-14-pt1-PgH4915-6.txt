                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Almighty God, on a day when violence has come to this assembly, we 
ask Your blessing on our brother Representative Steve Scalise, the two 
officers, and the staffer who have been shot. Bless the hands of those 
who tend to their injuries.
  We as Americans are blessed by a free and open society, with rights 
secured by law and the Constitution. But once again we are reminded 
that there is a vulnerability that comes with that openness.
  May we all be vigilant in being good citizens, neighbors, and 
defenders of our way of life at a time when so many challenges to our 
way of life and government seem under siege.
  We thank You for the men and women who respond to the crises that 
befall us, especially the Capitol Police, and all first responders. May 
their heroism and generosity of spirit be an inspiration to us all, and 
may they be assured of our appreciation of their service.
  And in this great silence, as we are gathered most dramatically as 
this assembly at the people's House, may Republicans and Democrats be 
mindful of the rare companionship they share, men and women who have 
taken very public responsibility for our country, that carries so many 
burdens and, today, the reminder, shared danger.
  May this day be characterized by kindness, goodwill, and compassion 
one to another.
  God, bless America, and may all that is done this day be for Your 
greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
