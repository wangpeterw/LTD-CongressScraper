    COMMEMORATING 20 YEARS OF THE GLUCK FELLOWS PROGRAMS OF THE ARTS

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 20 years of the 
Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts at the University of California, 
Riverside.
  Since 1996, the Max H. Gluck Foundation has supported undergraduate 
and graduate students as they bring innovative arts programming to 
schools, libraries, and community centers in my district.
  The Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts has provided students, 
families, and other community members with the opportunity to 
experience art, music, dance, theater, and art history through 
workshops and performances. Over the past 20 years, more than 300,000 
Inland Empire residents have benefited from this program.
  I congratulate UCR's Chancellor Kim Wilcox; Dean of Humanities, Arts 
and Social Sciences Milagros Pena; Gluck Fellows Director Erika 
Suderburg; and especially the Max H. Gluck Foundation and its chair, 
Dr. Jon Kaswick.
  I wish continued success to the Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts at 
the University of California, Riverside.
