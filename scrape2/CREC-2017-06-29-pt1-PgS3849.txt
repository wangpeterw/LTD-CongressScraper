         amended

                           Annex Item No vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The MK 54 Lightweight Torpedo (LWT) has been in service 
     in the U.S. Navy (USN) since 2004. The version offered in 
     this sale is the MK54 Mod 0 of the system. The purchaser 
     currently does not have this weapon system in its inventory. 
     The proposed sale consists 168 MK-54 Mod 0 LWT conversion 
     kits, containers, spare and repair parts, weapon system 
     support and integration, personnel training, training 
     equipment, test equipment, U.S. Government and contractor 
     engineering, technical and logistical support services and 
     other related elements of logistical support.
       a. Although the MK 54 Mod 0 LWT is considered state-of-the-
     art-technology, there is no Critical Program Information 
     associated with the MK 54 Mod 0 LWT hardware, technical 
     documentation or software. The highest classification of the 
     hardware to be exported is SECRET. The highest classification 
     of the technical manual that will be exported is 
     CONFIDENTIAL. The technical manual is required for operation 
     of the MK 54 Mod 0 LWT. The highest classification of the 
     software to be exported is SECRET.
       2. Loss of hardware, software, publications or other items 
     associated with the proposed sale to a technologically 
     advanced or competent adversary, poses the risk of the 
     destruction of the countermeasures or replication and/or 
     improvements to the adversary's Undersea Weapon Systems, 
     weakening U.S. defense capabilities.
       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the 
     information could be used to develop countermeasures which 
     might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in 
     development of a system with similar or advanced 
     capabilities.
       4. A determination has been made that the recipient country 
     can provide substantially the same degree of protection for 
     the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. 
     Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. 
     foreign policy and national security objectives in the Policy 
     justification.
       5. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     the government of Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative 
     Office (IECRO) in the United States.

                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

       Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) 
     in the United States--AN/SLO-32(V)3 Upgrade
       TECRO has requested a possible sale to upgrade the AN/SLQ-
     32(V)3 Electronic Warfare Systems in support of four
       (4) ex-KIDD Class (now KEELUNG Class) destroyers. This sale 
     will include AN/SLQ-32(V)3 upgrade hardware, software, 
     support equipment and parts, publications, training, 
     engineering and technical assistance. The total estimated 
     program cost is $80 million.
       This proposed sale is consistent with United States law and 
     policy, as expressed in Public Law 96-8.
       This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic and 
     security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing 
     efforts to

[[Page S3854]]

     modernize its armed forces and enhance its defensive 
     capabilities. The proposed sale will help improve the 
     security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political 
     stability, military balance and economic progress in the 
     region.
       The proposed sale will improve the recipient's capability 
     in current and future defensive efforts. The recipient will 
     use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional 
     threats and to strengthen homeland defense. The proposed sale 
     will improve operational readiness and enhance the electronic 
     warfare capability onboard the ex-KIDD Class destroyers. The 
     recipient will have no difficulty in absorbing this equipment 
     into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance 
     in the region.
       The prime contractor will be Raytheon Missiles Systems 
     Company of Tucson, Arizona. There are no known offset 
     agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.
       It is estimated that during implementation of this proposed 
     sale, a number of U.S. Government and contractor 
     representatives will be assigned to the recipient or travel 
     there intermittently during the program.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.


                         Transmittal No. 16-70

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b) (1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as 
         amended

                           Annex Item No vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. The AN/SLQ-32(V)3 is an electronic warfare system 
     providing shipboard identification and cataloguing of the 
     electronic signature of missiles and aircraft. The system 
     consists of sensors and computers which process electronic 
     signals within parameters established in a threat library. 
     The customer currently has an earlier version of this 
     equipment in inventory.
       a. The AN/SLQ-32(V)3 upgrade consists of hardware, 
     technical documentation, and software. The highest 
     classification of the hardware to be exported is SECRET. The 
     highest classification of software to be exported is SECRET.
       2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the 
     information could be used to develop countermeasures which 
     might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in 
     development of a system with similar or advanced 
     capabilities.
       3. A determination has been made that the recipient country 
     can provide substantially the same degree of protection for 
     the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. 
     Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. 
     foreign policy and national security objectives in the Policy 
     justification.
       4. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     the Government of Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative 
     Office (TECRO) in the United States.
