      ROBERT MUELLER AS SPECIAL COUNSEL IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, for 7\1/2\ years before coming 
to Congress, I was a judge in Tennessee trying felony criminal cases. I 
tried the attempted murder of James Earl Ray and many other high-
profile cases.
  Robert Mueller, with his close relationship with James Comey, should 
never have been appointed as special prosecutor in a case in which Mr. 
Comey is such a central player. Mr. Mueller should never have accepted 
such an appointment when offered. That would have been the honorable 
thing to do.
  Then, to make matters much worse, he has hired several lawyers who 
are big contributors to and are active campaigners for Hillary Clinton 
and other Democrats.
  Most people believe there are many conflicts of interest here. There 
are hundreds of thousands of lawyers who could have been hired who had 
not been involved in any way for either the President or Mrs. Clinton.
  This investigation has been tainted, and any action now will look 
like a partisan witch hunt. Former Speaker Gingrich said what we now 
need is a special counsel to investigate the special counsel.
