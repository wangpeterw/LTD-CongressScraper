                                 PRAYER

  Minister Jeremiah Tatum, Willow Avenue Church of Christ, Cookeville, 
Tennessee, offered the following prayer:
  Father in Heaven, we bow to You and praise You upon this, the 
beginning of spring. We are reminded that You are in control of all 
things, and it is by Your hand that they exist and were created.
  Look down in mercy, we beseech Thee, on these our American States. Be 
Thou present, O God of wisdom, and direct the councils of this 
honorable assembly; enable them to settle things on the best and surest 
foundation. Direct them according to the instructions of Your holy 
word.
  We humbly ask for Your care and patience. We request the revival of 
the spirit by which we were founded and have endured. We pray for Your 
guidance upon our President, his Cabinet, the Members of our Congress, 
and each and every person within our government. We pray for Your truth 
and love and peace to reign in our country and in our world.
  In Jesus' name, amen.
