           RESIGNATION AS CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following 
resignation as chairman of the Committee on the Budget:

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2018.
     Hon. Paul Ryan,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker, It has been my great honor to serve as 
     Chairman of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of 
     Representatives. I am proud that we completed our work when 
     the House passed the most conservative budget in two decades, 
     with $203 billion in cuts to mandatory spending and paved the 
     way for tax reform. While I do wish the Senate had adopted 
     our resolution, I believe that we have begun to change the 
     culture of excessive spending in Washington.
       With the FY18 Budget and tax reform complete, I am now 
     respectfully stepping down as Chair of the House Budget 
     Committee, effective Thursday, January 11, 2018.
       Last summer, I announced that I would run for Governor of 
     Tennessee in 2018. I had previously forestalled that decision 
     to devote myself to the duties of serving as Budget Committee 
     Chair in 2017--an opportunity that I did not foresee, but one 
     that I felt honored and committed to undertake to ensure this 
     House Republican majority passed a bold, conservative and 
     balanced budget.
       I would like to thank President Trump and Vice President 
     Pence for their support of our House budget and leading the 
     way on tax reform. It has been an honor working closely with 
     both of them this year. I am grateful to the people of the 
     Sixth District for giving me the privilege of fighting on 
     their behalf in Congress.
           Sincerely,
                                                      Diane Black,
                                               Member of Congress.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the resignation is 
accepted.
  There was no objection.
