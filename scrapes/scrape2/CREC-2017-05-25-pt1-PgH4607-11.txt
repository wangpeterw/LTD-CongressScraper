           By Mr. MASSIE:
       H.R. 2657.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       This act is justified by the Commerce Clause of the United 
     States Constitution which, by granting Congress the power to 
     regulate commerce among the several states, also allows 
     Congress to prevent or prohibit federal interference with 
     Americans' ability to slaughter and process meat. This act is 
     also justified by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the 
     Constitution, which recognize that rights and powers are 
     retained and reserved by the people and to the States.
