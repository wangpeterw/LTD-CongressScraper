                        IMPEACHMENT DISCUSSIONS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am always grateful to have this 
preeminent privilege of standing in the well of the Congress of the 
United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that three prominent Democrats 
have asked to meet with me to discuss impeachment.

                              {time}  1030

  Mr. Speaker, I will meet with them in my office, and here is what I 
will say:
  I will tell them that impeachment is not about Democrats. It is not 
about Republicans. I will tell them it is about democracy. It is about 
government of the people, by the people, for the people. I will tell 
them that it is about the Republic and that it is about what Franklin 
said: We have a Republic, if we can keep it.
  I will tell them that I refuse to sit on the sidelines while the 
world is considering one of the greatest issues of our time. I will 
tell them that I will continue to be a part of this great debate.
  I will tell them these words I have heard, but I do not know the 
origin of. I will tell them that if a man does not keep pace with his 
companions, perhaps he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the 
music he hears, however measured, however far away.
  Mr. Speaker, I will tell them that tomorrow we will bring Articles of 
Impeachment to the floor of the Congress of the United States of 
America for a vote.
