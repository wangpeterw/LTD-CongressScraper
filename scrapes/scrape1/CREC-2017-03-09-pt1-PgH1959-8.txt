                      AMERICANS HURT BY OBAMACARE

  (Mr. GIBBS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about Melanie, a 
constituent from Ohio's Seventh Congressional District.

[[Page H1960]]

  Melanie and her husband are near retirement. Before ObamaCare, their 
monthly health insurance premiums were around $600. ObamaCare promised 
them reduced insurance premiums and increased access to care.
  But this promise to Melanie, like it was to millions of Americans, 
was broken. Melanie's premium skyrocketed to nearly $1,000 a month for 
a plan with a $5,000 deductible. Her monthly premium is now more than 
their mortgage.
  When her husband was laid off, their options were limited: continuing 
coverage through COBRA or entering the ObamaCare marketplace. The 
ObamaCare plans were even more expensive. While Melanie's husband was 
looking for work, they depleted their savings trying to maintain health 
insurance.
  Melanie is one of millions of Americans who have been hurt by 
ObamaCare. It has raised Melanie's premiums and deductible, and when 
she needed an affordable option in an emergency, it wasn't there.
  ObamaCare is collapsing. It is time to repeal it and provide relief 
to the millions of Americans suffering because of it.
