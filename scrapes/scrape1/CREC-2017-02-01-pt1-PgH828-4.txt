                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We thank You that we are a nation fashioned out of diverse peoples 
and cultures, brought forth on this continent in a way not unlike the 
ancient people of Israel. As out of a desert, You led our American 
ancestors to this promised land where they declared their independence 
and constituted a new nation founded upon unalienable rights given to 
us by You, our Creator.
  Bless our Nation with wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, and bless 
the Members of this people's House. Renew in us the adoption by Your 
Spirit that we may affirm our freedoms, not only with the conviction in 
the way we understand others, but in ourselves by actions proven beyond 
words.
  Bless us this day and every day. May all that is done here this day 
be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
