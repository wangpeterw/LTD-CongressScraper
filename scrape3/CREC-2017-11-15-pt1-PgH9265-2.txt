                            ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong 
opposition to the Republican tax bill.
  Mr. Speaker, how much can the American people take? How many 
alternative facts will we ask them to believe? How many broken promises 
will we ask them to overlook?
  The proposed tax bill is camouflaged as a tax break for the middle 
class, but you and I both know the only permanent tax breaks are for 
the richest people and corporations in America. As a matter of fact, 
over 36 million families will see a tax increase.
  Now, there is a new flimflam on the table. Mr. Speaker, you are well 
aware that Republicans have voted over 50 times to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act. All attempts failed. But now a repeal of the 
mandate that all Americans have healthcare has mysteriously been added 
to the tax bill. Is it possible that tax reform is just a ruse to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act?
  Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, I believe the American people are 
paying attention, and I believe the American people will hold those 
accountable who vote against them.
