                         NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the new market tax credits have 
helped inject new economic viability into my western New York 
community. The program continues to help revitalize economically 
distressed cities throughout America; in western New York, more than 
$300 million in private investment in the past decade that would not 
have occurred without the tax credit program.
  Historically and architecturally significant buildings like the 
Electric Tower and Asbury Hall in downtown Buffalo are buzzing with new 
residential and commercial life. Most recently, Roswell Park Cancer 
Institute, the Nation's first cancer center, opened their new clinical 
sciences building with the help of the new market tax credit program.
  I urge my colleagues to support my legislation to make the new market 
tax credits permanent.
