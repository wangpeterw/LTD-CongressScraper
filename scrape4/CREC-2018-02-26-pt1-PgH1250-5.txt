 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 

     I am strong, and I am blessed because the strength of the 
           animal beneath me multiplies my own strength, so I am 
           able to stand and support my family and friends.
     I am joyful, and I am blessed because the gentle wind that 
           rushes by my face as I rid with abandon spreads my 
           smile and my joy far and wide.
     I am loyal, and I am blessed because the loyalty of a horse 
           transcends words, embraces my soul, and flows out to 
           encompass everything in my world.
     I am filled with love, and I am blessed because the trusting 
           love between human and horse is a love that radiates 
           from my heart and settles protectively on those who 
           join me in my journey.
     I am a cowgirl, and the blessings of partnering with a horse 
           are reflected in the strength, the joy, the loyalty, 
           and the love that I am able to share with everyone 
           whose path crosses mine.
     I am blessed to be a cowgirl.
