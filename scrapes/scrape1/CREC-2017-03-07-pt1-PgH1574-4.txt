       HOUSE REPUBLICANS' BILL TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, it took 7 years, but it is finally here: the 
House Republican plan to make America sick again.
  Under this plan, millions of Americans will lose their health 
insurance, and millions of other families will pay more for worse 
coverage. At the same time, the Republicans' bill rolls back Medicaid 
expansion and allows insurers to charge older enrollees more.
  We always knew that the House Republican plan would harm the most 
vulnerable Americans, but we still do not know how much this bill will 
cost and how many Americans it will cover.
  Now, House Republicans prefer it this way. They know that their bill 
will cover far fewer people than the Affordable Care Act does. They 
want to hide this fact from the American people and rush this bill 
through committee.
  Mr. Speaker, this is an obvious and embarrassing display of cowardice 
from the House Republicans. The American people deserve to know the 
consequences of this bill just as they deserve quality and affordable 
access to health care. With the Republican plan, it looks like the 
American people will get neither.
