SENATE RESOLUTION 113--RECOGNIZING AND CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE CENTER ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND DISABILITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
                   WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON

  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 113

       Whereas the Center on Human Development and Disability 
     (referred to in this preamble as ``CHDD'') is one of the 
     largest and most comprehensive interdisciplinary centers in 
     the United States that focuses on improving the lives of 
     individuals with developmental disabilities;
       Whereas, each year, hundreds of University of Washington 
     faculty, staff, and students contribute to the lives of 
     people with developmental disabilities and their families by 
     providing--
       (1) model clinical services;
       (2) basic and translational research;
       (3) interdisciplinary clinical and research training; and
       (4) technical assistance and outreach to community 
     practitioners and agencies;
       Whereas CHDD is a recognized University Center for 
     Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, a national network 
     authorized under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance 
     and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15001 et seq.);
       Whereas, as a member of the network of 67 University 
     Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities located 
     in every State and territory, CHDD provides services to 
     individuals with developmental disabilities and their 
     families in 11 different CHDD-based clinics at the University 
     of Washington;
       Whereas CHDD scientists and clinicians conduct research to 
     generate knowledge and disseminate information to improve the 
     lives of individuals with developmental disabilities through 
     the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental 
     Disabilities Research Center;
       Whereas CHDD dynamically prepares graduate students and 
     community professionals in health, education, behavioral, and 
     other related fields to develop greater knowledge and skills 
     to meet the unique needs of individuals with developmental 
     disabilities and their families;
       Whereas CHDD partners with premier national and State 
     disability organizations and resources, such as the 
     Washington State Developmental Disabilities Council and 
     Disability Rights Washington, to improve the lives of 
     individuals with developmental disabilities and their 
     families; and
       Whereas CHDD promotes the quality of life of individuals 
     with developmental disabilities by improving--
       (1) community access, support, and inclusion in education, 
     housing options, continuing education opportunities, 
     employment, quality health care, and wellness programs; and
       (2) opportunities to build and grow friendships: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes and celebrates the history and contributions 
     of the Center on Human Development and Disability at the 
     University of Washington in Seattle, Washington; and
       (2) commends the Center on Human Development and Disability 
     for--
       (A) creating more welcoming and supportive communities; and
       (B) improving the lives of individuals with disabilities 
     and their families.
