               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF 1ST INFANTRY DIVISION

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th 
anniversary of the Army's 1st Infantry Division, or the ``Big Red 
One.''
  From their heroic start, the 1st Infantry Division has played a vital 
role in our Nation's history, serving in almost every American war 
since 1917. Today, the Big Red One has over 5,000 soldiers deployed 
worldwide, with an additional 10,000 in my district at Fort Riley. They 
are preparing to deploy in support of ongoing operations.
  Since 1917, more than 13,000 soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division 
have paid the ultimate sacrifice. We honor those who have worn the 
patch of the Big Red One and those that do so today. I cannot be more 
proud of our troops at Fort Riley. I am honored to represent them. I 
thank them all for their service.
