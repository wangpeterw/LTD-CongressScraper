                   REMEMBERING SERGEANT DUSTIN WRIGHT

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a Toombs 
County native. Twenty-nine-year-old Staff Sergeant Dustin Michael 
Wright was one of the three U.S. Army Green Beret soldiers killed in 
the line of duty last week.
  The U.S. Africa Command says Dustin was part of a team assisting in 
advising local forces in southwest Niger at the time of the ambush.
  A 2007 graduate from Toombs County High School, Dustin joined the 
Army soon after graduation, following in the footsteps of his parents 
and his brother. His family remembers him as a beloved jokester and was 
always making people laugh. He took great pride in serving the country, 
and I am so proud to see the Toombs County community coming together to 
paint the town red, white, and blue in honor of Dustin's life. Dustin 
was truly a hometown hero, and Toombs County will remember him often.
  As Jesus said: ``Greater love has no one than this, to lay down one's 
life for his friends.''
  Dustin sacrificed his life for his brothers and sisters in service to 
this great country. I will never forget our freedom fighter from Toombs 
County.
