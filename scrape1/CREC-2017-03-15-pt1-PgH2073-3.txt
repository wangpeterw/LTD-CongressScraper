          HONORING TRINITY UNITED METHODIST ON ITS 200TH YEAR

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this year, the Trinity 
United Methodist Church in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, marks its 200th 
year as a house of worship.
  Founded in April of 1817, the church congregation began with just 
seven people. Schoolmaster and Methodist layman James McGee led the 
first meeting. Over the years, Trinity's congregation has steadily 
grown, and today it boasts 200 members. The current church was built in 
1875, and in 1962, an educational building was added on.
  The church plays an important role in the Bellefonte community and it 
organizes several programs throughout the year, including a free 
community lunch, a New Year's Day dinner, free public concerts, and a 
toy drive before Christmas for children in need.
  Mr. Speaker, for the last 200 years, Trinity United Methodist Church 
has opened its doors for people to hear the Word of the Lord, but a 
church is much more than a building. It brings a love of God into the 
community and into the hearts of those who fill the seats each Sunday.
  God bless Trinity United Methodist Church on the momentous occasion 
of its bicentennial.
