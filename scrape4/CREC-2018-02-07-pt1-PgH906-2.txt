  RECOGNIZING SCHOOL COUNSELOR DANA ZAPANTA AND DESIGNATING THIS WEEK 
                    NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK

  (Ms. SANCHEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SANCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the tireless work of 
school counselors across the country and in the 38th District of 
California, whom I am honored to represent. These public servants guide 
students through academic, social, and personal development.
  Dana Zapanta, a counselor at Artesia High School in my district, is 
exactly the type of champion that students need. Dana, a 12-year 
counseling veteran, has been instrumental in the development of 
Artesia's Career Technical Education program. She also coordinates 
numerous events, including AP Student Night and college fairs. Thanks 
in part to her unwavering commitment to students, the graduation rate 
is nearly 99 percent.
  Despite the important contributions counselors like Dana make every 
day, counseling positions are not always protected when local budgets 
are cut. The average student-to-counselor ratio in our Nation's public 
schools is almost double the ratio recommended by the American School 
Counselor Association.
  Students deserve to have the support of school counselors like Dana. 
That is why I am proud to introduce a resolution to designate this week 
as National School Counseling Week. I urge my colleagues to join me in 
honoring these selfless professionals.
