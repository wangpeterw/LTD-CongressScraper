      CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF GIVING BY FRIENDS OF ST. JUDE--MIAMI

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10th 
anniversary of the founding of Friends of St. Jude--Miami.
  St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, located in Memphis, Tennessee, 
is a leading institution in the fight against pediatric cancer and 
other diseases that harm children.
  Friends of St. Jude--Miami is made up of young professionals in south 
Florida, who, like my dear friend Wendy Grant, are dedicated to St. 
Jude's lifesaving mission and who have continued to help the 
organization to ensure that no family ever receives a bill for the 
world-class care their son or daughter requires.
  To Wendy and, indeed, all of the members of the Friends of St. Jude 
in south Florida, thank you for the difference you continue to make in 
the lives of children across our Nation and across the world.
