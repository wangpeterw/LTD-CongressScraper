          REMEMBERING PAUL GLAAB OF ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

  (Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory 
of Paul Glaab who passed away on January 26.
  Paul's career in public service began in the 1980s when he worked for 
the Republican caucus in the California State assembly on business, 
transportation, and housing issues. He continued to serve two 
California Governors in the State's Division of Codes and Standards and 
the Department of Transportation. He then served on the board of the 
Orange County Transportation Authority and later as the board's chair. 
Notably, he served two terms as Laguna Niguel's mayor.
  Paul was a true public servant, and he will be missed by everyone in 
the Orange County community.
  Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Janice, his daughter 
Molly, and the rest of his family. We join them in their mourning and 
hope that they will find comfort in knowing that Paul's legacy of 
leadership will live on for years to come.
