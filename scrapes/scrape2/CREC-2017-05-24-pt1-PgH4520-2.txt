                      MEDIA TARGET PRESIDENT TRUMP

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, from a recent Investor's Business 
Daily editorial, a Harvard University study found that ``During the 
first 100 days of Trump's Presidency, TV networks CNN, NBC, and CBS 
provided negative coverage 93 percent, 93 percent, and 91 percent of 
the time.''
  Meanwhile, ``The New York Times delivered 87 percent negative 
coverage, while The Washington Post 83 percent and The Wall Street 
Journal 70 percent were only a bit less negative.''
  ``Trump's overall score of 80 percent negative coverage during the 
start of his Presidency compares with Obama's 41 percent, Bush's 57 
percent, and Bill Clinton's 60 percent.''
  ``Both the Post and the Times, for instance, have used unnamed 
sources and even the supposed content of documents that they have never 
viewed as the basis for major revelations about Trump in recent days. 
They have let their raw hatred get the better of them.
  ``Such a media environment is dangerous for American democracy.''
  Expecting basic professionalism from the media, sadly, seems to be 
too much.
