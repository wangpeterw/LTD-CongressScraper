                      REFLECTIONS ON MEMORIAL DAY

  (Mr. DesJARLAIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DesJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on what Memorial 
Day means to our country. Memorial Day truly is a special occasion in 
which we honor the brave men and women in uniform who made the ultimate 
sacrifice.
  Many from the Volunteer State died on the battlefield to defend our 
Nation. Because of them, and so many others from across our Nation, we 
enjoy our freedoms and many blessings. The debt we owe them is 
immeasurable.
  But we can honor their memory and make life easier for families of 
fallen heroes like Lance Corporal Andrew P. Carpenter, from Columbia, 
Tennessee, who died fighting in Afghanistan. Although his loan provider 
forgave his student loan debt, Andrew's family owed taxes on the 
discharged amount. I introduced the Tax Relief for Our Nation's Heroes 
Act to resolve this IRS oversight.
  Military families should have more peace of mind, which is part of my 
job on the House Armed Services Committee.
  I would like to thank all those who have worn the uniform of the U.S. 
military, and offer my prayers for the safety of thousands now serving 
in harm's way.
