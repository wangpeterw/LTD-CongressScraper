                        HONORING MS. SYBIL LYNN

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Sybil 
Lynn as she bids farewell to 12 years of service and dedication to the 
Jekyll Island Authority Board of Directors.
  Ms. Lynn was appointed to the board by Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue 
in 2005. Since that time, she has played a vital role in assisting with 
the island's revitalization, including construction of the Jekyll 
Island Convention Center, the new Beach Village, and renovation of 
island hotels.
  A testament to her dedication to the betterment of coastal Georgia is 
that she only missed two meetings during her 12 years of membership on 
the Jekyll Island Authority Board of Directors.
  Ms. Lynn has fed citizens of Wayne and surrounding counties, as well 
as citizens from all over the United States, for 40 years at Sybil's 
Family Restaurant in Jesup.
  Ms. Lynn's insight, service, and commitment will be truly missed by 
the Jekyll Island Authority Board of Directors.
