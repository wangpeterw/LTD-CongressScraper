                    AUTHORIZING THE E-VERIFY SYSTEM

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of permanently 
authorizing the E-Verify system and requiring U.S. employers to use the 
system to ensure their employees are eligible to be working in the 
United States.
  I am proud to be a partner with United States Senator Grassley of 
Iowa in offering legislation to do so, entitled ``The Accountability 
Through Electronic Verification Act.''
  E-Verify is a proven system for making sure job opportunities are for 
American workers. E-Verify is a deterrent against illegal immigration. 
Expanding it to new workplaces will make sure legal American workers 
are not shut out of employment.
  There are 700,000 American businesses that successfully use the E-
Verify system. There is no cost for the employer or employee to use E-
Verify, and our legislation will make sure that there are no costs 
passed onto businesses, their employees, or to customers.
  We should be considering practical solutions that remove incentives 
for illegal migration into the United States. We need E-Verify up and 
running, and we need all employers to participate to make it effective.
  I urge cosponsorship and collaborations from both sides of the aisle 
to implement this effective policy.
