              SUPPORTING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION

  (Ms. ESTY of Connecticut asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, for weeks we have heard that 
the partisan tax plan crafted behind closed doors might include the 
elimination of the deduction for families' State and local income 
taxes. Today the rumors became reality. The tax plan announced today 
would drastically reduce the State and local tax deduction.
  Let me be as clear as I can be. This proposal is a tax increase on 
middle class families, and I oppose it. Working people in my State 
already send more dollars to the Federal Government in taxes than they 
receive back in support. For every dollar we send to Washington from 
Connecticut, we receive back just 83 cents. By attacking the State and 
local deduction, this tax plan would make life even harder for real 
people in my district.
  A senior citizen in Simsbury, Connecticut, called me to say that she 
might lose her home if this tax deduction is taken away from her. 
Seniors who live on a fixed income shouldn't have to risk losing a roof 
over their head just so that Congress can cut the corporate tax rate.
  Families who are already struggling to pay their bills, put their 
kids through college, and buy their first home shouldn't have to suffer 
in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans.
  The President promised that tax reform would help our middle class 
and would bring jobs back. It is doing neither.
  I urge my colleagues to support keeping the State and local 
deduction.
