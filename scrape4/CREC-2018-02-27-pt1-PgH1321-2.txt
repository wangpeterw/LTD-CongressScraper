              BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS TO REVISE FISA PROCESS

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, in the United States of America, cash at a 
political party should never be convertible to a warrant to spy on 
American citizens.
  Because I expect Republicans and Democrats will both be empowered at 
some point in the future, we should be looking for bipartisan solutions 
to revise the FISA process so that what happened to President Trump 
never happens to a future American President.
  I went looking for solutions, and I found that, in 2013, the 
gentleman from California, the ranking member of the Intelligence 
Committee, wanted to give the President of the United States the power 
to appoint FISA judges. He argued that then judges would be more 
ideologically diverse. They would come from different areas in the 
United States, and they would be subject to Senate confirmation.
  Today, I filed that legislation, and I would encourage the gentleman 
from California to join me as a cosponsor so that we could advance 
bipartisan legislation to improve the FISA process, because, Mr. 
Speaker, if it was good enough to give President Obama these powers, it 
is good enough to give President Trump these powers.
