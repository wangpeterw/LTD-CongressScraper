                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let's not make America sick 
again.
  I am deeply disappointed my Republican colleagues are moving forward 
with their plan to undo the historic progress we have made by expanding 
health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, repealing it and leaving 
millions of Americans with no coverage.
  While repeal and replace was an abstract talking point for years, it 
is clear that there is no plan for replacement, no plan. The new phrase 
``repeal and delay'' will, in effect, be repeal and chaos, with no plan 
in place.
  Repeal will have real-life, personal impact on 30 million Americans 
who will stand to lose their health insurance. The options for the 129 
million Americans with preexisting conditions who have newfound health 
security would disappear. We would be returning to a time of lifetime 
limits, annual caps for care, and consumers will be sold junk health 
plans at high costs.
  Not only will the newly insured suffer, repeal would destabilize the 
individual health insurance market and send the healthcare system into 
disarray. Let's don't make America sick again. Let's have no repeal 
without a replacement.
