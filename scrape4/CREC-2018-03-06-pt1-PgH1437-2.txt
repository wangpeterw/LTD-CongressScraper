  STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND 
    REVENUES FOR FY2018 AND THE 10-YEAR PERIOD FY2018 THROUGH FY2027

                                         House of Representatives,


                                      Committee on the Budget,

                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2018.
     Hon. Paul Ryan,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Speaker: To facilitate application of sections 302 
     and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, I am transmitting an 
     updated status report on the current levels of on-budget 
     spending and revenues for fiscal year 2018, and for the 10-
     year period of fiscal years 2018 through 2027. This status 
     report is current through February 23, 2018. The term 
     ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and 
     revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted 
     or awaiting the President's signature.
       Table 1 in the report compares the current levels of total 
     budget authority, outlays, and revenues to the overall 
     limits, as adjusted, contained in H. Con. Res. 71, as agreed 
     to on October 26, 2017, for fiscal year 2018, and for the 10-
     year period of fiscal years 2018 through 2027. This 
     comparison is needed to implement section 311(a) of the 
     Congressional Budget Act, which establishes a rule 
     enforceable with a point of order against measures that would 
     breach the budget resolution's aggregate levels. The table 
     does not show budget authority and outlays for years after 
     fiscal year 2018 because appropriations for those years have 
     not yet been completed.
       Table 2 compares the current levels of budget authority and 
     outlays for legislative action completed by each authorizing 
     committee with the limits contained in the Statement of 
     Committee Allocations of the Fiscal Year 2018 Concurrent 
     Resolution on the Budget, published in the Congressional 
     Record on November 2, 2017, for fiscal year 2018, and for the 
     10-year period of fiscal years 2018 through 2027. For fiscal 
     year 2018 and the 10-year period of fiscal years 2018 through 
     2027, ``legislative action'' refers to legislation enacted 
     after the adoption of the levels set forth in H. Con. Res. 71 
     and the Statement of Committee Allocations published in the 
     Congressional Record on November 2, 2017. This comparison is 
     needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget 
     Act, which creates a point of order against measures that 
     would breach the section 302(a) allocation of new budget 
     authority for the committee that reported the measure. It is 
     also needed to implement section 311(b), which exempts 
     committees that comply with their allocations from the point 
     of order under section 311(a).
       Table 3 compares the current status of discretionary 
     appropriations for fiscal year 2018 with the ``section 
     302(b)'' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and 
     outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is 
     needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget 
     Act because the point of order under that section equally 
     applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 
     302(b) suballocation. The table also provides supplementary 
     information on spending in excess of the base discretionary 
     spending limits allowed under section 251(b) of the Balanced 
     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.
       Table 4 compares the levels of changes in mandatory 
     programs (CHIMPs) contained in appropriations acts with the 
     permissible limits on CHIMPs as specified in section 5103 of 
     H. Con. Res. 71. The comparison is needed to enforce a rule 
     established in H. Con. Res. 71 against fiscal year 2018 
     appropriations measures containing CHIMPs that would breach 
     the permissible limits for fiscal year 2018.
       Table 5 displays the current level of advance 
     appropriations for fiscal year 2019 of accounts identified 
     for advance appropriations pursuant to the Statement 
     published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017. 
     These tables are needed to enforce a rule against 
     appropriations bills containing advance appropriations that 
     are: (i) not identified in the statement of the Chairman 
     published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017 and 
     (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations 
     to exceed the level specified in section 5104 of H. Con. Res. 
     71.
       In addition, a letter from the Congressional Budget Office 
     is attached that summarizes and compares the budget impact of 
     legislation enacted after the adoption of the budget 
     resolution against the budget resolution aggregates in force.
