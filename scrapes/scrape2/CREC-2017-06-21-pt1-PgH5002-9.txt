                      HONORING SAILORS LOST AT SEA

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the USS Fitzgerald 
collided with a cargo vessel in the Sea of Japan on Saturday, resulting 
in the loss of life of seven patriotic sailors. Each of the deceased 
sailors was dedicated in the service to their Nation and exemplified 
the U.S. Navy's motto, ``Not for self but for country.''

  As the grateful father of an orthopedic surgeon currently serving in 
the United States Navy, the sailors and their families are in my 
thoughts and prayers.
  May we never forget these sailors: Shingo Douglass, 25, of 
California; Noe Hernandez, 26, of Texas; Ngoc Huynh, 25, of 
Connecticut; Xavier Martin, 24, of Maryland; Gary Rehm, Jr., 37, of 
Ohio; Dakota Rigsby, 19, of Virginia; Carlos Sibayan, 23, of 
California.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Our sympathy to the family of former State Representative Skipper 
Perry of Aiken, South Carolina, Aiken Chamber of Commerce ``Man of the 
Year.''
