                     EMPLOYEES UNDER INVESTIGATION

  (Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, something that has not gotten nearly enough 
attention in the media concerns security. We know that there were 
people working--Imran Awan, Abid Awan, Jamal Awan, Hina Alvi, Natalia 
Sova--and I have heard that one of these has fled back to Pakistan 
since being investigated.
  They worked on Democratic computer systems. And although we have been 
told, ``Well, they couldn't get into the SCIF and get into the 
classified section,'' they had access to congressional computers. I am 
told that if you can get access to one Congress Member's Outlook 
program, you can easily hack into many others.
  This has got to be investigated. It appears to be a major crime and a 
major breach of trust in the House.
  I hope my friends across the aisle that use these people will step 
forward and help us plug the hole.
