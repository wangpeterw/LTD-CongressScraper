                              NOMINATIONS

  Mr. McCONNELL. One way to begin moving forward is by proceeding with 
confirmations without delay, especially when it comes to key national 
and economic security nominees.
  Tonight we will vote on the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be Director 
of the CIA. He enjoys overwhelming support to be confirmed, just as we 
know that many other Cabinet nominees command sufficient support as 
well. So let us confirm them now and never forget the way Republicans 
worked with the administration of former President Obama to confirm 
seven members of his Cabinet the day he took office and nearly his 
entire Cabinet within 2 weeks.
  Both parties appear to agree that our economy, our health care, and 
our politics need fixing so let us get down to fixing them. Let us join 
hands and move forward. The American people are ready for solutions, 
and after 8 long years, they are ready for Democrats to work with 
Republicans to deliver them.
