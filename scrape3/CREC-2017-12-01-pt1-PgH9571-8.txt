program, winning seven State cross country championships over the

  I commend these young women on their athletic achievement. I can only 
imagine how proud their parents and families must be.
  It is encouraging that the hard work of these young women has been 
rewarded with success. Their perseverance and commitment should be 
commended.
  I also express my heartfelt congratulations to their coach, Sean 
Walsh. With Coach Walsh's steadfast leadership, the North Hunterdon 
women's cross country team was able to realize its full athletic 
potential. And these young women are distinguished academically as 
well.
  Congratulations to all who were involved.
