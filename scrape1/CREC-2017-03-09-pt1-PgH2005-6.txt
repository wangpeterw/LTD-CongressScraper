                      OPPOSING REPEAL AND REPLACE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
repeal and replace bill offered by my Republican colleagues. I have 
never believed ObamaCare was perfect, but it was a step in the right 
direction.
  We will only move our healthcare policy forward by working together 
to

build on the very real successes of ACA and fix the actual problems 
with the law. But this legislation as proposed does none of that and, 
in fact, takes us in the opposite direction.
  Under the proposed legislation, 10 million Americans would lose their 
health insurance, according to an analysis from Standard and Poor's. 
Seniors would be charged much more than what others pay for health 
care, and the 3.2 million Illinoisans who depend on Medicaid will face 
cuts to their coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, this House is recklessly and unnecessarily rushing to a 
vote before we have basic answers. Most importantly, we need to know 
from the Congressional Budget Office how many people this bill will and 
will not cover and how much it will cost.
  We need to set aside the politics and work in a bipartisan way to 
give all Americans quality, affordable health care.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.
