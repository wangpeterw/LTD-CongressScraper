                         THANKING JANET BOSLEY

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and public 
service of Janet Bosley. Janet has been a caseworker in my district 
office and previously served my predecessor, Congressman Matt Salmon. 
She is a wife, a mother, a grandmother, and I am very happy to call her 
my friend.
  Janet will soon be retiring. She faithfully served the constituents 
of Arizona's Fifth Congressional District for the past 5 years, and her 
steady presence in the district has been invaluable.
  My staff and I are going to miss Janet's infectious smile and her 
witty stories. She is one of the most engaging people I have known, and 
my life has been blessed because of her friendship and example.
  I wish her the best of luck and happiness as she moves into this new 
chapter in her life.
  Thank you, Janet. May God bless you.
