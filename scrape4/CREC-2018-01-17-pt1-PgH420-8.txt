         PEMBROKE, NORTH CAROLINA, 2017 SMALL TOWN OF THE YEAR

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Pembroke, North 
Carolina, named 2017 Small Town of the Year by the North Carolina Rural 
Assembly.
  Pembroke, population 3,000, is home to the University of North 
Carolina at Pembroke, as well as the Lumbee Indian Tribe, two wonderful 
organizations with whom I am actively involved.
  Much of southeastern North Carolina has been decimated by poorly 
negotiated international trade deals and the loss of traditional 
industries. Pembroke is fighting back by participating in a first-in-
the-Nation innovation and entrepreneurship program and is working to 
build its economy by focusing on healthcare, construction, and 
agribusiness.
  Congratulations to Mayor Charles Gregory Cummings, Council Members 
Locklear, Jones, Sampson, and McNeill, Town Manager Tyler Thomas, UNC 
Pembroke Chancellor Robin Cummings, Lumbee Tribal Chairman Harvey 
Godwin, and the entire Pembroke community on this outstanding 
achievement.
