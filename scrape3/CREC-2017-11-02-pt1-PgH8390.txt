                          REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Jeffries) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, the so-called Republican tax plan will 
increase taxes on the middle class, explode the deficit, and undermine 
Medicare and Medicaid. It will saddle your children and grandchildren 
with more than $1 trillion in debt, simply to provide millionaires and 
billionaires with a massive tax cut.
  Now, House Republicans will argue that trickle-down economics, 
supply-side economics, and dynamic scoring will somehow magically save 
the day. But the notion that massive tax cuts for millionaires and 
billionaires will somehow result in strong economic growth is a phony, 
fraudulent, and fake argument. It has no basis in reality. There is no 
evidence to support this fantasy.
  When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires, it 
didn't result in strong economic growth. It led to a massive deficit.
  When George W. Bush cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires, it 
didn't result in strong economic growth. It led to the Great Recession.
  When the Republican Governor of Kansas cut taxes on millionaires and 
billionaires, it didn't result in strong economic growth. It led to 
prison riots, overcrowded schools, and crumbling infrastructure.
  We cannot allow this scheme to happen to the United States of 
America. The American people deserve a better deal.
