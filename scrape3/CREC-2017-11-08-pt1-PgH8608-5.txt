                      TAX PLAN PROVIDES TAX RELIEF

  (Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I had planned to come down to the floor 
here to manage some bills here in a couple of minutes, but I decided I 
needed to take this opportunity to address some of the things that the 
American people might have been hearing from the other side of the 
aisle just now.
  This is absolutely just political demagoguery what is going on. 
Frankly, it is political malfeasance. This is about simplification. 
This is about fairness. This is about making sure that hardworking 
American men and women and their families have the opportunity to live 
the American Dream.
  Right now, we have a Tax Code that is massive, first of all. Second, 
it is filled with loopholes and exceptions that lobbyists and the well 
connected have put in there over the last number of decades. It is time 
to change that. The American people deserve this.
  There is real tax relief for real working families, and that is why I 
think you are seeing such enthusiasm out of the American people for 
this tax plan.
