                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our shield, look with favor upon our Senators today. Guide 
them around the obstacles that hinder their progress, uniting them for 
the common good of this great land.
  Lord, free them from anxiety and fear as they put their trust in You. 
Enable them to go from strength to strength, fulfilling Your purpose 
for their lives in this generation. Guide them to use their abilities 
and talents to accomplish Your holy will. As they strive to please You, 
help them to stand for right and leave the consequences to You.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
