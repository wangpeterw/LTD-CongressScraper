                       WE MUST PASS THE DREAM ACT

  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, America is founded on the promise that if 
you work hard and play by the rules, then we will have a place for you.
  That is the American Dream. There is no reason it shouldn't extend to 
people who were brought here as young children and have been working 
since then to build a better life.
  San Diego is home to 38,000 residents who could be eligible for DACA, 
the seventh most of any county in America.
  DREAMers are our friends, our neighbors, and our coworkers, and our 
economy is more prosperous because of their contributions.
  Like so many, I was saddened and angry at the decision by President 
Trump to end the DACA program. It was a cruel action, rooted in fear, 
that only makes us weaker.
  Congress must act swiftly to correct this economic and moral 
catastrophe. We must pass the Dream Act to protect DREAMers, and give 
them and their employers the certainty that they deserve.
  The time is right now for Congress to finally step up and do its job.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
