                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, we fix our minds on You, the Author and Perfector of our 
faith. Remind our lawmakers that a Heavenly focus brings joy. Give them 
the wisdom to see that those who have done the most good in this 
present world often have thought most about the world to come. May our 
Senators permit the diligent focus of their hearts on Heaven to 
preserve the vigor of their work on Earth. May Your Kingdom come, may 
Your will be done on Earth even as it is done in Heaven.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
