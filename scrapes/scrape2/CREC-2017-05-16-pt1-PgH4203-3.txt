                    RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, this week recognizes National Police 
Week. I would like to especially highlight the small but significant 
things officers do for our communities.
  Police officers in Clearwater, Florida, surprised a 10-year-old 
robbery victim with lunch after his lunch money was stolen as he walked 
to school.
  Hillsborough County sheriffs will drive homeless men and women to the 
Social Security office and help them with paperwork.
  These are extraordinary individuals, Mr. Speaker. There are countless 
examples of local law enforcement doing good every day.
  This week we commemorate the fallen officers. Florida lost 11 
officers in the past year, including Deputy Sheriff John Robert Kotfila 
from Hillsborough County who was killed after a collision with a wrong-
way driver.
  We also remember the Tarpon Springs officer, Officer Charles Kondek, 
who was fatally shot by a fugitive while on duty in 2014.
  Thank you to our law enforcement officers in Florida and nationwide 
who keep us safe.
