  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a new record in 
Oswego County, New York. The town of Redfield now has the record for 
the most snowfall in 48 hours. An astonishing 62 inches of snow fell in 
this idyllic town along the Salmon River with only 550 people near Lake 
Ontario.
  While subzero temperatures and blizzard conditions keep most people 
inside our homes, National Weather Service observer and constituent 
Carolyn Yerdon braved the elements to announce the record shattering 
news standing atop a 5-foot snow bank.
  The total snowfall breaks the world record of 57 inches in a 48-hour 
period set in 2008 by Bennetts Bridge in Oswego County.
  Home to some of the harshest winter conditions in the country, 
upstate New York experiences heavy lake-effect snow, high winds, and 
bitter temperatures all season long.
  As snow blankets our region this winter, we are grateful to our first 
responders, who continue to go above and beyond and keep our roadsides 
safe, to protect and rescue some stranded vulnerable citizens--yes, in 
5 feet of snow, you can lose people--and providing assistance to all 
our communities.
  A special thank you to Carolyn Yerdon, our special National Weather 
Service employee. May I just say her favorite words: Let it snow, let 
it snow, let it snow.
