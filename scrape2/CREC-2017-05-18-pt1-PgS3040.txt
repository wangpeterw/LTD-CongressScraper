                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, during this week, National Police 
Week, I honor all those who serve to keep us safe. I honor three 
Maryland officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2016. 
Corporal Jack Colson of Prince George's County Police Department, 
Senior Deputy Patrick Dailey, and Deputy First Class Mark Logsdon, both 
of Harford County Sheriff's office, all dedicated their lives to making 
Maryland safe. We thank them for their sacrifice, and we thank their 
families, friends, and fellow officers. They will never be forgotten, 
and they deserve to be honored not just this week, but every day.
