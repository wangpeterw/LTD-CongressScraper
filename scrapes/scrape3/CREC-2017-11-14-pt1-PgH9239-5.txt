                     NDAA CONFERENCE REPORT PASSAGE

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the 
conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act, which 
passed the House of Representatives today.

[[Page H9240]]

  In a great bipartisan moment, the NDAA received overwhelming support 
to authorize almost $700 billion in defense spending and set priorities 
for our military, including the largest pay raise for our troops in 8 
years. The conference report kept funding important to Georgia's 12th 
District, included in the earlier versions of the FY18 NDAA, such as $8 
billion in funding for cyber operations and over $85 million in new 
military construction to prepare for our cyber warriors at Fort Gordon, 
like new family housing and a new gate.
  Ensuring that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are equipped with the 
facilities and resources they need to fight the battles of today and 
tomorrow is crucial to our Nation's safety and security.
  Days after celebrating one of the most important days of the year 
honoring our veterans, I am happy to say that, with the passage of H.R. 
2810, we have provided for the common defense, supported our 
servicemembers, and worked to close the critical readiness gap.
