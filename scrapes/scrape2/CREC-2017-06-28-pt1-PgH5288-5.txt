          RECOGNIZING KELLY CRAFT AS U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CANADA

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud President Trump's selection 
of Ms. Kelly Craft as the next U.S. Ambassador to Canada.
  Canada is the number one export market for my home State of Kentucky. 
Agriculture is the major industry in my congressional district, and 
Canada is a critical export market for Kentucky farm products. As a 
result of our successful history of trade with the nation of Canada, I 
cannot think of a better person to lead relations between these two 
countries than my dear friend, Kelly Craft.
  Kelly was raised in Glasgow, Kentucky, which is 30 miles from my 
hometown. She has a lifetime of achievements and is extremely 
qualified. On a personal note, Kelly has always been there for and 
believed in me, and I am very appreciative of her support and 
friendship.

  I look forward to Kelly Craft's great leadership as Ambassador to 
Canada, and I urge a swift confirmation process in the Senate.
