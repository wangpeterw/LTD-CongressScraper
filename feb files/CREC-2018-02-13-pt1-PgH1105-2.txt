                     OBSERVING AMERICAN HEART MONTH

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we observe American Heart Month, we 
are reminded of how important diet and lifestyle choices are to our 
health.
  Sadly, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in our 
country. Making heart healthy choices, knowing your family's heart 
history, and regular checkups are all integral parts of cardiovascular 
health.
  Organizations like our very own United Way of Miami-Dade work 
alongside community clinics to conduct screenings and tests to help 
prevent and manage health issues. This month, United Way of Miami-Dade 
is partnered with FamilyWize, a program that provides access to 
affordable prescription medications.
  The University of Miami's HeartAware risk assessment is an online 
screening survey offered by UHealth. This program helps patients 
identify their risk for developing cardiovascular disease, learn the 
next steps based on their risk factors, and promotes lifestyle changes 
to lower their risk of heart disease.
  Let us all take time during American Heart Month to focus on our 
hearts and encourage not only ourselves but our family and friends to 
live healthier lives.
