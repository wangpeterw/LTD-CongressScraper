                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Robert Hughes, Broadway Presbyterian Church, Sedalia, 
Missouri, offered the following prayer:
  Awesome and merciful God, we thank You that we can approach You 
directly in prayer, fully aware that prayer is not a shield protecting 
us from all evil but, rather, a reminder, first and foremost, that You 
alone are God, creator, redeemer, and sustainer of all, and we are not.
  Gracious Lord, in ancient times King Solomon asked only for wisdom, 
not fame, fortune, or influence. Instead, he longed for godly wisdom. 
Whether as parent, teacher, minister, elected official, or in any other 
position of leadership, help us to lead with godly wisdom.
  Heavenly God, as I proclaim Your threefold unity, Father, Son, and 
Holy Spirit, individual, yet eternally united as one God, I pray that 
this Nation, the United States, be also unified, respecting and valuing 
the individual, yet eternally united as one nation, under God, 
indivisible. It is in Your name, I pray.
  Amen.
