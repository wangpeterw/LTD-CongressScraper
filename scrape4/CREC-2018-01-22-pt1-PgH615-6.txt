                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it is important for us to understand why we 
are here. We are here because the Republican majority in the House and 
the Senate and the President of the United States have not funded the 
government.
  Secondly, we also are here because there are a number of issues on 
which I think there is agreement in both Houses that have not been 
brought to the floor irrespective of the majority's will.
  It appears, from what the Senate leader has said, that there is an 
agreement in the Senate, and, perhaps--and I think probably--we will 
move forward today to open up the government.
  But I hope my Republican colleagues do not misinterpret what is 
happening because the issues will not go away. Between now and February 
8, if that is the date, we must resolve how we are going to fund the 
government--that is what has held us up--and we must bring to this 
floor a bill to protect people whom the President of the United States 
said we ought to protect.
  Let's do it. Let's do our work.
